Into their lives comes Tracy a composer and assistant choreographer from the City College of New York who inspires him to try to continue his dream while romance begins to grow between them despite coming from different neighborhoods and worlds. Meanwhile Lee is part of a breakdancing crew set on dominating the scene of their street. The rest of their friends include Ramon a graffiti artist determined to spread his painting to every subway car in the city while dealing with his girlfriend Carmen and Chollie a fellow disc jockey who becomes Kenny's manager after he lands him a gig at a Bronx club.

	schema:reviewBody "It's fine to appreciate this film through the sieve of nostalgia. Even I have a hard time viewing this film without reciting all the words I've seen it many many times. But the important thing to note here is that while Harry Belafonte made a noble effort to shape a story out of the Bronx's greatest cultural export it's only successful half of the time. The result is a film that garners lots of groaning through scenes while waiting for the 'good parts'. Rae Dawn Chong is flimsy and ineffective as usual in the role of the dance school instructor who 'discovers' Lee and KK. The ensuing romance that KK and Tracy have is terribly trite and makes for sleepy viewing. Likewise the sopping wet story of Ramon and his girlfriend who have a child and disapproving parents. Heavy handed and poorly acted to boot even for the time period. All the graffiti was designed by stage painters and looks like it distant and plastic. This is a depiction of a corny world indeed.What Beat Street is notable for is managing to compile many notable music artists and bboysbgirls in performance. The Rock Steady and NY Breakers footage the Us Girls group assembled for this film Busy Bee Melle Mel and the Furious Five Bambaataa  Soul Sonic Force Tina B. Brenda Starr Treacherous Three and Doug E. Fresh there's loads of it which greatly outweighs the mindless fluff of the socalled plot. The soundtrack coproduced by Arthur Baker of Planet Rock fame is extremely notable as well. It was originally sold in 2 volumes and while each record has several watery ballads the classic songs like Frantic Situation Son of Beat Street Santa's Rap and Battle Cry are very much worth the purchase. If you're like me and miss 'old New York' it was only 20 or so years ago but NY is totally different it's really great to see painted trains old street scenes and the Roxy. Beat Street has been contrasted to Wild Style many times especially with the scorn of Beat Street being the Hollywood retread of Wild Style's gritty budgeted reality. This might be the case but it would seem that Beat Street has a better focus on bboying breakdance whereas Wild Style's actual graffiti by famed writers remains the strong point of that film. There's a hokey wholesomeness present in Beat Street that just isn't realistic. Regardless Beat Street is certainly worth viewing particularly when it pops up on TV but be prepared for some stale hackneyed drama strewn into the great music and killer scenes. Beat Street Breakdown RUAHHH!!!".

The acting isn't always up to par and the characters aren't fully drawn out but they are more than compensated for by downtoearth dialogue a plausible story fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hiphop sound track.  It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing This ain't New York this is the Bronx! and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata.  Rock Steady Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80's the Roxy.  A must see for hiphop lovers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess when Beat Street made a national appearance Flashdance came at the same time. The problem with Flashdance is that there was only one break dancing scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why Beat Street was better. The only movie that could rival Beat Street seems to be Footloose because both movies focused on how dance had been used by people to express their utmost feelings.The breakdance scenes in Beat Street come just before the middle and at the end of the flick. And I loved all of them. Almost all of the break tricks were featured in the break jam scenes the jackhammer the flares the head spins the suicide sit the crazy legs the mortal the forward flip the figure fouralmost everything.Like The Warriors Beat Street does have violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world...but in a much less violent way than the former. The only major fight scene in Beat Street was when graffiti artist Ramon which in the movie was abbreviated as Ramo is chased by a rival gang member on the New York City subway tracks.....fighting each other on the third rail and both dying by electrocution on that rail. Well although that chase scene ended tragically it was better that they died that way than having blood exploding from a gang gunshot.Most of the gang stuff in the flick was graffiti related to the hiphop culture and rap music. A lot of rap music appeared in the flick because hiphop members used rap music as a diversion to the negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the movie which closed the curtain to the flick was not just an homage to hiphop cultureit also was an homage to the death of Ramon.By the way during the dance scene called 'Tango Tango' I guess the female drummer in the pit orchestra conducted by actress Rae Dawn Chong was Sheila E. making a cameo appearance.".

Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler one a d.j. another an artist who creates 'burners' while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift Beat Street to greater heights.

But a huge number of movies you watch you watch for fun and nothing more or maybe to remember a time when things were different. Such is the case with BEAT STREET.In 1984 when the movie came out hip hop music was on the rise as was hip hop dancing. The jerky movements the spins the flips the musically influenced dance style was the rage. Hollywood never one to let a fad go by untapped made the choice to bring out several films involving the hip hop scene almost always by a low budget studio. That year Cannon popped out BREAKIN' and its sequel BREAKIN' 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO. KRUSH GROOVE gave Shelia E. a chance to hit the movie screen. WILD STYLE featured the music of Fab Five Freddy and Grandmaster Flash.BEAT STREET came out in 1984 and was one of the first to hit the screens. All of them seemed to play off of the same things the music the New York locale and the graffiti art. BEAT STREET takes on all of those themes. Kenny is a young DJ living in the Bronx with dreams of being a star one day. Along with his brother Lee who wants to be a professional hip hop dancer and his friends they hit the clubs and private parties held in abandoned buildings.The possibility of success arrives in the form of Tracy Rae Dawn Chong a grad student who invites Lee to show off his moves for her classmates. With no pay and no chance to use it as a stepping stone Kenny gets upset since Lee had told him Tracy promised him a chance at both. This leads to a parting of the ways until Tracy finds a way to make things right with Kenny. Later he gets that chance at stardom and an opportunity to show his skills at a major nightclub. He just has to show them what he can do.In addition to this story we have that of Kenny's friend Ramon a gifted graffiti artists who also dreams of making it big. Ramon also has a young child with his girlfriend and he's trying his best to make things right with her and her family. He works as well as doing his art and finds himself in a battle of wills with another spray paint artist who keeps ruining his works. A face off is inevitable.But story isn't the main reason for these movies. Much like the musicals of the past it was the song and dance portions of the films that made fans go to them. The movie offers plenty of that for hip hop fans who craved seeing that as often as possible. The film is filled with dance offs and party sequences that are filled with hip hop dancing. Not only that but songs are provided by some of the best performers on the scene at the time including Doug E. Fresh Grandmaster Mel and the Furious Five and Africa Bambata among others.The movie fits into the drama category because it's about hope and dreams some achieved and others that crash to the ground before they can even begin. Yes there is tragedy as well as joy in this film. In the end it is a movie that for those who grew up in the 80s when the music and dancing was just taking off will bring back fond memories. For those young enough to like the music they can now see what their parents were up to at the time. And for movie fans it's another one to just sit and enjoy. Those interested in adding it to their collections will be the diehard fans. All others will just have a bit of fun and move on.".

I will cut it a little slack for a solid effort keeping in mind that in 84 they didn't exactly have a tried and tested template to work with when it came to HipHop cinema.Still a classic though in certain respects. With many great cameos and HipHop moments nobody else was giving us at the time even the most diehard purist might have a hard time writing it off completely. The Melle Mel title track comes to mind as does the Treacherous 3 featuring Doug E Fresh 'Santa's Rap' performance. At six years old when this came out HipHop was still new to my young ears.

	schema:reviewBody "Beat Street was always the film you watched back in the 80's if you took Hip Hop and Break Dancing seriously and wanted a better idea of how this new wave of music was infecting the youth culture at the time. Oh how we laughed at those who thought Electric Bogaloo was the film to watchif you hadn't seen this you didn't know anything.Beat Street as a film in its own right is something of a rare gem and still stands up today despite a really weak performance from Rae Dawn Chongthe rest of the performances from mostly non or inexperienced actors are raw and real. The plot such as it is revolves around two brothers KK a DJ Lee a dancer and their close friends who are all hustling with the new movement of dance music and graffiti art to make their marks in the run down impoverished Bronx of New York. Thrown into this story is something of a rather flimsy love plot involving the older brother Guy Davis and a dance from the local arts school where it seems only the rich kids go. What is more interesting is the relationship between talented artist Ramo John Chardliet shame he didn't do more acting and his girlfriend and mother of his young childSantiago excellent in anything she is in as they struggle to make ends meet while he strains to retain his title of the spray can king. At the time this was made it was seen by many as a fictionalised version of the documentary Wild Style the films almost go hand in hand. In the latter an artist called 'Cap' always sprayed over everyones work just for the hell of it. Here someone called 'Spit' does the same ultimately with Tragic results.The film features the dance groups of the time Rocky Steady Crew and New City Breakers as well as Africa Bambata Doug E Fresh Grandmater Mel and the Furious Five and others. It is gritty rough around the edges but has a charm and is often funny and touching. The ending with the concert and mesh of styles and music of the time is a really rewarding sequence which I have watched many times. Anyone who looks at this film dismissively is really missing the point. It was an attempt to counter point god awful films like Breakdance 1 and 2 to show a more realistic depiction of the types of kids who were involved in this music and culture at the time Most of them in the film actually were and though the film enjoyed some success it left many of its participants wondering at the end what happens now? What indeed? It almost feels as if the film was the last cry of a generation that became fragmented and lost its way just before drug culture impacted so heavily on communities.Beat Street played out of competition at the Cannes festival in 1984 which that year found Paris  Texas scooping up all the awards but as an impact on youth culture on an international stage that film cannot claim to have even a fraction of the influence that Beat Street did especially behind the iron curtain where pirate copies were being sold for as much as 100 dollars. Sometimes it feels as if it were criminally overlooked not least of all by Cannes. Anyone who doubts its impact only needs to go and look at Art and Hip Hop in France and you will find many of its influences orginate from this film. It was a voice for a time that many over looked but those interested in the beginnings of Hip Hop should seek this out. As a statement on musical culture given voice through a drama in this way this film has not been equalled.".

But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared like Krs One Public Enemy Ultramagnetic Mc's Jungle Brothers Bizmarkie to name a few and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a fan of the war genre but Beaufort plays out more as a psychological thriller and I find it hard to fault. There was an amazing blend of naturalism stylistic devices humour touching human drama and suspense  at one time I jumped in my seat like I never have before.The camera movements and cinematography are excellent and reinforce a sense of claustrophobia as a group of Israeli soldiers keep guard at an historic fort within southern Lebanon but are virtually under siege by Hezbollah forces. Character development is also excellent with much authenticity. The film focuses on the idiosyncrasies of various characters and how they interact with each other under the circumstances. Respect for the commanding officer is sometimes lacking resulting in a lack of discipline and friction at a difficult time.I count this film as one of my favourite films in the genre kind of a cross between Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Sam Mendes' Jarhead and as good as either of these. Like these two films there is an understated political critique in how young men are pawns in the games played by those who live comfortably away from the field of battle and death. Whether you like war films or not this is mustsee cinema.I saw the film's screening at the Melbourne International Film Festival.".

	schema:headline " A fantastic work of art from the ever growing Israeli cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is simply amazing  but as mentioned else where  might be extremely problematic for the non Israeli non IDF serving audience. Despite that  the movie has a universal notion that shines through occupation wars that last for years on end with no clear objective except to stay in the occupied land cannot be won. This is hardly even war  its the use of naive young men using their sense of patriotism and love for their country and willingness to serve it for a twisted outdated political machination that ends up killing them and putting them in impossible situations. The movie was criticized for being far too left winged but I view it as mostly right winged  it shows the camaraderie of soldiers the bonds that can only be created or so it seems in a close knit military unit. Also  there are no women in the movie not even by voice  which further serves to show a society built on machoism and the devotion for young men and their sacrifices to the country. There are no talks of peace here no talk about negotiations or even viewing the enemy as human. There is only running away or fighting. Despite all that  the movie captures a sense of reality filled with all variants of humor and pain and longing to get home that captured me completely. I served 4 years in the IDF and this movie manages to get to the core to the essence of the unbelievable situation of serving fighting and dieing without knowing why without seeing any goal or reason in the madness  only following orders. This is one of the best Israely movies created  if you have any interest in Israely cinema regardless of your political or other views don't miss it.".

It is still only a few days since I saw it but the images return and the sheer originality in terms of being a 'war movie' coupled with the usual Jewish genius of making a point in short comment dry humor body language tone of voice well chosen repetition i.e. the monotonous almost dead tone over a loudspeaker from the lookouts stationed to warn against 'incoming incoming' missiles which after explosion were commented on by'impact impact'. After the third or fourth of these 'scenes' I suddenly felt a wave of claustrophobia and fear which these young Israeli soldiers must have felt being stuck on a mountain top without a visual enemy and only lookouts to rely on for their own lives and safety 'incoming incoming'  crash bang 'impact impact'  it was unnerving. This film is a must for anyone  also those who like me are not war buffs because it is not about war. It is about a lot of things. Reality how to handle anxiety frustration loss grief in a tight and stuck environment with no relief in sight Israel itself? It is about individuality in terms of different personalities backgrounds political opinions who have to make it work and who do in their own humorous gentle aggressive accepting way. It is about men and a male attitude which I have not witnessed for over thirty yearsand sorely missed the honesty and humanity of men and it is about exile. The one lifeline to the home country a dirt road has been blocked by a strange explosive device for about a month and this is where the film starts with the bomb squad arriving at the outpost to identify and disarm the device so that the outpost can receive supplies once again...and a whole 'different' story is touched upon. I could go on for hours about this film and not in a very logical way since all the 'points' haven't been connected yet it has so many layers. This what I call genius  'layering' and this is what I look for in Israeli film and this year it was Beaufort who delivered. Go and see it.".

	schema:headline " ...so it doesn't escape";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this last night at the Sydney Film Festival and want to let you know what I thought about it. It is a movie about boredom fear and leadership set  as I understand it  in the last days of the Israeli occupation of the buffer zone in Southern Lebanon. The Beaufort of the title is a hilltop fortress used a forward position by the Israeli Defense Forces and as the name suggests was built by the Crusaders in the 12th Century. Because of its history the site is respected or sacred to both Israel and the Arabs and has become a symbol of bravery. For that reason both sides try to ensure the ruins of the original fortress are not damaged and it becomes a character in the movie as the leader of the small group soldiers left to defend it describes how he feels almost physically prevented from leaving. The scene of the soldiers finally departing has the feeling of a captain wanting to go down with his ship. To get to that point though the soldiers must survive in their cramped conditions against the increasing attacks by the unseen Hezbollah  who want to make the Israeli withdrawal look like a Hezbollah victory the indecision and delays from their superiors  who may be waiting for a political solution as they face pressure from the Four Mothers Movement to remove troops from the Security Zone and their own isolation  especially as any attempt at character development results in that character being the next one to die. And there is humour to illustrate the futility of their mission as two Shakespearean characters explain that they are guarding the mountain...so it doesn't escape.It is a political movie made clear with the intervention of the father of one of the dead soldiers. In fact I understand that a representative of the Israeli government was booed during his introduction of the movie which I missed at the Sydney Film Festival. Was anyone there? What did he say?I'll leave it others in this forum to discuss the politics and reality of the events but judging it as a piece of movie making it is wellwritten wellacted and welldirected and deserves to do well at the box office. Seek it out.".

But after holding a buffer zone for 18 years with increasing casualties caused by a strengthening Hezbollah the army's presence there began to seem pointless.This is a story about soldiers stationed at an outpost in Lebanon just before the eventual withdrawal in 2000. It manages to raise many valid moral and existential questions without getting preachy or politically partisan. Beaufort is a strong film that really sticks in your mind afterwards. The dialogues spoken by the soldiers is very true to life and the movie is highly authentic in every respect. It is well directed the cast is good across the board and the visuals are persuasive and gripping. But most of all Beaufort succeeds in giving you a real sense of the fear and suspense of being a sitting duck for Hezbollah rocketlaunchers to fire at. It is utterly nervewrecking.Minor flaws include the customary settingup of a character's personality just before he gets killed to make you mourn his loss more but such obvious manipulations are few and don't significantly hurt the movie.".

I do not think that the movie has a clear statement about war. Some believe it is antiwar and lefty. I just believe it presents the human side of war and doesn't say a lot about politics. It does say however that human life is precious and that even soldiers have a right and should fear for their lives.".

I do not think that the movie has a clear statement about war. Some believe it is antiwar and lefty. I just believe it presents the human side of war and doesn't say a lot about politics. It does say however that human life is precious and that even soldiers have a right and should fear for their lives.";

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing 'Beaufort' during this preOscar period makes me wonder how it is being perceived by the nonIsraeli viewer. The reason is that this is one of these movies with a strong political message full of nuances and conflicts that I am afraid will be lost to the foreign viewer. And yet it is a better international film that Israeli film. I will try to explain.There is a lot of cinema aesthetics to be enjoyed in 'Beaufort'. The setting is a direct quote from Kubrick's Space Odyssey the fortified bunker in the Lebanon of the year 2000 seems to be a spaceship in an hostile and incomprehensible universe while the Israeli soldiers spending their last weeks before Israel's retreat dressed in the heavy and technosophisticated equipment with their weapons upon them all the time seem to be astronauts fighting some invisible monsters who hit when you expect less. The abstractionism of the conflict the faceless enemy the waiting fear survival instinct are all human themes that find the path to the hearts of any viewer beyond politics.It's a very different movie for an Israeli viewer and especially for somebody who went through the experience of the army who understands the language and the tension. The characters on screen look familiar to the Israeli viewers they may be themselves or their children or their neighbors. The film does not make any clear political statement and this is a statement by itself.Director Joseph Cedar succeeds to control at the level of detail the image and the sound. Sound work is especially amazing after a few minutes the viewer will learn as the soldiers on mount Beaufort to discriminate between 'outputs' friendly artillery fire and 'falls' hostile fire.And yet it is from the Israeli perspective that I found more flaws. It is not the lack of political message that disturbed me actually I found better as in real life that the director avoided to drive to conclusions and let everybody seeing the film to draw its own. There are too many characters in this film who are part of a schema and not even commander Liraz well acted by Oshri Cohen reaches the psychological deepness of the characters of other lesser known and perhaps not so good Israeli war films. When one of the characters starts to open himself to his comrades and the viewer his end is coming soon and this looks painfully simplistic. The overall balance is also broken by the final scenes when the soldiers are back home after a war in which victory means just personal survival  these may be emotional for the Israeli audiences but they are artistically unfinished.I would have loved the film to have a different ending in the frame where the metal plaque with the names of the soldiers fallen in the fights at the conquest of the mountain at the beginning of the war melts in the fire. One of the characters comments that the plaque could not be taken out in the turmoil of the retreat like the fallen heroes wanted to stay where they died. Those were the first soldiers fallen in the war in 1982 in a fight famous in the military Israeli mythology. Now their names melted down in the last flames of the same war heroes and victims at the same time of a war as absurd as any other war.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rightwing audiences have criticized Beaufort for being leftwinged while leftwing audiences have criticized the movie for being rightwinged. Immediately that should tell you this is a movie worth watching.Like all great war films Beaufort avoids situational politics and instead focuses on the broader universal issue of war which all sides can agree upon war is hell. Or specifically in this case war is pointless hell. Here we have an excellent illustration Beaufort is the story of a handful of soldiers who fight admirably to defend a fort simply so that they can abandon it as planned a few days later. Folks it don't get any more pointless than that. I would tip my hat to the genius who came up with such a great metaphor but the funny thing is that the story came straight out of history.Note although this film depicts the Israeli withdrawal from Castle Beaufort which was returned to Lebanon in 2000 it was actually filmed at a different fortress at the Golan Heights in Syrian territory currently held by Israel.Joseph Cedar directs this film in a tense claustrophobic way with narrow labyrinthine corridors that burrow deep into the mountain. I was instantly reminded of the classic submarine film Das Boot and wasn't surprised one bit when I read that Cedar was highly influenced by that film. Beaufort shares several qualities with Das Boot such as the facelessness of the enemy all we see are the incoming mortars  missiles the youth  inexperience of the soldiers Beaufort's commander is 22 and most of the soldiers are 18 20 years old and of course the constricting suffocating feeling of being stuck in a steel tube while outside the powers that be are deciding your fate.One notable difference between Beaufort and Das Boot are the infrequent but powerful shots of the gorgeous landscape the humbling presence of the 12th century ruins and other scenes of nature which lend a positive breath of fresh air to an otherwise dismal setting. This I'm sure was very deliberate on the part of the director and at one point there's a nice speech where one soldier says to another This will all be a tourist attraction and you can bring your girlfriend here and tell her this is where Outpost Green once was.And that to me is what separates Beaufort from the standard war is hell stories. Regardless of how the story ends up you get a feeling that eventually the majesty of nature will prevailor should I say the stupidity of humans will fail. Same thing I guess.Peculiar highlights of this film include a powerful sad song sung by one of the soldiers in the barracks and one of the cutest war dogs ever. And if like me you always cringe at animals being used in films that aren't regulated by the AHA or RSPCA don't worry I don't believe there was any animal cruelty here.Other great antiwar films that focus on the psychology of the soldier rather than the action of battle include the aforementioned Das Boot set entirely in a German submarine None But the Brave about an American  a Japanese platoon each stranded on a remote island together and an excellent wardramacomedy from Korea called Welcome to Dongmakgol about N  S Korean enemies meeting in a remote village where none of the villagers are aware that a war is going on.All of these great films can be viewed free of politics if you just ignore the uniforms. Both rightwingers  left wingers alike can find common ground with the universal thought to quote exMarine talk radio host Kim Peterson the only point of war is to kill people and break things!".

	schema:reviewBody "'A more mature version of Buffalo Soldiers' would be the easy one sentence summary for 2007 Isreali film Beaufort a film looking at the smaller less exciting situations and scenarios behind the larger more significant situations and scenarios that shape certain people's lives. The film is slow but deliberately so pointing out the insanities of war by having the primary soldier characters sit around and eventually loose interest at the sound of shelling and warning of incoming explosive shells thus leading to a potentially damaging mental attitude when something dangerous isn't initially treated as such. If people are to find the film slow then the film has done its job because it avoids following a nice neatly plotted route that instigates familiarity and a sense of accomplishment. What the characters do is a slow process and Beaufort studies it.Joseph Cedar's film sees a number of Isreali troops inhabit a reasonably large bunker in southern Lebanon at Beaufort Castle stronghold. The year is 2000 and the troops are a part of Isreal's army holding the area from Lebanon forces located several miles away and mostly limited to the odd rocket or shell landing on or around the area of the stronghold. The film builds to the historic IDF withdrawal in which the Isreali troops abandoned the fort and the conflict fizzled out with a political handover. Cedar uses the time leading up to this event as a chance to deconstruct the troops to have them indulge in any necessary acts of questioning one's role in life and in the conflict as well as document what it took for the men involved to get by to live to survive and ultimately to get by the monotony.No don't worry  there are no tank drivers ploughing into other vehicles whilst under the influence of drugs in this film like there are in Buffalo Soldiers. Rather than take guidance from a Cheech and Chong movie Beaufort draws on 1981's 'Das Boot' for inspiration at least according to Cedar himself. The inspired ideas are clear a study of what happens inbetween conflict with the enemy and how conflict with friends as well as foes can lead to everyone's downfall. Beaufort's approach to the material that could so easily have been delivered hollowly and without much intrigue isn't an airy and sweeping approach that relies on long long takes of external shots of the fort. Instead it is constructed in an uncanny sense that this space we are inhabiting should be something to be feared and that while conflict is sparse with gunfire and manonman conflict almost nonexistent  that doesn't mean we are not in a warzone of some kind in the first place.Beaufort carries a low and pulsating noise on its musical track almost entirely throughout. It's a very obvious noise obvious more at certain times than others creating an eerie and uneasy sense for a lot of the close claustrophobic shots of inside the bunker itself. This early series of exchanges which is meant to get across the bunker as a place of fear is actually told through the eyes of a certain soldier named Ziv Knoller a bomb expert specifically called in to look at a suspicious object not too far away. Since it is our first taste of the bunker at Beaufort we get to see the dwelling through the eyes of this new recruit as fear and uncertainty washes over us as it does with Ziv. There is no doubt Cedar applies this tactic and removes Ziv from the text at the point he feels we are embedded within the locale and no longer need a rookie's viewpoint to break us in.Some of the more uncanny items that crop up during this opening segment might include Ziv's encounter with a dummy dressed as an Isreali soldier the manner in which the approach is constructed with the positioning of the doll and the finding out of what it is with the sudden appearance of a friendly soldier with the rest of the film playing out under grey skies or the black of night is unexpectedly unsettling and works really well. But this is all introduction and the bulk of the film will revolve around several other Isreali soldiers Koris Tiran Shpitzer Perzev and Liraz Cohen to name but a few. Beaufort sees fit to plunge us head first into explosive combat as many of the guys try to avoid incoming artillery shells although later on the direct hitting of the base drolly announced by a tannoy with the words 'impact impact' doesn't seem to have an affect on anyone anymore.Following the continuous socalled monotony of the shells hitting the area there is one such incidence during which a missile of some description hits the base and everybody suddenly takes notice.The impact is a lot larger and a lot louder than the usual shells causing panic causing a sense of urgency. What follows is further use of sound effects as a means of the uncanny what with a bizarre diegeticnondiegetic siren sound effect clogging up the sound tracks and disorientating the audience just as much as the characters. Beaufort is a film that documents the absurdities of war but through a relatively peaceful and mundane setting and one of its more seductive accomplishments is how it delivers a tale about essentially bored people in a manner in which we actually find them interesting. Credit where credit's due Beaufort works.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that rating films out of 10 is a little futile as what may stir one person may leave another cold. With that disclaimer set then let me say this about Beaufort Yes this is a war film in the sense that the characters are soldiers. It is however in my opinion far more of a character study than most films in the genre. Full Metal Jacket has been mentioned as a comparable work and I can understand the comparisons. The internal turmoil of the characters is portrayed with similar verve and the swings at provoking the big questions have similar merit. Where Kubrick's film veers into the slightly surreal to deliver it's message Beaufort stairs straight ahead into the stark reality of it's particular war time situation and this is perhaps the fork in the road where the two films part company. This very tangible starkness is what enables the film to deliver such a telling experience life and death laid bare for all to see and attempt to comprehend. It is one of the quintessential artistic topics and Beaufort approaches it admirably. The viewing experience may not be as exhilarating as Saving Private Ryan or Platoon and it certainly lacks the surrealistic glee of Full Metal Jacket but Beaufort had me contemplating it's content long after I watched it. It had me writing this review something that I have not done for any of the films I mention in reference to Beaufort despite their qualities. In conclusion I would thoroughly recommend Beaufort to anyone that enjoys cerebral films and if you particularly enjoy war films then I would also recommend Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima as another excellent war film that is similarly thought provoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beaufort is that rarity among war films  one with the subject matter of retreat and a at least implied defeat of sorts. As such it falls in with such earlier and illustrious company as Ford's They Were Expendable 1945  a generation and continent away perhaps but which also showed the camaraderie that can develop at the anticlimactic close of a military campaign. Unlike Ford's work with its unspoken certainty of eventual victory director Joseph Cedar's Beaufort is a portrait of military inertia and inevitable pointlessness at least as experienced by its small band of combatants. Conversely it's a million miles away from such films as Black Hawk Down where it's suggested gung ho bravery can some way appease for operational ineptitude and loss. If it's true that most history is written by the victors then Cedar's film and its ilk ought to be treasured as offering a truer and more convincing alternative  even if as in Beaufort's case the results are criticised by local critics for being 'left wing' and 'defeatist'.Coadapted for the screen by its author Ron Lesham the film concerns a group of soldiers guarding a mountaintop in Lebanon shortly before the Israeli withdrawal in 2000. Beaufort Mountain is a place with particular historical significance both as twelfth century crusader castle and a more recent hardwon Israeli military capture  although it's quickly apparent that the value is more symbolic than strategic. Frequently shelled by the Hezbollah guessing perhaps that the IDF is about to pull out the outpost is isolated the garrison depressed with an unclear purpose.As the film starts Beaufort's soldiers are joined by Ziv Ohad Knoller sent to investigate a newstyle explosive device found on the road. During the opening scenes of the film there's some anticipation in subject matter of the recent Hurt Locker but matters shortly take a different course after the first traumatic event. It turns out that the central character of Cedar's film is not the bomb expert but the introspective and honourable Commander Liraz Oshri Cohen. A man who can't believe someone gave him the job whose increasing guilt and disillusionment at his responsibilities make up the core of the narrative.It has to be said that Beaufort is rather a glum film shot in claustrophobic interiors often at night. This may be an accurate representation of warfare under such circumstances but although Cedar like Ford admirably avoids sentimentality he fails to fill the space left with any real pathos and poetry although showing successful empathy with his characters. Neither is there much if any black humour to provide contrast. When not on guard duty or dodging incoming rockets the soldiers are normally in their bunkerlike environment  the corridors of which at times remind one of a spaceship without an alien  gloomily interacting with each other. The military installation on Mount Beaufort largely empty and of questionable purpose becomes a symbol of their whole mission perhaps even more so than the plaque hanging there celebrating recent war dead. The camp stands in contrast to the remains of the original castle visited at one point by several of the soldiers while in contemplative mood the earlier construction had a far more distinguished point and still seems to be a source of strength.Where Beaufort scores is through its representation of a soldier's life when trapped between duty and political inertia even though it's implied withdrawal from political engagement can be seen both as a strength and weakness. Instead of confrontation it relies upon the unspoken rage of the morally dispossessed. In one telling scene we see Ziv watching on TV an interview with the parent of one of his fallen comrades. The commander's slow tapping with a lighter on the table an insistent accompaniment to the points being made on the small screen that a parent's duty is to ensure his offspring are better aware of the value of life is like a military tattoo for a friend's funeral cortege and though him honour itself. Ziv the loyal soldier cannot overtly question his predicament but the ironic beat over coverage of events inevitably offers commentary.Writerdirector Cedar's previous two films HaHesador aka Time of Favor 2000 and Madurat Hashevet aka Campfire 2004 both engaged with social and political aspects of the modern Jewish state sometimes with controversial elements. In this latest one he provides another wellwrought and thoughtful piece worth seeking out even if it does not pretend to offer any answers. But perhaps that is the point answers are always hard to find let alone agree on in such circumstances.".

It is not a movie about great wars great battles or massive invasions but one where there are long periods of inactivity punctuated with short periods of incomprehensible frenzy. The Left Elbow Index considers seven elements of filmacting production sets plot character character development continuity artistry and dialogueon a scale from a high of 10 to a low of 1 with an average movie rating a 5. It attempts to avoid emotional judgment based on the political elements of films such BEAUFORT which like almost all Mideast films related to longstanding tensions tend to affect one's judgment of a film depending on which side of the conflict one finds oneself. The acting in this film looks reasonably goodit is measured it is controlled and the characters seem real. The acting rates a 7. The production sets seem carefully constructed and authentic looking there rating another 7. The plot seems average a 5 with the main emphasis being on what will happen to the fort and when. Another 5 for character development. The are some high points but soldier's development can only go so far due to the implicit restraints of military service. Film continuity appears good a 7 since the dramatic tone is constant. The use of hightech equipment the futility of war and the eternal questions of war never leave the film. The artistry rate highest of all an 8 due to the quality imagery and good cinematography. Also Joseph Cedar's direction tends to focus directly on the main idea of each scene. In fact in places it causes the viewer to be as restless as the characters since one is unable to escape the tone of the moment. Dialogue is clever in spots yet average overalla 5. In a film where characters are ruled by a sense of duty there is not much to say. The Left Elbow Index rating results in a 6.28 somewhat better than average. There are three concepts is this film which may drive you mad duty has its price our's not to question why and military life amid changing orders. The film is well worth seeing and I recommend it.".

As far back as in 1982 did brave IDF soldiers take control of the fortress in a bloody battle during the first Lebanon campaign. That war was started to stave off bloodthirsty terrorists this time  members of Hezbollah. Much blood was spilled during that battle but the movie is focusing on the year 2000 shortly before the Israeli troops withdrawal from Lebanon. The fortress somehow reminds of the state of Israel itself also isolated among the triggerhappy enemies only seeking to grab every chance to shoot to kill. The defendants of the fortress despite their being soldiers have their own sometimes very different opinions concerning defense strategies in particular and politics in general and that is how Israel is divided too. Ruefully the final course of action decided upon both by the commanders of the fortress and commanders of the country is almost always that of defense and withdrawal as the little state of Israel lacks international understanding and support necessary to treat the troublemakers as they deserved to be treated and are treated in other places. The good thing about the film is that it doesn't seem to take a clearcut stand concerning what should be done and thus embraces both camps comprising the society  leftist and rightist. United shall we stand but shall we win? Hopefully so.".

This is not a shootem up war hero type of entertainment it is an attempt to display the reality of Israeli soldiers in Lebanon who are attempting to defend their ancestral land against an implacable and racist foe who use stealth to cover their cowardliness.There is a lot of politics in dialog but it is narrow Israeli politics which may not be appreciated outside of Israel. The taking and holding of Beaufort is controversial...and the ending is the beginning of yet another controversy.Supporters of RacismPalestinism will not doubt hate the movie. But they should take solace in the fact that wider nonZionist political and historical topics are not covered. For instance the stealing of Jewish lands by Arab armies of aggression or the genocidal way in which supporters of RacismPalestinism wish to wipe out Jewish Palestinians if not yet in body then at least in thought.So the movie has something for everyone. And it is a good way to develop an ear for Israeli Hebrew...which has been more of less the Hebrew of Middle East for a thousand years.".

	schema:headline " Dread and futility in a military outpost";
	schema:reviewBody "Though the predominant effect in Joseph Cedar's Beaufort 2007 is claustrophobic dread and futility the film is enlivened by telling details.Two visitors frame the narrative the soldier sent to defuse a road bomb and the soldier sent to blowup the Beaufort bunker to leave nothing to Hizbollah. One item that survives the explosion is the metal sheet listing the soldiers killed in the original  and apparently unnecessary  battle to win the castle. Whatever the war does it can't undo the loss of its soldiers' lives nor their memory. The project to blow up the bunker is called Back to the Future. The dynamiter imagines a soldier returning to that landscape and pointing out amid the revived Edenic greenery where the old bunker and its parts once stood. But won't the land remain as scarred as the soldiers? This paradise once lost can't be regained. You can't undo a war at least not in the individual soldier. The remote officers' disconnect from the soldiers recurs. The bombdefuser is killed by a land mine near his target. His father on TV regrets never having taught his son fear to preserve himself for his loving family. But the soldier knew fear. He originally resolved the bomb was too dangerous to approach. His commander overruled him sending him to an unnecessary death. Indeed the road is paved over anyway so the fatal defusing attempt was unnecessary. With Hezbollah threatening to slaughter the remaining soldiers and their fort wired to explode the remote commanders still order the battalion to remain there another night. As the loyal bomb sniffing dog is considered a weapon so are the soldiers reduced to impersonal weapons to the distant command.The film hints at the life these men could rather be living. When the first visitor gives a soldier some liquorice from Holland  not kid stuff but salty strong  Cedar holds for over 10 seconds on the soldier inexpressively enjoying it. Like the white soccer ball that redundantly appears in a photo pose with the soldiers who brought the explosives it's a reminder of the joys these men could and should be living rather than fulfilling a dubious mission beyond their country's borders. So too when the soldiers joke about one man's American girlfriend another soldier appears illuminated in the doorway behind stripped to his shorts a fleshly image of the flesh denied. The men's bleak situation admits glimpses of the life outside. So too the film is drained of colour. Much is black and white like the old American trench films of the Korean War much in sepia with occasional flashes of colour to remind us that these men's lives have been reduced in their palette.We don't see any enemy. We hear their missiles and see their terrible effects but we don't see them. Nor does Cedar present any of the reasons why Israel went into Lebanon in 1982 e.g. to drive back the PLO that had been firing into Israel the hope of working through to a peace treaty with Lebanon etc. The enemy and the reasons for the war thus seem irrelevant. As a character stated in Time of Favour Cedar's point is that in war one fights oneself more than an enemy. In both films the characters' alienation and misery play out amid the welcoming of the sabbath a paradoxical discord.When our heroes finally do escape they are welcomed by troops in a row of trucks that evoke our older images of the concentration camp trains. But now the Jewish soldiers are no longer victims to the outside world  but to their own commanders. The new Jew the Israeli Jew is a rugged often blond assertive force antithetic to the traditional shrinking victim. In the bomb sniffer the Jews run their own German shepherd.The hero the young battalion commander lives up to his reputation for character virtue and judgment. By refusing to violate his instructions to remain in danger an extra night by fulfilling his mission he redeems himself for earlier having frozen unable to run out to retrieve a wounded comrade. This brave leader then learned fear but also learned to overcome it. In the last shot he has stripped off his layers of armour and clothing and kneels in the road weeping. He's home at last free at last but behind him slightly out of focus the horizon line is actually a barbed wire fence still sealing him off. This is after all Israel where whatever principle you espouse whatever ideal you advance you're still a nation threatened with annihilation by every neighbour around  and a good many citizens within. Maybe you can't afford your ideals  but you can't afford to lose them.Like any historic fiction Beaufort is not primarily about the time in which it is set Israel 2000 but about the time in which it is made Israel 2007. Like the best however it's equally effective as a reflection of the time in which the film is viewed. The wasting of the noblest lives in warfare the fatal folly of undertaking to claim and defend outposts beyond your borders the pathetic destructiveness of a bunker mentality  these themes still speak to audiences not just in Israel but well beyond. As in his visit to the planned attack on Temple Mount in Time of Favour and his critique of the early settlers movement in Campfire Cedar proves Aristotle's subordination of history  which records what happened merely once  to fiction  which discovers recurrent truths everywhere and always. Wherever there is the urge to war there will be a Beaufort. And oh what a waste of heroes. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.".

	schema:headline " Very dramatic movie sometimes good sometimes bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful Bitch is a German 100minute movie from almost 10 years ago. It was a bit of a breakthrough film for lead actress Katharina Derr even if this is probably still her most known performance to this date. For writer and director Martin Theo Krieger this was the last work as a filmmaker so far. I am not sure if he is retired now. Anyway his film here is about a teenage girl who is a professional thief early on and faces the dark sides of life as an immigrant in Germany. She gets in trouble with the wrong people but also meets some people who genuinely seem to like her even if the initial reaction wasn't entirely positive either.All in all I believe this is a decent film for the most part. There are 2 or 3 occasions during which it wasn't working or cringeworthy in terms of the script or acting but overall it is an interesting story and I felt for the main character. I guess that has more to do with Derr fitting the role nicely than with truly great acting. Admittedly her face expressions weren't too many in this movie. On the other hand I thought the actress who plays her best friend did a pretty good job and this is even higher to rate as she did not appeal to me physically.What I liked about the film was that it was unclear for a very long time who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. Krieger includes some nice shades here a lot more than black and white and it was unclear where exactly the film was heading. A couple surprises included some truly shocking ones at times. I feel kinda sorry to see Krieger is not doing any new movies apparently. I can see solid talent in here and overall I have seen many German films from recent years with worse scripts. It is not great by any means or bestofyear material but a very tolerable watch for the most part and I recommend it. Thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to see zero reviews in IMDb for this classic one of Michael Raven's best features. How quickly they forget.It features Julia Ann in a terrific role playing against her title beauty as an evil scheming character who torments our sympathetic heroine Stormy. The two actresses have teamed up several times on screen and this was an important feature in which one Blonde goddess sort of passed the baton to an up and coming future and similar icon.The costumes styling and visual style suggest 1940s film noir but shot in color. Stormy and sympathetic coworker Devin Lane slave away at Julia Ann's business but Julia becomes jealous of Stormy's beauty and the attention paid to this underling. It soon becomes apparent amplified by the clever character names in Raven  George Kaplan's script that this is an adaptation of Snow White with a dollop of Sleeping Beauty thrown in.So will Stormy hook up with Erik Prince played by Brad Armstrong as a suave businessman hatching big deals with Julia Ann? Or will the evil villainess named Ellen Queen prevail? It all unfolds in stylish visuals shot by Raven himself and several dramatic scenes worthy of a mainstream film. I've been watching a number of Michael Raven clunkers lately but this baby counteracts a lot of the bad karma those losers generate. Definitely a must for any Julia Ann fan and a fitting introduction to the great career unfolding for Stormy Daniels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful Boy is not a fun movie to watch. Although arrestingly realistic it can be a pretty painful ordeal to endure. In fact it feels like such an immaculate representation of what it must be like to live through a horrific tragedy that one feels uneasy restless and depressed for hours afterward. So  know that going into the theater.As the story begins a college freshman named Sammy is calling his parents at home to check in. Mom Kate Maria Bello is a typical concerned parent wanting her child to do well Dad Bill Michael Sheen asks is Sam needs any money and is doing well and he hangs up. The next morning the terrible news Sam has shot 18 students and teachers in his college before killing himself.The movie wisely shows us nothing of the massacre its focus is on the aftermath. Kate and Bill are staked out by the media. They escape to her brother's house to live with him his wife and their young son. They are vilified on television and online particularly on Sam's Facebook. Their parenting is constantly questioned. In short time they are questioning themselves Did they make this happen? Kate and Bill had been drifting apart for some time to the point where Bill was actively looking for a new place to live. The tragedy doesn't immediately bring them together and it doesn't immediately drive them farther apart. Rather they each drift some more apart not just from each other but from reality. They blame themselves. They blame each other. They don't blame anyone. They continue on.There's hardly a note in the movie that doesn't ring true. These characters are not caricatures and they aren't archetypes either. Both Bill and Kate seem completely believable and with the tragedies in places such as Columbine and Virginia Tech they are characters who very much feel like they could be living next door to us right now. That they are trashed and widely hated is understandable and luckily neither character lacks the selfawareness to grasp why people are so mad. Bill reasons that the public wants to believe that the couple feels bad about what their son has done. They do of course. They show their deepening anguish in different ways but their devastation is complete. Their lives are seemingly ruined.But this is not a movie without any hope. The subject matter is gruesome but it's not tiresome. What we see are real reactions from realistic people. There are no real good guys just a couple of people who've suddenly lost their way. Whether they regain it is almost immaterial just as it's almost immaterial whether they regain it together. For us it's the journey from their discovery through the passage of a week or so that's the true endgame. Neither does the film wallow in sentimentality for the sake of making us feel good. The true moments of joy are fleeting just as they can be in real life. Even a dark movie can contain passionate performances.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful Boy is a raw and realistic look at society in which very few filmmakers dare to explore.";
	schema:reviewBody "Kate Maria Bello and Bill Michael Sheen have been struggling with their marriage for years and have decided to give it one final go before actually calling it quits. One night while planning their huge family vacation their son Sam Kyle Gallner calls and seems quite out of it. Both Kate and Bill seem worried but feel that Sam is just having a rough time during his first semester away at college. The next day life goes on as normal until the couple is notified that their has been a mass shooting at their son's college. Its only a matter of hours before Bill and Kate's already troubled life gets worse as they learn that Sam is not only dead but the one who began to shoot up the school. A raw realistic and heartwrenching look into our society ensues...Man do I love movies like this! I love movies that dare to tackle subject matters that our society just completely ignores. Beautiful Boy is not only a realistic tale about a crumbling marriage but also a unique look at the family of a trouble college student who did the unthinkable. In a time where school shootings are at an all time high there comes a movie like this that dares to examine the subject matter from a unique perspective. For years after mass shooting at various schools like Virginia Tech Northern Illinois and of course the notorious Columbine its about time some filmmaker dared to take a look into this subject and from the parents point of view.When we hear about school shootings we always think about the crazy kid who shot up the school but we never question for a second what about the parents and how are they taking the news. The media tends to point the blame at the parents and state that they must have screwed the kid up and caused himher to do that. Why purely blame the parents? Why isn't it on our society? The media? Or even just the large amount of hate in this world. No one can deny that there are some crazy people in this world but the question that remains is who is to blame and what would ever bring a person to take on such horrific action? No one knows and this film doesn't necessarily answer that questions but instead does show how hard the parents not only take the loss but how it makes them feel as people who have to live with knowing what their child is a killer.While this film not only tackles that difficult subject matter it also takes a brutally honest look at divorce and the basic struggles of every day life. Many husbands and wives stay together for the kids in our society today. I personally know several people that have stood together for the years when their marriage was on the rocks. Beautiful Boy shows this with Bill and Kate throughout the film and how the couple goes through periods where their love is strong and where it is weak. There is a huge fight scene near the end of the film in which Kate and Bill begin to violently argue about the relationship and whose fault it is that Sam turned out the way he did. That scene would bring tears to the eyes of any couple who has a kid or wants a child. It is gripping raw and unforgettable.In order for this film to work as perfectly as it did it clearly depended on Maria Bello and Michael Sheen to give realistic and believable performances. Needless to say they nail it and gave some powerful and gutwrenching performances. The chemistry and tension that they face is as real as any that I have seen in real life. When they are happy on screen you are happy and when they are sad and miserable you are sad and miserable. This film is clearly a character study of Kate and Bill and while there are some great supporting roles its really only those two who we as audience members are focused on. Bello and Sheen are the ones knock this film out of the park and give some truly Oscar worthy performances.I applaud directorwriter Shawn Ku as well as cowriter Michael Armbruster for creating a film that makes our society look at life marriage and adolescent violence from a whole new perspective. The script was well written and the scenes were placed perfectly throughout the film to make the movie keep the audience wanting more. The emotional scenes in this film were beautifully captured by Shawn Wu who seems to have an eye for detail on capturing raw emotion from his actors. With Wu's direction Beautiful Boy feels makes the audience feel as though we are dealing with the events that are taking place on screen and as filmmakers that is a great accomplishment.At the end of the day Beautiful Boy is definitely not the feel good film of the summer but is probably one of the most powerful and realistic films that I have seen in many years. It's real raw and brutally honest and I love that about indie films. I love feeling good when I go to a movie but I also like movies that tackle issues that are relevant to our society today. This film does that and while many may not appreciate how honest of a film this is I did and applaud everyone involved for taking on a film of this caliber. Beautiful Boy will more than likely be one of those films that around December of this year that will make it's way onto my  best of list for the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that Hollywood especially lately has been in the habit of giving us films dealing with parents suffering the loss of a child. We see them scream we see them cry we see them go through the same routine. Beautiful Boy takes this theme and puts a unique much more tragic spin on it. Michael Sheen and Maria Bello play parents who lose their collegeage son but worse is their son died after shooting up his school. So along with them having to grieve the loss of their boy they have to suffer the scrutiny of the media attacking their son and them publicly along with fighting themselves in trying to figure out what led to this awful thing happening. They fight with whether they're responsible whether they should take time to grieve or try to go back into things and as many other things as you can think of in this struggle for normalcy in understanding when everything else is fighting against them.Of course anything dealing with themes like this gives way to a lot of opportunity for melodrama. There's a subplot with a novelist that is very silly and expected and a few other scenes that rang false but for the most part the film was surprisingly honest and from the heart. These characters suffer in real ways and even though the film initially splits the two into stereotypes Bello having the hysterical screams and disbelief and Sheen with the stunned silence as it progresses they both go through phases of devastation denial and just a need to understand and get past it. It doesn't do anything particularly unique in how they grieve but the two performers make you feel everything these characters go through. They bring a lot of power to their roles and it can definitely hit very hard at times.Both Sheen and Bello have always been fine actors who rarely get the chance to demonstrate their immense talents. Here they are given full opportunity to let their skills show and neither of them hesitate to do so. Whether they are having a shouting match in a hotel room consoling one another in tears or just silently trying to deal with this huge tragedy it's hard to take your eyes off either of them. It definitely goes down the expected path but these two make it well worth watching with their powerhouse performances and I did admire the slight turn on what had kind of become a tired setup. Making the son this kind of person added a lot of layers to the struggle these two had to go through.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film last night two weeks after the bombing at the Boston Marathon where some virtual bystanders are still wringing their hands about how normal and sweet Suspect 2 was. The parents are angry and either in utter denial or at least with respect to the mother in silent conspiracy claiming that the brothers were framed and they could not have been terrorists. The characters and plot line in Beautiful Boy resemble the Sandy Hook horror even more closely. Imagine that Nancy Lanza was not killed by her son and that Peter Lanza still lived at home unhappy and on the verge of moving out. Their anguished discussions how they individually deal with the guilt and grief their desperate investigation of their son's life for clues as to how and why the blame and heartbroken accusations that they hurl at each other   these are so spot on that the film can be uncomfortable and unnerving. The movie also masterfully captures the wide spectrum of others' reactions. The brother and sisterinlaw who offer their home and as much love and sympathy as they can but still emit occasional flashes of blame and fear for how their own son could be impacted by their presence. A young author who the wife believes is a friend until she finds him hunting through her son's belongings for material for the book he wants to write. The open house held for the home where media vultures neighbors with cameras and the thrillseeking curious thoughtlessly devour the cookies the wife baked hoping that they would make the house smell better. Michael Sheen and Maria Bello play the roles of husband and wife with precision and depth. Moon Bloodgood soon to return in the upcoming Falling Skies season seems somewhat dispassionate and impersonal in her interactions with others as the sisterinlaw but that is a criticism I have for most of her performances. The scene where she expresses frustration to her husband about Maria taking over control of the home comes across as rehearsed. Alan Tudyk currently in Suburgatory as the brother is more sympathetic to the plight of his family but also displays a limited range of emotion. The son played by Kyle Gallner is mesmerizing in his few moments of screen time and I feel that the movie would have been much stronger if we were permitted to see a little more of his college environment and the days leading up to the shooting.However I recognize that is the very point of the movie   we want to understand how people make these terrible decisions but we never can see enough evidence because ultimately there is nothing that can justify such evil. The parents who are arguably the ones who should have the best chance of understanding their children's motivations and conduct are often as lost and confused as the rest of the world with the added component of trying to comprehend the degree of their own culpability. Those dynamics are nicely captured in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful Boy is about people. Husband Bill Michael Sheen and wife Kate Maria Bello and their son who is in his first year of college. They have an emotionless marriage one where things are done logically rather than with feeling. They're separated just not physically. Bill is going to save up money then find an apartment then put a down payment on it and then move out. But then comes the news of a mass shooting at their son's school. The police arrive at their door and the tears start flowing. But wait as the cops say There's more. Their son was the mass murderer killing 17 professors and fellow classmates and himself. Especially to Kate and less so to Bill they are the victims. To the media they are the people responsible for creating a monster. This is about their coping or attempts at coping with immense feelings of guilt loss and sadness. This is not about whether or not guns kill people or people kill people. This is just about people.With the media at their door and Bill is frustrated and Kate is just confused the film then sets up some extremely interesting dynamics. Kate's brother Eric Alan Tudyk opens his house to them but with a young and impressionable son their sisterinlaw Trish Moon Bloodgood isn't quite as welcoming. The tension and repressed feelings were so palpable you could cut through it in the theatre air. Tudyk's torn love and Bloodgood's icy stare easily matched Sheen and Bello's ceaseless emotional range.When giving us supporting characters whose roles in the couple's partnership seemed obvious both the supportive neighbour and the young handsome writer became more than their clich counterparts would suggest and added substantial interest to the already engaging dynamics of all the relationships.The audience is given plenty of time to cry. Just as the immense grief of the characters can bubble up at any time you will hear those around you burst into tears at any time. But this isn't just about feeling pain to move on. This is about people. And the characters here do interesting things during extraordinary times in the response to everyone around them. Kate is told that what they are going through very few people have gone through. Which is true but we can easily relate to Bill and Kate understand them and care for them.The extreme emotions that Bill and Kate go through are magically portrayed by the evercharming Michael Sheen and the understated Maria Bello. But it's more than just extreme emotions it's real everyday emotions. They brought real pause for thought about the fear and grief that parents go through when their child is off at university and sounds depressed and might not be adjusting all that well.Beautiful Boy ends as it beganwith people. With Bill and Kate and their marriage but now with feelings. There's more emotion than logic involved. And it's beautiful.".

In America we have witnessed in this generation alone some of the most evil ever conducted by mankind in all of history the fall of the twin towers the war in Iraq the shooting massacre in Virginia Tech all terrible staples in my memory and I'm not even thirty yet. What other horrors will this lifetime bring? As a new father I want to wrap my daughter Sophia in a bubble and never let her see the light of day for fear of what she may either endure or be influenced by. Shawn Ku's Beautiful Boy examines the aftermath of a young man Sammy that commits a mass shooting at his school and ultimately takes his own life. Bill Michael Sheen and Kate Maria Bello are your average married couple. Held back by grief guilt and rage Bill and Kate undertake the scrutiny from the presses and the families as the sole reasons for young Sammy's demise. How could you move on from a nightmare you couldn't wake up from? Ku takes on the story with ferocity examining a vast subject which perks our ears up and raises our eyebrows. Ultimately Ku fails at getting down to the emotional center of this tale. The narrative picks up rather quickly from the beginning but loses pace and theme quickly. It's not necessarily a failure on Ku's part or cowriter Michael Armbruster simply not as evolutionary in terms of independent filmmaking. The premise is enticing enough to withstand its flaws and it does have moments of brilliance especially in the scenes following the shooting. However it's the powerful performances of Michael Sheen and Maria Bello that hook the viewer in and safely guide throughout. Michael Sheen delivers his finest performance since his towering work in Stephen Frears' The Queen. Sheen attacks the character unlike anything seen from him before. He is engaged and delivers the emotional peril of a heartbroken father attempting to pick up the pieces in the most magnificent ways possible. Sheen invites the viewer into his world showing the ugliest and worst parts about him and letting us form our own opinion. Downright brilliant. Maria Bello who I fell in love with in David Cronenberg's A History of Violence handles Kate with care love and ease. Bello's precision and dedication to the craft stands nearly on the top of most actresses today. It also equals one of her finest works in years. Her hearton thesleeve approach not only allows us to respect Kate but it transforms her into a clear sign and example of masterclass acting. Where it can easily be taken over the top Bello holds it right to the edge never pushing us over. In a rare and personal plea these two performances should well be on the Oscar radar. As a small and obviously personal film Michael Sheen and Maria Bello deliver clear and cut two of the most worthy performances of award's recognition this year. It's reminiscent of the same feeling Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams delivered in their powerful works in last year's Blue Valentine. In his briefest scenes Kyle Gallner Sammy boils his performance to the rim and delivers a clever and daring performance. Beautiful Boy has raw and emotional power without falling all over itself with melodrama but it does come up short in some narrative regards. But with these two talented actors in tow the film will knock your socks right off in simple artistry.Read more reviews at Awards Circuit dot com.".

The hardest part of moving on is letting go and finding the courage to forgive to regret and to love. To comfort those around us in times of need we often use words like hope heal trust hurt feel and rebuild. However it is the word live that is the most important. When the emotions of life have gotten the better of us we forget how to live. This is a film about living. So rarely do you find such a beautiful debut film for a writerdirector but Shawn Ku has done just this with Beautiful Boy. The decision to use distant camera shots that are then zoomed in provides a layer between the characters and the audience that works in this film as we are invading the private lives during their most difficult times.The film follows the emotional journey of Bill Michael Sheen and wife Kate Maria Bello who are coping with the loss of their son from a college shooting incident. The blurred foreground as you peak through a window or from another room in the house to see and hear a conversation is perfect as their lives are forever going to be in a fish bowl. We all want to stare and look but are afraid to get close and truly understand what they are experiencing. The film deals with a topic that is for the most part unfamiliar to all of us. We have seen the unfortunate tragedies of Thurston HS 1998 Columbine HS 1999 and Virginia Tech 2007. However the emotions of the families are completely foreign.The supporting roles are quietly powerful with Alan Tudyk mostly known for his role of Steve the Pirate in Dodgeball as the brother of Kate who defends his sister to his own wife when she is acting like supermom to her nephew. Then there is Meat Loaf as a hotel manager that says what we all are thinking. However the best of the supporting cast might be Deidre Henry as the neighbor who quietly delivers the best performance. Her comforting hug to Kate is exactly what you in the audience might want to do.read more of the review at moviequacks blogspot".

	schema:reviewBody "I will be honest I saw this film listed on the movie channels and looked at the information and upon seeing it had Maria Bello and Michael Sheen in it I wanted to watch it. The fact it was about parents dealing with the fallout of their sons college shooting pulled me in all the more.Having just watched it I wanted to have a look what others made of it. There is a review that picks at how the film was shot and the bleakness of coloursbackground but for me that made the film better. I think sometimes films working on low budgets actually make it better there is something to be said for going a little old school.The drab colours reflect what emotional turmoil the character's are going through the fact that their world had literally plunged into unexpected and unwanted chaos when it wasn't perfect to begin with. We have two people who are already strangers to one another there is an emotional and physical divide between them and then this bomb hits their life and everything becomes isolated bleak and numb. I think the directing the photography and the actual film itself really encapsulates this feeling. Of course this is a highly sensitive issue and there was a lot of talk about We Need To Talk About Kevin in which Tilda Swinton delivers a wonderful performance. I think these are very separate films offering different perspectives. For Beautiful Boy you don't have the son available to speak about his actions like the other film you only get a couple of tiny snippets the film doesn't focus on him or the shooting at the same time that it is entirely focused on them but via the parents' reaction.I think this film stands out because there is no way to determine any wrong doing and it feels that there really isn't any. People do demonise the parents after events like this and here we have two people who are so completely stunned that they go through a series of emotions. They pull together they turn on each other they leave each other they cry laugh and shout. They have the double whammy of not only dealing with their child's death but the fact that he had it in him to kill so many people.I don't think that Maria Bello and Michael Sheen deliver a well acted chemistry I think they deliver a superb estranged numbness that would be evident in parents like them. It is a silent subtle thing to act  and to also act out physicality in emotional ways again  superb. They really turn the turmoil into a tangible assault for the watcher you are compelled to follow them as they go through both individual and combined experiences and processes.I think if you are a person that enjoys films for what they are films that don't need anything but good actors with a good storyline to be brilliant you should watch this. It is a great step into looking behind the scenes of the families that have to go through these types of events where they may not have been perfect parents but they were by no means bad ones either. Just everyday ordinary people that raised a son that loved him that worried about him from time to time but had no idea that he was capable of murder.If offers no solid reason for his actions I think that would detract from the film because though the storyline is about him the film is about them. I also think you're meant to decide for yourself why things like that would happen whether it is somebody in extreme emotional hurt that turns it outward or is innately bad or evil. Perhaps audiences are not ready to face that there unfortunately is never a good time to examine this subject head on in this way but Beautiful Boy offers the closest examination I've seen so far.".

I think sometimes films working on low budgets actually make it better there is something to be said for going a little old school.The drab colours reflect what emotional turmoil the character's are going through the fact that their world had literally plunged into unexpected and unwanted chaos when it wasn't perfect to begin with. We have two people who are already strangers to one another there is an emotional and physical divide between them and then this bomb hits their life and everything becomes isolated bleak and numb. I think the directing the photography and the actual film itself really encapsulates this feeling. Of course this is a highly sensitive issue and there was a lot of talk about We Need To Talk About Kevin in which Tilda Swinton delivers a wonderful performance. I think these are very separate films offering different perspectives. For Beautiful Boy you don't have the son available to speak about his actions like the other film you only get a couple of tiny snippets the film doesn't focus on him or the shooting at the same time that it is entirely focused on them but via the parents' reaction.I think this film stands out because there is no way to determine any wrong doing and it feels that there really isn't any. People do demonise the parents after events like this and here we have two people who are so completely stunned that they go through a series of emotions. They pull together they turn on each other they leave each other they cry laugh and shout. They have the double whammy of not only dealing with their child's death but the fact that he had it in him to kill so many people.I don't think that Maria Bello and Michael Sheen deliver a well acted chemistry I think they deliver a superb estranged numbness that would be evident in parents like them. It is a silent subtle thing to act  and to also act out physicality in emotional ways again  superb. They really turn the turmoil into a tangible assault for the watcher you are compelled to follow them as they go through both individual and combined experiences and processes.I think if you are a person that enjoys films for what they are films that don't need anything but good actors with a good storyline to be brilliant you should watch this. It is a great step into looking behind the scenes of the families that have to go through these types of events where they may not have been perfect parents but they were by no means bad ones either. Just everyday ordinary people that raised a son that loved him that worried about him from time to time but had no idea that he was capable of murder.If offers no solid reason for his actions I think that would detract from the film because though the storyline is about him the film is about them. I also think you're meant to decide for yourself why things like that would happen whether it is somebody in extreme emotional hurt that turns it outward or is innately bad or evil. Perhaps audiences are not ready to face that there unfortunately is never a good time to examine this subject head on in this way but Beautiful Boy offers the closest examination I've seen so far.";

	schema:reviewBody "The first fortyfive minutes of Beautiful Boy I must admit were minutes that included strong acting and harsh realism. The whole plot of the film is hard to really grab a hold of and decipher it since really it is a story that is just so hard to comprehend. But one too many things go wrong with this film that are results of maybe the film's own personal setbacks and the screenplay's too.Bill Sheen and Kate Bello are a middleclass couple with a son in his Freshman year of College. The son is Sam Carroll played by Kyle Gallner who if you recall was in Kevin Smith's most recent work Red State as the horny teenager who fell pray to a radical religious cult. Sam is troubled ignored and underestimated. Bill and Kate are shocked and in denial when they get the news the next day that their son walked into his morning class with a handgun and opened fire on his teacher and classmates.Now is the part we rarely think about when it comes to tragedies like school shootings  the aftermath for the shooter's parents. Their whole life has just went from mediocre to worse in a matter of a second. They are unfairly blamed stamped with the seal of bad parents and are now trying to save their already dying marriage by holding onto the only one who knows their pain.It's heartbreaking to think about both of the affected sides in an incident like this. Not only have many lost their life but the ones who were the parents of the killed now have to go on and struggle to find their ability to cope with the sudden change. It's hard on everyone.Michael Sheen and Maria Bello create pretty well acted chemistry but ultimately the film is its own worst enemy. Beautiful Boy was shot was a 16mm camcorder meaning that the picture quality isn't stellar compared to what is the norm now. That doesn't bring the film down as much as it is how the film works with its low budget. The color scheme is nothing but bleak  gray and black only hit the screen which might be parallel to the subject matter I'm not sure. But it just seems like it wasn't meant to be this way.The directing by Shawn Ku doesn't do too much justice either. During some of the intense and believable fight scenes between Sheen and Bello they are usually victim to swift pans which is where a shot instead of cutting to the other person talking it just spins right over to that person. It's sloppy and is extremely distracting from what the film is trying to show.The screen writing saves the film majorly here yet it lacks one fatal flaw  it's emotionless. We feel sad and a little gloomy sure but just thinking about the premise might have made people shed a few tears. The film is free from waterworks and this is coming from a guy who cries during My Girl Stand By Me and Toy Story 3.It might seem like I'm being way too critical but once you get past those minor setbacks Beautiful Boy truly is a pretty good film. It explores a field rarely shown and thought about. We don't really think about the parents of the murderer or how they are affected.One subplot I wish the film would've explored was maybe having one of the neighbor's kids being killed and then the aftermath of between the couple of the killer and the couple of the victim. Imagine the victim's couple was close friends with the shooter's and then think about how much of a war would've went on with the neighbors. I feel that that would've made a great little addition to a film already very limited.Beautiful Boy is a good first effort for a plot like this and hopefully more films will explore this topic with a heftier budget and further pursuing of the story would occur. There is a film coming out pretty soon called We Need to Talk About Kevin and from reading the plot and details of it it seems Beautiful Boy wanted to be something just like that. It will most likely suffer by comparison when that comes out when really its setbacks are some that you just can't really overcome.Starring Michael Sheen Maria Bello and Kyle Gallner. Directed by Shawn Ku.".

I am experiencing his work for the first time and I am driven by respect to pen this piece down. Director and also Cowriter Shawn Ku tackle a tough one by taking on BEAUTIFUL BOY. A majority would agree that it is a great effort for a startup directorial. I value the effort however although well accepted it would have been accepted even better if Shawn Ku himself took a step back and looked at what he missed out on I am most certain he will find areas that need fine tuning. The precision acting by Micheal Sheen  Maria Bello this time is the reason to me that failed in this drama. The acting is so greatly directed and executed by the cast that it seems that they forget to connect with the audience. All I experience is well enunciated lines. I heard noise but I didn't feel the anger I heard sobbing but I didn't feel pain I heard the silence but I didn't feel the sorrow. Bill Micheal Sheen and Kate Maria Bello are sharing a marriage that has no love. At the verge of separation they are willing to give the marriage one more chance by taking a family vacation with their son. Sammy Kyle Gallner a college freshman is having issues of his own. On a regular night Sammy calls his parents speak very indifferently and ask his mum a very unusual question before the conversation ends. Next morning Sammy's college is headlining the news as a shootout had taken place and 20 have been reported dead. None of the names are released in respect for the families of those who have passed. Two detectives walk up to Bills front door Kate knew that Sammy is dead even before a word is said however what she didn't know is that her son is the killer and he took his own life as well after shooting down the other students. A mother just lost her son this has to be felt by the viewer don't you think? Shawn Ku has all the right moves with the camera angles the close up shots the abrupt silence to build interest but his efforts would have gone a longer way if the emotional factor which is in my case the most predominant of all factors is present.Mass high school and college massacres always have been a thriving issue in some countries. I am forcing myself to believe that this plot on its own is something that always had to be discussed. The public need to see what it is to be the killers' parent. How do they handle the pressure? What happens to the social status? How do they cope with colleagues? How do they handle the media? How do they move on with their lives and get used to the fact that from this day forth they will always be looked at by society in a different angle? Brilliant issues don't you think? A Brilliant movie it must be don't you think? It indeed must be to some but not to me today. The issues don't tug at my heart as much as it should due to the lack of emotions being teased. This movie experience to me is just like the marriage Bill and Kate shared. They showcase a happy marriage but within they are empty for each other. This movie is empty to me.This is how I see it nothing more nothing less. Title Beautiful Boy Directed by Shawn Ku Starring Michael Sheen and Maria Bello Rated R for some Language and a scene of sexuality Rated 0410".

The director treats his audience to a refreshing array of kick boxing stunts coupled with his artistic creativity that makes the action and poignant scenes commendable and touching. The inner struggles faced by Nong Toom as he battle the collision of  testosterone and estrogen within his body and soul delivers the true essence and spirit of the movie that makes watching it an uplifting experience. The close relationship and love he gets from his  endearing mother soothes his inner pain and cushion the degree of sympathy showered on his potrayal as a pitiful character.Some of us can probably resonate with his pain and inner conflicts as there are often setbacks that leaves us emotionally crippled. The reflective scenes with plenty of natural scenary could however been better choreographed with more grace to create a more sombre mood. Above all Asanee potrays the character with tremendous aplomb and steely will and was duly rewarded with a 2004 Thai Suppanahongsa Best Actor Award.As my tagline suggests its rare to see such a testosterone and estrogen charged movie within the same character A commendable effort that will turn the spotlight on finer Thai movies to come. 4 stars out of 5.

	schema:reviewBody "I rarely see films twice but Beautiful Boxer continues to be a remarkably evocative film even on a second viewing. I saw it last summer at Outfest and took several friends to see it this weekend because I knew that they wouldn't see it on their own. It was a third choice film when I first saw it at the festival. I'm not a fan of boxing and have seen my share of documentaries on the transsexual experience so I was not particularly interested. Since I hadn't seen a Thai film I decided to go. What a gratifying surprise the film turned out to be! Beautiful Boxer transcends time culture ethnicity and gender identity to illuminate the humanity of the characters. Asanee Suwan the lead actor who plays Nong Toom is amazing. At the first viewing I thought that there was a very similar looking stunt double who did the fight scenes. Yet in the post film discussion with the Director Ekachai Uekrongtham we learned that the Asanee is an actual Muay Thai professional boxer. This was his first acting role. That makes his performance even more remarkable. He communicates the full range of Toom's being seamlessly integrating the feminine and masculine dimensions of hisher personality.In Iron Ladies and in other transgender themed films the transvestites are usually in your face over the top characters. The gender themes are either campy andor played for laughs. Beautiful Boxer on the other hand conveys the inner life of the Toom's struggle to assert her identity. I was very moved by Toom's dignity steadfast courage and perseverance in coming to terms with who she is. The film is poignant and ultimately inspiring. Yet it is also very entertaining. The film provides a window into Muay Thai boxing both its beauty and violence the socioeconomic conditions in Thailand and aspects of Thai culture. It was a most rewarding experience. BTW my friends agreed. GO SEE IT!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rising even higher than the greatest expectations engendered by the International Press when it became a favorite of the film festivals BEAUTIFUL BOXER is one of the more poetic sensitive luxuriously vivid and colorful films to come out of Thailand  and that is saying a lot given the extravagant epics that yearly grow in popularity. This work of art is simply stunning in content in direction in acting and in heartfelt simplicity of message. This is a great one! Writerdirector Ekachai Uekrongtham based his first film on the true story of Parinaya Charoemphol AKA Nong Toom a famous Thai athlete Muay Thai boxer better known as 'kick boxer'  a demanding dangerous sport who entered the world of Muay Thai to garner enough money to help his family and pay for his ultimate sexchange surgery. A tough story to offer general audiences perhaps but Ekachai Uekrongtham presents this edgy biography with such cinematic finesse and care that it becomes a film that should appeal to a very wide audience. And much of that success is due to the towering performance by Asanee Suwan in his acting debut Suwan is in life a professional kick boxer who won the title role after extensive auditions by many practitioners of Muay Thai.BEAUTIFUL BOXER takes us through the life of Nong Toom his childhood in a family of loving accepting parents who respect his love of beauty and things feminine his brief period of being a monk who must leave the monastery because of his inclinations through his introduction to makeup and playacting women's roles in the Thai theaters his ridicule as being more girl than boy a fact that results in his parents' incarceration! and his devoted friendship with a girl who supports his desire for femininity and a young man who stands up for him in the boys' camp for learning sports. Gradually Nong Toom realizes that the only way he can make enough money to achieve a sex change operation is to become a successful kick boxer and he aligns himself with a trainer Pi Chart Sorapong Chatree and with much commitment and practice becomes Thailand's most famous Muay Thai. His selfrespect is further established when he openly wears makeup in the boxing ring causing many to believe his act is a gimmick and not the manifestation of his true transsexualism. He fights the toughest opponents and wins consistently until he at last arrives in Toyko for the 'big purse' of fighting female wrestler Kyoko Inoue who plays herself. With the money from the fight he is able to have his surgery and becomes the famous actress and model now living in Bangkok.Under less sensitive eyes and minds this story could have become audacious but instead the film elects to be sensitive to the transsexual conviction that Nong Toom is a woman trapped in a man's body and it is the journey of self acceptance and personal victory that makes the story so deeply touching. Asanee Suwan as a fine athlete does all of his own fighting in the film and it is more choreography than brutality. He is amazing to watch and coupled with the fact that he is so wholly convincing in his fine acting that he makes this young transsexual utterly credible in movement emotional density and purity of vision is an extraordinary achievement.Yes the film has a few flaws of editing and other minor aspects but the overwhelming power of the story more than compensates for those 'first film' learning curves. Highly recommended for ALL audiences especially for those who fear there will be gratuitous physical scenes that might offend. There are none! Grady Harp".

It was even better because it made in Thailand and gave a realistic take on Thai culture. I don't know how accepting people would be here in the United States with a transsexual boxer fighting in makeup.

	schema:reviewBody "A Beautiful Boxer tells a touching story of a girl born into the wrong body and who through boxing would eventually be able to become one through surgery. It's a story about overcoming one's fate.Nong Toom was interested in dancing putting on girl's makeup and wearing woman's clothes from a very early age. His mother comments at the very beginning of the story that it was just a fad but it soon becomes clear that this isn't a phase it's just the story of boy who should have been born a girl.The writing and filming is solid and so is the pacing with the exception of a few moments. But what makes this film rise above its technical merits is its heart. The acting is superb. At some points you forget that you're just watching a movie because it's clear that the actors especially Nong Toom's Asanee Suwan are really becoming their characters. Thanks to this we get a plethora of heartfelt moments and really get a feel for a subject area that is relatively untouched transsexuals. Sometimes transsexuals get a bad rep but the fact is that these are real people who have to overcome the exceptional struggle of coming to term with their own gender identity while the people around you despise you bully you and at times make your life a living hell because they don't really understand.Overall Nong Toom is an exceptional movie with a psychological edge that is harshly realistic. I recommend it to everyone because I believe it's a story that everyone should be familiar with. Transgenderism isn't as rare as people think.".

	schema:headline " My summary and review of this exquisite film...";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie starts out with scenes depicting a man getting ready for a fight a very masculine portrayal of himself. With body oil and all the right gear that a MALE boxer would need. However there is also a scene that the movie keeps switching too a scene of a beautiful woman that is very feminine getting ready with stockings a reddish dress jewelry and very sexy red nails. The switching of the two scenes sets the stage for the movie A Beautiful Boxer. You already start to see his inner turmoil to become what he already knows himself to bea woman. This movie is based on a true story of a Thailand Transvestite named Nong ToomParinaya Charoemphol who is a boxer who fights like a man so he can become a woman.In the next scene we see a woman beat up a lot of people who are fighting a male reported that was trying to catch up to Nong Toom or Parinya who apparently goes back between the names depending on dress. The woman is the boxer. After this scene is where the boxer Nong Toom starts to tell us about his life and how he decided that he wanted to become a woman through boxing.You see a small child about 8 or 9 he is at a carnival and is following a girl with a pretty flower in her hair he sees a boxing match and is rather scared of the sport. He then sees a woman singing she sings a song that goes something like this Even though I was born a genteel girl I won't let anyone intimidate me I'll give my blood and tears to save my beloved land and he is enthralled by her and her look we see him fall for this look and this want of emulating her.Almost every male Thai child goes through period of their lives when they taken in by the monastery and try to accumulate good Karma for their parents at least that is how I understood it though the movie so Toom also went. He was told that he had had bad Karma in a previous life and now must suffer through this life wanting to be what he is not. Many more events unfold this movie is brilliant in showing a person's inner chaos and pain and at the same time keeping a sliver of hope for something better something better to come.I love the way this movie portrays Thai culture and the warmth and love between the mother and son Toom. I believe that the mother was responsible for being able to keep Toom strong and confident enough to be able to become a fighter in fact this movie has a whole line of strong and beautiful women guide him when it is needed who help him when there is nothing else for him to do and who ultimately save him in just the right moment.There is a moment when he first starts training to become a boxer and he is running up a very very long flight of stairs and he is so winded that he just can't go on anymore the trainer says Just imagine what you want most in life is up there. And run for it! That would be the premise for his entire training as a boxer. There is this pure genuine need for him to become his true self. To be able to get a sex change operation.The way the movie depicts boxing is so beautiful it is not just violence it is like a choreographed dance. After he sees how beautiful the sport can be he starts to work harder and harder pushing himself to max There are many struggles to get over his timidity. The more he fights the more confidence he acquires. There is a quote from Toom in this movie that I really loved it really embodies a part of his fighting career he says It seems like the more makeup I put on the harder my opponents kick me. So kick them back harder!In a later fight when one of the boys tries to trick him into rigging the fight we see him really grow up and lose a lot of his naivet the rain starts pouring the lighting comes out and he seems to change to harden a little at least his male boxer persona does. He is going through such frustration such pain he wants to be the woman he sees. The little girl with the flower in her hair he followed her as a child he now sees that girl and tries to see her face however he cannot. In my eyes that girl is him the person he keeps chasing is himself or herself. He remembers the dance of the beautiful lady and her song of never being intimidated he dances that same dance in the ring impeccably with a joy but also with a certain hidden sadness. Then he cries and you want to cry with him because anyone could understand having a goal wanting something so bad that you would do anything to get it. You really feel for him. My most favorite shot in this movie is when there are 7 people all sitting and waiting for the bus. The 7 people are all him  her from a young boy to the little monk though the stages of the boxer and now as almost a woman he has finally achieved his dream has become who he is meant to be gets off the bus and is a beautiful woman The quote form this part is the culmination of the movieIt's hard being a man. And it's difficult being a woman. But the most difficult thing is trying not to forget who you really want to be.".

The Thai cast in this production is nearly perfect in presenting her story.Among the many issues facing transgender individuals is the staggering cost of reassignment surgeries and that even in the face of overwhelming medical and psychological evidence to the contrary insurance companies still regard a sex change as elective cosmetic surgery. The same classification as they would give a rhinoplasty nose job to most of you.As it turns out Thailand is one of a few countries where transgender people go for surgeries. It's expensive and therein lies the tale of Beautiful Boxer. Noom Tang uses the prize monies won in kickboxing to pay for her surgery. While transitioning she faces a whole lot of evil but she literally kicks her way out.Watching this film I was struck with the similarity of this film and Flawless. In Flawless Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a drag entertainer who by chance finds a drug dealer's stash after a shooting and keeps it to pay for her reassignment surgery. It would probably have taken her twenty years of drag shows in order to pay for what she needed. A marketable skill but not quite marketable enough as kickboxing.I hope that those who watch the film think of the many who can't earn it win it steal it or stumble on the funds needed. If Beautiful Boxer can make people think about that it's a public service film.Or you can just enjoy it and be downright inspired.".

However this movie turned out to be the complete opposite. I was also surprised to see how the main character was not actually an actor but real life thai kick boxer. The acting was truly believable and almost had me in tears through out the movie.What I found really interesting to see was how the people of Thailand was not accepting of transgendered people and gays. I always imagined Thailand to be one of the only countries that did not have biased views on different sexualities and open to transvestites transgendered people. Therefore it was shocking to see how the main character had to deal with the harassment as he grew up to become a kick boxer. The movie filmed kick boxing in a beautiful artistic way. Although I imagined it to be an aggressive violent cruel sport the movie showed kick boxing to be a choreographed stylized art instead. The scene where the main character wakes up early to peak at the practices done by the chosen high level kick boxers was shot beautifully. The use of light from the back making the fighters figures look more like shadows was great and intesified the story.Overall this movie was a heartbreaking touching movie that really moved me and helped me understand how biased our culture is. There is no such thing as normal even the ones that fit in that category have a difficult time trying to achieve that state of normality. This movie helped me see that the education and religion needs to be adjusted so that everybody can live comfortably in their own body and their sexuality.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay for some people this movie might seem pretty risqu and for others it might just be an interesting story that makes them think. But I think at least 99 of people would still think of a man wanting to be a woman and going through with it as a taboo. Even if you yourself think it is OK and accept it as something that happens everywhere you probably wouldn't wish it on your children family or friends and would look twice if you saw someone like that on the street. I think of myself as the latter and I am posting about a part of the movie that caught my interest the most. When Toom came out to sign autographs and was called a disgrace by the distraught woman from Thailand I felt it was unfair for her to judge him. Later when I looked back on it I realized she had a reason to feel that way. Earlier in the movie we got some understanding of their religion Buddhism when Toom was sent to become a monk. If 85 of Thai men become monks for at least a short time it is obviously a religion many of the people in Thailand practice. Therefore I am assuming this woman believed very strongly the same as did Toom's parents and what the monks were taught. I mean not to think sinful thoughts My point although I'm not sure if I have gotten it across is that I was wrong. The woman had every right to say what she believed to be true even if it wasn't the nicest thing to say. Different people have different cultures and beliefs and that is why we need our rights. To be free to say what we think and feel which is what this site's for. Yay. K".

Even if you yourself think it is OK and accept it as something that happens everywhere you probably wouldn't wish it on your children family or friends and would look twice if you saw someone like that on the street. I think of myself as the latter and I am posting about a part of the movie that caught my interest the most. When Toom came out to sign autographs and was called a disgrace by the distraught woman from Thailand I felt it was unfair for her to judge him. Later when I looked back on it I realized she had a reason to feel that way. Earlier in the movie we got some understanding of their religion Buddhism when Toom was sent to become a monk. If 85 of Thai men become monks for at least a short time it is obviously a religion many of the people in Thailand practice. Therefore I am assuming this woman believed very strongly the same as did Toom's parents and what the monks were taught. I mean not to think sinful thoughts My point although I'm not sure if I have gotten it across is that I was wrong. The woman had every right to say what she believed to be true even if it wasn't the nicest thing to say. Different people have different cultures and beliefs and that is why we need our rights. To be free to say what we think and feel which is what this site's for. Yay. K";

When he was child he had such kind of sexual identity and is bullied. While his father is not formative for Noom's identity he does not charge it and said anything about it. To make separate from the public community they let he go monk school. Boxing is school too. While some people is against to his gender role they are kind so no body reject him.Thus he does not hide the thing even after he could make money as a boxer.Japan scene is was impressive for me because it describe how much Japanese people love the groupie things.

To achieve his ultimate goal of total femininity. Touching funny and packed with breathtaking Thai kickboxing scenes Beautiful Boxer traces Nong Toom's childhood teenage life as a traveling monk grueling days in boxing camps and explosive matches where he knocks out most of his opponents across Thailand and Japan.

	schema:headline " Face you real sexuality bravely";
	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful Boxer is a touching and meaningful Thai movie by Singaporebased director Ekachai Uekrongtham. Nong Toom's life story is the main subject of the film which is playing by Asanee Suwan a male kick boxer in the real life. Nong Toom was a Thai boxing champion before but she is a model in Thai today.In the movie Nong Toom is a transsexual person who faces her real sexuality bravely. I like the film because I really admire her behavior and spirit. The fans of the genre would be satisfied since the impact of the story is really strong. It is difficult to imagine that a masculine man would choose to do a surgery in order to become a femininity lady. The storyline structure of the film are wonderful because it not only shows the life of Nong Toom to audience but also displays her internal talk and state of mind which is easy to understand. I can predict that the main character is a male transgender who wanted to become a woman in his childhood. However it's still a good movie because it's fun to know how people with gender distortion are thinking and feeling. In the film when Nong Toom was in the childhood there are many shots about lipstick. Nevertheless Nong Toom had interests to be a woman is not because of cosmetic but is mindset. HeShe hates violence of Thai boxing but heshe loves the beauty of it. HeShe joined the competitions was not because of gaining reputation but letting family to have a better life.Beautiful Boxer relates to the society. There are few people who have gender and sexuality problem. Also these people usually got discriminated. But we cannot say that being a transgender or transsexual is their fault since they are born this way. Life will take you on many roads. But only when you look inside do you find the strength to be yourself? and The most difficult thing is try not to forget what you really want to be. I really like these two sentences which Nong Toom mentions when she was interviewing by a western reporter. The film tells us that if you are comfortable with the opposite sex there is no need to be ashamed of it. Although some people would laugh behind being what you really are is more important.".

It could be that through such a base of peace and mostly support around her at a young age that she was able to persevere at a very consistent rate until she became the most popular Muay Thai Champion in Thailand.I rate this film highly for it's sense of biographical delicacy nicely shot fightscenes and soothing sense of atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "I had not heard of this movie before I saw it so I didn't really have any expectations however I was very pleasantly surprised. Most movies that portray transgendered people or transvestites lean heavily on the use of stereotypes to portray characters. While the movie does little to show the difference between these types of people and doesn't really even It is also nice to see a movie which from a nonwestern culture take on these types of issues.The film is about a Thai boy Parinya Charoenphol also known as Nong Toom who from a very young age knew that he was not truly a boy. The very gentle Toom had for most of his life knew that his sex and his gender are very different but had no real way of affording an operation to make himself feel like a complete person. When he first winds up in a Muay Thai match Toom is very afraid of getting injured however a lucky hit makes him win.With the cash prize in hand and with a new found confidence gained by his ability to defend himself Toom decides to join a Muay Thai training camp. He has several initial troubles as he feels like the only women in a group surrounded by men. However he is able to get some help in secretly expressing his feminism from the wife of the camps coach. The coach Pi Chart eventually finds out Toom's secret after he has begun to win a few fights. To his surprise Toom is encouraged to keep wearing makeup even during matches.Toom had begun fighting to free his family from financial burdens and to earn enough money to get a sex change operation. He's transvistism gave him an advantage with the audience they may have laughed at him at first but once he won so many matches many of which ended in knock outs the crowds loved him and his antics. Some accused Toom of not being a real transgendered person but it appears that she was accepted on mass before and after her surgery.This movie boldly speaks out on gender issues and it is treated very differently than it would be in the West. Yes there is some comedy in the actions and dressing of Toom when he cross dresses. However his sexuality and gender isn't part of the comedy of the movie as it would probably be in an American movie. It is addressed more as a fact and in a more mature way.".

When he first winds up in a Muay Thai match Toom is very afraid of getting injured however a lucky hit makes him win.With the cash prize in hand and with a new found confidence gained by his ability to defend himself Toom decides to join a Muay Thai training camp. He has several initial troubles as he feels like the only women in a group surrounded by men. However he is able to get some help in secretly expressing his feminism from the wife of the camps coach. The coach Pi Chart eventually finds out Toom's secret after he has begun to win a few fights. To his surprise Toom is encouraged to keep wearing makeup even during matches.Toom had begun fighting to free his family from financial burdens and to earn enough money to get a sex change operation. He's transvistism gave him an advantage with the audience they may have laughed at him at first but once he won so many matches many of which ended in knock outs the crowds loved him and his antics. Some accused Toom of not being a real transgendered person but it appears that she was accepted on mass before and after her surgery.This movie boldly speaks out on gender issues and it is treated very differently than it would be in the West. Yes there is some comedy in the actions and dressing of Toom when he cross dresses. However his sexuality and gender isn't part of the comedy of the movie as it would probably be in an American movie. It is addressed more as a fact and in a more mature way.";

The trip is as much to go to the reunion and see his old friends  none of whom left Knights Ridge after graduation  as it is to get away from his current life at which he is at a crossroads both personally and professionally. He is just eking out a living with his piano playing gigs and as such he is thinking about taking a sales job. He's also not sure if he's ready to marry his long time girlfriend lawyer Tracy Stover. Most of Willie's Knights Ridge blue collar friends' best days were in high school they still having that trophy mentality of girlfriends and wives. Only Michael Mo Morris is happily married with a family. Paul Kirkwood whose room is plastered with magazine pictures of models wants his waitress exgirlfriend Jan back only because he knows now that he can't have her.

	schema:reviewBody "It is very rare to encounter a film so devoted to character and this is the greatest strength of Beautiful Girls. Each character has their own personal turmoil and lightness which shines through in a film which from start to finish very little movement of plot is actually achieved but then again it doesn't need to.Smalltown sensibilities and community spirit are intertwined with the notions of enigmatic strangers posing in an almost prophetic manner delivering advice upon the populous. Events such as brutal fighting unashamed drunkenness and references to sex are handled as items which are not derogatory but necessary in a rites of passage kind of way. Each character develops through the film into better individuals of what they once were but not to such an extent as to impose sickly sweet values on the audience.Every character is natural and rounded despite some major personality flaws. Timothy Hutton's excellent Willy is at odds with himself over the next stage of growing up Rappaport plays the goofy yet loveable fool for love Dillon the lost soul and Emmerich the doting yet somewhat incapable father. But it is in the Beautiful Women themselves where the real essence of the film lies. Uma Thurman is every blonde inch the mysterious and elegant Andera crossing paths with everyone and influencing their lives for the better. Rosie O'Donnell as the brash 'matron' of the group is the perfect foil for Sorvino's insecure personality. The ace of the bunch however is a mesmerising Natalie Portman who even despite being the cast's youngest member is compelling to the point that you can understand Willy's fascination with her character Marty.For anyone wishing for comfort on a cold winter afternoon there are very few films with such a strong heart Demme excels himself by never laying on the sentimentality rather poking gingerly at our own innermost feelings and coming out with a winner.".

The key word in ensemble cast is obviously cast. And this movie has a stellar cast. Timothy Hutton as Willy is perfectly cast. Yes this is an ensemble movie but it sort of hovers around his character and he carries the movie so well. And to play off him Natalie Portman is tremendous in this movie. Despite being the youngest cast member she outacts most of the adults in this movie. Her chemistry with Timothy Hutton is amazing. The other cast members including Rosie O'Donnell Michael Rappaport Uma Thurman and Matt Dillon are also really good in their respective roles. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a hilarious monologue about the differences between men and women and it should not be missed.The story is relatively simple... a man going back home to attend his 10 year reunion. But because of the complex characters and their various storys it becomes much more than just a high school reunion. Its a story about a man finding himself. Its a story about a young girl getting a taste of what love might be despite it being in an unlikely person. Its a story of a man who has to grow up and let go of the long gone high school glory years. Its a story about relationships between friends family and couples. All these tales are interwoven into a heartwarming story. This movie ranks as one of my all time favorite movies.".

As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be' and the denial that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating in Beautiful Girls' a drama featuring Timothy Hutton Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.Willie Conway Hutton is back home in the Midwest for his high school reunion but more than that to try and make some decisions about his future.  He finds that nothing much has changed the town or his old friends most of whom seem to be exerting more time and energy attempting to cling to what was rather than moving on with their lives.  Tommy Rowland Dillon for instance the high school hero' as it were now drives a snowplow for all intents and purposes his life peaked' in high school and he can't seem to get past it.  Then there's Paul Michael Rapaport who just doesn't seem to want to grow up after a seven year relationship with Jan Martha Plimpton he refuses to make that final commitment after all What's the rush?'All of which does nothing to help Willie with his own dilemma the only words of wisdom he gets from anyone in fact come from the precocious thirteenyearold Marty Natalie Portman who lives next door.  But in a couple of days Tracy Annabeth Gish the girl Willie thinks' he wants to marry is due to arrive from Chicago so it's time to move beyond the crossroads for Willie it's decision time.Demme delivers a story that just about everyone in the audience is going to connect with on some level because everyone's gone through or will go through these kinds of things at one time or another.  Who hasn't experienced if only for a moment that sense of either wanting to stay as they are or going back to what they were when life was better or at least simpler.  Or more fun.  Working from a screenplay by Scott Rosenberg Demme examines the relationships between this eclectic group of individuals in a way that offers some insights into human nature that will no doubt elicit some reflection on the part of the viewer.  It all points up that no matter what it may look like on the surface underneath it all we're not so different from one another we all share that common bond of learning life's lessons one day at a time albeit in our own particular way which corresponds to who we are as individuals.  And Demme succeeds in telling his story with warmth and humor by tapping into the humanity at the heart of it all.The story may focus on Willie but the film is a true ensemble piece realized as it is through the sum of it's many and varied parts.  It's a talented cast of actors bringing a unique bunch of characters to life that makes this film what it is beginning with Hutton who anchors it with his solid portrayal of Willie a challenging role in that Willie has to be an average guy who is unique in his own right.  The same can be said of Dillon's Tommy in whom traces of Dallas Winston from The Outsiders' can be found Tommy is perhaps just Dallas a few years later.Mira Sorvino gives a memorable performance by creating the most sympathetic character in the film Tommy's girlfriend Sharon.  This is the girl who was never going to be prom queen and who up until now has lacked the selfconfidence necessary to create a positive environment for herself. Lauren Holly meanwhile succeeds with her portrayal of Darian Smalls the absolute opposite of Sharon a young woman who is probably too positive for her own good and who lives the life of a perpetual prom queen an individual who as another character succinctly puts it was Mean as a snake' back in the day.  Good performances that add a balanced perspective to the film.There are two performances here that really steal the show however.  The first being that of Michael Rapaport who as Paul so completely and convincingly captures the very essence of an average Joe with not too much on the ball no prospects for the future to speak of but who is at heart a good guy.  There's humor and pathos in his portrayal which personifies that particular state of being the film is seeking to depict.  Excellent work by Rapaport and decidedly one of the strengths of the film.The most memorable performance of all however is turned in by Natalie Portman who at fifteen is playing the thirteenyearold Marty the girl mature and wise beyond her years I'm an old soul' as she puts it with whom Willie forms a kind of bond as she in her own way helps him to sort out his feelings and find his focus.  Portman's performance here some three years before she would forever become Padme Amidala exhibits that spark and charismatic screen presence that has served her so well since in films like Anywhere But Here' and Where the Heart Is.'  She has for some time been and continues to be one of the finest and most promising young actors in the business.The cast also includes Noah Emmerich Mo Rosie O'Donnell Gina Max Perlich Kev Uma Thurman Andrea Anne Bobby Sarah and Pruitt Taylor Vince Stanley all of whom help to make Beautiful Girls' a memorable and satisfying cinematic experience.  And that's the magic of the movies. 810.".

Too bad Demme is Donne because this is great work. Every single role is believable and not overacted. Maybe it's my 30 something now 40 something mind working but this is a great movie to sit down and enjoy. Nothing blows up and I can't recall a single car chase but if you can allow yourself to get involved with a storyline this is for you.You can fall in love with Natalie Portman and I don't know that I've ever seen Rapaport in a better role. There isn't anyone more anti Rosie Odonell than me but even her role is great. The bad news for friends and family is that I've stolen many lines from this flick because I'm not original enough to come up with my own stuff.What's he all creased aboutI would be first in line to purchase a another DVD that is Dolby Digital and has some extras. Lastly don't miss the soundtrack there is a great blend of feel good music along with some new cool licks.".

This movie is entertaining and sometimes fluffy but more importantly it is real and timely. Amongst all the hype of the XGen this movie boiled down our mood all us kids who are still growing up in a small town setting where the people were real except for Rosie she should have ended up on the editing room floor. The slight plot is less important than the setting and the circumstances. Winter in small town Massachusetts on the frozen lakes and the plowed roads and small taverns  on the edge of early midlife adulthood for yet another lost generation...the movie leaves you with a cold warm snow feeling of hope and sorrow for people in transition that usually only a classic novel like those by F. Scott or Hemingwaycan give you.".

Winter in small town Massachusetts on the frozen lakes and the plowed roads and small taverns  on the edge of early midlife adulthood for yet another lost generation...the movie leaves you with a cold warm snow feeling of hope and sorrow for people in transition that usually only a classic novel like those by F. Scott or Hemingwaycan give you.";

I don't know if reading it before will spoil it for youI doubt it in fact but you never know.Being the typical unmarried man I rented Beautiful Girls because of its attractive title.  I had no idea it could be so moving or endearing.  I may be just getting soft but it was one of the few films I have thought about for more than 72 hours after I saw it.Aside from all the sexual content swearing etc. the dialogue between Marty the now beautiful Natalie Portman and Willie my favorite actor Timothy Hutton is nothing short of astounding.  Willie is enchanted and attracted to this little 13year old girl next door.  As they exchange more and more conversation he realizes her great potential and even dreams about how he might just be able to wait ten years and maybe marry her.The scene in which Willie discusses his feelings with Mo his married friend was the turning point of the story.  Willie realizes that even if she had a loveatfirstsight crush on him she would drift away as she matures she would find someone closer to her own age and Willie would become just some silly old man she met when she was young and had a ridiculous immature attraction to.  He realizes that by just being her friend he will be able to keep her in a much more real way than if he tries to wait for her to be his lover.But the one scene I will remember forever the most perfect scene in the entire movie in which the dialogue seemed neither forced nor overelongated was the scene in the iceskating rink with Marty and Willie. Marty tells Willie all the things he would have liked to hear before his talk with Mo.  She would marry him after they waited five years etc.  The association Willie makes with Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robins is so beautiful it almost made me cry.  Not really but you get the point.  He gives her a good taste of reality and she seems mature enough to understand.In a later scene Willie tells Marty that he would like to continue being a friend even a mentor to her and he has total confidence that whatever she does will be amazing.There are about three other stories intertwined into the movie but the PortmanHutton line stands out as the superior.Overall a wonderful movie to which they should have given a title that would attract people with the ability to be moved.P.S.  The funniest part of the entire movie is the confused look Willie and Paul exchange after Mo gives unusuallyphrased threats to Steven who beat up their friend.  You have to have seen the movie to understand".

I figured either the tape was run down with it being exrental or the film was crap and nobody ever rented it.  However the prospect of Matt Dillion and Timothy Hutton in the same film made me buy it although my girlfriends were discouraged!So after a marathon evening of Gladiator followed by Being John Malkovich I popped this in the Video and was enthralled!  The acting was great and the story relevant to reallife.  Everybody goes through these problems after all.  The chemistry between Willie Timothy Hutton and Marty the wonderful Natalie Portman was brilliant  even though the subject is considered taboo.Matt Dillion's little triangle with Mira Sorvino and Lauren Holly is an entertaining sideline and Michael Rapaport provides the comic relief as we watch his crumbling relationship with Martha Plimpton.  Rosie O'Donnell is also hilarious as the downtoearth readytobreakyourballsifyoustepoutofline type who is happy to rip the rose coloured glasses from your face whenever she feels its necessary.There is a real sense of friendship between this allstar cast and that really the defining factor in this film.  However the real stars are Hutton and Portman who are simply brilliant.  She has perfected the little vixen role in Leon aka The Professional and although the characters of Mathilda and Marty are completely different there is that little inkling of a girl wanting to be loved by a man in her performance.  Hutton handles his role with care  and his WinnieThePooh speech is simply heartbreaking!".

Timothy Hutton was absolutely brilliant. Rosie O'Donell though I despise her at times has a brilliant feminist scene in which she puts Hutton and Dillon in their place. Uma Thurman though a fairly limited role in the movie is a stunning character and her role ties the movie completely together bridging the gap between the feminists and the vulgar men in the movie. A young Natalie Portman gets her career off to a great start as a very cute very sophisticated 13 year old who's witty charm is the icing on the cake.

	schema:reviewBody "The emphasis of this movie can be placed in Kev's last words to Willy in the film 'Stay Cool Man Stay Cool Forever.' All of the male characters in this film with the possible exception of Moe are trying to stay cool by refusing to grow up. Willy is wrestling with the idea of becoming a salesman and giving up on his lifelong passion of music. Only if he sticks with his music will he stay cool and according to Tracy stay sexy. He is also trying to avoid growing up by not getting too commited to Tracy. In the film he is willing to stray not once but twice. Moe tells him his infectuation with the 13 year old Marty is purely his way of refusing to grow up not grow old and here Moe makes the definition between the two but there is a definite chemistry between the two. Meanwhile his grownup infactuation with the sublimely sexy Endera is his last attempt at a fling before he grows up and decides he wants to spend the rest of his life with Tracey. Endera talks him out of it and tells him how lucky he is to have Tracy in the same way Endera's boyfriend is lucky to have her.Tommy's way of staying cool is to relive his highschool days and this means his affair with his highschool girlfriend Darian has to go on in order for him to stay cool. But by the end after having it beaten out of him by Darien's husband he realises his birdman days are at an end and it's time to settle down with Sharon.Meanwhile Paul has to grow up he realises he has to do something with his life or he'll end up like the three old guys at the bar as he says he doesn't want to end up like them. This is why he proposes to Jan and when she refuses he knows he has to do something else. His last words to Willy nothing changes here but the seasons leads us to believe that Paul believes the only way he can truly change is to get out as Willy has done.Meanwhile Kev is quite happy with his life and thinks that he is cool beacuse when Paul has his rant about the three old guys working and then drinking Kev thinks this will be a cool way to grow old.So therefore Beautiful Girls is a film about men refusing to grow up and wanting to stay cool for as long as possible. While the strong female characters in this film try to get them to grow up. This is an inspirational film about the different types of middleaged men and there ongoing rriendship with each other. 9 out of 10".

In addition to the aforementioned Academy Award winnersnominees the cast includes Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton Academy Award nominee Matt Dillon Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino and Emmy Award winnersnominees Annabeth Gish Rosie O'Donnell and Martha Plimpton.The story isn't much. Piano player Timothy Hutton comes home to a small town in Massachussetts and bonds with his old drinking buddies.

You really believe Hutton when he tells Portman he wants to keep in touch because when she grows up she'll be ...absolutely amazing. Marty already is. She's certainly wiser and more focused than almost any of the adults in this film except Thurman.END OF SPOILER Sit back and enjoy this beautifully written expertly acted laid back movie. I give Beautiful Girls an 8.".

	schema:headline " The Proverbial Guy Flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Beautiful Girls notwithstanding its stellar cast is a cerebral and multilayered film which represents the emasculation of emotional and experiential films which are often and rightfully vilified or what might be called chick flicks. To this end Beautiful Girls is a veritable guy flick and addresses to a more emotional end some of the same 20something angst and existentialist related issues faced by men as seen in more obvious and violent examples such as Fight Club. This film is a richly textured character story profiling one man's quest for self understanding and direction by returning to his banal hometown from the big city while at a crossroad in his personal life and while entering a new epoch in his relationship with an equally banal woman. His amalgam of high school friends remain isolated almost indentured to the same working class routine which defined their adolescence and have little hope of ever moving on other than in their idle daydreams. His subsequent obsession with the barely pubescent girl next door MartyPortman is in fact somewhat reminiscent of the dialectic of beauty and decay explored in Thomas Mann's epic Death in Venice whereas her youth and perceived way of interpreting the world is enviable almost infectious. She represents less of a sexual or romantic fixture in his mind than she does a crucible for all things he values and hopes for. And still hopes to be. This film is not for everybody and some less patient or intelligent viewers will no doubt decry it as boring or slow. Indeed the storyline is far from cutting edge but the real story in this film is the people the place and the raw emotion which we can all relate with. This film is an impressionist painting come to life and is perfect philosophical fodder for the introspective type.".

	schema:reviewBody "Willie Timothy Hutton is at a crossroads in his life. His career as a musician isn't going anywhere and he needs to decide what to do with his life. So he returns to the town where he grew up under the guise of attending his high school reunion to decide if he is ready to grow up and move on. Should he give up his dreams marry his lawyer girlfriend get a regular job settle in?This is the premise around which Beautiful Girls revolves. Willie is the central character in a group of twentysomething high school buddies who never left adolescence. They are the quintessential poster boys for abstinence of every stripe. They don't get it. Not just relationships. They don't get anything. They hold down dead end jobs carry on dysfunctional relationships with women who care about them more than they deserve and spend quality time together every week fishing in an ice house in the middle of a frozen lake. It's enough to make you feel good about your own life. The characters especially the male ones don't generate much sympathy. Their wounds are selfinflicted they have little interest in the world around them. Still each possesses a certain vulnerability that makes them easy to relate to and we all know people in our lives like them.While his friends go about their lives oblivious to life's possibilities Willie is looking for something. He is looking for something beautiful. And he finds it in the most unlikely of places  next door literally. Marty Natalie Portman in her best role is pretty precocious and confident with a penchant for quoting classic literature. It's love at first sight fate having brought them together. Only there's a problem  she's only thirteen. But as she duly informs him she is an 'old soul' wise beyond her years. And it is their sweet confusing and ultimately transcending relationship that becomes the heart of the movie.Willie is initially cautious somewhat befuddled and in something of a state of denial about his growing affection for Marty. But pretense soon falls away and he begins to come to terms with his feelings for her. She's smart she's funny. She's hot...but it's not a sexual thing. I could wait. In ten years she'll be 23 and I'll be 39 and it will be no big thing. SPOILER Marty on the other hand possesses the clarity of youth and in the movies pivotal scene at the ice rink she shares her feelings with him Marty You should wait till you're ready. Until you meet someone who excites you.Willie Yeh well she may not be out there. Willies girlfriend Tracy doesn't excite him  he is still looking for someone who can. That is why he is balking at marrying her. He knows he would never be happy with someone who doesn't inspire him. Marty Alas Romeo we can't do diddly. You go to the penitentiary and I become the laughingstock of the Brownies. But if your feelings for me are true you'll wait.Willie Wait?Marty Yep. Wait five years. I'll be eighteen. We can walk through this world together.The look on Marty's face is priceless it says it all  she's in love and she knows he has feelings for her. She wants him to know what she feels for him is real and unique and she wants him to wait for her while she grows up and he sorts his life out.Willie I can't be a Pooh. Willie is afraid afraid that if he waits for her she won't be there when he is ready. But she just smiles a smile that reflects her confidence her unshakable belief in the power of fate. Meanwhile Willies relationship with Tracy is going nowhere. He knows Tracy is a wonderful girl  smart and sweet. But he is not in love with her. His father is in love with her. His younger brother is in love with her. But he isn't. He never says he loves her at any time not once. He kisses her briefly once or twice but there is no passion no excitement shared between them. There is affection. There is respect. There is friendship. But there is no love nor the special connection necessary for love to develop. The only time he gets close to her is when they have sex in his room. But sex is not intimacy. Sex is not love. True intimacy defies words. It is transcendental. And that is the beauty that Willie seeks.The final scene provides subtle hints as to what the future holds. Even as he is packing Tracys things into the trunk of the car as they prepare to leave he keeps glancing over his shoulder next door hoping to see Marty. When she does appear she doesn't say Goodbye she says Later Pooh. She knows they will see each other again and that he is indeed her Pooh. But his Pooh is not one that her Christopher Robin is willing to forget. Their future is reflected in the remarkable series of emotions that cross Marty's face as she watches him leave. First there is sadness then contemplation and finally determination. It is not a look of farewell it is a seeyouinfiveyears look. And when she waves goodbye it is not with sadness but with anticipation resolve of faith in destiny. She is telling him 'I'll be here.END SPOILER This is a sweet endearing story of love in its purest form  timeless selfless eternally optimistic . I hope Beautiful Girls receives the sequel it deserves.".

But I was positively cringing at some scenes especially the singsong bit in the bar where everyone joined in as if it had been a tradition of theirs for years with everyone knowing the words and everyone loving it oh so much an awful piece of directing and acting Mo going off key so obviously. This film was full of stupid things that no one would do or say and things that weren't said that would have been etc.  What woman wouldn't take offence if a friend told her she reminded her of Kathy Bates from Misery?  Check out the dialogue of Willie's father following the dinner with Tracey. In places this film is unbearable. If I hadn't been waiting for the appearance of Annabeth Gish I might have turned off in disgust long before the end.  But there are a few redeeming features Michael Rapaport as Paul giving his reasons for not removing his pictures of models from his wall becomes almost poetic we'll ignore the fact that this was totally out of character.  He was carrying more than his fair share of this movie singlehandedly with Matt Dillon and Rosie O'Donnell sleepwalking through familiar territory and the other supporting roles so numerous that they could only be thinly written.  But this is undoubtedly Natalie Portman's film.  She is a triumph even if her character does stretch credibility to breaking point.  The doomed romance is played so perfectly I fell for her myself and the penultimate exchange between her character Marty and Willie moved me to tears. Although Portman's performance is so good I would go so far as to say one should watch it just for that this isn't great filmmaking. A final sour note is that Beautiful Girls also has a distinctly unsavory femalechauvanistic tone. SummaryHas redeeming features but not enough.

	schema:reviewBody "I mainly watched this to see Natalie Portman as I've been a fan of hers for some time and have been very impressed with most of her performances but I have to admit as I started watching it I really liked it. It grabbed my attention immediately and never lost it. The plot is interesting and captivating it revolves around Timothy Hutton who plays Willie a late20's piano player who returns to his home town after ten years to meet his old friends and celebrate the 10years highschool reunion with them. When he arrives he quickly finds out that nothing really has changed in the last decade at least not for his friends and the town in general. His friends are all still struggling with their love lives their family and their lives in general. Among those friends are TommyMatt Dillon who has a girlfriend and an affair with a married woman with a child Michael Noah Emmerich who has settled down and gotten a family and seems to be content and PaulMichael Rapaport who's girlfriend has just broken up with him because he couldn't commit after a long relationship and who almost worships models because he is very hung up on beauty. Willie quickly meets the new neighbor or rather the new neighbors teen girl MartyNatalie Portman who almost immediately casts her love on him despite their obvious age difference. The entire cast does a great job Timothy Hutton plays a great somewhat happy guy who realizes that no one in his home town where he grew up have moved on done something with their life like he has. Matt Dillon gives a great performance as the former high school stud who can't give up on either of the girls in love with him. Noah Emmerich plays a believable dependent father who can't seem to raise his kids without his wife's help. Michael Rapaport portrays the hopeless dreamer who couldn't settle down with his girlfriend and can't get over his ex. Natalie Portman gives a great performance as the Lolitalike Marty who falls in love with someone she knows deep down that she can't be with. The characters are all wellwritten and interesting and despite the fact that there are so many they all get the screentime they deserve and require. I also enjoyed and somewhat liked every single character even the one played by Rosie O'Donnell who I normally loathe was entertaining and interesting. The humor in the film is great it doesn't seem forced and it just blends in. The film doesn't have any of the cliches often associated with dramas that have a high school reunion in them. The actors all have great chemistry and really make you believe that they are that character not just an actor playing a part. I liked the Wizard of Oz theme and references though I'm not entirely sure what to make of them. Either the city was Kansas or it was Oz. Anyway all in all a great drama with great humor and great acting. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors fans of dramas and generally people looking for a good little film with an allround great cast and believable characters. 810".

I can understand how some people can think it's quite slight without a deep plot and no explosions. It's not that type of film however. It's a character piece and all the actors are excellent in their roles. I also like that it's a movie made for grownups. There's been some great movies dealing with relationship issues for teenagers but there doesn't seem to be many movies made about that period in your midtwenties when you're trying to figure out what you want out of life and who you want to spend it with. The cast are all great and I especially liked Paul who added some comic relief. Rosie O'Donnell playing Gina also has a great scene lambasting the guys for their immaturity. One criticism that could be made is that it's a movie made of set pieces but I think that's inevitable when you're concentrating on so many different characters and make them all identifiable and well rounded. Due to the snowy backdrop and small town setting I always think of this as a lovely Christmas movie. Grab a tipple and some chocolates and snuggle under your favourite blanket and give it a watch.".

Why do we want what we want can we even realize the value of what we have unless we face its absence? All questions which can be discussed at length which have been discussed at length since the dawn of time. Beautiful Girls doesn't claim to have all the answers it only wants to convince us that we can find them with an open mind and an open heart.The many flawed yet charming and unique characters who are depicted in this story are in a struggle to trace their path back to the roots of their issues before they are allowed to carve a path towards personal growth peace and happiness as symbolized by Willie's return to his hometown for a highschool reunion. Many of these people are described with a naive honesty that fits in well with the small town covered by snow imagery a fantasy of purity simplicity and wholesomeness which covers up a lot of dirt. Perhaps the snowplowing is the unifying metaphor in this movie. As more and more issues are resolved for example as we see Paul open the driveway of Jan we see snow disappearing from the roads. Last scene of the movie we see Kev with the snowplow truck driving on clear roads freed from snow at last in contrast with an earlier scene in the movie as Willie is picked up at the bus station by Mo we see the roads were covered in snow. In a sense snow becomes the element which blocks the roads towards progress symbolizing being stuck frozen in life.I like these kinds of small town small people movies. They teach us that meaningful stories that have things to tell about human nature don't always have to come in epic packages have to be tied to events of epic proportions that the significance of events relations etc. can not solely be measured by the number of people they end up effecting that true adversity can and does often come from internal conflicts which can't be solved by brute force like external conflicts.Take for example Willie's relationship with Marty. On the surface it's creepy for sure but Willie isn't really after a sexual relationship. He's looking for and finding in her what he's been missing in his life A bright future full of possibilities an inquisitive mind that isn't afraid to askquestion a courageous heart not afraid to take risks a pure soul not tainted by years of accumulated cynicism and tiredness that come with the harsh realities of everyday struggle as an adult. He sees in her a glimpse of his own childhood and wants to grasp on to it for growing up means he has to come to terms with the possibility that his dreams might never come true.All in all a very well made movie whose layers peel away one by one to reveal a beautiful core in the end.".

I think any gay man growing up can relate to Jamie. He doesn't excel in sports and almost too smart for his own mother.  He is comfortable with his sexuality and he doesn't give a damn what the world thinks of him. Ste on the other hand fears his older brother and his father made his life miserable. As he states in the film they made me ugly. Ste is not all ugly and Jamie realizes this and is attracted to his brash manly demeanor. Unfortunately Ste's own demons and his insecurities are present throughout the film.  At one point Ste ashamed of rumors of his questionable sexuality denies it to a heartbroken Jamie.Obviously I enjoyed this movie. The scenes between Jamie and his mother and likewise between Jamie and Ste are perhaps the best parts of the movie. I understand having Leah in the movie to provide the supporting role of comic relief was a necessity in most film requirements but in this one it distracted the viewer to an extent. I was so glad when it came out on DVD so I can put my last VHS tape to rest but disappointed that there were no cast interviews or extras at the end. Granted the movie was made six years or so after the DVD came out but you might think the film makers would find something of interest.So England what will be the next great gay movie ?".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those great British dramas set in a typically grim environment but shot with positivity throughout. Having grown up around the area in the film and being only a few years older than the featured boys it was a joy to see life there depicted in the film. I agree with all previous comments about the actors and how truetolife it feels. Although slightly exaggerated in places this film is a great comment on London working class life as well as being focused around a gaybased storyline.However I wanted to add that this film also comments on the complex class system in the UK which explains why Tony was dropped by Sandra. Many nonBritish viewers may not have picked up on this. Thoughout Tony is shown as a middle class character who doesn't really fit into the working class environment. He uses different slang words to the others has a 'posher' accent and has slightly different attitudes to all the other characters. He and Sandra come from different worlds. As Sandra says she has been fighting all her life whereas he has had evertyhing given to him on a plate. Ultimately this relationship was never going to last. Life in London and the UK is still spilt into different social classes although they do mix a little more than they used to. But you can often tell where someone is from by their accent and their choice of words. This was used to great affect in the film.Overall a lighthearted look at life on a London council Estate with some great performances... one of my favourite films.".

A school mate named Ste Scott Neal has problems with his abusive father. They meet and end up realizing they're gay and in love. Also there is a black girl neighbor who is always blasting songs by Mama Cass! Moving and VERY well made drama. It was shot in Thamesmead England so the accents are hard to follow sometimes but you eventually get the hang of it. Berry and Neal who were both teenagers when this was shot played their roles perfectly. You can see in their faces and body language the confusion they're feeling and trying to deal with their orientation. When they run around in a dark wood and start kissing with Make Your own Kind of Music booming on the soundtrack it's absolutely ecstatic and liberating! Also they're not painted as saints. They come across as normal teenage boys. Henry is just incredible as Jamie's mother. All kidding aside I'm shocked that she wasn't nominated at the England Academy Awards for this performance. You see her and Jamie trying to deal with each other and her realizing he's gay. This all leads to a GREAT moment at the end when Ste and Jamie are dancing to Dream A Little Dream Of Me holding each other close right out in public. Sandra sees this and starts dancing with a black women right next to them. The defiant look on her face to everybody was just right! I remember seeing this when it came out in 1996 and actually crying out of happiness at the end. This was an unexpected art house hit in 1996 and ushered in for a few years anyway a tidal wave of gay films. Moving beautifully acted and how can you resist a movie with a Mama Cass soundtrack? Just exceptional. A 10 all the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Heartwrenching performances a witty and sensitive but never sappy script and characters so real they could walk off the screen these aren't usually things to be found in gaythemed movies but Beautiful Thing has all of them and more. Where Brokeback Mountain left me devastated and believing happiness couldn't ever last I will never watch it again and Latter Days is a prime example of style over substance Beautiful Thing makes me feel like love is out there and it's really worth fighting for. It has stayed with me vividly and powerfully since I first saw it and I continue to watch parts of it often.I don't know if Glen Berry or Scott Neal could have realized what an impact this film would have on some viewers but I wish I could thank them for bringing such humanity realism and likability to the roles of Jamie and Ste. Linda Henry too in the brilliant role of Sandra gives a performance worthy of an Oscar and Sandra's boyfriend Tony played perfectly by Ben Daniels is hilarious and surprisingly endearing. The script is not selfconscious or saccharine it is uplifting without being preachy and tender without being grating. If you're gay or just a human being with empathy and understanding and a good sense of humor  the script is terribly clever and the film really benefits from multiple viewings Beautiful Thing is an experience you should not miss. It's a film I will cherish forever enhanced by the music of Mama Cass Elliot who was truly gifted and whose death was a great loss.Favorite scenes though almost every scene is really a favorite the Make Your Own Kind of Music chase in the woods I may love this scene more than anything else ever the bedroom scenes with Jamie and Ste and the final sequence featuring Mama Cass's beautiful Dream a Little Dream of Me which I will not spoil  I envy the firsttime viewer who is in for a huge treat. I like to think that Jamie and Ste live on forever in the final shot the future uncertain but the present a greater joy than they had ever known their love a small but bright glimmer of hope in an otherwise gray world.".

It's very refreshing to see gay themed movies that do not depict the main characters as effeminate andor drag queens... just regular guys being regular guys. I would rate this movie right up with Brokeback Mountain in that respect just in a different setting and a different time period. I've already bought a copy off EBay and would recommend this movie highly to anyone. I would also recommend it to any parents who are struggling with gay issues with their children. The acting is topnotch and I can certainly see why it was nominated and won so many awards. Scott Neal and Glen Berry held onto their characters like pros and Linda Henry as the mom was just excellent! The characters of Ronnie and Trevor made my skin crawl but from an acting perspective  wow  great job! Ric.".

	schema:headline " A truly wonderful funny and at times moving coming of age story";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a long time since I've seen this not in fact since it first came out in 1996. The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny yet tender and positive film.Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu.The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers but it is never graphic or overly highlighted it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most which is a good thing it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes nor does it present being gay negatively.The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point a 'Fuck You Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible. Whilst coming out and acceptance is very difficult for many young gay people the journey is a little easier for these two but it's that that makes this such a joy to watch and a reinforcement that being gay is both perfectly natural and wonderful.More of my reviews at iheartfilm.weebly.com".

	schema:headline " Flawed but sweet";
	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then when I'm in the mood to watch a sweet little gay romance I dig out my VHS copy of Beautiful Thing. The film has its flaws. Exchanges of dialog that aren't quite believable. They perhaps worked better on stage than on screen since we expect less realism on stage. Ben Daniels was miscast as Tony or at least needed better makeup and wardrobe he doesn't look young enough or privileged enough for that character. And then there's that annoying closing dance in the courtyard......But before I launch into that pet critique let's talk about what works well in this film. Excellent use of actual locations in Thamesmead the film gives you the feeling of settling into the realworld geography. Great musicand I have in mind not only the Mamas and the Papas but also the very clever selection from The Sound of Music and the sweet understated John Altman instrumental that recurs through the movie. Superb acting of the kind you expect from the British even the small parts feel like threedimensional fully thoughtout characters. The two male leads aren't especially attractive as would have been required if this had been an American production but they make the romance so endearing that they somehow seem to get cuter as the film progresses.My great regret about this filmthe thing that keeps me from enjoying it as unselfconsciously as I would like and as the filmmakers presumably hope I wouldis that closing scene where Ste and Jamie dance in the courtyard ignoring the crowd around them. My understanding someone correct me if I'm mistaken is that in the play that final dance occurred in the relatively more private space of Jamie's balcony which makes so much more sense. I can understand why Jonathan Harvey and Hettie Macdonald would be tempted to provide a more dramatic defiant celebratory coming out for the end of the movie. And I have tried so hard over the years to justify that decision in my head as a believable event in the world of this movie Ste and Jamie are both accustomed to being victims of violence so the decision to live openly is a knowing calculated risk. Ste is presumably leaving the estate to move into the new pub with Jamie and Sandra so he's no longer in danger from his father and brother as everyone had been so afraid earlier. Jamie's making foolish decisions in the reckless euphoria of coming out but Sandra's there watching out for him glaring at the crowd like a mother velociraptor daring anyone to threaten her child.I've tried to explain the closing scene in all those ways. But the fact remains that after all the work this film went through to make itself believablethe locations the superb actingit lapses inexplicably at the final crucial moment into a fairy tale ending. That was an unfortunate decision and tagging the film An urban fairytale doesn't suffice to make the decision palatable. This film simply has the wrong ending. I've seen Harvey say that he wanted to provide a positive image of hope for gay workingclass youth. Those young people would have been better served and the story would have been sweeter had the film stayed more believable up through the end.Still the film's worth digging out from time to time for another viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "Every now and then when I'm in the mood to watch a sweet little gay romance I dig out my VHS copy of Beautiful Thing. The film has its flaws. Exchanges of dialog that aren't quite believable. They perhaps worked better on stage than on screen since we expect less realism on stage. Ben Daniels was miscast as Tony or at least needed better makeup and wardrobe he doesn't look young enough or privileged enough for that character. And then there's that annoying closing dance in the courtyard......But before I launch into that pet critique let's talk about what works well in this film. Excellent use of actual locations in Thamesmead the film gives you the feeling of settling into the realworld geography. Great musicand I have in mind not only the Mamas and the Papas but also the very clever selection from The Sound of Music and the sweet understated John Altman instrumental that recurs through the movie. Superb acting of the kind you expect from the British even the small parts feel like threedimensional fully thoughtout characters. The two male leads aren't especially attractive as would have been required if this had been an American production but they make the romance so endearing that they somehow seem to get cuter as the film progresses.My great regret about this filmthe thing that keeps me from enjoying it as unselfconsciously as I would like and as the filmmakers presumably hope I wouldis that closing scene where Ste and Jamie dance in the courtyard ignoring the crowd around them. My understanding someone correct me if I'm mistaken is that in the play that final dance occurred in the relatively more private space of Jamie's balcony which makes so much more sense. I can understand why Jonathan Harvey and Hettie Macdonald would be tempted to provide a more dramatic defiant celebratory coming out for the end of the movie. And I have tried so hard over the years to justify that decision in my head as a believable event in the world of this movie Ste and Jamie are both accustomed to being victims of violence so the decision to live openly is a knowing calculated risk. Ste is presumably leaving the estate to move into the new pub with Jamie and Sandra so he's no longer in danger from his father and brother as everyone had been so afraid earlier. Jamie's making foolish decisions in the reckless euphoria of coming out but Sandra's there watching out for him glaring at the crowd like a mother velociraptor daring anyone to threaten her child.I've tried to explain the closing scene in all those ways. But the fact remains that after all the work this film went through to make itself believablethe locations the superb actingit lapses inexplicably at the final crucial moment into a fairy tale ending. That was an unfortunate decision and tagging the film An urban fairytale doesn't suffice to make the decision palatable. This film simply has the wrong ending. I've seen Harvey say that he wanted to provide a positive image of hope for gay workingclass youth. Those young people would have been better served and the story would have been sweeter had the film stayed more believable up through the end.Still the film's worth digging out from time to time for another viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those typical British films made with excellent but unknown atthetime actors a budget of nothing about a taboo subject that has no humour in it in a deprived working class area. In typical British film style all these essential ingredients together with some added humour make for a wonderful and absorbing film. Linda Henry for me was the star of the film. Playing Sandra Gangel Jamies mother she really is 'The Tart With A Heart'. Shes hard as nails a worker and essentially a great mother though this is not always easy to see at the beginning of the film but as the story progresses it becomes clear that she has struggled and fought for her son throughout his short life. Once his homosexuality comes out into the open the real fight is only just starting. Jamie falls for abused neighbourschool friend Ste. Both the characters of Jamie and Ste are played with such professionalism throughout. There are some bedroom scenes which could have been over played but in this film much is left to the imagination of the viewer. The young boys really do justice to the great writing and direction. The supporting cast are much in the back ground except Leah a rather troubled girl in from the same housing block who provides some of the more amusing moments and pathos especially with her devotion to the music of 'Mama Cass. The British class system also comes into the film via Sandras latest boyfriend Tony. Again this difference is played for what it is  a difference in backgrounds and cultures. It is not played for laughs. It is just there all the situations in this film appear to be normal and not contrived or put into the film for the sake of it. Tony does however make a valuable comment during the film. When Jamies homosexuality is known by Sandra she is seen out on the balcony crying and thinking about how she brought Jamie up on her own. Tony's comment about nothing having changed is a wonderful moment in the film. The climax of the film shows Sandra and Jamie moving a step up in the world and Sandras acceptance of her sons sexuality. She makes a great comment to her best friend Gina Gina I shall never have grandchildren. I mentioned earlier the humour. This is typical British dry humour which i can imagine would pass some non Brits by as it isn't slapstick or obvious but subtle and natural and comes from the excellent script. Good examples of this are the lovehate relationship between Sandra and Leah which provides some very funny one liners and also the conversations Sandra and Jamie have together. There is some wonderful pathos! I saw this film first when it was shown in the 1990s when it did cause some controversy in the UK and again in 2006 and it has not dated at all. It still looks as fresh and good as the day of release.It shows a hot summer on a London Housing estate where two young people find themselves. The picture is more like a window into the lives of the people on the estate. You can easily imagine that life went on before the film and indeed is continuing much the same today.".

A local Chicago theatre company Famous Door presented an absolutely firstrate production that eventually played offBroadway in NY. To say that the play was a revelation is a complete understatement . . . we were completely blown away. We connected to the story to the excellent cast to the simple but effective production. After the play we had to get something to eat so that we could continue talking about it! A year or so later while we were living in Richmond VA the Richmond Triangle Players also presented the play. That production was somewhat unique because the actress playing Sandra was the reallife mother of the actor playing Ste. We were happily surprised to find the film which I finally have had a chance to see. The film brought back that same emotional rush of our first encounter with the play in Chicago. Beautiful Thing is a positive endearing and enduring film. The film version makes a few changes and opens the story up a bit as the medium allows and the casting of the role of Leah made for a slightly different dynamic in the film. The cast is uniformly excellent and the scenes between Jamie and Ste are as many previously have noted very real and very honest. The Cass Elliott songs add a great dimension to the film as well. The direction is clean uncluttered and straightforward. Much credit must go to Jonathan Harvey who wrote a very fine play and then adapted it well for the screen. I wish that there were more gaythemed films like this one  romantic in the best sense of the word and accessible to all with hearts open to love  to help counterbalance the usual portrayal of gay characters as superficial and selfabsorbed. I look forward to repeated viewings of this wonderful movie.".

Beauty Shop gives us the return of Gina played by Queen Latifah from the second Barbershop movie. Gina has moved away from Chicago to Atlanta so her daughter can attend a prestigious music school. She has made a name for herself at a posh Europeanstyle salon owned by the famous hairstylist Jorge. After a scuffle with her boss Gina decides to quit her job and achieve her dream of owning her own beauty shop. She brings with her a few loyal customers along with another worker at the salon. With the help of her family and the electrician slash romantic interest who lives above the shop Gina finds success with her beauty salon.The cast of Beauty shop follows the same formula as the barbershop movies. There's the obvious ice cube parallel with Queen Latifah's Gina. The older and wiser stylist the male form of Cedric the Entertainer's character played by Alfre Woodard who quotes the wisdom of Maya Angelou to her customers. The token white worker is present with Alicia Silverstone and the one opposite sex worker played by Eve in the barbershop has her counter part with Bryce Wilson's James. Also included in the film is everyone's favorite Huxtable Keisha Knight Pullian famous as Rudy Huxtable. And lastly quite possibly my favorite part of the movie and funniest character in the movie Kevin Bacon is hilarious as the egocentric Jorge. The cast works very well together and the fun they had while making the film shows in each scene.While the cast is fun to watch I still felt as though something in the film was missing. When watching Barbershop that classic old town feel emits throughout the show. The characters are so fun to watch as we see their relationships with each other and their own personalities work and clash with each other. While watching Beauty shop while the characters were fun to watch interact with each other that feeling just isn't the same when you walk out. I left feeling somewhat unfulfilled.However after more reflection on the matter I realized that the mood of a beauty shop is no the same as the mood of a barbershop. Maybe I didn't feel the same because well I'm not a woman. As with any television spin off a movie spin off should be able to hold its own ground. It doesn't need to be a complete reference to its predecessor. Think of Frasier. One of the things that made the show so great was the fact that it held its on ground separate from Cheers. The same goes with Beauty Shop. Yes it relies on a few references and relations to the barbershop movies but other than that it completely holds its own. Which as I thought about it made it more enjoyable to know that I wasn't watching the same movie in female form.Beauty Shop is a fun movie to watch with a very solid cast. Queen Latifah does a fine job as Gina and makes and more or less makes up for her involvement with last year's Taxi. If for anything else see the movie for Kevin Bacon you wont be disappointed. Beauty shop is pretty enjoyable and is the closest to a hair cut ill come to. I give it 3 stars.out of 5".

The acting from Latifah Woodard Silverstone and Bacon are great. Actually I've never seen Bacon act like that in his entire film career. It's funny to see that. Bacon's character then gets jealous because Gina is doing much better than he has expected. The jokes are funny in this film.If you just want to see a feelgood film here it is!".

So the message from that perspective is that in order to fit in and be accepted one must conform to be just like everyone else. Good for a few laughs but loses something in the translation.The standouts here are Kevin Bacon who is outstanding and hilarious as Jorge the not quiteAustrian salon owner and Djimon Hounsou who is charming and catches you with the kindest face in film.The rest of the cast are average each actor and actress playing themselves and bringing nothing special to the table.On the whole this film is just a shadow of the Barbershop films basically trying to emulate them frame by frame except for one important aspect this film has no plot. No story. it's just a bunch of scenes strung together by the overall premise of a beauty shop owner trying to make it in this crazy world. No story and no Cedric the entertainer and a ton of excessively vulgar booty humour equals a poor woman's Barbershop. I'd save your tenner and wait for the DVD  or better yet rent the Barbershop films. They're the better bet as the originals usually are when compared with the clones. 510.".

	schema:headline " Despite a strong cast Beauty Shop is mostly a forgettable flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Queen Latifah reprises her role from Barbershop 2 Back in Business as sassy stylist Gina Norris who has now moved down to Atlanta. When her annoying boss Kevin Bacon at the fancy salon where she works goes too far Gina decides to set up her own business bringing along the shampoo girl Alicia Silverstone and many of their clients. In her new beauty shop women have a lot on their mind and they're not afraid to speak out about it.So the premise is pretty much just a female version of Barbershop. Barbershop appealed to everyone and it was fairly interesting to watch. Beauty Shop is the exact opposite and it's just not as interesting nor as funny to watch. The characters aren't as good and some are just bad stereotypes. The dialog is also pretty weak and the film just doesn't work sometimes.In this type of film if the characters aren't interesting then the film is dead. Luckily Queen Latifah has a likable personality and she carries the film by herself. It doesn't make the film good but she did save it from being a complete disaster. She's not as good as Ice Cube but can still carry her own film.The rest of the actors are only okay though they seem to be having a good time and this helps. Alicia Silverstone gives a decent performance as Lynn. Her really annoying accent takes away from the performance though. Andie MacDowell's role is pretty small which is a good thing since her performance isn't very good. Kevin Bacon gives a funny performance as Jorge. Unfortunately he isn't in the film very much. The rest of the actors aren't very memorable and they aren't worth mentioning. Billie Woodruff does a bad job of directing and he should seriously stick to directing music videos if that. He just doesn't try anything new or interesting. He keeps the pace sluggish and he just follows a normal routine.I didn't like the movie very much. I thought I would like it because I enjoyed Barbershop. However Beauty Shop was dull and not very creative. The script was generic and weak. The characters were mostly just stereotypes and one dimensional. The main plot line just wasn't as engaging as Barbershop. Also the topics they discussed in the shop just weren't very interesting and they were more fluffy topics rather than important topics. In the end Beauty Shop is a disappointment and a dud compared to Barbershop. Rating 410".

The dialog is also pretty weak and the film just doesn't work sometimes.In this type of film if the characters aren't interesting then the film is dead. Luckily Queen Latifah has a likable personality and she carries the film by herself. It doesn't make the film good but she did save it from being a complete disaster. She's not as good as Ice Cube but can still carry her own film.The rest of the actors are only okay though they seem to be having a good time and this helps. Alicia Silverstone gives a decent performance as Lynn. Her really annoying accent takes away from the performance though. Andie MacDowell's role is pretty small which is a good thing since her performance isn't very good. Kevin Bacon gives a funny performance as Jorge. Unfortunately he isn't in the film very much. The rest of the actors aren't very memorable and they aren't worth mentioning. Billie Woodruff does a bad job of directing and he should seriously stick to directing music videos if that. He just doesn't try anything new or interesting. He keeps the pace sluggish and he just follows a normal routine.I didn't like the movie very much. I thought I would like it because I enjoyed Barbershop. However Beauty Shop was dull and not very creative. The script was generic and weak. The characters were mostly just stereotypes and one dimensional. The main plot line just wasn't as engaging as Barbershop. Also the topics they discussed in the shop just weren't very interesting and they were more fluffy topics rather than important topics. In the end Beauty Shop is a disappointment and a dud compared to Barbershop. Rating 410";

Beauty Shop was just about as effective as the hotdog.This movie was a complete waste of time. Not worth the 8 bucks to see it at a decent theater not even worth the measely 2 dollars to see it at a cheap theater.

Queen trades in Cedric the Entertainer who played the older wise yet hilarious barber for a female counterpart in Alfre Woodard. The white barber who couldn't catch a break is replaced by the white hairstylist with the same dilemma. Both films involve the financial hardships of trying to run a business while not being ran out of business. Unlike the original Barbershop films Beauty Shop lacks the intensity but more than makes up for it with comedy. Andthe movie was funny! How could it fail? The support cast included comedians or scene stealers Sherri Shephard Sheryl Underwood Adele Givens Ms. Laura and L'il JJ. But no one could compare with Kevin Bacon's performance as the Scandinavian stylist extraordinaire Jorge. At 50 he still looks like a man in his 30's. And while we're talking about the supporting cast I can't forget to tell you about Keshia L'il Rudy Knight Pulliam. She's grown into a beautiful young woman and she's still a decent little actress. I just hope she doesn't go the dismal way of child stars and end up in the center on Hollywood Squares.Who knew that when we saw Queen Latifah pushing those chess pieces off that large board in the Ladies First video that one day she would stand out as a gifted actress singer and comedian.

It's like choosing to be a goth or a punk or all of those subcultures almost conformingly anticonformist grouping yourself in a similar minded alternative.So now we have this movie where Queen Latifa plays Gina a stylist whiz who feels underappreciated at her job so opens her own shop and there she shocks and appalls the neighborhood by bringing in white clientele and white employees and letting them all enjoy the scenery. It's actually one of the strongest movies dealing with integration I think I've seen basically because when everyone gives trouble to the the white girl and the white girl's getting upset and disturbed by it Gina just has to say to her Hey think how I felt in a white shop. Indeed.Plus when dealing with those pesky issues of representation that seems to hover over every mediated creation of black characters this one is pretty broad from the black women who refuse to work with the white woman and leave to the young whitespeaking black girl who keeps on getting hit on by the jivetalking twelveyearold to the African culture versed man above them who also happens to know a thing or two about playing good piano.And of course it would be. From the makers of Barbershop it has that same more critical look at black culture that loves it and yet knows what it really is and where people on both sides take it too seriously. Barbershop was actually quite a wonderful film mostly because of it's political incorrectness but also because of the paleskinned barber who points out that being black is what he wants not what he has to be born into and Cedric the Entertainer doing his Martin Luther King Jr. was a HO! bit was just too much.Now if only this film didn't have ... well... Kevin Bacon. I thought that having Kevin Bacon in it would make it amazing but it really really didn't. He's just too weird for a too lightly humored film.

A beauty shop is the social place where women go not only to have their hair taken care of but also is where a lot of drama happens when divas don't have their way.Jorge the phony man who owns the exclusive Atlanta salon feels threatened by the talented Gina who he sees as a threat he ends up firing her. Gina doesn't take anything sitting down. She envisions having her own place and will not stop until she finds it. When she takes over a salon that has seen better days she starts putting her input into what she wants the place to be. Some of her old customers follow her.Not everything is easy for Gina. It appears that Jorge is behind the scenes trying to do anything to derail Gina's business. But never fear Gina is up to the task and she is a formidable foe so don't mess around with her.This comedy directed by Bille Woodruff capitalizes on Queen Latifah's charismatic personality.

A beauty shop is the social place where women go not only to have their hair taken care of but also is where a lot of drama happens when divas don't have their way.Jorge the phony man who owns the exclusive Atlanta salon feels threatened by the talented Gina who he sees as a threat he ends up firing her. Gina doesn't take anything sitting down. She envisions having her own place and will not stop until she finds it. When she takes over a salon that has seen better days she starts putting her input into what she wants the place to be. Some of her old customers follow her.Not everything is easy for Gina. It appears that Jorge is behind the scenes trying to do anything to derail Gina's business. But never fear Gina is up to the task and she is a formidable foe so don't mess around with her.This comedy directed by Bille Woodruff capitalizes on Queen Latifah's charismatic personality. She is sassy she has common sense and if anyone can make a place like Gina's work it's this huge talent that is the main reason for watching the movie. Kevin Bacon also has some hysterical moments as Jorge. He is a riot when he shakes his corn rows when he is in a snit.

The world is racist its still a white man's world. Gina has her shop destroyed because Jorge cant stand her success.There's a white girl Lynn Alicia Silverstone who wants to be black whats the harm in that?I like rap music anything wrong with that? No. It certainly it shows that I love some of things the black culture has shared with our very narrowminded society. Yes Lynn's character is dumb and ditzy to some but I took her as just being happy go lucky.I thought Queen Latifah's acting was pretty good always believable even shes rich and all she still how to portray a ghetto character trying to make ends meat.I really loved Andie MacDowell's character as Terri a woman who opens up and joins the beauty shop as a regular customer. Mena Suvari steals the show though as overbearing rich slut of a client Joanne who basically thinks the world is hers and everyone should obey her orders if you don't you die.Here's actually part of the give and take of the strong where snobby critics fail to mention. Since Joanne is a rich client obviously she can make or break Gina knowing this she abuses Gina with insults and still expects her to service her.This is like the whole master slave thing that still apparent today or at another level the division between two classes the rich and the poor who still exploit their disadvantages.Eventually Gina has to make a decision become the source of abuse for this rich white client or does she tell her to go to hell and pay the price.I really loved Queen Latifah in this movie I think a lot of these roles really shine a like as whats it like in the Urban City when you have many people seeing your poor and working hard to make a living basically beat you down and try to keep you there just because they can.Someone said Kevin Bacon was great but I thought he was crap he just played some prick of a person who like Joanne doesn't care who he hurts as long as they get what they want in the end.I am glad he gets his punishment at the endThe audience I saw this with a good mix of every culture pretty much loved the movie and I liked it too.Anyhow I give this movie a good thumbs up. 7 out of 10".

But I'm afraid I can't recommend it.First it is clear the cast and crew think the script funnier than it is that's important because it means there are going to be editing mistakes  not glaring ones like mismatched shots in intercut but mistakes in timing when the editor thinks there's a audience laugh to be allowed for with the brief take of an actor's response to a line or slowburn but the laugh doesn't arrive so the takes are just dead time dragging the film down.Which of course leads to the second problem  the film's pacing. It is very erratic. Some scenes have no buildup some have too much and end up overextended which all amounts to slow there are actually 'slow comedy' techniques Jack Benny was a master. But this is basically a sitcom without a laugh track so it needs to move at a real clip but it doesn't.Finally there's manner in which Latifah is presented. The director clearly admires her acting as much as I do but he keeps trying to emphasize it. Latifah understands that an actor only needs small gestures and expressions on film since the camera enlarges everything but the director here really tries to bring our attention to her performance so that she appears to be overacting sometimes when that is not the case  actually the camera lingers too long there are too many closeups and they are too close for the naturalistic performance Latifah is trying to accomplish.That happens to a lesser extent with all the actors all of whom are doing their best.But it's a weak script to start with and the director hasn't yet found a focus that elevates it so the acting gets pretty lost along the way.Watchable but not much more.".

	schema:headline " A meddlesome priest";
	schema:reviewBody "The tale of Thomas Becket has had many incarnations over time. T.S. Eliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral' is but the most recent acclaimed literary treatment each revisitation seems to draw new elements forth from the story. Edward Anhalt won the Oscar for best screenplay adapted from other material for this film. This film shows Henry and Thomas Becket roughly equal in age at variance from history for in this time the age difference of 15 years is practically a generational difference. Becket is shown as being a guide to Henry but less from a masterpupil standpoint as it is a clever diplomatic with a utilitarian and almost Machiavellian sense about him. Henry is presented as coarse and unrefined uneducated and in need of assistance but historically this is unlikely.Becket is played admirably by Richard Burton Henry II is portrayed by Peter O'Toole. Both were nominated for the best actor Oscar but neither won. In addition to these nominations and the best screenplay award the film was nominated for nine other Oscars running the list from costumes music directing best picture and a best supporting actor nod for John Gielgud whose cameo as the King of France is rather interestingly presented.Indeed the movie has a remarkable realistic feel to it particularly for a film from the 1960s when cinema was as likely to portray stylised and idealistic images of the past. The sets are in bare stone with a minimum of ornamentation as would have been the case in Plantagenet times likewise the ceremony around the royal person is much less grand and the church rather grand which is both accurate and serves to highlight the underlying conflict of the story in the film.Becket is portrayed as a man of ambiguous loyalties  a man of principle who has yet to find principles worthy of loyalty. Finally in the role of archbishop he finds a calling from the honour of God and in so doing is not unlikely many priests who see their path to ordination as the means of spiritual grace indeed many are disappointed that the faith does not come with the office. Whether Thomas Becket actually experienced a spiritual conversion that made him a strong champion of the church or in fact saw the power of the church as a means to an end of dominating the country we will perhaps never know.In the film Becket is often disparaged as being a Saxon this is perhaps overstated given his Norman lineage which is never hinted at in the film. While he does not come from Norman nobility he is far from being a simple Saxon. Burton's portrayal of Becket shows the change from worldly chancellor to spiritual archbishop in unsubtle terms. Even so there is an ambiguity that plays out marvelously in both his performance and the reactions of the other characters who constantly question his sincerity.O'Toole's performance is not as polished as Burton's when he plays an older wiser Henry II in 'The Lion in Winter' four years later the acting is much more dramatic and effective. It perhaps goes without saying that Pamela Brown does not make the same impression on the screen as Eleanor of Aquitaine as Katherine Hepburn does in the later film but Eleanor is an incidental character in Becket in any case.Music in this film is not a prominent feature  various trumpet and brass flourishes announce events or major scene changes in parts a lot of chant long before Gregorian chant achieved popular status accompanies church scenes  indeed I credit this film for giving me my first real taste of Gregorian chant. The scene with Sian Phillips as Becket's love Gwendolyen is accompanied by period string instruments  again Phillips is a remarkable actress who is underutilised in this performance.Done in a flashback manner there is a resolution in the film  Becket is dead made a saint honour is satisfied as the King does penance and the people are happy. We know what is going to happen but then anyone with knowledge of history would likely know the story already. In fact Henry's reign was rarely without challenge but he was always powerful and much more effective after Becket's death than before. Reigning for nearly twenty years after Becket's death he left a very powerful Western European coalition of lands that soon fell apart and embroiled England and France in war for centuries later. The tensions between church and state carry forward to this day while the specifics of the challenges faces Becket and Henry II are very different from issues today the principle of the relationship between church and state is far from definitively resolved.Also the sideline issue of class warfare and racial prejudice teased out with subtle nuance between the Normans and Saxons who ironically look exactly the same on the screen are addressed in an interesting precivil rights sort of manner. This issue is never resolved in the film as indeed it wasn't in the 1960s either.This is an intriguing film with great acting and great production values and an interesting story that even if not completely historically accurate does not alter the history so much that it becomes a parody of the subject.".

	onyx:emotionText "The tale of Thomas Becket has had many incarnations over time. T.S. Eliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral' is but the most recent acclaimed literary treatment each revisitation seems to draw new elements forth from the story. Edward Anhalt won the Oscar for best screenplay adapted from other material for this film. This film shows Henry and Thomas Becket roughly equal in age at variance from history for in this time the age difference of 15 years is practically a generational difference. Becket is shown as being a guide to Henry but less from a masterpupil standpoint as it is a clever diplomatic with a utilitarian and almost Machiavellian sense about him. Henry is presented as coarse and unrefined uneducated and in need of assistance but historically this is unlikely.Becket is played admirably by Richard Burton Henry II is portrayed by Peter O'Toole. Both were nominated for the best actor Oscar but neither won. In addition to these nominations and the best screenplay award the film was nominated for nine other Oscars running the list from costumes music directing best picture and a best supporting actor nod for John Gielgud whose cameo as the King of France is rather interestingly presented.Indeed the movie has a remarkable realistic feel to it particularly for a film from the 1960s when cinema was as likely to portray stylised and idealistic images of the past. The sets are in bare stone with a minimum of ornamentation as would have been the case in Plantagenet times likewise the ceremony around the royal person is much less grand and the church rather grand which is both accurate and serves to highlight the underlying conflict of the story in the film.Becket is portrayed as a man of ambiguous loyalties  a man of principle who has yet to find principles worthy of loyalty. Finally in the role of archbishop he finds a calling from the honour of God and in so doing is not unlikely many priests who see their path to ordination as the means of spiritual grace indeed many are disappointed that the faith does not come with the office. Whether Thomas Becket actually experienced a spiritual conversion that made him a strong champion of the church or in fact saw the power of the church as a means to an end of dominating the country we will perhaps never know.In the film Becket is often disparaged as being a Saxon this is perhaps overstated given his Norman lineage which is never hinted at in the film. While he does not come from Norman nobility he is far from being a simple Saxon. Burton's portrayal of Becket shows the change from worldly chancellor to spiritual archbishop in unsubtle terms. Even so there is an ambiguity that plays out marvelously in both his performance and the reactions of the other characters who constantly question his sincerity.O'Toole's performance is not as polished as Burton's when he plays an older wiser Henry II in 'The Lion in Winter' four years later the acting is much more dramatic and effective. It perhaps goes without saying that Pamela Brown does not make the same impression on the screen as Eleanor of Aquitaine as Katherine Hepburn does in the later film but Eleanor is an incidental character in Becket in any case.Music in this film is not a prominent feature  various trumpet and brass flourishes announce events or major scene changes in parts a lot of chant long before Gregorian chant achieved popular status accompanies church scenes  indeed I credit this film for giving me my first real taste of Gregorian chant. The scene with Sian Phillips as Becket's love Gwendolyen is accompanied by period string instruments  again Phillips is a remarkable actress who is underutilised in this performance.Done in a flashback manner there is a resolution in the film  Becket is dead made a saint honour is satisfied as the King does penance and the people are happy. We know what is going to happen but then anyone with knowledge of history would likely know the story already. In fact Henry's reign was rarely without challenge but he was always powerful and much more effective after Becket's death than before. Reigning for nearly twenty years after Becket's death he left a very powerful Western European coalition of lands that soon fell apart and embroiled England and France in war for centuries later. The tensions between church and state carry forward to this day while the specifics of the challenges faces Becket and Henry II are very different from issues today the principle of the relationship between church and state is far from definitively resolved.Also the sideline issue of class warfare and racial prejudice teased out with subtle nuance between the Normans and Saxons who ironically look exactly the same on the screen are addressed in an interesting precivil rights sort of manner.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Burton is Becket in this 1964 film starring Peter O'Toole as Henry II and John Gielgud in a small role as the King of France. King Henry creates a Frankenstein monster when he makes his best friend Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury believing this will solve all of his problems with the Church. It's a decision he lives to regret. Becket finds that he loves serving God and is in his rightful place living a life of prayer retreat and helping the poor and the needy. When he comes up against the King his response is not what Henry expects. Becket now serves another master  God.This is such a beautiful film not only the sweeping landscapes and muted colors but the stunning sometimes stark images throughout of the two men the scene on the beach toward the end in particular.Becket is a clash of two titan actors and historical figures. O'Toole and Burton so different in their acting approaches are a match made in heaven with O'Toole playing Henry as a childish selfish rogue in a very overt performance and Burton playing Becket with an internalized quiet strength and resolve. They are both magnificent. Both deserved the Oscars for which they were nominated they didn't receive them. O'Toole would go on to play Henry II again in Lion in Winter giving him an interesting place in cinematic history  he's the only actor to play the same character in two completely different films neither one of which was a sequel or prequel before you invoke the name of Al Pacino.Much is made in these films of historical inaccuracies. What makes these period movies so wonderful is whether or not you watch them knowing much of the history after you've seen them you rush to the Internet to read more. I was most interested in the homoerotic aspects of the relationship between Becket and Henry  but none was mentioned in anything I read. It was however very apparent on the screen.The '60s was really a time of these great historical dramas similar to that period later on when MerchantIvory produced their many sweeping films. In a time of Spiderman and Transformers these wonderful characterdriven films are sorely missed. This is a particularly fabulous one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Becket' is about how Archbishop Thomas Becket Richard Burton stood up to King Henry II Peter O'Toole and was eventually killed for it.  This is not interesting because Becket is the Archbishop and Henry II is the king but because they were great friends and shared a deep love for one another.This film could not have been made now forty years later.  Reason being there's no action.  That's not a complaint mind you my point is that when audiences these days go to a movie set in the middle ages they expect swashbuckling.  This is a sword and sandal epic without the swords brave enough to be an emotional epic rather than an adventurous one.The movie is still a visual feast though.  It's beautiful to look at wonderful to take in.  All the colors landscapes skies castles costumes filmed with the vibrant lifecapturing cameras of the 60s that have been unequaled since.  I usually don't care for the scenery in movies but this one isbeautiful.The movie starts with Henry II visiting the grave of Becket ready to be punished for something we have yet to know about but something that's still easy to guess.  We then flash back to when Becket was still alive mischievously playing with a young village woman with Henry II before escaping on horseback.  This scene is key in showing what little morals Henry II has and how little Becket cares about it.  Henry II and Becket are good friends Henry II talks to Becket about how much he despises all of the properness and superficiality of royal life and Becket listens nods and passes wisdom.But there is something Henry II doesn't know about Thomas Becket he's an honest man.  If he's supposed to do something he will without submitting to corruptness.  This is because he does not want to risk losing any selfrespect or dignity.  That's why when Henry II announces him Archbishop he begs for him not to.  Henry II is doing this so he can control the church but Becket will not listen to Henry II when he is carrying a title that says he listens to God before anyone.Then something unexpected happens to Becket he realizes he loves serving his Lord.  He tells the Lord he's never been happier after giving all of his wealthy possessions to the poor.  When Henry II first hears about this he is infuriated.  He wants Becket to listen to his king not his Lord.  He doesn't see the big picture that being Becket cares about his soul more than his country.  He can see it but he chooses not to because he is selfish.When an English lord kills a fugitive monk before trial Becket demands he be punished.  Henry II can't do this because he'll lose favor with the people.  Becket excommunicates the lord from the church.  This angers Henry II so much that hate sets in and he starts plotting to kill Becket who becomes a fugitive of England.  Henry II hates Becket because he thinks he's stubborn but what Henry II doesn't realize is that Becket is standing up for what he believes in.Throughout this whole story both characters are played perfectly by Burton and O'Toole neither actors ever losing their focus on their performance. O'Toole's performance is very physical he screams cries stomps around whatever room he's in like a storm.  Burton's is more inward all the acting is entirely in his face eyes mouth and voice and he conveys Becket's emotions effortlessly with these four tools.  Both men were fantastic actors two I respect very much.The rest of the cast is fair and good but not many get as much attention as Burton and O'Toole.  Of the ones that do are John Gielgud in a delightfully funny Oscar nominated role as King Louis VII of France and Martita Hunt and Pamela Brown as Henry II's nagging wife and mother.  You might call the supporting cast small but it doesn't need to be large because of Burton and O'Toole's towering performances.The film beautifully shot and emotionally acted was nominated for twelve Academy Awards winning only for its screenplay but how neither Burton nor O'Toole won I'll never know.  A film fantastic within every inch of its being 8.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Becket is one of my favorite movies. It is possibly the most underrated movie of all time and I consider it one of the top five greatest movies. It has everything for everyone and is done at such a high level too. The center point of this movie is definitely its writing.The writing by Edward Anhalt is the best I have ever seen and that is no exaggeration. Line after line I was just in awe. Every line had so much meaning and just made more and more anxious on what would happen next. It was funny witty intelligent and serious all at the same time. I have never seen such an amazing blend of so many different themes and working so greatly. This is usually how movies falter not succeed but this movie was like five movies mixed into one yet very enjoyable mostly in part of the writing. Many people like to memorize lines from the Godfather series but I believe this movie contains so much more than even the Godfather. The Godfather is more like one of those quote pamphlets with 1015 pages. Becket is not just like but really seems to be a quote book with a couple of 100 pages filled with quotes. Still this movie was not done to impress with just good lines it has a real story to it. The story was so amazingly strung together along with its amazing quotes this script seems to be absolutely perfect.The acting was at its best. Peter O'Toole gave a performance only second to his performance in Lawrence of Arabia. He displayed everything that a king has especially that of Henry II. He displayed the immaturity the constant swaying of opinion according to how he feels and at the same the stubbornness that a king has not accepting what anyone else has to say except for his close friend Thomas Becket at least for a while. He portrayed such a complex and just down right strange character. Then there is Richard Burton who was nothing short of greatness either giving one of his best performances as well. He of course plays Thomas Becket who reluctantly stands up to his friend and his king Henry II in the name of equality and for basic civil and human rights. His performance was the most inspiring performance I have seen from Richard Burton. In the movie he has surprised at his own transformation but yet proud of what he was doing because it is the right thing to do. Yet there is still more. John Gieglud gave a great supporting performance as King Louis the VII of France. He just added to the laughs and provided a much needed extra character and voice to add something a little different and gave some diversity as well. I believe he was very much overlooked for such a great performance this not too shocking though when you are playing next to Burton and O'toole. As they say in sports he was the Xfactor.The directing and editing was also add its height. The directing by Peter Glenville was just spectacular when it came to art direction and costumes to the camera shots of the castles and ceremonies all the way back around to the cinematography. I have read that nobody knows how good a movie was edited except for the editor and director. In this case you can clearly see that this movie was edited together perfectly with its great music and sound effects to stringing together all the scenes together to near perfection.It is so clear that this movie was worked on very carefully and precisely and was not made just to make money but to provide a message and a purpose. It is just a sham that this movie lost best picture to My Fair Lady in a year that had so many great movies including Zorba the Greek Dr. Strangelove FailSafe The Pawnbroker to even Mary Poppins. Yet Becket seems to have everything that undoubtedly what those great movies have in every technical aspect but most importantly in the multiple messages and themes that it has making it one of the best to have ever been conceived.".

I believe he was very much overlooked for such a great performance this not too shocking though when you are playing next to Burton and O'toole. As they say in sports he was the Xfactor.The directing and editing was also add its height. The directing by Peter Glenville was just spectacular when it came to art direction and costumes to the camera shots of the castles and ceremonies all the way back around to the cinematography. I have read that nobody knows how good a movie was edited except for the editor and director. In this case you can clearly see that this movie was edited together perfectly with its great music and sound effects to stringing together all the scenes together to near perfection.It is so clear that this movie was worked on very carefully and precisely and was not made just to make money but to provide a message and a purpose. It is just a sham that this movie lost best picture to My Fair Lady in a year that had so many great movies including Zorba the Greek Dr. Strangelove FailSafe The Pawnbroker to even Mary Poppins. Yet Becket seems to have everything that undoubtedly what those great movies have in every technical aspect but most importantly in the multiple messages and themes that it has making it one of the best to have ever been conceived.";

I agree with a comment that Burton was shafted the oscar for his performance of Becket.  It does seem at times that the Academy veers from rewarding darker complex mercurial characters in favor of anaesthitized heroic caricatures. It is one of the greatest tragedies of filmmaking that the talented are often unrewarded and forgotten.  Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole are perfect foils in this film.  The souring of their friendship makes a deeply moving story.  Historical inaccuracies I can easily forgive this is a dramatic film not a documentary and a director and screenwriter must condense lives into a believable and appealing plot. It is far better to make alterations than to have nothing such as this produced...

Becket carried out many tasks for Henry II including leading the English army into battle. After Archbishop of Canterbury dies Henry offers the post to Beckett counting on his unbending loyalty and support in religious questions. To his utmost surprise and anger Beckett openly defies Henry on the matter of clergymen found guilty of serious crimes. Henry decided that they should be handed over to his courts. Thomas Becket insisted that the church should retain control of punishing its own clergy. The king believed that Becket betrayed him and was determined to obtain revenge which he finally expressed in front of his four knights Who will rid me of this turbulent priest? It's been several days since I saw the film but I still can't and I don't think I ever will decide whose performance was more powerful and remarkable. Both O'Toole and Burton are simply outstanding and carry the film effortlessly. They both were nominated by the Academy for best leading roles. I will always remember the last Burton's words just before his Becket dies hacked with the knights' swords Poor Henry...In the last moment of his life he feels sorry for his murderer his former friend whom he loved but would not betray his principles and beliefs even for him. Another scene is also imprinted in my memory  Henry invites his family for the reunion where he is expected to name his successor. Surrounded by his closest relatives his mother his estranged wife Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine his three sons whom he never loved nor they loved him. All they want  the throne of England. All he wants  his friend Beckett next to him but he lost him to God... I'd like to add that the scene of reunion is the source of another film featuring Peter O'Toole as Henry II. In 1968 O'Toole reprised the role of Henry in The Lion in Winter where his partner was Katherine Hepburn as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. O'Toole was nominated for the Oscar for both films and lost both times.For the first time since 1964 Beckett is available on DVD with many bonus features that include Peter O'Toole's commentary two archival interviews with Richard Burton from 1967 and 1977 where he does not speak about Beckett but we learned a lot about Richard Burton the actor and the man and interviews with editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal. Nominated for 12 Academy Awards Beckett won for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should have won much more. It deserves every one of its nominations even now after all these years.".

Why is it that everything has to be razzledazzle eye candy instead of a subtle beautiful fine piece of craftsmanship and storytelling.  Becket was tough to watch because of all the grain and clicks on the neglected print.  But past all of the distortion of a neglected print I found a very remarkable and exquisite achievement that ranks among some of the best films ever made!  The craftsmanship is just the beginning!  It gets better!  Peter O'Toole who ironically played Henry II years later in A Lion in Winter does a superb job.  He's so angry volatile and above all whiny.  When I saw the Disney version on Robin Hood with Peter Ustinov playing the voice of the whiny Prince John I felt it was directly inspired by Peter O'Toole's Henry II!  He was so good at being a great whiner.  And Richard Burton as Thomas Becket looks so reserved strong and reverent as a friend of Henry II who's faith and belief in God and serving the people brings a rift in their friendship. I also felt bad that not only was this a crappy print but also that the beautiful photography seemed so small on the TV.  This is the kind of film that needs to be seen on the big screen in  order to fully appreciate it. I hope that this gets some more respect and popularity because it needs it and it has deserved it for years!".

	schema:reviewBody "Becket as originally presented on Broadway during the 19601961 season ran for 193 performances and got several Tony Awards including Best Drama for that year. Its stars were Laurence Olivier as Thomas Becket and Anthony Quinn as King Henry II of England.Though it would really have been interesting to see Olivier and Quinn in those parts on the screen no one I know has ever complained about Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole in those respective roles. They play off each other so well it's a pity they never did another joint project.The showier part is clearly Henry II who between his drinking and wenching was one of the best monarchs England ever had. His kingdom included about 35 of what is now France so that is a considerable bit of real estate. His one trusted confidante in matters of state and more personal endeavors is Thomas Becket. They are really closer than brothers.But there's quite a bit more to Richard Burton's character Becket than the king remotely suspects. O'Toole is having trouble with the Church and its head in England Archbishop of Canterbury Felix Aylmer. Seems as though they don't want to pay any taxes and the king needs money for a war with France. Burton as the king's chancellor acquits himself well in a battle of intellects with the church officials including Aylmer.Then Aylmer conveniently dies and O'Toole has the brilliant idea of making Becket a priest one day and an archbishop the next. It turns out to be a serious blunder because Becket fights for the church's prerogatives every step of the way.It's a question of perception for both men. O'Toole takes Becket's new opposition to him as a personal betrayal and Burton sees a higher duty to the Deity than his friendship with his king. When one of the local lords kills a priest in his custody the kingdom and the church split over the issue of whether clergy should be tried as anyone else if they commit a crime or are they judged by their own courts.In those days the Roman Catholic Church was at the high point of its power and influence. Some forty years later Henry's son King John got into a nasty fight with the papacy and lost and consecrated the whole kingdom over to them. The church was indeed law unto itself and insisted on that prerogative.Becket was nominated for a whole flock of Oscars including Best Actor Oscar nominations for both Burton and O'Toole and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for John Gielgud as King Louis VII of France. The only winner was Edward Anhalt for adapting Jean Anouilh's play from another medium. In fact that was quite the achievement in that several scenes were added most notably Richard Burton's scene with the Pope in Rome where he goes to plead his case. Paola Stoppa is a very sly and wily Pope Alexander III it's one of my favorite supporting roles. His part is not in the original play. Another one is Donald Wolfit who plays Bishop Folliott of London who was the betting favorite to succeed Aylmer as Archbishop of Canterbury. Wolfit is always finding that what's best for Wolfit is what's best for the church. He moves from being Aylmer's champion to a supporter of the king when he sees the opportunity for royal favor. Becket is one fine drama that holds up well today about a man who found a higher calling as he saw it and a king who was wounded to the heart at what he saw as betrayal. And ironically they're talking about the same events from different perspectives.".

	onyx:emotionText "Becket as originally presented on Broadway during the 19601961 season ran for 193 performances and got several Tony Awards including Best Drama for that year. Its stars were Laurence Olivier as Thomas Becket and Anthony Quinn as King Henry II of England.Though it would really have been interesting to see Olivier and Quinn in those parts on the screen no one I know has ever complained about Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole in those respective roles. They play off each other so well it's a pity they never did another joint project.The showier part is clearly Henry II who between his drinking and wenching was one of the best monarchs England ever had. His kingdom included about 35 of what is now France so that is a considerable bit of real estate. His one trusted confidante in matters of state and more personal endeavors is Thomas Becket. They are really closer than brothers.But there's quite a bit more to Richard Burton's character Becket than the king remotely suspects. O'Toole is having trouble with the Church and its head in England Archbishop of Canterbury Felix Aylmer. Seems as though they don't want to pay any taxes and the king needs money for a war with France. Burton as the king's chancellor acquits himself well in a battle of intellects with the church officials including Aylmer.Then Aylmer conveniently dies and O'Toole has the brilliant idea of making Becket a priest one day and an archbishop the next. It turns out to be a serious blunder because Becket fights for the church's prerogatives every step of the way.It's a question of perception for both men. O'Toole takes Becket's new opposition to him as a personal betrayal and Burton sees a higher duty to the Deity than his friendship with his king. When one of the local lords kills a priest in his custody the kingdom and the church split over the issue of whether clergy should be tried as anyone else if they commit a crime or are they judged by their own courts.In those days the Roman Catholic Church was at the high point of its power and influence. Some forty years later Henry's son King John got into a nasty fight with the papacy and lost and consecrated the whole kingdom over to them. The church was indeed law unto itself and insisted on that prerogative.Becket was nominated for a whole flock of Oscars including Best Actor Oscar nominations for both Burton and O'Toole and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for John Gielgud as King Louis VII of France. The only winner was Edward Anhalt for adapting Jean Anouilh's play from another medium. In fact that was quite the achievement in that several scenes were added most notably Richard Burton's scene with the Pope in Rome where he goes to plead his case. Paola Stoppa is a very sly and wily Pope Alexander III it's one of my favorite supporting roles. His part is not in the original play. Another one is Donald Wolfit who plays Bishop Folliott of London who was the betting favorite to succeed Aylmer as Archbishop of Canterbury. Wolfit is always finding that what's best for Wolfit is what's best for the church. He moves from being Aylmer's champion to a supporter of the king when he sees the opportunity for royal favor. Becket is one fine drama that holds up well today about a man who found a higher calling as he saw it and a king who was wounded to the heart at what he saw as betrayal. And ironically they're talking about the same events from different perspectives.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like most dramas by Jean Anouih 19101987 BECKET essentially sets two largerthanlife characters against each other in a relationship fueled by widening ideological rifts. In this instance the rift is between the holy and the secular. King Henry II of England whofrustrated by the frequent interference of the Roman Catholic Church in his rulemanages to have friend Thomas Becket appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury. He expects Becket to act on his behalfand is shocked when Becket undergoes a spiritual transformation and takes his office seriously.The 1959 play was tremendous successful throughout Europe in England and in the United States. In 1964 it reached the screen with Richard Burton as Becket Peter O'Toole as Henry II such notables as John Gielgud as Louis VII of France. The film was extremely wellreceived and received numerous critical accolades particularly for Burton and O'Toole. It was not however widely available to the home market until this 2007 MPI DVD release.In a technical sense BECKET looks better than ever the transfer is very crisp and the picture likely looks better here than it did on the 1964 big screen. At the same time however it is very evident that this is a film that really is best seen on the big screen where the larger than life characters and their ideological battles have the advantage of a scope to equal their nature. It also has a slightly stagey quality most often in the script which doesn't quite manage to shed the theatrical trappings of the original.Even so there's a great deal to admire and the leading actors are most certainly chief among them. Burton and O'Toole wench brawl argue and explode with invective with complete conviction it would be hard if not impossible to say which gives the better performance here. Gielgud is particularly memorable in his brief appearance as Louis VIIand Sian Philips Pamela Brown and Martita Hunt make the most of their relatively small roles as well.The DVD has several notable bonuses. I personally found the interviews with Richard Burton archival footage from 1967 and 1977 slightly over ratedbut the featurettes on editor Anne V. Coats and composer Laurence Rosenthal are excellent and the DVD commentary by O'Toole is consistently fascinating. I personally find the film as a whole a bit dryCoats tellingly makes the comment that if the producers had put just a bit more money into BECKET it would have an undeniable masterpiecebut fans of the film will find this particular package an extremely welcome one.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "In 12th Century England footloose and fancy free King Henry II Peter O'Toole and his best friend Lord Chancellor Thomas Becket Richard Burton are an inseparable pair of friends engaging in hunting whoring and generally enjoying their position. A showdown between Church and State and conflict in France places a pallor over their relationship however and after the perfidious Archbishop of Canterbury Felix Aylmer is disposed of Henry appoints his old friend to the position thinking he can easily control him. Unfortunately however Becket has found a cause worthy of standing up for  leading to an inevitable showdown between himself and the King.Becket is an interesting exploration of individualism and works well as a counterpart to A Man for All Seasons. Both plays show powerful English noblemen close friends with their King ultimately sacrificed finding a cause greater than friendship or power  a cause worth defending. Sir Thomas More finds solace in himself and his Catholic faith even as Henry VIII and his minions scheme to bring about his downfall. But unlike More Becket has no ingrained faith indeed the film makes a point of the fact that he is LOOKING for something honorable to hang his hat on. The sanctity of the position of Archbishop offers something giving him religious faith and an office to hold on to  it gives him something important to live up to besides himself.Like Man's Henry VIII Henry II is a young foolish man who is less interested in the matters of statecraft and religion than personal gratification. Early scenes where he meets with his advisers and bishops show him to be ignorant on matters of the state thinking that because he is king he should get his way regardless the justification or reason because well he is King. He spends much of the film's early going drinking and whoring and thinks of the challenge with the Archbishop as a minor problem that can be easily dealt with. Unfortunately Henry makes the mistake of appointing Becket  a strong man who is desiring to find himself  to a position where his strong personality will clash with Henry's weak one. Henry is an inadequate father let alone ruler and his clash with his old friend results from his hopeless naivet and inability to see right from wrong.As gorgeous as the direction cinematography and period costumessets are the film is absolutely driven by two things a highly literate script and a fabulous cast. If not for these two this would be just another goodlooking but ultimately empty costume epic of the kind churned out by Hollywood in the '50s and '60s.Becket deserves to be placed in a category with A Man for All Seasons Spartacus and the David Lean films as the thinking man's epic  a movie that despite much pageantry and scope is driven by a thoughtful literate screenplay. While historically inaccurate to the extreme the play does a good job in its depiction of our two feuding protagonists the man who is searching for self and a greater cause versus a man concerned with petty selfindulgence. The script is witty and does a good job of drawing up these characters in believable detail.The acting is borderline flawless. Richard Burton is at his stoic best as Becket the man who starts out as a philanderer much like his King but realizes there is something more to life than just being a playboy Burton owns the role of Becket much like Paul Scofield owns Sir Thomas More making his character's journey of discovery completely believable and portraying Becket as a man of dignity cut down by lesser men. Peter O'Toole should have won an Oscar for this film his portrayal of the exasperatingly selfabsorbed Henry II not really a worthy rival for Becket at all is absolutely flawless O'Toole at his best. It's not Lawrence of Arabia but it's something else entirely a man incapable of selfexamination because he is the King and must get his way for that reason. The supporting cast features the great stage actor Donald Wolfit General Murray in Lawrence of Arabia in arguably his best film role as the perfidious Bishop of London David Weston as Becket's young Saxon apprentice and O'Toole's wife Sian Phillips in a small but important part as Becket's shortlived wife. Also effective are Martita Hunt and Pamela Brown amusing as Henry's acidtongued mother and wife respectively with John Gielgud and Paolo Stoppa contributing graceful cameos more memorable than their screen time would suggest.Becket is an examination of a man who is searching for a purpose in life and when he finds it it costs him his life. History  and art  show us time and again that people find themselves only at the risk of losing everything. Perhaps if Becket had remained content with being the King's running mate or righthand man rather than subscribing to a higher calling things would have turned out better for him but then if that had been the case Thomas Becket would not have been Thomas Becket.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Wait a minute! Becket is a Saxon? Isn't that stretching literary license a bit far? It is hard to believe that modern Britain can trace its roots in part to a tribe of Vikings who first forced their way into France and then conquered England which indicated that if any group deserves dramatic treatment it's the Normans. They went all over Europe and Mideast and they were force to be reckoned with. So to make Becket a Saxon seems such a come down especially when it's not true and even a drama should not take such license. This movie would have worked well as a drama if Becket had been portrayed as a Norman which would have made the bond between he and Henry more plausible. That the Norman king would have a Saxon as his closest confidante seems a bit too much to accept and in fact it did not happen. Nevertheless this is an entertaining and wellacted movie. Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton are excellent in the principal roles. However although despite its trappings as a credible historical account of a political conflict with sexual overtones the movie is pure fiction with a story line that is hokey and contrived. The conflict that is the central theme of the plot loyalty versus integrity is unconvincing. A nobleman murders a priest and Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury demands justice and when none is forthcoming excommunicates the offender. What's the problem? Becket was doing his job but the king who is also Becket's patron and best friend and expects Becket to act the role of a stooge since it is the king who had Becket installed as Archbishop objects. Of course there was probably a lot more going on between Becket and Henry which the movie omits. The audience is asked to accept the premise that the king is so insecure that he cannot tolerate even the slightest action that can be construed or misconstrued as a challenge to his power. Now if the Becket had tried to raise an army and start a civil war then the king wanting to protect himself and his office would be understandable but no such challenge happens nor ever did happen. Becket confines his actions to that of an ecclesiastic nature which was well within the scope of his authority. That the king who is a profligate refuses to go along with Becket is unsurprising and that politics ruins what was otherwise a wonderful friendship is regrettable but what else is new? If Becket was as obnoxious as Henry then the movie may have produced some fireworks. Instead the movie presents Becket as being so passive that he cannot possibly pose a threat to anyone and as proof of his abject vulnerability even flees England for his life. Such an action does not suggest a man who is a threat nor does it make for high drama or any level of drama. The movie insinuates that perhaps Henry and Becket had a homosexual relationship but even this is treated in a halfbaked manner which further dampens the movie's dramatic impact. Probably the strongest scene is the one in which Henry's wife Eleanor who is portrayed as a whining selfindulgent shrill gives Henry a public tongue lashing which he deserved being obsessed with a man who to the rest of the court is a nobody. Richard Burton gives a strong and dignified portrayal of Becket in stark contrast to Peter O'Toole's hysterical and overthetop performance which makes the king come off as a buffoon. His fixation on Becket seems hollow and without substance more so since Becket himself is an emotional neuter who is most comfortable when he is alone and with the likes of Henry and the king's pouting wife around who could blame him?".

It is hard to believe that modern Britain can trace its roots in part to a tribe of Vikings who first forced their way into France and then conquered England which indicated that if any group deserves dramatic treatment it's the Normans. They went all over Europe and Mideast and they were force to be reckoned with.

	schema:reviewBody "spoiler so be wary you've had your warningThis film may have Burton playing the title role of Becket but it is O'Toole who shines like a supernova in one of the most challenging and complex roles in any media.  I will sound harsh when I say Rex Harrison robbed O'Toole just as harshly as Cliff Robertson robbed O'Toole out of an Oscar.  Harrison and Robertson played pleasant good nice guy characters and stole O'Toole's trophy for the two times he played a character whose morals were questionable and whose wit was as sharp as his tongue.  I hate when The Academy awards nice simple characters over complex and often unlikable characters.ps congradulations to Anthony Hopkins and Michael Douglas to rise above the Academy's sweetheart roles and win.  Why did Al Pacino never win for playing Michael Corleone why did Cuba Gooding win over Edward Norton why didn't Richard Burton win against Lee Marvin or Paul Scofield?  The answer  they were too deep too complex and especially too dark for the academy to award them and decided the characters they liked the best were going to win.  Let's remember this is a popularity contest not an actual representation of what the best really is look at Citizen Kane. Kane according to most film critics fans and film courses sits at number one of most lists while How Green Was My Valley sometimes sits outside of most lists except for AFI which is a desent list. Does anyone remember who won the Oscar over Bogart's Rick in Casablancaoff the top of their head? Not easy is it.Well back to Becket now that I got the injustice off my chest let's get to the heart of the matter.  Becket executes the transition from play to movie without missing a beat.  In fact it may be a better picture than a play.  The film opens with King Henry II doing penance for the death of the Arch Bishop Of Canterbury Thomas Becket.  Then the film shifts to a recap of the events that led to Becket's death.  The opening half hour shows the deep friendship and love that the king has for Thomas O'Toole walks that fine line of adding a level of bisexuality to his character and still having the king be a virile leader.  the bisexuality hinting hurt O'Toole's chance to walk away with Oscar for Lawrence of Arabia so maybe it hurt him here too. Burton's stoic and often placid character complements O'Toole's bombastic and passionate character to perfection.  Then the story hits the key pivot Henry fearing that he would lose power to the church makes his newly appointed Chancelor of England Thomas Becket and appoints him to become the Arch Bishop of Canterbury and as Arch Bishop Becket is torn between Church and King.  As it turns out he decides to abide by a higher power and the friendship is strained into conflict. Henry begins to hate Becket with the same intensity that he loved him and Becket still cares and respects the king but he can't do his accept the kings wishes.  Finally the conflict reaches a zenith where Becket seeks sanctuary with France's King and then with the Pope and finally meets with the king to try to reach a peace. Becket and Henry meet on horse back and speak to each other trying to recapture their friendship and try to find a happy medium which is not possible.  Throughout this scene the King mentions the cold often which represents death.  After they depart knowing that their friendship although exists and the king's love for Becket exists it only exists like a sunken ship that is at the bottom of the sea that can't be salvaged even though everyone knows the ship is there.  Then at a private dinner the king has with his most loyal guards O'Toole delivers the finest few moments of acting I've seen  drunken and filled with emotions of hate love fear power insecurity anger and depression he speaks to his men about their loyalty and their courseness all really representing his respect for Becket he exclaimsWon't someone rid me of this meddlesome priest and his men leave to kill Becket.  Before the scene is over Henry instantly becomes remorseful for sending the messengers of death to Thomas and the king mentions that he says Forgive me Thomas my quote may not be what is said in the film but does get the meaning across Thomas is then killed and his finals words are Henry what have you done in a sad and forgiving manner.  Then the film flashes back to the king serving his penance and then giving a public apology.This film strikes perfectly what movies should do and is amongst the superior although nearly forgotten movies and it is a shame that a film with complex characters and crisp direction writing and execution does not win best picture and inferior films and performances do.  This is why all the Titanic's and My Fair Lady's of this world don't impress me because deep and intricate films don't usually win over the popular and less intellectually stimulating films.  Oh well I'll rant and rave on another good movie that didn't get it's dues.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1963 I went to the theater in Buenos Aires to see the magnificent play of Jean Anouilh Becket or the honor of God. I loved it very much.  In fact I saw it thrice within a couple of months. But nevertheless I felt disappointed with the outcome of the portrait of King Henry II performed by Lautaro Murua the best actor in Argentina  actually he was born in Chile  in the last fifty years. It was not because the performance was bad.  It was excellent.  But Murua only could transmit the coarse side of Henrys personality not his noble side.  He did not have the physique du role. I must say that I liked his performance very much more than Duilio Marzios characterization of Thomas Becket.  Marzio is not a bad actor but representing Becket is a very difficult task as we should see later. After my third view of the play I guessed it might come soon as a movie. Who should be King Henry was my first wonder.  Immediately I choose for myself a young actor who played the main role in David Leans Lawrence of Arabia and just have acted in a minor film namely Lord Jim.I was delighted when before a year later the film was released precisely with Peter OToole in the role of the King.  The version was excellent though again I had to complain about the characterization of Tomas Becket this time by Richard Burton.  I think it was the only Burtons poor performance throughout his remarkable career. The fact is that Anouilhs Thomas Becket is an intellectual youngster full of mannerisms intending to be a cynical play boy and a smart chancellor at the same time and later he has to become an energic and virtuous archbishop. The script leads dangerously to fall either into an overacting and almost effeminate characterization Marzio or to inexpressive acting Burton in order to avoid it. I must say that my choice for Thomas Becket was the American actor George Peppard but I was not very sure about it mainly because Peppard was not British.  Nevertheless I dont think that his characterization would have been very much better than the one Richard Burton finally performed. Even today I wonder if there is an actor capable of showing the exact personality of this particular Thomas Becket.  Perhaps Daniel DayLewis as he is so versatile but Im not quite sure. Instead Peter OTooles  characterization was really outstanding.  His performance was so good as in Lawrence and later on in Good bye Mr. Chips and again as King Henry II in Lion in winter.  And he was noble and coarse at the same time.  Wonderful choice! Another comment I want to add is that  as far as I know  Becket has not been seen again in Argentina since 1964 nor in TV nor in videos.  I can hardly imagine that there does not exist a video of this excellent and valuable film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is everything that reminds me why I love movies. I came across it unwittingly as I stood outside a remote movie hall in New York and was drawn to its English title Just Another Love Story. One glance at the poster told me it was anything but that. A man stands with a gun drawn over a dead man in a pool of blood. Time wasn't wasted. Tickets were bought. Seats occupied.The movie begins like promised with a series of numbered love scenes. Except that it was hardly love. It begins with the protagonist's narrative of how it all ends and then we are thrown into his life abruptly as we come in terms with the brutality of what he does boring mundaneness of how he lives and how he is suddenly unwittingly drawn into a passionate love an exotic fantasy and a forbidden life that he claims as his own.And as we follow him through a sensory overload of events we are both repulsed and strangely attracted to his actions. The guilty pleasure of enjoying something really despicable. There is always a woman the protagonist says and there is one here. One we are as much mesmerized with as is the protagonist. Cleverly written the characters often dwell in the intricacies of metafiction. A woman and a mystery are the ideal ingredients of a movie one of the characters says sarcastically. A good shot says the protagonist in another scene which is a classic film noir shot if any ever is. The background score is brilliant alternating between a slow haunting acoustic guitar to a symphony of sorts as we move through the protagonist's life. The script is fresh and pulsating with energy as we laugh one second and are repulsed the very next. If a movie can make you grimace laugh and bite you nails with apprehension and wonder at the intelligent sharp exchange of dialog it is one that has managed to make its mark. This particular movie has surpassed the mark. Acting by the lead characters is ace. The confrontation scene between the protagonist and his opposite number is fletched out stunningly. Fragments of each life are shown to you and as you put everything together and move towards what is a stunning climax you realize somewhat surprised that this movie is exactly what it promised to be.Just another love story.".

It was like an exceptionally twisted version of the romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping. I loved the blueandgreen cinematography as a backdrop for such a black plot which by the way I thought was entirely coherent and interesting. The filmmaker definitely took some risks you wouldn't see in a Hollywood film but I thought they payed off. The overlay of simultaneous action images was aesthetically pleasing and allowed forward action to continue while giving clues into the character's mysterious past. I think what really made the film for me though was the concept of the basic human and especially American need for MORE. No matter how perfect a life may seem it is never really enough. Trying not to spoil the plot there are some actions that would normally make the character seem like a jerk but he is still very easy to sympathize with because we all have the same driving desire for satisfaction. I think the original Danish reviews had it right. While some of the violence and nudity may not be completely vital to the plot it all adds up to a great modernday film noir.".

	schema:reviewBody "Right from the outset the ironicallytitled 'Just Another Love Story' demands a nifty bit of doublethink from its audience try and suspend your disbelief for the next 90plus minutes  but don't believe anything you see. Above all never forget this is only a movie. There may well be some deeper truths embedded in the narrative but for now we'll assume this stuff is shallower than the puddles pooling around the body of our fall guy whose departing soul a la 'Sunset Blvd''s Joe Gillis is commenting on its broken vessel bleeding to death on the sidewalk. In a moment they'll bring white tape to mark out my profile. And here's a woman flapping over him and weeping hysterically as the rain cascades through the gutters in black rivulets. A body a dame assassins as yet unknown and lousy weather yes it's a film noir alright. Pencils ready? We're about to tick off some more boxes.With all the frenzy of The Muppets' Swedish Chef director Bornedal juggles noirish ingredients  the dupe the femme fatale the mysterious suitcase  and stirs them into a boiling black stew of obsession murder and stolen identities. The principals whose trajectories will collide figuratively and literally on a Copenhagen motorway are Jonas a crime scene photographer listlessly married with children and suffering the usual existential crises and Julia the beautiful but damaged daughter of a megabucks publisher initially glimpsed hiding out from Triads in a seedy Hanoi hotel and engaged in a fevered spot of gunplay with her psychotic lover. Jonas clearly requires a femme fatale to really help screw up his life and right on cue the distraught Julia on the run in Denmark clips his stalled car crashes and slips into a coma.When Jonas shows up at the hospital Julia's parents mistake him for Sebastian the dodgy boyfriend they've never met. And with the knowledge gleaned from Interpol that Sebastian has been shot point blank in Vietnam a bewitched Jonas draws back the screens of opportunity and assumes the 'dead' man's identity waking the seminaked Julia with a fairytale kiss  and more the patient has become pregnant.Blinded and amnesiac she initially buys Jonas's deception but memories begin seeping through of violent encounters with Sebastian in Southeast Asia. What really happened out there? Who's the figure in the wheelchair haunting the hospital corridors with a bandaged face like Claude Rains in 'The Invisible Man'? Can dead boyfriends come back blown in like an ill wind from the East? Or is Jonas going insane through the pressure of maintaining a double life? This can't end well.A beautiful woman and a mystery muses Jonas Isn't that how all film noirs begin? The metafictive Just Another Love Story which often resembles a Danish Dennis Potter with its hospitals and obsessions doesn't so much wear its influences heavily as constantly barrack you with nods winks and a dig in the ribs. And if this were merely some playful postmodern exercise featuring striking visuals lurid fullfrontals and Bornedal's trademark mortuary humour we'd probably still buy it. But there's a bit more to this than just a lot of reflexive razzamatazz.The story deals in dualities dual identities dual lives  and that duality extend to the film's technique and tone. Bornedal masterfully folds visual and aural elements from one scene into another to suggest memories innerlives and otherlives. In one passage Jonas denies having an affair to his wife but the scene is soundtracked by the fluttering cries of his and Julia's lovemaking. A cute trick sure but the film never allows its considerable style to swamp stuff like character or heart. Though hardly Dogme it nevertheless keeps one boot mired in sober reality eliciting some authentically heartbreaking performances Charlotte Fich in particular is superb as the cheated Mette struggling to comprehend how her husband has managed to slip clean away from her.A scene in which Jonas' midlife crisis culminates in the middle of the family's weekly shopping run is both appallingly sad  and bravura direction. Is this a good place for it? demands Mette barely keeping a lid on her mounting panic as Jonas signals his split. No place is good replies Jonas truthfully as their row spills out into the supermarket car park. Meanwhile of all of this is intercut with shots of Jonas whisking his new bride to her father's country mansion while the presiding soundtrack of Vivaldi's ebullient 'Spring' from 'The Four Seasons' provides a perfectly corny accompaniment to one scene  and an ironic counterpoint to the other. Rebirth is painful indeed.As with Dennis Potter's 'The Singing Detective' this is a film about real people with real middleaged problems  who just happen to have found themselves locked in the contrivance of a film noir. Its selfconscious roleplaying nature also starts to make sense with the discovery that this is something of a cathartic exercise for the director  a way of publicly working through his guilt following his own admitted marital infidelity. I left my family but not my children says Bornedal. It is not an ideal situation  it is however better than marriages without love. In other words 'Jonas  c'est moi'. In the hands of another director one with less integrity this might have sported a ludicrously upbeat punchline an attempt to coverup through fiction. The fantasy of some Hollywood fat cat excusing his tawdry affairs with a ripping tale of dangerous dames. But it's Bornedal's movie and his penance is in plain sight. He wants us to see it  needs us to see it. It is why he has chosen film noir to beat himself up with. In film noir that most moralistic of genres infidelity does not go unpunished. The film is also a reminder to us whether single in a relationship or looking for an escape route that love exists as much in the imagination as in the heart.".

This alternates a highly realistic acting with a layered and deliberately constructed structure to make for an aesthetic experience as well as a narrative one.The plot is involved and is too easily given away but the meat of it is that a well meaning likable guy finds that an opportunity to become someone else comes along and it is too tempting to pass up.

It all begins when his car stalls and the car behind him swerves and gets into an accident of its own.

The intensity of what follows and the way the actors make it believable is stunning. In the simplest form of a recommendation I would say see this film. It's different without being affected. It's honest and realistic without becoming reality. It moves and intrigues all the way through.A Danish film set mostly in Copenhagen Just Another Love Story is not just another love story a bit.

Like many angstridden men of his age he wants more. Well along comes distraught Julia Rebecca Hemse who inadvertently smashes her car into the rear of his with wife and kids onboard what a technical triumph that smashup was!.

Jonah while visiting her is mistaken for Sebastian Nikolaj Lie Kaas Julia's fiance from Hanoi. Quick as a flash Jonah dives into the deception because now  stupid sap  he thinks he's in love...If you can accept a venture of that magnitude by an otherwise intelligent cop and father of two cute kiddies then accept what follows as a clever take perhaps even inversion on the traditional femme fatale scenario. Sure you already know he's dying but  who fired the shots? The answer as in all excellent film noir comes only in the few seconds that precede that deliciously dark opener. Before you get there though the plot has enough false trails macabre cop humor and misdirection for you to keep you glued to your seat. Moreover like all good narratives nothing is ever as it seems. In that regard I'm reminded of the murder of luckless Lester Kevin Spacey in American Beauty 1999 ironically gunned down in his house blissfully unaware of who did it and why.Technically the structure of the story and photography is brilliant with the first twenty minutes giving the viewer a series of scenes and dialog in a seemingly discordant sequence. As the plot continues the editing of sound and picture then assumes an ironic register and tone as the dialog from one scene might play over a scene that opposes or deconstructs the other. It's a narrative technique that's quite effective and best of all it's not overdone. You'll know it when you see it.The acting and direction are superb no question. The special effects during fight scenes grittily and graphically hit this viewer between the eyes. Moreover I think the editing displayed true mastery of narrative flow and cohesion. And the music score fits like a glove. Overall this is one of the most satisfying and entertaining efforts in this genre for many years. But is it believable? Well given the propensity for most of humanity to do stupid things for love I'd say that's a nobrainer.Recommendation  run to your video store and get it. Nine out of ten nobody ever gets ten from me.December 4 2013".

And soon the movie turns out as a thriller in the Hitchcock's and Coen Brothers' traditions with the main character taking the sudden choices in order to run from the stalled relationship that lost its initial appeal from unfulfilling job from life that leads nowhere to a romantic passionate love and exciting new possibilities.Derivative  that's the word that majority of naysayers use when commenting on this film. But its writerdirector Ole Bornedal does not hide throughout the picture that he has made a noir film or rather Neonoir Danish style that characterizes by postmodernist selfreflection and consciously refers to the works of past and present. There are all ingredients here you would expect in a noir film twists turns wrong or questionable choices the main character takes and where they would lead him. There are mysterious young woman with a dark past and a sinister stranger in bandages gloomy deserted landscapes and long corridors with flickering neon lights. The scenes of killings and beatings are rather cruel and violent erotic encounters  explicit and the ending is thousands miles away from a Hollywood happy ending. But for Ole Bornedal the creator of Just Another Love Story the most important message that he wanted to convey to the audience was that everybody carries a dream and the need for a selffulfillment in life  that life very rarely offers. His dark violent moody noir reflects on the wishes fantasies desires that seem have been lost as time goes on but never disappear and only wait patiently for a sudden spark to ignite them and to start unquenchable allconsuming disastrous flames.The film is over the top in its second part but by that time you have been already so involved in the story and glued to the screen that you are willing to forgive whatever problems and deep holes the plot has and how many films and books Just Another Love Story freely refers to. It could be described as Talk to Her While She Was Sleeping but remember not to mess with the Chinese Triads because this is No Country for Old Men. Ole Bornedal's neonoir also brings to memory the mystery novels by French writers the duo Boileau Narcejac and Sbastien Japrisot. The former are the authors of the novels Les Diaboliques and Vertigo. Before they became the classics of cinema they had been and still are highly popular books. Trap for Cinderella by Sbastien Japrisot tells about a young woman who has lost her identity due to amnesia in the fatal fire accident and does not remember anything that led to the disaster including the truth about being a murderer or a victim or both. The common feature of all mentioned novels and their screen adaptations is assuming somebody else's personality. But No man is an Island entire of itself every man is a piece of the Continent a part of the main. And giving up your identity pretending to be someone else thus accepting their connections with this world however mysterious sinister dangerous those connections may be inevitably leads to the devastating results. It is just a guess whether Bornedal is familiar with these books but the theme of Identity is the most prominent in his film which is a riveting thriller an impossible lovestory a social commentary on the middleaged angst as much as a philosophical meditation on the possibilityimpossibility to live someone else's life and accepting your own.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seemed like a good idea at the time. I wish I had a dollar for every occasion when that thought has crossed someone's mind. But first some background. Is modern life in an affluent European country with its taxpayerfunded health education and welfare rather too comfortable rather too safe rather too unchallenging rather too dull for some individuals? Our ancient ancestors developed genes for taking risks sometimes awful risks simply to survive. Julia Castlund daughter of a wealthy publisher ought to be able to settle down to a life of fulfilment and contentment in modern enlightened Denmark  but no she's a fidgety rebellious risktaker with a history of perilously unsuitable boyfriends. The latest news her family has had from her is that she's roaming round the Far East  Cambodia or Vietnam or somewhere  and her current love interest is a Dane she's met out there called Sebastian no details as to what he does for a living.Meanwhile in the heavily mortgaged suburbs Jonas lives in a comfortable home with his nice wife and two lovely children. He has a steady job not very well paid as a crimescene photographer for the police. Jonas wouldn't do anything irrational or impulsive  would he? If there's one thing he's learned in this job it's that horrific outcomes sometimes occur when people make impulsive choices perhaps quite trivial choices. And one of the reasons why bodies end up on a slab in the morgue is love gone wrong  be warned. There's a sharp disconnect between Jonas's agreeable domestic life and the ghastly events he has to photograph mutilated bodies murdered children etc.If Jonas is going to keep this family car he really ought to spend some serious money on it  it's been giving a lot of trouble. On a busy road it conks out and he can't get it started again. A preoccupied driver going fairly fast swerves to avoid this obstacle and collides with a vehicle coming the other way. The driver is Julia. What's she doing back in Denmark? Now she's in intensive care. Jonas feels responsible guilty. He goes to the hospital but he's not allowed to see her because he's not family. She's in a coma and several family members are gathered around her bed. Jonas has a bright idea. He gains entry to the room by pretending to be Sebastian it seems like a good plan at the time. The family are delighted to see him  partly because he looks like a normal sort of guy and not one of the weirdos that Julia usually dates. Talk to her Sebastian. See if you can get her to wake up. And she does wake up sort of with amnesia and seriously impaired eyesight her face hacked about by broken glass and with tubes stuck in her orifices. And Jonas falls in love...He does what? You make one silly little mistake and your whole life has to spin out of control? Apparently so. Jonas obtains this suitcase that Julia had in her car. A police colleague tells him about an Interpol notification it looks like Sebastian was shot and killed in Hanoi  but why? Some bad guys were after him? The title Just Another Love Story is ironic. It's more than a love story it's more than one love story and at least one of its love stories is decidedly unusual. On the other side of the coinage of love is death nightmare a journey to the underworld a ride to that slab in the morgue. It's not clear that anything is going to be inevitable  until it happens. And then you can see the inevitability. For the alert viewer there are some nice Now I understand moments and some nice Ah that's what must have happened moments you may have the opportunity to see this movie twice. All this and more  much more. Altogether a thoroughly satisfying film.".

There's a sharp disconnect between Jonas's agreeable domestic life and the ghastly events he has to photograph mutilated bodies murdered children etc.If Jonas is going to keep this family car he really ought to spend some serious money on it  it's been giving a lot of trouble. On a busy road it conks out and he can't get it started again. A preoccupied driver going fairly fast swerves to avoid this obstacle and collides with a vehicle coming the other way. The driver is Julia. What's she doing back in Denmark? Now she's in intensive care. Jonas feels responsible guilty. He goes to the hospital but he's not allowed to see her because he's not family. She's in a coma and several family members are gathered around her bed. Jonas has a bright idea. He gains entry to the room by pretending to be Sebastian it seems like a good plan at the time. The family are delighted to see him  partly because he looks like a normal sort of guy and not one of the weirdos that Julia usually dates. Talk to her Sebastian. See if you can get her to wake up. And she does wake up sort of with amnesia and seriously impaired eyesight her face hacked about by broken glass and with tubes stuck in her orifices. And Jonas falls in love...He does what? You make one silly little mistake and your whole life has to spin out of control? Apparently so. Jonas obtains this suitcase that Julia had in her car. A police colleague tells him about an Interpol notification it looks like Sebastian was shot and killed in Hanoi  but why? Some bad guys were after him? The title Just Another Love Story is ironic. It's more than a love story it's more than one love story and at least one of its love stories is decidedly unusual. On the other side of the coinage of love is death nightmare a journey to the underworld a ride to that slab in the morgue. It's not clear that anything is going to be inevitable  until it happens. And then you can see the inevitability. For the alert viewer there are some nice Now I understand moments and some nice Ah that's what must have happened moments you may have the opportunity to see this movie twice. All this and more  much more. Altogether a thoroughly satisfying film.";

Jonas plays along and the drama is stretched when Julia awakes from her coma conveniently blind and afflicted with amnesia. Julia the impressive Rebecka Hemse starts to remember a lessthanrosy side to the affair with Sebastian...The strengths of the film are the acting by the main players and the alltoohuman interaction between them. When Jonas confesses to his friend that he has fallen for Julia his friend in a quite startling moment asks if he can have Jonas' wife. When Sebastian does finally show up a quite chilling dinner scene enfolds.The thriller elements are where the film is weakest with far too many of the plot devices forced through. Sebastian Nikolaj Lie Kaas clearly channeling Billy Zane in Dead Calm stalks the hospital in a wheelchair and bandages looking like an extra from The Mummy. The disguise is elaborate to say the least considering the people he is hiding from do not know what he looks like. At a quite crucial moment when Sebastian is at his most threatening Anders inexplicably opts to go for a drive leaving Julia alone with her own personal monster. It is a clunky set up for Anders to make a horrific discovery in the boot of the car and Sebastian to begin the final phase of his plan for Julia.But while the thriller element is less than convincing there is a wonderfully observed nuanced romance here. Not Anders and Julia but Anders and his wife Mette. Charlotte Fich is superb as the discarded spouse. The moment when Anders comes clean during a supermarket excursion is a delicious mix of comedy and tragedy. The film's overelaborate opening setup is some what ameliorated by ending on the failed marriage storyline. Anders strays Anders comes home Anders gets his comeuppance. That simple thread alone makes this film worth watching.".

So when Saul eventually learns that Eliza is participating and excelling in spelling bees she becomes the focus of his life as he believes that letters in the form of words will lead to answers to the universe.

	schema:reviewBody "In Bee Season a film by Scott McGehee and David Siegel a suburban Oakland family discovers meaning and purpose in the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam translated as repairing the world. Adapted by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal Running on Empty from the novel by Myla Goldberg the film explores the subject of Jewish mysticism and its effect on a dysfunctional family. Relying on the teachings of Isaac Luria a 16th century Jewish Kabbalist Berkeley Professor Saul Naumann Richard Gere instructs his students that God created the world by forming vessels of light but as He poured the light into the vessels they shattered and became countless shards. Thus humanity's task is to free and reunite the scattered Light and restore the broken world. Naumann is an intellectual who reaches out to God but cannot connect with his family and they mirror the broken shards rather than the Divine Light. Saul is close to his musically gifted son Aaron Max Minghella with whom he shares a love of music but ignores his 11year old daughter Eliza Flora Cross until her talent for spelling is recognized and she wins local and regional spelling bees. He takes advantage of the opportunity to become closer to her by training her for the national championship and encouraging her to explore the mystical states that he only relates to conceptually. He sees in Eliza the potential to put into practice the teachings of the Kabbalah scholar Abulafia that enlightenment can be achieved through alignment of letters and words. He tells her that many cultures believe that letters are an expression of a special powerful energy that when they combine to make words they hold all the secrets of the universe. Yet as Eliza and her father delve further into their studies they forget to look around and see that the people around them are in trouble. Aaron rejects his father's teachings and turns to Hinduism at the encouragement of a young woman named Chali Kate Bosworth. He pretends to go on a weekend camping trip but instead dons orange robes and spends the time at a retreat for Hare Krishna followers much to his father's displeasure. Unfortunately the story treats his decision to explore a different faith as an adolescent lark rather than a legitimate spiritual quest and we never discover his true reasons for his interest. Meanwhile Saul's wife Miriam Juliette Binoche has flashbacks of a car accident that killed her parents. She takes the phrase Tikkun Olam  to repair the world  literally and steals small glittering objects from people's homes in order to reconstruct the world but her own world begins to spiral downward. The subplots are not well developed however and the characters' behavior is insufficiently motivated to be plausible. The heart of the film lies in the transformation that is taking place within Eliza dramatized in the spelling bee competitions. Although she has never seen or heard of a particular word before she is able to visualize it in different ways by concentrating with her eyes closed depicted on screen by clever special effects. We follow the gifted speller as she moves through one competition after another and marvel at how she is able to remain centered while the world around her is crumbling. The acting is credible and Cross is a promising newcomer but Gere emotes too much personal warmth and star quality to be fully convincing as a selfcentered emotionally detached Jewish scholar. Bee Season has a potent message in so far as it celebrates an individual's use of personal power to alter their experience of reality. The filmmakers however fail to clarify what the film is trying to say. Various threads compete for attention Eliza's personal experiences of God Saul's Kabbalistic teachings Aaron's turn to Eastern religion and Miriam's sickness but none are sufficiently developed to make a coherent statement. Even the ending that is supposed to bring some resolution leaves us scratching our heads. Bee Season is a wellintentioned film that tackles an important subject but ultimately fails to fully explore the depth of its characters or the true meaning of its message and I found its suggestion that a family can love God but not each other to be incongruous.".

It appears to be a Kabbalistic approach to healing shattered reality put together as a parable.I know very little about Kabbalism so that may be why so many pieces were nonsensical to me. Some things however were clear on reflection. Eliza's choice at the end was a redemptive sacrifice. It was a way of turning Saul's obsession back upon itself so he when he was brought up short by the apparent disaster would be accessible once again to his family. The final implications are that she is successful in this and happy with her choice. Eliza also connects with her mother through the camera and apparently starts her back on the road to healing.There are some very nice uses of glass and kaleidoscope imagery as metaphors of shattered personality and lives particularly for the mother but for all the characters to some extent.All of that makes sense but as a whole it just doesn't work. The mother has apparently been in a psychotic break for many years and no one noticed? The son who seems to have a close relationship with both his father and his sister responds to the father's extra time with Eliza for the bee with petulant jealousy and finally runs off to join the Hari Krishnas without any indication of why he is searching or why the traditions of his family do not work for him. His motivation seems to be nothing more than an exceedingly pretty face.The daughter Eliza is the hardest one to believe of all  even though she is masterfully represented. In an unusual form of Deus Ex Machina she restores the shattered family by having paranormal abilities and then denying those abilities as a sacrifice to redeem the ones she loves. I suspect this is part of Kabbalistic mysticism but I don't know. In one spoken letter she brings sanity back to her shattered family reeling in all the fragmented pieces just as her father had described and her mother had tried and failed to do. It's a nice idea for a parable but I found the final answer too pat the mystical portions glossing over frightful danger and the pain of the family both believably intense yet unbelievably represented and I could not believe the solution.Maybe it is because my own spiritual views are vastly different from the writers but it was painful to watch and neither satisfying nor helpful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since I have not read the novel upon which Bee Season is based I  cannot evaluate the film's interpretation of the book. It seems  however that there is more occurring within the characters of this  story that is not stated or developed within the screenplay. And  unfortunately more needed to be conveyed and developed in order for  this film to affect the audience in a useful way.  Plot Summary The film is about an intellectual dynamic family. Eliza  Flora Cross enters a school spelling bee wins and soon realizes she  has the ability to visualize words and their correct spelling. She says  she feels and sees the word talking to her. Her father Saul Naumann  Richard Gere a professor of Judaic Mysticism at a San Francisco  university later decides that Eliza has the unique ability to speak to  God. He becomes preoccupied with nurturing and developing this gift  within his daughter and in the process falls out of touch with his son  Aaron Max Minghella who becomes disillusioned with his faith in  Judaism and rebels against the influences of his father. Aaron begins  studying Buddhism after meeting a female romantic interest who is  sympathetic to his expressed feelings of emptiness and detachment.  Saul's Wife Miriam Juliette Binoche struggles with her own  detachment from reality as she continues to mourn the death of her  parents who died in an accident when she was young girl.  My Analysis Like some of the characters in the film I too left the  film somewhat empty or unfulfilled. I wanted to know more about what  was going on with this family. The relationship between Gere's  character and his son is somewhat familiar  a son rebels against a  father who is too strongly pushing his faith and interests. This form  of rebellion seems typical of most adolescents. The mother and daughter  share the unusual relationship both of whom seem to possess certain  supernatural powers. While it is the daughter's power to visualize and  spell that is the focal point of the film it may well be a similar  ability that drives her mother to mental illness. The relationship  between them should have been developed more however.  I wanted to know what the mysticalsupernatural ability meant but the  screenplay doesn't explain much and this is frustrating. In addition  when it becomes apparent that Miriam is suffering from a severe mental  disorder and continues to mourn the death of her parents I questioned  why her husband was so utterly unaware of her suffering as it had been  going on for some time. He was an intelligent man who had great concern  for the welfare of his family and it didn't seem to fit his character.  The film might merely be about a domineering father and the influence  his beliefs have over his family. But I'm hoping it's more than that.  The story goes to pains to make it clear that there is a very real  supernatural element at work here but the film doesn't do enough to  convey what this means and why it's important. I appreciate movies that  are efficient that don't hold my hand through everything and that give  me credit for making inferences to tie a storyline together or even  leave the story purposely ambiguous so as to allow for interpretation  but in the case of the Bee Season the subject matter is too abstruse  and the story is too underdeveloped. I could not reach a satisfactory  understanding of what occurred and why it was important.  The acting was strong however. Binoche Gere and company make the best  of an underdeveloped script. The quality of the acting makes the  problems with the script even more frustrating because it seems like  this film could have been much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is a novel that doesn't lend itself for cinematic adaptation Bee Season written by Myla Goldberg would seem to be the one. It doesn't help that the screen play as written by the talented Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal doesn't help to clarify for the casual viewer what is going on with the Naumanns of Oakland. In fact the problem in the novel as well as with the movie is Miriam the distant mother who has fled reality and lives in a world of her own.Bee Season codirected by Scott McGehee and David Siegel feels empty because the somber treatment they have given to the movie. The dark cinematography of Giles Nuttgens doesn't help either but the musical scores of Peter Nasher works well as a whole.One enters the Naumann world through the sensitive Eliza a girl much older and wiser than her 11 years indicate.

	onyx:emotionText "If there is a novel that doesn't lend itself for cinematic adaptation Bee Season written by Myla Goldberg would seem to be the one. It doesn't help that the screen play as written by the talented Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal doesn't help to clarify for the casual viewer what is going on with the Naumanns of Oakland. In fact the problem in the novel as well as with the movie is Miriam the distant mother who has fled reality and lives in a world of her own.Bee Season codirected by Scott McGehee and David Siegel feels empty because the somber treatment they have given to the movie. The dark cinematography of Giles Nuttgens doesn't help either but the musical scores of Peter Nasher works well as a whole.One enters the Naumann world through the sensitive Eliza a girl much older and wiser than her 11 years indicate. It is Eliza who senses all that is wrong with her family as it appears they are falling apart in front of her and as a little girl she simply can't do anything at all to bring everyone together.

	schema:reviewBody "BEE SEASON is a strange little film that seems to polarize the public. Though many have dismissed it as fragmentary and superficial taking the time to bear down on the issues merely touched upon yields an emotional as well as spiritual experience not often found in films. With a cast that includes Juliette Binouche and Richard Gere there should be a hint there may be more to the film than a quick glance might reveal.Based on the highly successful novel by Myla Goldberg the story enters the household of a family of four Saul Richard Gere is the father who is a professor of spiritual studies Miriam Juliette Binouche is the mother suffering with demons from her past loss of her parents as a child leading her to grow without an intact family Eliza Flora Cross is the daughter who seems content to watch TV instead of paying attention to her schooling and Aaron Max Minghella is the son who excels at playing the cello and who is the focus of his father's life. When it is discovered that Eliza has a penchant for spelling and wins a spelling bee the focus of this family abruptly changes. Suddenly Saul moves his attention to Eliza convinced that she has the power of the influx of Godknowledge shefa described by the Kabbalist Abraham Abulafia. This leads to his prepping her for her constant victories at spelling bees but it also leaves Aaron without focus and he responds by seeking first Christianity then Hare Krishna for the meaning of his life. At the same time Miriam becomes more isolated and secretive and enters a state of depression that reflects her childhood loss and the need to accumulate 'things' in a number of ways that border on mental breakdown.The film is best viewed by the way by first watching the featurette about the reasons for the making of the film  a wise commentary that gives us enough philosophical background to appreciate the message of the story that seemingly has eluded directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel. Watching the explanation of how religions all act to provide frameworks that should help individuals to piece together the fragments of existence that have been given to us as our lives serves to bring into focus how each of the four characters in this story is each on that journey for meaning. Once viewed this featurette makes the movie far more meaningful and enjoyable.The screenplay by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal yes the mother of Maggie and Jake is minimalist in technique of writing giving just enough information about the big questions to make us work to paste the story together. The cinematography by Giles Nuttgens and special effects by Sean House are used extraordinarily well to underline the mysticism that permeates the film's story. Peter Nashel's musical score accompanies the otherworldly atmosphere that helps to bring the audience into the mood of the film.This may not be a great film but it is a unique one that calls upon the audience to think and freeassociate with the characters each of whom is well enacted by a strong cast. Well worth viewing. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I know most people don't give this movie a very good review and that's unfortunate. It is a very deep movie and the viewer is made to think. It's not the kind of movie where everything falls into place and everything ends up happily ever after. If that is the kind of movie you like then this one is not for you. If you like a movie that is deep and has a very serious story line then this is the one.I will try to put this in as simple terms possible the story is mostly based around Saul Naumann the father Richard Gere and his daughter Eliza Flora Cross both superbly acted by the way. Saul is a professor on the Jewish Religion and he very much wants to get closer to God but is unable to. Saul is a very domineering husband and father very selfcentered so is unable to see the problems that are dividing the family or maybe he sees it and doesn't want to admit it.When his daughter begins to win at spelling bees he thinks that somehow Eliza is linked with God and that is how she sees the word and can spell it correctly. He begins teaching her like she was one of his students by using the thesis he wrote to become a professor. In this thesis it lays out the plan to get closer to God he tried it for himself but couldn't so he decides to try it on his daughter.Saul's wife Miriam Juliette Binoche has many problems stemming back from the time her parents were killed in an auto accident when she was a young girl. I'm not going to go into specifics here but if you pay close attention to the scene where he is talking to his class you will understand how this is linked to Miriam's problem and how she has decided to solve it. Also pay attention to the scenes where I'm assuming they were fist married flash backs and he is explaining to Miriam the same thing he has been talking about with his class in that scene I mentioned. Because Saul is so domineering and selfcentered he doesn't realize that she even has a problem until it all explodes and he finally becomes aware of what she is doing. Miriam tries to explain to Saul why she did what she did and if you listen closely to what she says you will understand.The son Aaron Max Minghella has a good relationship with his father and is shown a lot of attention by him until Saul begins to spend more and more time with Eliza. I think Aaron may be a little jealous of Eliza because she is now getting all the attention but I don't think that is his real problem. I think he also wants to get closer to God and is not sure how so begins exploring other avenues other religions. He becomes involved with another religion and feels this may be what he has been looking for. When Saul finds this out all hell breaks loose and he finally realizes that the whole family has many problems.Meanwhile Eliza thinks she is the reason for all that is happened and tries to converse with God to correct it. By this time Saul is convinced that God is interacting with Eliza when they go to the final spelling bee The Nationals.This is just a very basic outline of the movie of course I have left out a lot of the movie because I don't want to give too much away and you should see this for yourself and come to your own conclusions. Give this movie a chance and I think you will like it.".

Richard Gere playing a Jew? Almost as ridiculous as Melanie Griffith! But I needn't have worried. The film is nearly a masterpiece. A subtle emotional journey through a world of spelling bees Hare Krishna Kaballah Kleptomania and the gorgeously rendered interior spaces of the imagination. Beautiful original special effects delightful characters great acting. The girl who plays the daughter is excellent as are the other actors. Juliette Binoche is heartbreaking and mysterious Richard Gere is perfectly cast as the selfabsorbed Jewish! father and Anthony Minghella's son is also in the movie believe it or not and he's very good. There are changes from the book. But the overall feeling is very similar. The movie is neither as funny or as dark as Myla Goldberg's novel. But the end might be more emotionally satisfying. See for yourself! You won't be disappointed if you approach with an open mind. Not for the cynical or for the action film junkie but I found this a delightful rich and emotional journey. Definitely a 10! Put it on the Oscar watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am coming to believe that no effective movie can be deeply spiritual. We know the problem with cinematic love how do you show it? Sex? Placed in the midst of larger flows like war?Mystical forces are similar internal. A bond a sway that cannot be seen by definition cannot be visually displayed.Its a real challenge for the serious filmmaker who is tired of stories about spiritual awakening as sports contests. The solution we have here is clever. Yes I know it was solved first in a novel that the larger structure wasn't immediately intended for the eye. But what the author and screenwriter put together is very good cinema if somewhat stupid on the spiritual side.The first thing is how the idea is surrounded by the four characters. Ostensibly the display is anchored and explained by the father. He plays double duty teaching in words about the mystical tradition he studies professes and failed in his attempt to follow. He also provides the human problem of blind expectations that haunts the others in his family. Its a tired formula even if the spiritual piece is substituted for the more common failures and wouldn't be enough if the supposed secondary stories didn't eclipse it.The apparently number two character is the daughter who wins spelling contests because she has this gift this insight that her father lacks. This coincidence of the mystical tradition and the spelling of words by deep seeing is what makes the story work and also happens to be the thing that makes it antispiritual  at least so far as it selfadvertises. More about that in a minute.Then there's the older son. Oh this is when the Jewish imposition comes the son is simply rebelling and it matters that he leaves a religion of the written word for a chanted one. Dramatically this is the least interesting occlusion though it shows that the author understood how words play in the thing.Finally the mother. We are seeing this movie primarily through the eyes of the dad so the mother's actions seem at first inexplicable and incidental. Later we are convinced she is mad and was so from the beginning. Under the spell of her husband's spiritual notions she engages in an obvious misunderstanding of what it means. Or so we are meant to believe.The structure of the thing is why I want to recommend it to you but the spiritual message is off. Perhaps necessarily so as I'll explain.Here's the plot Father studies Kabbalah. Daughter apparently has the gift he studies. The Dad's understanding of Kabbalah is one that novices have that words carry the essence of the thing so their constituents namely the letters are the atoms of God's breath in the world motivating and reflecting all in creation and creation itself.So when the daughter closes her eyes in the contest and sees the letters assemble she is one with the coupling force of God. She is an adept. Meanwhile her mother is ill and the daughter discovers this right before the ultimate context. She performs the forbidden Kabbalistic exercises right before this contest so that she has the powers of a fuller adept.She deliberately loses the contest thereby healing her mother and surprising her father with her wisdom. That's the story a novice viewer will see. But the point and construction is that there is an alternate flow here. I've told you the apparent plot so that you can imagine the realer one underneath.The dramatic tension isn't between father and daughter but daughter and mother. The father is a doofus who makes the same mistake we as viewers do. In Kabbalah there are several blinds just as in a way the Bible itself is supposed to be a blind to first level of Kabbalah. In that first level is the stuff the father spouts in this movie that letters matter or that they denote some ineffable spiritual soulflies. This is the stuff of the modern Kabbalah Institute we know from yearning movie celebrities. Real Kabbalah is beyond that beyond its Jewish confines escaping into softer and broader Christian Mulsim and alchemical Judaic wisdom mostly from the Spanish confluence. It is as it happens usually visual and folded. In fact my own awareness of this tradition comes from study of folded narrative.The girl's last two spelling words are syllogism and origami.So.Just as within the story there is a deeper vision beyond what you see so is there a deeper story. The mother is the adept. Her actions seem insane to her husband and therefore us. But she is the one who turns her relationships all of them including the sex into the ability to influence events. As with any magi she does this indirectly through others invisibly. All the others will think they are in control in some important way but they are not.I would like to recommend this to you for the way it is put together. It is cinematically something between Beautiful Mind and Pi but far far better than they in conveying what it is like to be a mathematical mystic. The tradition hinted here the one that envisions the world geometrically is the parent of what we now call mathematics.I recommend you take the movie seriously perhaps more seriously than the directors and see the underlying story whatever you may recognize.But the spiritual notions on the surface are as mundane as the politics in V for Vendetta If you want better mysticism in this tradition go to Ninth Gate and Drowning by Numbers. The former brings inner visions to cinema and the latter the other way around. Or perhaps Andrei Rublov for the travails of an artist in this quest.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

She performs the forbidden Kabbalistic exercises right before this contest so that she has the powers of a fuller adept.She deliberately loses the contest thereby healing her mother and surprising her father with her wisdom. That's the story a novice viewer will see. But the point and construction is that there is an alternate flow here. I've told you the apparent plot so that you can imagine the realer one underneath.The dramatic tension isn't between father and daughter but daughter and mother. The father is a doofus who makes the same mistake we as viewers do. In Kabbalah there are several blinds just as in a way the Bible itself is supposed to be a blind to first level of Kabbalah. In that first level is the stuff the father spouts in this movie that letters matter or that they denote some ineffable spiritual soulflies. This is the stuff of the modern Kabbalah Institute we know from yearning movie celebrities. Real Kabbalah is beyond that beyond its Jewish confines escaping into softer and broader Christian Mulsim and alchemical Judaic wisdom mostly from the Spanish confluence. It is as it happens usually visual and folded. In fact my own awareness of this tradition comes from study of folded narrative.The girl's last two spelling words are syllogism and origami.So.Just as within the story there is a deeper vision beyond what you see so is there a deeper story. The mother is the adept. Her actions seem insane to her husband and therefore us. But she is the one who turns her relationships all of them including the sex into the ability to influence events. As with any magi she does this indirectly through others invisibly. All the others will think they are in control in some important way but they are not.I would like to recommend this to you for the way it is put together. It is cinematically something between Beautiful Mind and Pi but far far better than they in conveying what it is like to be a mathematical mystic. The tradition hinted here the one that envisions the world geometrically is the parent of what we now call mathematics.I recommend you take the movie seriously perhaps more seriously than the directors and see the underlying story whatever you may recognize.But the spiritual notions on the surface are as mundane as the politics in V for Vendetta If you want better mysticism in this tradition go to Ninth Gate and Drowning by Numbers. The former brings inner visions to cinema and the latter the other way around. Or perhaps Andrei Rublov for the travails of an artist in this quest.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.";

Meet the Naumanns Father Richard Gere is an avid scholar who teaches the Kabbalah.

He's the perfect student who knows what he's reading but doesn't necessarily practices what he preaches. This spelling bee is a ways for him to bask in Eliza's prowess.Aaron progressively becomes aware of this lie within his home and is the first to openly rebel.

Sure their meeting feels clich but I've seen the same types of encounters happening with people of other sects. Her pat screen time serves to instill action in Aaron and create a deeper need to attack Dad's quiet arrogant pomposity.Even so it's not a sincere move. And with Mimi's progressive descent into her own world of trinkets and stolen gifts the only one who seems capable of any real sense of spirituality is young Eliza who lives deep inside her own unformed unnamed faith. It's of such a magnitude that she at one key moment invoking the voice of God before her climactic contest suffers a seizure immediately following an intense rapture.BEE SEASON is a movie that looks hokey from different perspectives but spoke to me with its message of what true mysticism means. Answers are not in what we are taught but of the voice inside us and the complete faith in transcending worldly awards to those that are much higher much more durable and which elevate us to a higher plane. I know this might sound like New Age blather and maybe it is for you but for me it's a golden reality.".

With a father like Gere you could hardly be other than a whiz at whatever he urged you to try. And Aaron is searching for God too. But where does he find God? In the nowdefunct Hare Krishnas. Of course it could have been worse. Aaron might have dug up some suicide cult. But still for some people it must be getting a bit tiresome to deal with people who have learned that God is communicating with them. Andy Warhol once claimed that he'd been given a dead phone but that God was supposed to be on the other end waiting for his call.

TWO geniuses in the family not including him and Juliette Binoche who is a scientist. Aaron and his cello are put on the back burner while Gere hovers over his daughter and tells her emphatically that God is in the letters. In the end she teaches him a valuable lesson too humility.There's something distasteful about judged performances like spelling bees though. I say this not only because Barbara Lukashinsky came in first to my second in a fifthgrade spelling bee just because I misspelled a stupid word like nickel and she got it right. No it's not that at all even though she didn't deserve first prize.It's that like other judged performances spelling bees are a zerosum game. One can only win at the expense of someone else. It's competition in its purest form. You win the prize by beating everyone else. But who wins a prize for cooperation? Or self sacrifice? Roger Bannister was the first person to run a 4minute mile. Does anyone remember who was the second runner to break four minutes? It isn't that competition is necessarily bad per se. It can boost team solidarity and even be fun. The main problem with spelling bees is that they encourage lazy categorical thinking about either victory or defeat while compromise has no part in the contest.This is a pretty slow movie. It's almost European. It's stuffed with far too many themes like the kaleidoscope did I spell that right? that Binoche hands down to daughter Emily. Impossible to grasp them all. But it's a nice change to see a film that challenges us.".

I completely forgave the movie for its sickening angst but not after such a terrible ending.I don't care the reason for it. I watch movies to celebrate. That little girl went through all the trouble to get to a national stage and then she throws it? Give me a break. And all the family is highfiving over it and being all weepywoo over it? Not going to buy it.Everyone I watched it with was disgusted.And the dad seemed like one of the best dad's you could ever have yet he was made out to be a meddler? What the?

	schema:reviewBody "Bee Season reviewed by Sam Osborn rating 3.5 out of 4 At first glance Bee Season seems to be just another clichd family melodrama waltzing its way into your multiplex. But please please please give this film a chance. Based on Myla Goldberg's critically acclaimed bestseller this film adaptation by directing team Scott McGehee and David Siegel strikes all the right notes. There's a veneer of family melodrama but beneath it there's a deeply affecting story about each family member's sense of spirituality. I realize that the word spirituality alludes to images of What the Bleep do we Know?! and other pseudophilosophic pieces you've suffered through but Bee Season has little to do with those. For one there's no hardboiled message tagged onto Bee Season. Actually if anyone were to walk away from the film with a lesson it would be that there is no right answer. It's up to you to figure one out for yourself. Second there's more to Bee Season than spirituality. There's a smart and well acted family drama to go along with it.Bee Season opens with little Eliza Naumann's Flora Cross class spelling bee. Passing through the class competition and continuing onto the school bee she surprises both herself and her brother Aaron Max Minghella by taking first prize and moving on to districts. Eliza's father Saul Richard Gere a Judaism Scholar and college professor was caught unawares by the good news and was delighted to pass it on to their scientist mother Miriam Juliette Binoche who was also unaware of her daughter's natural talent for words. Even more surprising Eliza goes on to win the Districts competition and continues on to Regionals. Saul whose interest had mostly laid in Max's affinity for classical music slowly begins turning towards Eliza's talents. Just as a sidenote don't worry there isn't any jealousy interplay between Aaron and Eliza over their father's attention. Bee Season's too smart for that. Anyway with more free time on his hands without his father's music Aaron finds himself with an intriguing freespirited girl named Chali Kate Bosworth whose involvement with the Hari Krishna following interests Aaron. Whether it's the girl or the religion Aaron begins to explore different religions of the world wondering if his father's choice of Judaism is best for him.Aaron's story is the most obvious of subplots concerning individualist thinking in terms of theocracy. However his story isn't hamhanded or blatantly melodramatic. What Aaron deals with is an absorbing comingofage story that many people his age can relate to. There's a wonderful scene where Aaron passes by a Catholic Church service and decides to give it a try. Directors McGehee and Siegel almost work as entire characters in of themselves in these pivotal scenes. Their subtle stylistic approach allows the depth of the writing to reveal itself. Max Minghella director Anthony Minghella's son does well with his role playing a young man with a ton of moral fiber but struggling with his own sense of self.Saul's interest in Eliza's spelling brings him to digging up his studies for his university thesis paper on the power of words and their connection with the Torah and God. He begins helping Eliza study for regionals teaching her word exercises that deal more with the spirit of the word than the spelling of it. He soon realizes that Eliza may have more talent than he originally thought. She spells words she hasn't ever heard before mystically closing her eyes in concentration and slowly sounding off the letters. She says that when she closes her eyes she can hear the word's voice. McGehee and Siege's style also shows off here with a visual representation of the voices of the words. For instance the word dandelion when concentrated upon causes roots and stems to shoot out from Eliza's hair and shoulders forming the letters as they haphazardly grow alerting Eliza to their spelling.After one particularly tiring night of spell practicing Eliza's mother comes into the room and awards her daughter with her childhood treasure the kaleidoscope. But instead of provoking a sweet reminiscence of her earlier days the kaleidoscope evokes painful memories of her parents' deaths. Miriam's story is probably the most affective working almost as a mystery. Juliette Binoche impresses in the role playing a deeply divided and wounded woman whose scars are just beginning to reopen.Family drama is in my opinion the most difficult genre to write. Writers can overshoot their boundaries with shock factor while other writers tragically understate the family with clichs. It seems that Myla Goldberg's got it right with Bee Season. What I really loved about the story is that it never criminalized a character. The characters may get mad at each other and fight but the audience is already so deeply involved in every family member's story that we come to realize the side each member is fighting for and can empathize.At the center of the film however is Eliza. Acting as the catalyst for all this change her affinity for spelling works as the spark to start the fire. Flora Cross is amazing in her role in the same natural way Alex Ethel was in Millions. Their performances seem to come so easily. Come to think of it much of Bee Season is similar to Millions. The superb acting the spiritual story and the director's style. But I think Bee Season is the superior film overall. It's mlange of family tales works as an ensemble story that weaves in and around the centerpiece of Eliza's spelling bee achievements. But I think that its beauty is nearly impossible to display through previews trailers posters critiques and advertisements. The only way you can understand is to see the film. That's the best recommendation I can give.".

Acting as the catalyst for all this change her affinity for spelling works as the spark to start the fire. Flora Cross is amazing in her role in the same natural way Alex Ethel was in Millions. Their performances seem to come so easily. Come to think of it much of Bee Season is similar to Millions. The superb acting the spiritual story and the director's style. But I think Bee Season is the superior film overall. It's mlange of family tales works as an ensemble story that weaves in and around the centerpiece of Eliza's spelling bee achievements. But I think that its beauty is nearly impossible to display through previews trailers posters critiques and advertisements. The only way you can understand is to see the film. That's the best recommendation I can give.";

	schema:reviewBody "Beer For My Horses is a redneckflavored buddy cop comedy starring country music superstar Toby Keith and downhome comedian Rodney Carrington the pair also cowrote the script as smalltown Oklahoma sheriff deputies. Toby's the strong silent hero type while Rodney provides the goofball comic relief. When the two stop a gang of crooks from stealing fertilizer from a local farm one of their prisoners turns out to be the brother of a particularly vicious Mexican drug lord. From there you can pretty much write the script yourself  the prisoner tells Keith My brother is going to kill you Toby laughs it off then his girlfriend is kidnapped right out of her car on a country road late at night. Of course the prisoner's brother is responsible and he arranges an exchange  You bring me my brother or I'll kill the girl. Thus Keith and Carrington sneak their prisoner out of jail and head off to Mexico in Carrington's absurdly overthetop monster pickup truck having various misadventures along the way some of which are far too silly to describe here before a final showdown South of the Border. Do I really need to tell you how it all turns out? I didn't think so. Toby Keith has suggested that this film is meant to be an homage to the Cannonball Run or Smokey and the Bandit movies i.e. not to be taken very seriously. To me it seemed like they weren't sure whether they were making a straightup cop movie or a screwball comedy and never found the proper balance between the two. Toby's a decent enough actor and Carrington is always good for a few yuks but I was actually embarrassed for him by the time we got to the scene in a reststop men's room where he leads a group of loitering gangbangers in a singalong. Willie Nelson is always a welcome presence in movies like these but he seems wasted in a bit part as the father figure of a traveling circus. I got the most laughs out of the first half hour or so showcasing Toby's domestic problems and the lack of respect he gets at work from his superior officers. Once they hit the road for Mexico the movie starts to fall apart. My favorite character in the whole movie is Ted Nugent who plays a fellow deputy who never speaks except for two words at the end  knowing what a motormouth he is in real life I imagine it must've been hell for him to keep his trap shut for nearly the entire movie!! In short Beer For My Horses is OK for a few laughs if you happen to catch it on Country Music Television where it airs on a seemingly weekly basis but not something you need to seek out unless you're a fan of any of the participants.".

If your familiar with the music video of the song Beer for My Horses you knew some extension and maybe transformation could lead to a movie. The question was would they do it? The answer was yes. As much as I loved the song when I was younger I wasn't going berserk for the film. I was shocked when discovering it I hadn't seen it until about two years later. The main reason was I was upset Willie Nelson co singer in the song wasn't Toby Keith's sidekickpartner in the film. Thats why I avoided it.Though as soon I started watching it I inevitably got hooked. It surpassed the video. It honestly did. The video's plot involved a serial killer who would kill prostitutes and it was up to Toby Keith Willie Nelson and another cop to find out who it was. The movie's plot has a lot more suspense and effects the protagonist more than the music video did.Toby Keith plays lovable deputy Rack who's sidekick is more than meets the eye Lonnie Rodney Carrington his bumbling sidekick and silent and solemn Skunk Ted Nugent. The three deputies recently arrested a group of Mexicans who tried to steal fertilizer from a shop. The brother of one criminal kidnaps Rack's love interest who he goes back to after his most recent girlfriend dumps him. Rack Lonnie Skunk and the criminal head to Mexico to claim the girl and return the criminal.Besides some bad jokes clich moments and foreshadowing of help from something useless this movie proves to be okay. There's just a few problems I have with this. The song Beer for My Horses is heard for fifteen seconds barely in the near opening of the film. Thats fine maybe if the movie wasn't called Beer for My Horses but why would you name a movie after a song thats not even in a movie? Its on the soundtrack and the quote Whiskey for my man beer for my horses is said in the movie.The last thing I have to complain is the fact that Willie Nelson is the sidekick in the song but not that movie. Instead he plays a random trucker who fixes the guys' car. Why couldn't all three men Lonnie Rack and Willie be the lead characters in the film. I don't have a problem with Skunk but he wasn't even in the video.This will probably be the closest to the video we will get. Im still hung up on the fact that one of my alltime favorite songs has been made into a movie. Not a bad film with likable characters and some funny humor. Its not often a good country song gets made into a movie. Though lets hope the next one includes the TITLE SONG.Starring Toby Keith Rodney Carrington Willie Nelson and Ted Nugent. Directed by Michael Salomon.".

This is what had a lot of people who was hooked on the video disappointed me included. However the comedy was great! I'm one who loves to laugh. Yes it could have been better but it wasn't the worst movie I've seen. Each character was very unique and have something obnoxious and funny about them. I thought it was pretty cool to have veterans in the movie like Ted Nugent Tom Skerritt and Gina Gershon. They didn't do it because they needed money as one reviewer assumed! They did it because they thought it would be fun.! This movie has become one of my alltime favorites and I just watch it whenever I just need to destress and have a good laugh.".

I was disappointed that this plot was not in the movie. I felt if it had been the movie would have been much better and did better at the box office. This is what had a lot of people who was hooked on the video disappointed me included. However the comedy was great! I'm one who loves to laugh. Yes it could have been better but it wasn't the worst movie I've seen. Each character was very unique and have something obnoxious and funny about them. I thought it was pretty cool to have veterans in the movie like Ted Nugent Tom Skerritt and Gina Gershon. They didn't do it because they needed money as one reviewer assumed! They did it because they thought it would be fun.! This movie has become one of my alltime favorites and I just watch it whenever I just need to destress and have a good laugh.";

Just before the house changed hands I took a walk with my wife and met some guy in a cowboy hat and jeans coat and workgloves ripping out all the brush that lined the road across from our house good thing... it was ugly. He told us he had just bought the land and was going to build a house on it. It was some 20 acres. We thought some housing developer was going to put in a new division.I congratulated him on his purchase and I said I was glad it was a solo owner. You can count the residences in the neighborhood on one hand so I introduced myself and said howdy neighbor. He told me his name was Rodney Carrington. I asked what kind of work do you do Rodney? I got a stunned deer look from him as it was obvious my wife and I had never heard of him. After he told me what he did my wife and I made a little more smalltalk and we walked home. On a whim I looked him up on YouTube. OMG! Then I found out who Rodney was... and later that he bought my house. I'm now his tenant.Before I get to the review I will say that I find Rodney very funny and he's quite the regular guy. He's a hardworking comic in the tradition of Will Rogers though less grated and he and his family make mighty fine neighbors.Now to the movie rating. Beer for my Horses isn't a bad movie nor is it a mustsee movie. There are some serious plot failures no you can't cross into Mexico the way they did the bad guys are sadly cartoonish and the story is overall very pedestrian.However the acting is competent the cast of stars was a pleasant surprise and we're spared the clich of making The Man Tom Skerritt's role as the sheriff seem like a jerk or a buffoon. He recognizes his rogue subordinates as at least trying and joins in the toasts when they seem appropriate. Rodney is only really turned loose for the reststop scene and it's actually worth watching the movie just for that scene. Ted Nugent is there to act up with the weapons and his best moments are at the start of the film.Summary If you're not sure what to watch and you need a comic moment grab some shots and beers and watch Beer for my Horses.".

If you can think of a third thing you're able to write a better screenplay which means nothing. In the meantime some bad guys try to do some thing of some sorts probably get a job in a better movie like Home Alone 7 or Kazaam but the dog saves the day or whatever. Look at what Judge Reinhold is willing to do to pay his bills these days. Or better yet don't. Lassie would turn around in his garden.";

While some of the movie is a bit funny like Judge Reinhold trying to get Michalangelo Beethoven's lookalike to behave like Beethoven the movie is one to be skipped.I'm not sure if 3 and 4 were filmed back to back since this movie does carry a copyright date of 2000 on it. However Beethoven's 3rd wasn't even theatre releasable so the decision had to have been to make 2 direct to videos.Anyway Judge Reinhold should try better choices at least ones that don't have him drinking out of a toilet.Rating 2".

Beethoven seems to start acting strange he's not up to his usual schemes and judge reinhold in an incredible performance as the father wonders what is wrong. They soon find out that beethoven has been switched by a better fartknocking  dog. The sorrow that the family goes through is shocking and unbelievably real. I also think Rob Shneider would be excellently cast as the father or any role.  Also the film did not have as many fart jokes as i would have hoped for. We all know that what holds together films is the fart jokes and i believe that Rob Schneider could have provided enough fart jokes for our satisfaction. But despite the lack of Rob Schneider and fart jokes this movie was a great ride with an ending so powerful that it changed me as a human being.".

Julia Sweeney once famous for her place on Saturday Night Live reprises the Beth Newton Persona and there are two very badacting children in the film also.This awful sequel deals with Richard Newton watching Beethoven for his brother once played by the muchbetter Charles Grodin while they go on a family vacation. Unfortunately for both Richard and the audience the millionth time Beethoven drinks out of the toilet bowl it makes everyone a bit mad so they take him to training class where he accidentally switches places with a rich man's Matt McCoy Saint Bernard without anyone noticing. When Rich Man's dog comes back to the Newton's they are astonished at the fact that he is finally obeying his masters...the only problem is that now Beethoven is over at the Rich Man's House caught with The Rich Man's Snooty Daughter and the Quiet Elderly Butler. How will Beethoven ever get back?Quite honestly I couldn't care less whether Beethoven makes it home or gets run over by a steamroller. Let's put it this way I really enjoyed the original Beethoven film written by the King of the Eighties John Hughes. The second was a bit contrived and was cashing in on the original a bit but it still had its moments. This mindnumbingly bad sequel however is a followup to an already mindnumbingly bad third installment. By this time I've seen so much Beethoven I don't really care what happens.Perhaps if Charles Grodin was in it I'd still enjoy the series.Perhaps if the script was intelligent and witty and not the equivalent of EVERY family film that comes out nowadays I'd like it.Just perhaps.But somewhere along the line in this world of cashingin on superior originals Beethoven lost the charm wit and talent it once had and is now a snorefest. Really it went from a pleasant and enjoyable family comedy to a kids' movie with dumb dialogue dumb situations dumb characters etc...the whole dumb works. It's almost like it's a whole other film series.Or is it?Beethoven's 4th gets 15 from meit's weak pathetic has lost its charm two sequels ago and is filled with kiddiefilm material and ultimately no intelligence whatsoever. The film execs who gave the goahead on this one were looking for one thing Money.Avoid this flop and see an intelligent family film like 2001's Monsters Inc.

	schema:reviewBody "Although rather less elevated than some of the previous Beethoven movies I did appreciate the rather transparent themes of the film. It was impeccable that no part of the plot was left to imagination or surprise. After all the fourth title of the series has quite a lot to live up to. I must however be quite honest and admit that when Mrs. Newton stood in front of a mirror in one of the opening scenes in an outfit of mustard yellow and said to Mr. Newton It makes me look fat! doesn't it? I sided with her rather than her husband. She did look a bit like an overstuffed Twinkie. Imagine my sheer joy when Beethoven slobbered all over it proving once again that he is an irascible central character to the plot with obviously finer taste than many viewers would give him credit for. I rather appreciated that every nuance of the film was explained very plainly or overexplained as it gave the viewer time to possibly catch a brief nap and still be fully informed upon awakening. As I said it was very possible without being clairvoyant to guess that when Beethoven the rather illmannered or working class dog was shown juxtaposed against Michelangelo the wellgroomed and civilized dog who by the way lived in a mansion and wiped his paws on doormats somehow the two would end up switching places with amusing mayhem as the consequence! I was especially intrigued when Mrs. Newton in a subtle bit of foreshadowing exclaimed believably as I saw it There's no house in the world big enough for that dog!in reference to Beethoven I also appreciated the fact that the next shot portrayed Michelangelo sitting in his kingsize bed in that giant mansion of his. It didn't keep me guessing but yet assured me that said mayhem would ensue. The only thing I truly pondered was the method of the switch. Unbelievably it was during a scene where Beethoven chased a cart of hot dogs down a sidewalk in a park while simultaneously an attempt was made to kidnap Michelangelo in the same park that the two were mixed up. The said plot gave the Newtons time to finally relax a little with a wellbehaved dog around. Unfortunately the other family The Sedgwicks and in this case Sedgwick is not the name of a wealthy household's butler but the name of the couple themselvesfind that Beethoven's antics in fact rid the household of it's overlystuffy atmosphere and bring the family closer together. Unfortunately Michelangelo's good behavior is almost too unnerving for Beethoven's real owners though the children think this is because of the fact that they've secretly enrolled Beethoven in obedience training classes. Luckily the two dogs are switched back during Beethoven's graduation ceremony which must have been quite a task to film. The whole class of dogs have red graduation caps on and it's quite an affair. Everlasting is the word Mrs. Newton herself would use I'm sure if she were to describe it. However Beethoven foils Michelangelo's wouldbe kidnappers in the end recovering 250000 for the grateful Sedgwicks though wreaking havoc on the carefully contrived dog graduation. The two are switched back without the knowledge of the owners who in the end pull their cars up to the same stop sign at the same time in one final shot. Though the movie seems fairly cut and dry I wanted for a moment to review the themes. If you happen to be wealthy beyond your wildest dreams remember that money cannot buy you the closeness of family. Alternatively remember that sometimes a neat and tidy house is less important than the love and nurturing of pets however large and cumbersome they might be. I happily give this film two stars out of ten although I am uncertain whether I will watch Beethoven's 5th anytime soon. I'd say that that particular film is probably on the same priority list as Home Alone 3 or as a friend of mine would call it Some Kid Somewhere Snowy Does The Same Thing All Over Again. Thank you so much for reading.".

I felt that Beethoven's third had been a bit of a flop with childish jokes and a not very good father character. I am sorry to say that I feel that the fourth one has gone the same way. The plot is alright being very imaginative and the Whodunnit feel to it is a nice touch.But the jokes and the actors are missing a certain spark that would make them funny to everybody not just little children who love farts and people falling over. Everybody in my family age range from 561 laughed at Beethoven. Genuine laughter. The only person laughing at Beethoven's 4th was me trying to convince everybody that the film wasn't a complete waste of money. I had to give up in the end. My throat hurt from trying to snigger. Still the added bonus was the free Beethoven film with the 4th one. The children especially could have done a better job. Its all about being a 'babe magnet' and being pushed on roller blades. And the girls have these annoying high pitched American accents that pierce your brain and make you grind your teeth. All of the stunts have been done before in other films to much better effect. And a last point why do they refer to him saving skiers in the Alps? When did Beethoven ever do that? Before he was kidnapped from a pet shop or enroute to the new family? In conclusion the film is a good film for children and dog lovers who adore dog films no matter the plot. But for comedy seekers this film is a big disappointment.210".

I was both right and wrong.You can tell from many of the comments on here that the preponderance of opinion weighs on the bad side of the scale yet in a quirky way I found this movie entertaining. What was interesting was watching several wellknown professional actors such as Tom Poston Dave Thomas Faith Ford John Larroquette Katherine Helmond and Kathy Griffin all coming across as if they were amateurs starring in a locallymade production. There was something oddly authentic about it. I also found myself cracking up at some of the comments Dave Thomas kept muttering offhandedly under his breath kind of like Popeye used to do. While looking for hidden loot Thomas and the kids encounter another treasure hunter who tries to sell Dave a fork he had found you just can't have enough good forks and Dave mutters something about looking for silverware in the woods after dark. Little asides like that just struck me as funny for some reason.Chances are many kids will like this. As an adult I thought the story wasn't all that bad but I do tend to like stories about mining towns and lost treasure. Yes it's a sequel that probably shouldn't have been made especially if you're familiar with the storyline of the originals. Still I'm glad they made it because on an evening when I was tired and stressed out and just wanted something funny to watch without a lot of involvement this movie was just the ticket and was fun for what it is.".

The second had its contrivances but it was watchable while the third and fourth films were mediocre at best. So what can I say about Beethoven's 5th? My my my this is by far the worst of the series a real dog of a movie with one redeeming quality. And I have already given away that redeeming quality in the title. Yes sorry to say but for me Beethoven was the only good thing about this film he is likable funny and well trained and he is the only likable character here. I guess I could say the same for the previous two canine adventures though the films themselves didn't quite reach this one's awfulness. Everything else did not work at all. The soundtrack one of the redeeming qualities of the previous films isn't necessarily horrendous it is just the matter of how it was placed in the film. Sometimes it felt obtrusive and predictable here. But that isn't the worst part. Beethoven's 5th I felt was shoddily made almost directtovideo quality. Even worse than this was the direction it was so awful and unfocused. The script has too many cheesy moments and the plot is dreadfully weak. I know the plot wasn't necessarily a strong point of the first film not to mention the sequels that followed but here it is disjointed and poorly structured with no sense of drive. And the characters with the exception of Beethoven don't have any sparkle. The actors just look as though they are trying to say here I am and what am I doing in this movie in short they looked embarrassed even those who were trying to give the film energy did not succeed due to the failure of the script and plot. Overall this is an awful entry of the Beethoven series. 110 Bethany Cox".

Then 7 years later in our time 2000 Beethoven's 3rd was released with the same family name but different people with the relation with the orignal newton family. The Beetohven's 4th was released in 2001.

King Ghidrah makes his second appearance and it is a lot more fun and interesting than his first Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster from 1964.This definitely isn't the fastest moving Godzilla film but there are a lot of cool things to look at as the plot goes along slow at times. And the alien invasiontakeover plot is pretty decent if not overly original. The aliens look pretty cool and their hardware is 60's scifi retro you gotta love it.Nick Adams is pretty decent enough and gives the film a certain flair. It's a shame he had to leave us so soon as it would have been a blast to have him return in a future Godzilla film.The special effects are totally mid60's Godzilla with all the obvious miniatures being stomped on by the guys in the monster suits. There's one great shot where a doll of an astronaut gets lowered onto Planet X via an open elevator outside the spaceship and as the doll is lowered to the ground in one lengthy camera shot you can't help but laugh a little realizing that there was no attempt whatsoever to make that shot look real or to hide the fact it's so fake with quick silly editing. But that's part of the charm of the early Godzilla films. I always thought it was odd when on Planet X underground as the leader shows the astronauts the screen showing Ghidrah wildly attacking on the surface that Ghidrah is in essence attacking nothing but rocks and dirt because that's all there is on the planet's surface. And also how Ghidrah flies past that huge painting of a planet in the distance a few times.Godzilla and Rodan eventually save the Earth and that's what it's all about in a 1965 Godzilla film. Godzilla by this time was definitely all hero protecting his home planet. It's such a shame that unless a movie looks like a silly music video so many kids won't watch it. Hopefully a lot of parents are introducing their kids to these old Godzilla films via DVD and video because they sure aren't on TV much anymore.".

The best way to watch any Godzilla film is to believe that you are watching an alternate universe where all nations are equally powerful and those future dreams of the past did become possible.For Godzilla fans there is a lot of love about this film. There are interesting characters and many consider this Nick Adams' best film which may not be true but his costar is BIGGER. For me it is the images of the two monsters being lifted from the lake and hauled off to Planet X. The battle on the planet is now considered a classic moment too as Goji does a victory dancereferred to as The Godzilla Shie. Godzilla always seemed to have a personality but that dance cemented this notion as he also demonstrates emotions in this story.The fact that you are reading this review demonstrates that you may have your own ideas and feelings about this film. This review is for the cinefile who believes in Godzilla and many of the other movies that came from Toho Studios. My recommendation is that you watch DESTROY ALL MONSTERS after this film and then go play the two Godzilla video games that are now available.".

This is an interesting film in the Godzilla series that has some pretty good scifi elements blended with good ole Godzilla fun.  The monsters are what you would expect and the acting is pretty pedestrian as a rule. Adams is an unwelcome addition as his acting ability is somewhat suspect and he tends to stick out like a sore thumb.  Nevertheless the film zips along at a nice pace. My only major criticism is that the monsters and in particular Godzilla have too few scenes.  Inshiro Hondo directed this one and it has many of his distinctive touches.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now here's a good entry to the franchise starring everyone's favorite firebreathing dinosaur. Godzilla having terrorized humanity in the past and battled his first few enemies had just earned his title of being a hero having helped save the earth from his nemesis King Ghidorah with some help from Mothra and Rodan. This left him open to being marketed more towards kids and it was time to keep the King of the Monsters on a role to being Japan's defender.Plot A new planet has been discovered near Jupiter and soon humanity encounters its inhabitants the Xilians. The Xilians promise to give to humanity a secret formula to cure diseases provided that they let the aliens borrow Godzilla and Rodan to rid their planet of the menacing King Ghidorah. However not all is as it seems. They tricked the earthlings and using magnetic waves send the three monsters on a rampage to help conquer the planet. Can our scientific heroes find a way to free the monsters and stop the alien menace? Can Godzilla and Rodan's combined strength rid the Earth of King Ghidorah? The fate of the world hangs by a thread.There's a lot to like about this flick. This is the first time an alien race has been featured in a Godzilla movie and for the most part the Xiliens are pretty interesting. You don't know whether to trust them or not. All the monsteraction scenes are great to watch with plenty of destruction despite being unfortunately kept to a minimum screen time. Godzilla along with the other monsters is given a more lively personality which allows him to express emotions more effectively. Surprisingly the human characters are pretty likable with Nick Adams delivering an amusing performance and they are all more involved with the story. there's a good deal of realism to the science of this flick and the movie itself has a fun and somewhat mysterious atmosphere.Overall this is a nice edition to the Godzilla series. It has all that you would like in a scifi creature feature plus a little more. Definitely worth a watch especially if you're a Godzilla fan. All hail the King of the Monsters!".

The plot has two astronauts Adams and Akira Takarada traveling to Planet X. The people of that planet tell them that the threeheaded monster King Ghidorah has been wrecking Planet X. They propose a trade  Earth lets them borrow Godzilla and Rodan and in exchange they'll give us a miracle drug that will cure all disease. Well the Earthlings happily agree to this and the two monsters are taken away. But it turns out the people of Planet X aren't what they appear to be and now have issued Earth an ultimatum.This is all just nonsense but very cool. I'll get to the monster stuff but first let me say how much I love the cheesy scifi. From the astronaut suits and ship to the Planet X aliens with their stylish sunglasses hilarious outfits and cool gadgetry  it's all so gloriously fanciful and dated. I love it! Now the selling point of this is naturally big monster fights. Well this one delivers. All three monsters tear crap up before Godzilla and Rodan take on Ghidorah in a wonderful climactic battle. Wait until you see Godzilla boxing and shuffling his feet  it's priceless! Oh and the best part of the whole movie is when he gives a victory dance. There isn't a word for how awesome that is. Nick Adams' performance is all over the place. For most of the movie he seems like an overgrown Bowery Boy but late in the film he decides to overact like he's in Streetcar. Lots of unintentionally funny lines and cheesy moments. It's great escapist entertainment. Probably my favorite Godzilla sequel.".

And of course the usual army guys.  What would a Godzilla movie be without a few platoons of cannon fodder?Obviously the budget for this film didn't go into the detailed miniatures that Godzilla movies are known for.  The two major battles take place largely on the rocky terrain of Planet X or in open fields on Earth. Except for a couple of impressive explosions relatively little gets smashed. The monsters spend more time flexing and posturing than fighting.  And in my growing collection of Godzilla movies in no other movie yet is it as obvious that these are grown men in rubber suits  at one point Godzilla even spars with Ghidorah bareknuckle style!Nonetheless the movie has its moments.  The dialogue at least the Englishdubbed version is full of great cheesy lines The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth! and You rats!  You stinkin' rats! just to name two.  The Planet Xians' futuristic costumes complete with newwave dark glasses have to be seen to be believed.

	schema:headline " A Few Flaws But Great!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to 1964's success Invasion of AstroMonster is the sixth film in the first series. This is the first ever Godzilla movie to involve aliens in the plot something that would soon become common later on around the late 60s. With the same four fathers behind it this film is one to remember. Akira Ifukbe delivers the Rodan and Godzilla themes with a fresh eerie twist that sounded great while Tsubaraya took the SFX to new heights. The Planet X set looked great and realistic on screen as well as the Xian saucers and their teleportation beams. Shinchi Sekizawa provided a very good screen play full of romance clever ideas and originality but a few faults. The human characters are likable and in their own way add to records to the Gsaga. First off Nick Adams is the first ever American actor to star in a Gflick with a major role although a few Americans are in a deleted scene in Mothra vs. Godzilla The scene is still in the American cut. Also this is the ONLY Godzilla movie in history to have on screen kissing although it only last 1.45 seconds  Adams and Kumi Mizuno. I for one find this quite odd because several future Gfilms would have love stories to a degree but never do they share a kiss. Just wanted to point that out...anyways many Toho stars make appearances including Akira Takarada Akira Kubo and Jun Tazaki. Yoshio Tsuchiya plays the 'Controller of Planet X'. I love how he does those gestures with his hands every time he says something and it looks extraterrestrial. Kumi Mizuno also makes her Gfilm debut who looked surprisingly cute in those ridiculous Xian tights.King Ghidorah looks great as he did in the last film and Rodan also returned looking okay. However this time a new Godzilla suit appeared. This suit doesn't look too bad and actually looks pretty cool. And believe it or not the campiness is actually toned down from the last film Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster. Still there's the odd Godzillashai and Godzilla thinking his Muhammad Ali. Despite this the monster action is superbly great especially on Planet X. Out of all the Showa films this one has some of the best fights. Now where as you do have to wait a while it's worth it in the end. The Planet X battle is defiantly top notch. The main reason I love the fights in this film is because their so energetic and full of personality. For one example after the saucers have been destroyed Godzilla recovers first and attacks Ghidrah while he's still down. I think it was a great character moment that showed how the two have become archenemies of sorts. Plus I like how Godzilla leaped at Ghidorah actually tackling him down. Very cool. Rodan however has kind of Godzilla do most of the actual combat but he still gets his moments.Along with all the cool fights all the monsters get some nicely done citysmashing scenes. It's been nearly ten years since we've seen Rodan destroy and it feels good to see in the words of Gexpert Stuart Gulbraith IV on the commentary that menace of old. Some of the destruction is Rodan stockfootage but it doesn't really bother me because not a whole lot is used. UNLIKE the messes created in 1972 and 1973. Godzilla and Ghidorah both do some delightful damage as well and there are some great shots. Oh yeah Godzilla's heat ray looks great if though a little too thin. But much better than his 'steam' breath in the last film.It's U.S. cut is respectful to the original although Tetsuo Akira Kubo sounds too nerdy at times. Aso some of the dubbing's lines are a bit cheesy. For example Takarada's character The licking our first trucks have taken is something terrible. it isn't looking too hot. Terrible I know but overall it's better than how others were dubbed. Some have pointed out a weakness in the plot specifically why did the Xians need to lie and trick the human characters into 'giving' them the monsters when they're already on Earth and could already control the monsters? To me it's something you have to think about. Maybe just maybe the aliens were afraid if they just launched an allout attack that Tetsuo would use his alarm system on them and wanted a more subtle approach. This is hinted at when they burn the plans for the device and when they imprisoned Tetsuo. Sekizawa should've explained it a little more. I just wanted to say that in the film's defense because other than this and the Xian's weird shoes the film was great. One thing there's no real way to defend is how in his monologue the Controller 'confessed' to using magnetic waves to control the monsters. And thanks to this our heroes thought up the idea to use the ACycle Light Ray.He obviously didn't think Earth was smart enough to find a loop hole in his dastardly plans. But as the climax shoes guess not. Still all in all Invasion of AstroMonster is a very well done installment to the series.".

	onyx:emotionText "The sequel to 1964's success Invasion of AstroMonster is the sixth film in the first series. This is the first ever Godzilla movie to involve aliens in the plot something that would soon become common later on around the late 60s. With the same four fathers behind it this film is one to remember. Akira Ifukbe delivers the Rodan and Godzilla themes with a fresh eerie twist that sounded great while Tsubaraya took the SFX to new heights. The Planet X set looked great and realistic on screen as well as the Xian saucers and their teleportation beams. Shinchi Sekizawa provided a very good screen play full of romance clever ideas and originality but a few faults. The human characters are likable and in their own way add to records to the Gsaga. First off Nick Adams is the first ever American actor to star in a Gflick with a major role although a few Americans are in a deleted scene in Mothra vs. Godzilla The scene is still in the American cut. Also this is the ONLY Godzilla movie in history to have on screen kissing although it only last 1.45 seconds  Adams and Kumi Mizuno. I for one find this quite odd because several future Gfilms would have love stories to a degree but never do they share a kiss. Just wanted to point that out...anyways many Toho stars make appearances including Akira Takarada Akira Kubo and Jun Tazaki. Yoshio Tsuchiya plays the 'Controller of Planet X'. I love how he does those gestures with his hands every time he says something and it looks extraterrestrial. Kumi Mizuno also makes her Gfilm debut who looked surprisingly cute in those ridiculous Xian tights.King Ghidorah looks great as he did in the last film and Rodan also returned looking okay. However this time a new Godzilla suit appeared. This suit doesn't look too bad and actually looks pretty cool. And believe it or not the campiness is actually toned down from the last film Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster. Still there's the odd Godzillashai and Godzilla thinking his Muhammad Ali. Despite this the monster action is superbly great especially on Planet X. Out of all the Showa films this one has some of the best fights.

Astronauts head to Planet X to see if there is hospitable life only to find a group of aliens who are being bothered incessantly by King Ghidra.

In the realm of meaningless hokey monstermovie fare Godzilla Versus Monster Zero is fun enough though lacks a lot of the meaty monster battles one is expecting. Aside from a brief midpoint where we see the three monsters go at it on Planet X with Godzilla providing a classically hilarious victory dance that looks like he's doing a jig all the monster action is confined to the last ten minutes.At this point finally Ishiro Honda and FX man Tsuburyara finally unleash their special effects fury toy tanks included and there's some cheesy enjoyment in that. But in general this flick suffers from a bit too much talk a little too much time spent on the people from Planet X who's cool look fades after thirty seconds and the usual paperthin characters. It might make some mild enjoyment to watch if you're young but those looking for a lot of action may be disappointed. A decent entry that suffers from taking a little for granted what it means to have GODZILLA appearing first on the title card.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this is the movie where Godzilla does his little dance of joy completing his anthropomorphic change from mindless instrument of destruction to sentient hero. The sixth entry into the series also marks a shift from 'horror' to 'science fiction' as Invasion of AstroMonster opens with some nonsensical 'space talk' while a rocketship carrying two astronauts Glenn and Fuji Nick Adams and Akira Takarada respectively travel to a newly discovered moon of Jupitar christened 'Planet X' only to find it populated by 'Xians' and besieged by Ghidorah. The Xians offer a cure for cancer in exchange for permission to 'borrow' Rodan and Godzilla whom they plan to use to eliminate the Ghidorah threat or so they claim. Suspicious events are occurring on Earth and the astronauts sense that there might be something malignant behind the Xians benign offer. In this film the now sentient saurian is a fullfledged hero  recruited by the Xians to fight an evil monster and later defending the Earth itself. His original transgressions seems to have been forgiven or forgotten Fuji who feels sorry for leaving the Earth monsters on Planet X comments that Godzilla and Rodan cause troubles sometimes  a considerable understatement considering that over the years they have destroyed the cities of Fukuoka Osaka and Tokyo presumably at the costs of thousands of lives and billions of Yen. Notwithstanding Godzilla's infamous victory jig after his initial routing of Ghidorah the film is not played for laughs as much as was King Kong vs. Godzilla but remains a pretty juvenile outing with a 'good guys vs. bad guys' plot simplistic characters an inconsistent and at times nonsensical storyline a silly script and lots of monster fights. The decline in the series' budget is apparent as most of the brawls are on the desolate Planet X or in unpopulated parts of Japan rather than in the complex and expensive city sets that were common in the earlier films and gave some sense of verisimilitude to the inherently unrealistic suitmated monsters. There are some good parts  I like the spaceships the alien 'airlift' of the monsters the almost surreal scenes on Planet X with Jupitar looming in the sky and as always Ghidorah makes for an entertaining foe. Overall very watchable by fans of the genre but pretty much what most nonfans would expect to see if invited to join in another goofy Japanese monster movie. This review refers to the subtitled Japanese version however as the film was an AmericanJapanese coproduction hence American costar Nick Adams there is little difference between the subtitled and English dubbed versions.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple of moments in Invasion of AstroMonster show great promise. The first comes during the first appearance of King Ghidorah with a cascade of gravity beams shown on the screen behind the Xien leader as he explains the situation. The second comes when the Xien spacecraft transport Godzilla and Rodan into space. Both of these show the two intended genre elements working in harmony and had the rest of the movie followed suit this might have been a seminal entry in the series. Unfortunately the results are too lopsided to work. Complementary genre elements are of little use if they supplant what unique things are brought by the giant monster genre especially when said elements have been done much better in past films.Simply put Invasion of AstroMonster does not feel like a Godzilla movie. Too much of the running time is devoted to the humanalien conflict and while this does lend more substance to the human portion of the narrative it's still clumsily constructed as in any entry of the series. Various ideas are either truncated or plumb never capitalized on such as the Xiliens' deception which is made blatant both to the audience and some of the heroes and explorations of the Xiliens' culture are mostly limited to throwaway details. The pacing is nothing to emulate. Scenes on Planet X seem to go on forever for the sake of imitating Forbidden Planet and the multiple trips between Earth and Planet X seem unnecessary. The point is Invasion of AstroMonster never gives us an alien invasion plot capable of carrying an entire film on its own and this issue magnifies the already fundamentally disappointing decision of reduced monster action. If one is to endure the downplaying of the monsters in a monster movie it's only fair to demand something superb. But it's difficult to not make comparisons with other alienspace exploration features e.g. Forbidden Planet War of the Worlds Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. The conflict with the Xiliens with its lack of outstanding qualities needs the monster element to stand out and that is unfortunately what the film fails to capitalize on. Treatment of the monsters is on the whole poorer than in the previous entry. While their destruction scenes are adequate if repetitive these guys always feel like mere appendages to the plot rather than focal points of concern they're regarded as assets rather than creatures. Say what you will about the incipient goofiness from Ghidrah the Three Headed Monster but at least these guys had an established presence in that movie with actual signs of personality. Here they don't even get a proper sendoff instead suffering from that headscratchingly unceremonious ending. There are some good moments though. Namikawa's sacrifice is moving and the selfdestruction of the Xiliens is certainly dramatic. Additionally Akira Ifukube delivers a great new rendition of one of his themes from Godzilla 1954 which can be heard over the opening credits. Even so as far as I'm concerned this is a pretty middle of the road effort for the Godzilla timeline spanning the 50's 60's and 70's. It's strengths elevate it above utterly disposable products like Godzilla vs. Megalon and Godzilla's Revenge but time has not been very kind to it later films would incorporate aliens in more ingenious and entertaining ways.".

Herzog informed the audience that he was shown some footage taken by a photographer in Antarctica while doing postproduction on Grizzly Man and he was immediately entranced by what he saw. From this he was compelled to visit the continent and shoot some footage of his own which became Encounters at the End of the World.The film perfectly balances both gorgeous footage of the continent as well as fascinating interviews and anecdotes of the many researchers and workers of the McMurdo research station. There are many humorous moments such as a scene in which visitors must go through a followtheleader type exercise before being allowed to venture out into the wild. Participants in the exercise must wear buckets adorned with ridiculous caricatures over their heads in order to simulate a whiteout. They must then try to follow each other as a group and find a researcher a distance away. Herzog simply observes as the participants fail over and over to find the researcher which left the audience laughing for minutes on end. Another excellent scene has Herzog interviewing an expert on penguins who goes into some of their more bizarre behavior such when penguins go insane. In both cases Herzog features striking footage and amusing interviews and narration.The film fits in well with Herzog's already substantial canon. It is a beautiful look at a beautiful continent populated by a forklift driver with a PhD a woman who once traveled to South America in a sewage pipe on the back of a truck researchers who play electric guitars on top of research station to celebrate discovering three new species of aquatic life in one day and many more. Their stories converge where all the lines on the map meet at the end of the world. Herzog shot the film with a crew of just himself and the camera operator and the result is a film with some of the most beautiful footage I've ever seen.

It turns out that Herzog was invited to stay in McMurdo Station as a resident artist along with a camera man and this documentary for Discovery Films was what came out of that visit. With characteristic eccentricity what captures the most attention in Herzog's lens is not the pristine landscape or wildlife but the rather mundane sight of the albeit colorful people who work and live in Antarctica. As one of the people Herzog interviews puts it it's like all of the interesting people who cut themselves loose from conventional life eventually fall down and meet here at the bottom of the world. Here we meet unforgettable characters like the philosopher truck driver the lady who traveled through south America in a sewage pipe and even a descendant of Aztec royalty. Their anecdotes and the narration will keep you in stitches. This isn't to say that Herzog doesn't take in the local sights and sounds. We're taken under the ocean into underwater 'cathedrals' we hear the psychedelic sounds of mating seals we see a live volcano and even catch a penguin or two. However the narration remains light and funny and the true focus always remains on the human inhabitants. Don't expect a grand message about conservation or anything else indeed Herzog's view of mankind seems to be very fatalistic. I think as long as there are interesting human beings doing interesting things Herzog will be happy ... and busy.".

	schema:headline " Dear Future Aliens This is why we've left you a fish";
	schema:reviewBody "The world ends at Antarctica at least geographically  there's nothing further south  and quite possibly in a greater sense. Werner Herzog has gone there to make a film catching the opportunity to capture some of it's beauty in a way rarely seen on film and also to share some of his thoughts about nature and humanity. In and around the large McMurdo Research Station he circulates the various people working there joins them on their fieldwork and interviews them all resulting in a blend of beautiful images personal microstories funny sidetracks well paced informative moments and an often fascinating look at nature's inexplicable mystery humanity's as well as Mother Earth's.This is a large canvas perhaps slightly difficult to put in proper words. Above all all of the ideas and thoughts within the movie stems largely from the viewer's own imagination Herzog is merely  with his warm and serious yet inexplicable witty narration  planting the mental seeds and asking the questions some rhetorical and some forever impossible to answer. And it is remarkable how he does this how this film is designed. All throughout Herzog moves about like a genuine tourist and at the beginning I am surprised how spontaneous the whole idea feels almost as if I am actually watching a private home video made for personal remembrance. The only difference being of course that it would be the kind of home video Herzog would make. And be that as it may this is still a great movie because it continues from this elementary first stage of how he travels to the station combined with stock footage of the explorers of the 1800s into that of a true thinker's exploration in a romantic setting. The form of the film gradually evolves first small steps with the reality of the small modern society that has been developed the paradox of a restaurant with a beloved icecream machine needless to point out further and despised by Herzog and with a scene of people having an unusual way of training in case they would get lost in a blizzard. From then on at least I was hooked and from these minor steps of humanity looking itself if but slightly in the mirror the movie blossoms into a greater and greater abyss of questions that human beings will always feel the hunger to answer questions they never will be able to answer but questions that human beings will always need to have.Human beings now there's another thing. Herzog encounters a lot of inhabitants of the station and gets to know them and while not to say that there aren't interesting people throughout the movie but here we have the adventurous woman who has her own party trick where she amuses people by becoming luggage. She has many stories to tell like how she hitchhiked from USA to Africa in a sewer pipe. Another man claims he once survived getting killed by the mayans . There are others with less dramatic things to say. Like one of the biologist divers slightly sad since he's decided that at that very day he will perform his last dive. He feels like his job is done. Another man is simply showing how he has two fingers of the same length which would prove that he's got Aztec blood in his veins. Or so they say.You might understand what I'm getting at. In these very sequences of utter realism we do get to feel the fresh air of a normal day out at the Antarctica. And it helps settle the notion that this is a film about humanity. We are constantly in the real world with real people in contrast to Grizzly Man 2005 Herzog's previous nature documentary where we were indeed surrounded by breathtaking nature but we were also viewing the Timothy Treadwell show put on by the star persona of himself if there ever were another. Here we meet the actual answer to Treadwell's love to nature. Science philosophy mere being in the never ending light over the ices. Herzog seems very much in love with nature be it ice skies underneath the surface or active thundering volcanoes or just the remarkable penguin scene that could break your heart even Herzog could not resist one of those sentimental scenes directed by nature despite even claiming early on that this is not a penguin film. It may be penguins but it's hauntingly beautiful nonetheless.Throughout the movie Herzog keeps expanding his view on nature and humanity until we reach the end and the topic we've all been waiting for. The climate change. As you'd expect though Encounters at the End of the World is by no means a propaganda film it would obviously be beneath Herzog's dignity. No it seems like Herzog quietly accepts that mankind might be headed for doom  it's as natural as the deranged penguins leaving it's flock to never return  and instead asks what alien lifeforms might think of our remains if they would land to explore in thousands of years. Yes the explorations goes on. And I think it is importance to remember that the end of the world is not the end of the world. Mother Earth will be alright. She has all the time in the universe. Makind however we may be getting near the end. I can't help but feel when I see the colossal wide arctic images and the spreading cancerstain of urbanism that after all mankind has done Mother Earth deserves to be left alone for a while.

	onyx:emotionText "The world ends at Antarctica at least geographically  there's nothing further south  and quite possibly in a greater sense. Werner Herzog has gone there to make a film catching the opportunity to capture some of it's beauty in a way rarely seen on film and also to share some of his thoughts about nature and humanity. In and around the large McMurdo Research Station he circulates the various people working there joins them on their fieldwork and interviews them all resulting in a blend of beautiful images personal microstories funny sidetracks well paced informative moments and an often fascinating look at nature's inexplicable mystery humanity's as well as Mother Earth's.This is a large canvas perhaps slightly difficult to put in proper words. Above all all of the ideas and thoughts within the movie stems largely from the viewer's own imagination Herzog is merely  with his warm and serious yet inexplicable witty narration  planting the mental seeds and asking the questions some rhetorical and some forever impossible to answer. And it is remarkable how he does this how this film is designed. All throughout Herzog moves about like a genuine tourist and at the beginning I am surprised how spontaneous the whole idea feels almost as if I am actually watching a private home video made for personal remembrance. The only difference being of course that it would be the kind of home video Herzog would make. And be that as it may this is still a great movie because it continues from this elementary first stage of how he travels to the station combined with stock footage of the explorers of the 1800s into that of a true thinker's exploration in a romantic setting. The form of the film gradually evolves first small steps with the reality of the small modern society that has been developed the paradox of a restaurant with a beloved icecream machine needless to point out further and despised by Herzog and with a scene of people having an unusual way of training in case they would get lost in a blizzard. From then on at least I was hooked and from these minor steps of humanity looking itself if but slightly in the mirror the movie blossoms into a greater and greater abyss of questions that human beings will always feel the hunger to answer questions they never will be able to answer but questions that human beings will always need to have.Human beings now there's another thing. Herzog encounters a lot of inhabitants of the station and gets to know them and while not to say that there aren't interesting people throughout the movie but here we have the adventurous woman who has her own party trick where she amuses people by becoming luggage. She has many stories to tell like how she hitchhiked from USA to Africa in a sewer pipe. Another man claims he once survived getting killed by the mayans . There are others with less dramatic things to say. Like one of the biologist divers slightly sad since he's decided that at that very day he will perform his last dive. He feels like his job is done. Another man is simply showing how he has two fingers of the same length which would prove that he's got Aztec blood in his veins. Or so they say.You might understand what I'm getting at. In these very sequences of utter realism we do get to feel the fresh air of a normal day out at the Antarctica. And it helps settle the notion that this is a film about humanity.

	schema:reviewBody "Encounters at the End of the World 2008  There is no point that is south of the south pole. That's a no brainer but have you ever thought about that before reading that statement? Such a simple and obvious saying yet there's something quite poignant buried within it. It's pointed out by one of Werner Herzog's dreamers  a philosopher and part time forklift driver  that he found on his encounters at the end of the world.Herzog begins his new documentary warning us that this will not be another film about fluffy penguins his questions about nature are far different. For example why does a sophisticated creature like a chimp not make use of inferior creatures  they could saddle goats and ride off into the sunset. Herzog delivers with a pondering and quizzical film. Encounters at the End of the World is about the intricacies  and insanities  of life on Antarctica. His visit was spurred on by the footage taken by one of the underice divers a friend of his. He opens the film with the images of what appears to be hauntingly blue skies and bubbly white clouds but its not skies nor clouds but the clear waters and hulking ice. Herzog always fascinated with the oddity and great beauty of the natural world fills his documentary with stunning images and sequences. Underwater divers film strange creatures under the ice and massive ice formations while navigating their way back to the single hole in the ice without tether lines to guide them. Volcanologists traverse dormant lava tubes only having to be weary of poison gases that can be found in some.Herzog's base of operations is McMurdo the largest settlement on the continent. He describes it as an ugly mining town. And it is ugly. It's filled with scientists wanderers adventurers and dreamers all looking to 'jump off the margins of the map' as one observer puts it. It also has abominations such as aerobics and yoga studios even an ATM. Before he go in the field he like everyone else must attend survival school where among other things students learn to build shelter and then must spend the night in it. They also partake in a white out simulation achieved by wearing white buckets on their heads. They wander out to find the instructor playing a lost peer. As they get disorientated the scene becomes comical but also points out our inferiority when up against nature.Herzog does make a stop to visit some penguins briefly and the man who studies them  reportedly no longer much of a conversationist with humans since he spends so much time isolated with penguins. Herzog's questions are amusing but thoughtful. Are there gay penguins? Is there such thing as madness among penguins? The answer to that last question leads to one of the films most memorable and profound sequences.The film at once is an admiration of those who find themselves working at the end of the world and an admonition of the manipulation of adventure. Herzog wastes no time on the uninteresting people there. He talks with a scientist who describes a horrifying world that would tear us apart  if it were not too small to be seen by the human eye. He also shows old science fiction movies and warns of our fate. Some of them gather during the night still day lit for a jam session on top of their hut.Another woman discusses how she rode through South America in a sewer pipe then zips herself into a travel bag. Another man a plumber says his hands prove that he is descended from Aztec and Inca royalty. On the other hand he admonishes the notion of adventure for conquer. Shackleton came not for the sake of adventure but to claim the South Pole. He almost lampoons some of his subjects but is never disrespectful and clearly admires all of them.The name of the film is something of a double entendre. Herzog frequently ponders another life after humans are gone. What would they think of us when they come see what we're doing in Antarctica? There are references to global warming and threats to our planet but Herzog is no issue of the day crusader. So many other documentaries would condescend to us and have. Green has become the fad of the day annoying many instead of enlightening. Herzog is too much of an enigma to pander or preach to us and that's part of the reason why Encounters at the End of the World is so special.Werner Herzog is a man incapable of making a dull film. What is entirely true in this documentary is questionable as it is in his others. His pursuit of ecstatic truth  semifictions to capture the essence of what is more truthful than truth  gives him license to embellish. But no matter if he has some of his interviewees script some details I do no care to know which. I'm happy being mesmerized by the stories they tell as is.For me a Werner Herzog film is like pulling on a warm pair of slippers on a cold winter day and pulling up by the fire to read a favorite book. Herzog was one of the first filmmakers to draw me into the world of great filmmaking and for that I forever owe him a great debt of gratitude. And it was Roger Ebert who lead me to him so how fitting that this beautiful film was dedicated to him.".

Hearing the inorganically musical underwater vocalizations of Weddell seals through the theater's multichannel speaker system was alone worth the price of admission. One of the scientists studying the pinnipeds aptly describes their varied and otherworldly sounds as Pink Floydian. I am also pleased to have beheld extended footage of the magnificent world beneath the sea ice. It is a teeming environment whose surface we are only beginning to scratch and I cannot blame Herzog for choosing choral background music that perhaps screams awe a bit too loudly there is no danger of it cheapening the majesty of the frozen stalactites or the splendor of the sunlight dispersing through the iceceiling. Lastly I'll note the humor usually intentional that Herzog uncharacteristically displays. His Teutonic deadpan is not his only comedic asset he has a keen sense of the ridiculous and ample targets among the many dubious denizens of the Antarctic.My complaints are essentially twofold. First the movie is disjointed. It is a hodgepodge of Herzog's encounters with various Antarctic researchers and residents there is no apparent order or theme. This is a minor criticism as most of the segments make for fine viewing on their own but it would have been more satisfying if Herzog had presented a unifying thesis or two about the Light Continent aside from the oftrepeated observation that it is populated by a fair number of professional dreamers. He should have at least arranged the segments in a clearly meaningful sequence. At its best the film made no more of an impression on me than that was beautiful that was cool or I didn't know that. Second and more significantly Herzog's narration is at times irritating. As someone who has studied climate change I share his frustration and pessimism. But there is no call for saddling the film's final moments with apocalyptic platitudes e.g. the end of human life is assured and a cursory reference to global warming. These sentiments are incongruous with the rest of the film which does not substantially address environmentalism and whose most haunting scene is of a mad penguin that abandons its flock and runs inland towards distant mountains to certain death with a singular determination. Herzog's doomsayings in any event are better communicated by the satellite images of rapidly melting polar ice that we observe on a climatologist's computer screen. I know that Herzog is capable of more measured reflections on the impersonal and uncontrollable power of nature for example from Grizzly Man what haunts me is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed I discover no kinship no understanding no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a halfbored interest in food. But for Timothy Treadwell this bear was a friend a savior. In Encounters Herzog superficially and selfindulgently overstates his case. I'm looking forward to his next film.".

I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me there is no such thing as a secret world of the bears. And this blank stare speaks only of a halfbored interest in food. But for Timothy Treadwell this bear was a friend a savior. In Encounters Herzog superficially and selfindulgently overstates his case. I'm looking forward to his next film.";

He also warned them it would not result in film about fluffy penguins.This is not Shackleton's Antarctica. The main US base is more like a mining colony anywhere on the fringes of civilization then what you think of when you think Antarctica. Its strangely modern and looks to be almost anywhere people mine. Indeed there is an odd shot of the modern camp with Scott's hut in the distance that signals how times have changed.Herzog's film is really about some of the wayward travelers who have reached the frontier. Herzog is curious what sort of people they are and finds them to be a rather philosophical lot. They are what you would consider explorers of the 18th or 19th century looking for something greater then themselves. As one guy says Where else do you find guys with Phds doing the dishes or linguists on the one place on earth where there is no native language. Its an amusing portrait of people I think many of us would like to be.We also get a portrait of what life is like there. Of the eternal sun which annoys HerzogOf the drabness of the living quarters motel likemixed with individual expression. We see the survival training the various scientific studies going on including one about penguins which cause Herzog to ponder if they go mad. and we see the landscape both above and below the ice on land and in the sea. These portraits of the land and seascapes are stunning. Herzog's ability to mix music and image creates some hypnotic passages that in part reminded me Koyaanisqatsi or Luc Besson's Atlantis. Its magical and creates sequences that you hate to see end.If there is any flaw is that the film kind of just ends. There is a wonderful final quote by Alan Watts but the film ultimately feels like a philosophical travelogue about a summer vacation instead of something grander then what I saw on my vacation. I'm sure had it not been Werner Herzog behind the camera I would not have been disappointed.Still you must see the film on a big screen if you can. Its really beautiful at times. It will enlighten and inspire you much more than this review will. And even though this is a Discovery Channel film I'm glad I saw it where I did because there is something about the end credits with the seal songs echoing all thorough the theater from front to back that you can't get at home. The long confines of the Film Forum in New York really allows for the magic of a sound scape.7.5 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Mixes the sublime and the banal";
	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for answers as to why a red worm lives in the anus of static sea life or the consistency of the milk of a baby seal you have come to the right place. The latest Werner Herzog documentary dedicated to Roger Ebert Encounters at the End of the World is a study of man and his interaction with nature in the iceladen rivers mountains and shores of Antarctica. Still searching for the bizarre and the eccentric Herzog takes us as far south as it is possible to go where he meets and interviews scientists researchers travelers and a variety of oddball characters looking for meaning and purpose. Herzog's documentary is loosely constructed and overly long freely mixing the sublime and the banal. Like some of his other works it is filled with gorgeous cinematography exquisite music and Herzog's unique commentary spoken in a somber musical voice that has a distinct poetic quality that strives for profundity.Herzog was paid by the Discovery Channel and the National Science Foundation to travel to McMurdo Station in Antarctica to gain some insight into the mysteries of the land at the bottom of the world promising only that he would not come up with another film about penguins. He criticizes McMurdo as an ugly mining town and rails against the noise and the tractors and yoga and aerobics which he calls an abomination. His study of course is less about the sex life of the penguins than about the oddball humans and why they have gone to great lengths to travel to the bottom of the earth. We meet a linguist who had studied the disappearance of native languages but is now growing hydroponic tomatoes in a tin hut a traveler who went from Ecuador to Peru in a sewer pipe a plumber who is convinced the shape of his hands points to a royal Aztec heritage and a woman who contorts her body to fit into a gym bag. We see scientist huddled together watching the science fiction thriller Them from 1954 and probably films of other genres that even Herzog was not able to include.We are also privy to a humorous training exercise as Herzog follows a survival class at McMurdo in which trainees put a white bucket over their heads to match the blindness they would encounter in a windstorm. Connected to each other they search blindly for the trainer who is actually only fifty feet away perhaps an inadvertent metaphor for humans trying to connect with God. Like all of Herzog's films there is an upside and perhaps the main reason to see the movie are entrancing underwater ballet sequences of the divers who risk their life every time they plunge in to the freezing waters shots of the beautiful caves carved in the South Pole and satellite images of sea ice compressed into an animated montage. Throughout the film Herzog finds the most beautiful music imaginable  Mongolian chants included with original compositions by experimental composerguitarist Henry Kaiser who coproduced the film and provided the music with David Lindley.All of this beauty strives for a spiritual context but comes up short. Sadly little attention is paid to subjects such as global warming and how it may affect the future of the region and of mankind. The scientists he interviews are some of the top men in their field but most are convinced that the human race is doomed to extinction a proposition not challenged by Herzog who is too busy excoriating yoga penguin movies aerobics environmentalists tree huggers and whale huggers and asking such questions as whether or not penguins are gay or insane. Perhaps the most telling sequence is the one most probably staged by Herzog in which an individual penguin refuses to follow the group heading to open water but instead opts for a lonely and sad journey to the mountains likely to result in certain death. It tells more perhaps about Herzog than about penguins or the human condition.".

	schema:headline " A Lot Of Interesting Moments To Someone Unfamiliar With Antarctica";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought that Encounters at the End of the World was a very good look at several different people's lives who live in Antarctica. One of my favorite things about this movie is how it does not focus on only one group of people in Antarctica but instead sheds a little bit of light on many different aspects. It shows everyone from truck drivers to seal researchers to divers to construction workers. There are a lot of interesting things that the audience gets to view in this film. From how life in McMurdo looks to the divers and the creatures that they see under the water to how some of the penguins run around and act it is all really neat to get a look at.Of the negative reviews that I have read about this movie many stated that he did not focus enough on all the indepth science that was occurring. It's true that he did not but that was not the point of this film. This film was meant to give a basic on the surface overview of one man's experience of his trip to Antarctica.Other negative reviews that I read said that Herzog had his own agenda in Antarctica and spent too much time with his own voice overs and opinions. Again this film focuses on Herzog's experience and views. I felt like his voice overs were appropriate. I like his thoughts shared throughout the course of the movie.This movie does not play like a show you might see on the Discovery Channel.

	onyx:emotionText "I thought that Encounters at the End of the World was a very good look at several different people's lives who live in Antarctica. One of my favorite things about this movie is how it does not focus on only one group of people in Antarctica but instead sheds a little bit of light on many different aspects. It shows everyone from truck drivers to seal researchers to divers to construction workers. There are a lot of interesting things that the audience gets to view in this film. From how life in McMurdo looks to the divers and the creatures that they see under the water to how some of the penguins run around and act it is all really neat to get a look at.Of the negative reviews that I have read about this movie many stated that he did not focus enough on all the indepth science that was occurring. It's true that he did not but that was not the point of this film. This film was meant to give a basic on the surface overview of one man's experience of his trip to Antarctica.Other negative reviews that I read said that Herzog had his own agenda in Antarctica and spent too much time with his own voice overs and opinions. Again this film focuses on Herzog's experience and views. I felt like his voice overs were appropriate. I like his thoughts shared throughout the course of the movie.This movie does not play like a show you might see on the Discovery Channel. It does not deeply focus on any one thing but instead shows a little about a lot of different things. If you do not know much about life in Antarctica and want to see a broad scope of it this is a very good movie to see.";

	schema:reviewBody "Well as someone who spent seasons at McMurdo and at the South Pole I can say Herzog got some things right. There really is trouble when Frosty Boy goes down and the sky is amazing in its own right down on the Ice. I just wish he had brought a bit less of his agenda and let more of the actual place show in his film. I'm sorry the reality of keeping science going on the Ice is somewhat messier than Mr. Herzog would like. Having seen the trash heaps of the great Antarctic explorers when they were here I'm sure they were just as messy and even smellier. Also there are about 1000 people who work on the Ice making it possible for the science to happen. The four chosen to represent the community are nice people but no more or less typical than any of us whom he did not chose to show. I know he filmed a bunch more peopleI was there when he did so. Not only is the soundtrack horrible but the ambient sound is heavily edited too. No flight down from NZ is silenteveryone has earplugs in and the roar still rattles your brain. The choppers are noisy too as are all of the various vehicles. It would have been nice to get some of the huge silence that you find anywhere more than 5 minutes walk from the center of Town. And the sciencethe main reason we go down year after year was treated as sort of a joke. These researchers have a very short time to do all of their field workmost are there for less than 3 months. To have to put up with a film crew asking idiotic questions was an intrusion that they really didn't need. And there's way better footage available of the underice marine lifeit was just taken by other divers. You could do very well watching this with the sound off and subtitles rolling. As for how Herzog got his grant the NSF gives out 5 or 6 artist grants every year. They want to expand the type of exposure that Antarctica is given as well as record a different type of human interaction with the environment. One of the other art works that happened that year was a set of blue spheres in different sizes set out on the ice and filmed from the air and by satellite. It was pretty cool. And I know nothing about the sturgeon under the South Pole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of us think that Antartica is a frozen dead land most of us maybe doesn't even know that there is a civilization a goddamn city with around 1000 people who stayed there each summer. This movie really brings a new perspective to the most unknown continent in our world how is life in there especially the people the inhabitants who can proudly say I'm ANTARTICAN!! to the world. This film is mainly about the story of people who live in Antartica a documentary about their own personal experience of leaving their home and human civilization behind and sought the new life of adventure and traveling. We are shown a wide array of personal experiences from a physics professor in search of some hypothetical particles to runaway prisoner who has been taking refuge in Antartica.Aside from the new insight about life in Antartica this film also provides us with some brilliant shot about the landscape in Antartica the underwater shot is extremely beautifulbut they could have done better with the shot on the mountain and stuff. The director also includes some weird ambient 1920's or 30's movie clip that somewhat doesn't really makes sense. And finally the message of this movie is kind a ambiguous it doesn't make any real statement about the global warming effects on Antartica or anything else for us to do. It is somewhat usual kind of Discovery Channel or National Geographic documentary which only show us some information without really adding some statement or opinion about it. It's just like the usual education movie we see in our environmental or biology class. In the nutshell this movie really gives us a brand new view about Antartica but nothing more. If you are expecting a brain beating conscience knocking documentary about some untold true story in some part of the world like Jesus Camp or An Inconvenient Truth this is not a film for you..".

	schema:reviewBody "Werner Herzog after seeing some footage of Antarctica from a researcher there is persuaded to cover the researchers the environment and work done in the Antarctic. Herzog's inquisitive mind is typically drawn in multiple different directions and in reading some some criticisms of the film the absence of a clear focus is the film's largest shortcoming. However I think this is cutting off the nose to spite the hand. How many of these people knew anything of significance about the South Pole? I would suggest not all that many and this film is useful in educating people about multiple aspects of life in Antarctica.He is interested in the array of fascinating people who end up working down there. There is a PhD driving a tractor a dishwasher who is a philosopher and a lady who traveled across Europe and Africa in a sewage pipe. People who are willing to work in Antarctica are fascinating for their broad outlooks on all topics. I say this as someone who has lived in multiple countries and had many very interesting jobs himself. I found their introspective thoughtful pointsofview on complex multileveled problems to be very helpful.Herzog also does a fascinating section on penguin behavior including the fact that sometimes penguins walk away from the pack of penguins in which they live over mountains and into the snowy wilderness toward certain death. I was fascinated to learn just how big the Antarctic was. Herzog's attention to penguins is also devoted to how some penguins prostitute themselves in order to keep their eggs warm. In short Herzog's interest in penguins is certainly not that of most conventional documentarians who might want to depict the lives and experiences of penguins in a rather upbeat feelgood manner.Herzog also offers us some interesting footage of the main Antarctic settlement at McMurdo station from above and we see a sprawling rather industrial and dirtylooking settlement there. We learn of some of the conveniences therea bowling lane several modern restaurants and a couple other places that would not be out of place in Peoria IL.Herzog's coverage of the marine life in the Antarctic and the work of the scientists who investigate the nature of that life is very interesting insofar as the marine life there is very odd and the scientists discover new species all the time. The scientists seem fascinated by the the simplicity of the species and just how old or complex those species are. One of the scientists working there is completing his last day of work as a scientist and decides to do his last dive as a scientist the day that Herzog is filming there. The scientists express great dismay and pessimism about the future of life on this planet given some of the things that they see in the South Pole Truly if you want a fascinating unconventional look at life in a place about which very little is known this is a great place to start.".

I would suggest not all that many and this film is useful in educating people about multiple aspects of life in Antarctica.He is interested in the array of fascinating people who end up working down there. There is a PhD driving a tractor a dishwasher who is a philosopher and a lady who traveled across Europe and Africa in a sewage pipe. People who are willing to work in Antarctica are fascinating for their broad outlooks on all topics. I say this as someone who has lived in multiple countries and had many very interesting jobs himself. I found their introspective thoughtful pointsofview on complex multileveled problems to be very helpful.Herzog also does a fascinating section on penguin behavior including the fact that sometimes penguins walk away from the pack of penguins in which they live over mountains and into the snowy wilderness toward certain death. I was fascinated to learn just how big the Antarctic was. Herzog's attention to penguins is also devoted to how some penguins prostitute themselves in order to keep their eggs warm. In short Herzog's interest in penguins is certainly not that of most conventional documentarians who might want to depict the lives and experiences of penguins in a rather upbeat feelgood manner.Herzog also offers us some interesting footage of the main Antarctic settlement at McMurdo station from above and we see a sprawling rather industrial and dirtylooking settlement there. We learn of some of the conveniences therea bowling lane several modern restaurants and a couple other places that would not be out of place in Peoria IL.Herzog's coverage of the marine life in the Antarctic and the work of the scientists who investigate the nature of that life is very interesting insofar as the marine life there is very odd and the scientists discover new species all the time. The scientists seem fascinated by the the simplicity of the species and just how old or complex those species are. One of the scientists working there is completing his last day of work as a scientist and decides to do his last dive as a scientist the day that Herzog is filming there. The scientists express great dismay and pessimism about the future of life on this planet given some of the things that they see in the South Pole Truly if you want a fascinating unconventional look at life in a place about which very little is known this is a great place to start.";

As usual Richard gave an excellent performance for which I am never disappointed. Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich were great choices for the female characters and effectively displayed the contrast between the personalities of the women. This movie contained real aspects to a person's dilemma's in relationships...from a sterile business 'association' with his first wife to a passionate and truly loving 'reallife' affair with the woman he met in a chance encounter. The drama of the accident was well done and suspenseful. In the end the most touching aspect was that neither woman wished to hurt the other by disclosing what they each believed to be true  both were loved and wanted. I enjoyed it very much and it is a muchwatched movie in my home with all actors performing excellently. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a love story which is true to reallife.".

Stone is especially good as the calculating Sally whose formidable personality holds together only at the fast pace of highend social and professional success.

Spirited Davidovich is very appealing as a vital woman deeply connected to fundamental contentedness and freedom.Some philosophy is in order when considering this intimate thoughtful film. It portrays various aspects of the human condition without embodying them. For instance Richard Gere plays a man in the grip of profound indecision but director Mark Rydell's hand is sure and his intent clear Whatever you're going to do do it!'. The movie compresses the many small but meaningful moments that make up a lifetime into a taut montage of images flashing before the viewer's eyes evoking the close link between life time and death. It shows how the simplest smallest gesture can trigger an epiphany of profound meaning as someone struggles to find clarity in their life. Best of all the movie illustrates how even in tragedy everyone can come away with something positive worth clinging to whether it's a message on an answering machine a hurtful letter undelivered or a plunge into the depths of peace.".

The first time I watched it that's what I thought too  and yes I did feel a little ripped off discovering that in the end it doesn't really matter what his choice is.That's when I realized that this film is about much more than just the main character. EVERYONE in the film has choices  difficult choices  to make. There's a reason for the film's name. Vincent is the intersection point of everyone around him and this story is about how everyone else is affected by the situation just as much as it is about Vincent himself.On the first viewing I enjoyed the film primarily for Richard Gere's haunting understated portrayal of an emotionally tormented burned out man struggling to navigate his way through life so that he gets what he wants and needs without hurting the people closest to him  and becoming emotionally paralyzed when he realizes that it's impossible leading to tragic consequences.It isn't until the last scene that the film reveals its true focus. Only then does the viewer realize that the story's preoccupation with Vincent  even the accident itself playing out in slowmotion over the course of the film  is nothing but a clever distraction designed to divert the viewer's attention so that the final scene is even more unexpected and powerful. Stone and Davidovich both turn in brilliant performances and their confrontation absolutely crackles with emotional tension. It took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate the depth of their performances and see everything that leads up to that final moment. Because in the end that's what really made this film work for me. It's not about Vincent because his choice is rendered tragically pointless. He is merely the catalyst. The film's true focus is on the choices of Vincent's wife and mistress and what they decide to take away from their relationships with him. The film's suspense doesn't come from Vincent's fate it comes from knowing that Sally and Olivia both have the power to hurt each other deeply and wondering whether or not they will choose to use that power.".

Not that that sentence that I just penned is a great example of those qualities but I digress...The movie features fine performances from all involved including Lolia Davidovich and Sharon Stone and the prettymuchalways excellent Richard Gere.  Gere's character is convincing and real but perhaps a tad too real because he's a pretty wishywashy fellow and his is not the most compelling of roles.  Then again neither is anyone else's really.  The two female leads get marginally more to wrap their skills around but the whole is way less than the sum of its parts.  A 98minute film Intersection seems a lot longer and I found myself calculating timeelapsed and timeremaining at more than one point.  Hardly a good sign.  Sure there are no Ramboesque explosions and car chases though a highspeed driving theme is at the movie's heart but I'm not the type of male who has to have that kind of thing to keep me engaged.  A story might be nice though.  I mean a story that hangs together.  In the absence of much direction and in the presence of multiple and confusing layers of flashback the actors' great work is sabotaged.  It just doesn't really seem to go anywhere.  When the film finished I felt the sentiment echoed in that old Peggy Lee song...Is that all there is?  And I don't like Peggy Lee darn it!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a vastly superior remake of a French film called Les Choses de La Vie by Claude Sautet starring Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider. I had known the original film for many years because of its theme music....which is absolutely magnificent and composed by Philippe Sarde. The film itself is really a load of slow boring and tedious crap ........a car accident is repeated in slow motion I don't know how many times but enough to drive one mad on that score alone ! Also it was very repetitive and had little deep character development. In short its saving grace was its soundtrack !!!Intersection on the other hand which I saw when it came out in Cinemas in France and subsequently bought on DVD has always been a great favorite of mine ! So much better than the Les Choses de La Vie that to compare the two is quite frankly a total waste of time. To be truthful when I saw Intersection I did not make the connection with Les Choses de La Vie such was the greatness of Intersection compared to the banality of the other film ! It's only by reading about the film that I discovered this.From what appears to be a relatively limited plot we have magnificent performances from the three principal actors especially the two ladies ! Of course the redhaired Olivia Marchak was an absolute beauty but even Sharon Stone whom I don't usually like in films had something attractive about her ! Gere had a weak cowardly and annoying character  I don't like seeing people cheat on their wives  but I must admit he played the part very well. I was especially subdued by Olivia both by her physical beauty and here quasiunflappable character in what could have been tense situations.The final fifteen to twenty minutes of the film is the best part because ......you know it's going to happen .....but you don't want it to ......but it's destiny. I liked the bit about the letter he wrote to Olivia but never posted plus the message he left on Olivia's ansafone but where SHaron Stone came by accident into possession of the letter which was written but never posted. All that really got to me at the end and filled me with a strange emotion somewhere between happiness and sadness and is very difficult to describe. By this deft twist of the plot each of the Ladies believed he loved ......her !! An excellent way to finish the film.I have watched the film four or five times and each time I am filled with the same emotion .....so there must be something there !".

Sharone Stone Lolita Davidavich and Martin Landau round out the cast but this is clearly a Richard Gere film. Although I'm generally not a fan of Gere he is excellent in this. This does have the feel of a European film and although I've never seen the original I would like to. I'd likely find it better as a whole.

Gere just couldn't make a decision and when he finally decides his decision leads to his finding peace.I have read the other reviews and I think that people didn't give this movie a chance. Yes it's simple yes we have seen the love triangle before yes we have seen Sharon Stone in this role before but bring all those elements together include Richard Gere who's best acting before this movie was in Looking for Mr. Goodbar and you have a great classic. I recommend turning up the sound at the end so that you can appreciate the score and how the music is a key character in the film.Listen I am not a Richard Gere fan but he is the most underrated actor in America. He is so good at his craft and has been doing it for so many years that you don't realize that he is working at it. There is a scene when he is parked in front of a diner and he makes a call to his girlfriend with his decision. This one scene is the best acting of his career because it's so natural and unlike Gere as you have seen him in other movies. Check it out...give it a chance....".

The movie is a series of flashbacks that Vincent Eastman Richard Gere is having of the demise of his marriage to wife Sally played surprisingly well by Sharon Stone and the budding romance he has with the other woman Lolita Davidovich. The flashbacks are very entertaining and pull you in as you wonder what Vincent is going to do. Previous to viewing this film I never thought much of Sharon Stone as an actor but she acquits herself well in this role. I don't want to give away any vital information and I'm not one to point out little nuances that the director might be adding but it is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Lolita Davidovich is delightful as the quirky breath of fresh air Vince finds surreptitiously. An added bonus upon recently returning to this film I was bowled over to see that the once unknown daughter of Vince and Sally was none other than a very young Jennifer Morrison of House and Once Upon A Time fame.".

The choice of the sultry harmonica and violins is so beautiful and only adds to the wonderful story. While rooting for Vincent and Olivia to finally become a couple and live out their dream of marriage and their dream home...the wedding scene at the end captures your heart and gives you hope while the agony on Olivia and Sally's faces at the hospital is gut wrenching.The way Gere's thoughts are captured at the end is remarkable. I've truly never seen anything like it. The way the two women protect each other from hurt is a bit unbelievable because I tend to think women would rather enjoy letting the other woman know she was his first choice....however it is sad and kind all in one. It only reinforces that we all need to make every move count. It may be our last. Excellent film.".

While rooting for Vincent and Olivia to finally become a couple and live out their dream of marriage and their dream home...the wedding scene at the end captures your heart and gives you hope while the agony on Olivia and Sally's faces at the hospital is gut wrenching.The way Gere's thoughts are captured at the end is remarkable. I've truly never seen anything like it. The way the two women protect each other from hurt is a bit unbelievable because I tend to think women would rather enjoy letting the other woman know she was his first choice....however it is sad and kind all in one. It only reinforces that we all need to make every move count. It may be our last. Excellent film.";

	schema:reviewBody "This listless and confused tale of love gone lame is useful only as a crystal clear demonstration of the difference between movie stars and everybody else.Vincent Eastman Richard Gere is a man with more hair than he can handle speeding down a road through the Pacific Northwest when he swerves to avoid a stalled hippie van in the road and heads straight on into a semi. In the midst of the accident the movie becomes a flashback of the last few days of Vincent's life. We see that Vincent is recently divorced from his coldly beautiful wife Sally Sharon Stone working to be a good dad to their daughter Meaghan Jennifer Morrison and banging his wild redheaded girlfriend Olivia Lolita Davidovich. Though Vincent doesn't want to be with Sally anymore he doesn't want to leave behind his family and the architectural business he and Sally own together. So we get a bunch of blase' crap about him being torn between his old and new life and resenting the fact that Sally is moving on with a new man even though Vincent hooked up with Olivia when he was still married. Then we get flashbacks during the flashback showing us how Vincent was never really happy with the controlled and separate Sally and how he was swept away by the lively and engrossing Olivia. Then we catch back up to the time of the accident and after subjecting us to flashbacks within flashbacks the movie chucks a few fantasy sequences at the audience and closes with an ending that's supposed to be all touching and stuff but which actually proves these filmmakers never understood exactly what they were doing with the rest of the film.The most painfully obvious thing about watching Intersection is that Richard Gere and Sharon Stone are movie stars but Lolita Davidovichnot so much. Whatever quality it is that movie stars have on screen you can see it in Stone and Gere but you couldn't see it in Davidovich with an electron microscope. There's no sin in that. Most actors and actresses lack that quality. But if you're doing a story with three main characters and two of them are played by movie stars and the third isn't that dog won't hunt. It also doesn't help that Davidovich while pretty enough by any reasonable standard is not in Stone's league when it comes to beauty. Olivia is supposed to be this amazing woman who reignites Vincent's passion after years of being unfulfilled with Sally so Davidovich being less impressive than Stone on just about every level fatally undermines that whole idea.Davidovich can certainly act though Olivia is such a compromised character she's not really a person as much as she is a puppy dog who'll do anything to make her master happy. Vincent isn't much better. Outside of a scene where he acts like the uncompromising architect out of an Ayn Rand wet dream he doesn't really do anything but mope around. He's got this lovely smart capable woman who gave him a child and is largely responsible for his professional success but he's not satisfied with her. Then he's got this new woman who's funny and fresh and fiery and only wants to please him but he's not satisfied with her. I'm supposed to sympathize with this putz?Sally's the only decent character in the whole story and Stone is up to the job. She got a lot of praise for her work in Casino but I think this film is where Stone really demonstrated her chops as an actress. Sally honestly loves Vincent and there's nothing wrong with her. She simply doesn't have it in her to give Vincent what he needs.So Intersection is a movie almost exclusively about three characters. Only one of them is well drawn and only two of them are portrayed by movie stars. That cinematic math doesn't add up.There is a ridiculously gratuitous topless scene with Davidovich's perky rack on display. There's also some laboriously ham handed direction that tries to emphasize how deep and meaningful this story is supposed to be. Then there's than ending where these filmmakers forgot that you can't make a story completely about one thing and then make it about something else at the very end.Intersection is another one of those bad films that isn't aggressively bad. It's just so flawed in so many fundamental ways that it can't amount to anything.".

The main character Vincent Eastman Richard Gere is standing outside the store and the old farmer asks him Are you lost? That question is a capsule of the life of a gifted architect who is a deeply troubled human being. Indeed he is lost from start to finish in this turgid melodrama.There are two women in the life of Eastman that figure prominently in that fateful question asked by the farmer. The first is Sally Eastman Sharon Stone the daughter of the head of the architectural firm when Vincent became a superstar. Sally is the planner and Vincent is the creator in their work and evidently in their marriage. But it was never really clear what drove a wedge into their relationship. The only clue weare given is that Vincent began an affair that came as a complete shock to Sally when she first learned about it. The affair apparently destroyed the marriage.The other woman is Olivia Marshak Lolita Davidovich a witty columnist who begins her fateful affair with the married architect after they met by chance at an auction. In many ways Olivia is the most sympathetic character in the film. She is completely humiliated when she shows up unannounced at the opening of a new museum designed by Vincent. Sally is present with her new male paramour and daughter. Yet Vincent humiliates Olivia and even physically abuses her for daring to appear uninvited in the presence of his exspouse.The beautiful cinematography of Seattle and Vancouver is contrasted with the tawdry moments of the love triangle. Some moments are downright comical such as the longwinded phone message left for Olivia by Vincent where he proclaims with manic energy that he wants to marry her and have babies. Of course the marriage certificate and the progeny will solve all of his problems and take away his sense of being lost!In addition to interpersonal relations skills Vincent really needs to work on his driving. Buckle up for safety and respect the Canadian speed limits Vince! For her performance as Sally Sharon Stone received a Stinker award. That moniker is a good one for the film as a whole.".

Any time we hear it or parts of the main themes are played it immediately evokes this romantic film of 1945. It's a tribute to its director David Lean that after more than sixty years it still is one of the most cherished movie experiences for a lot of people that saw it or that are just getting acquainted with it.Brief Encounter owes it all to one of the best talent in the English speaking world of the last century Noel Coward. As part of his Tonight at Eight theater work this one act play Still Life was turned by its author and David Lean into what we know as Brief Encounter a bittersweet account of two lovers doomed from the start.The film works because the exquisite chemistry between its two stars Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. Both these actors make Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey come alive and stay with us every time we view this timeless film. The story is not far fetched and is made real by the two stars that elevate it to one of the best films of all times. The movie is done with an impeccable sense of decorum and style yet it has such a sexy subtext. That was a time when a film didn't have to bare it all in order to catch the viewer's imagination. In fact Laura and Alec let us know without being specific about the passion that both feel for one another.Celia Johnson was not a great beauty. Neither was Trevor Howard the epitome of handsomeness yet their scenes together project such a heat as the one that their characters are feeling at any given moment. The fact the two illicit lovers are played by people one could relate to is what makes the film resonate the way it does every time we watch it. Of course we realize this situation had no future from the start yet one keeps hoping their love will end well.The supporting cast is excellent. Stanley Holloway is seen as the station master Albert. Joyce Carey is perfect as the woman in charge of the refreshment area of the station where Laura and Alec spend some of their time together. Cyril Raymond makes Fred Jesson a man who perhaps understand much more than what he lets know. Everly Gregg is seen as the chattering Dolly Messiter.Brief Encounter is one of the best films directed by David Lean a man who was able to give the film the right tone and made it the classic that it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "Have you really never seen Brief Encounter? What have you been doing all these years? You have a treat in store.I have a great love for British films of the 1940s. There seems to have been a great flowering of creative talent then and the films of the period look beautiful and have such wonderful characters in them. David Lean is more famous for his huge Technicolor epics like Lawrence of Arabia or A Passage to India but Brief Encounter is his most moving film. It is shot in atmospheric black and white and tells the story of two people who fall in love in mundane little England.Celia Johnston plays Laura a middle class woman who lives a happy but predictable life who meets Dr. Alec Harvey played by craggy Trevor Howard. There starts a doomed love affair set to the sweeping romantic sounds of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto. This single piece of music plays throughout the film and stirs up exactly the right emotions. The film will make you want to own a recording of the music.Such is the power and influence of this film that it has been remade a few times and spoofed on countless occasions. It created the archetype for the romantic farewell on a station platform with steam hissing from trains and an orchestra playing in the background. Though this has been copied often it has never been bettered. The film involves a few scenes on railway platforms and some of these are mundane others joyous or despairing wretched. The director uses many deft tricks to heighten the emotion all along the way. A simple tilt of the camera or contrasting mood of another character serves to add tremendous power to the emotion of the scenes.Times were different then. People were brasher accents were stronger and social attitudes to affairs quite different. The period of the film gives it much of its charm. It does not make it a cold study of a different culture however. The film is very personal. The character of Laura's husband is hardly seen in the entire film which means that we identify more with Laura's feelings. We see the affair and next to nothing else.Celia Johnson brings a great deal to the film. She is so likeable and so able to express the misery that her new love brings her. Her manner of speaking is quite alien to a modern ear. In the 1940s it was quite normal to add a Y sound to many words. Hat became hyat. The accents are not forced though  they come across as quite natural and very likeable.This film would not be made this way today. The modern audience would demand younger stars and nudity. See this film to witness how it was once possible to make films about love without bedroom scenes. Brief Encounter is very much stronger for lack of these. Stoicism and restraint are underrated traits in modern cinema. Modern directors and writers would do well to remind themselves with this film that a story can be given tremendous emotional power by techniques which seem to have been lost.".

Everything in it contributes something essential the lighting the unromantic railway station sets the minor characters and of course the music the ultraromantic Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no 2. The emotional rollercoaster of the illicit affair has seldom been better portrayed. Perhaps it is a little understated for transatlantic tastes but noone viewing this movie would not appreciate that the English can be as passionate as the rest of us.Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alec are perfect together. It being 1945 they do not get to bed  that would have ruined the audience's sympathy for them in those rather more censorious times. It's all in their minds but their faces give the game away  to each other and to the bystanders. Nothing happens to drag anyone near the awful divorce courts but you are left wondering whether Celia will ever feel quite the same about her dull comfortable patronising and boring husband. As for Alec he professes he will love her forever but then he's a man.Noel Coward produced this film from a short play of his from 1935 the war and postwar shortages are absent and his dulcet tones may be recognised in the railway station announcements. David Lean directed and it is a remarkable collaboration. The action is opened out a little  a row on the lake a drive in the country  but the scenes from the play set entirely in the railway refreshment rooms still remain the centre of the story. The parallel relationship between Albert the station guard Stanley Holloway and Myrtle the refreshment room attendant Joyce Carey is an interesting counterpoint to the angstridden middle class wouldbe adulterers. Surely Noel old boy you weren't suggesting that the working class handles this sort of thing better? We see things largely from Laura's point of view and perhaps Alec didn't feel quite so guilty but their consciences are going to make them pay. A gem of a movie.".

The immediate postWW 2 era in the UK was a period that saw Brits struggling with the disppearance of traditional social mores that had endured for over a century and the new world order that came about at the conclusion of the war.

And like their US sisters they were expected to relinquish those jobs to returning men.Brief Encounter is in many ways a metaphor for the struggle that men and women were going through stuck with having to conform to social expectations while bursting to escape to the greater independence glimpsed fleetingly and pleasurably during the war when everything and everyone were turned upside down.Being the work of Noel Coward that master observer of and commentator on English manners Brief Encounter frames this struggle as a torrid love story bubbling under the surface of British reserve which demands maintaining appearances at all costs regardless of the personal pain involved.This passionate pair who never even exchange a kiss are constrained and ultimately kept apart by expectationsof their families of their social positions of Great Britain.When Alec puts his hand on Laura's shoulder at their final unexpectedly truncated meeting in the station snack barwaiting room it's as erotic and far more touching than just about every sex scene you'll see in movies.The first reviewer completely missed the point and the relevance of this movie in film history and especially in British cinema history.".

	schema:reviewBody "YOU CAN SAFELY READ MY INTRO  NO SPOILERS TO STARTI adore this movie more every time I watch it.First just a brief introductory summary to whet your appetite for this great picture my all time favorite a vintage black and white film set in Britain during the 1940's... During one of her weekly Thursday shopping excursions in a neighboring town a rather plain though earnest and engaging contentedly married middle aged housewife named Laura encounters an affable and kind also married doctor Alec at the train station refreshment counter. Circumstances force a brief interaction and thus begins a series of Thursday meetings between the pair with casual chance acquaintance quickly replaced by growing and consuming attraction. Most of the scenes revolve around the station tea shop which serves as a sort of home base to the affair. It is Laura's tale thus the events and emotions are related totally from her point of view all to the romantic strains of Rachmaninof's Piano Concerto. Read all the other rave reviews about the superb acting  character portrayals the atmospheric enhancement of the whizzing and hissing trains and so on. They're all true...plot character setting and atmosphere are all done to perfection in this film. BEWARE  SPOILERS AHEADHowever if you want a little serious insight into this movie consider my unique take....Yes it's dramatically moving and intense that farewell touch of Alec's hand on Laura's shoulder. However I'm probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True the drama revolves around Laura and Alec their encounters at the train station their thwarted passions and their guilt ridden emotions especially Laura's. But let's remember Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband Fred obviously her best friend and the only one who would understand.Well isn't a new romance exciting the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches boat excursions out in the countryside daydreams of Paris and Venice hanging on each other's every word. Don't we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However if Laura and Alec had remained together before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts at least not in its original form it takes on a more meaningful form. Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts. Poor dull Fred! He's my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don't buy it! Really there's nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality longterm in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura's husband but not Alec's wife nor does it give us much information about her other than the fact that she's delicate. That's because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he's not present in that many scenes his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be sweeping Laura off her feet but he's actually very kind to her. In the end he realizes she's been having an affair and is grateful she's chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society's expectations not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and hopefully some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura I think she'll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN'T consummated occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity realize the depth of Fred's love and try to make it up to him for her emotional disloyalty. I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It's boring ? stable committed love versus brief romance and passion. No movie portrays the contrast better than Brief Encounter. Pity more people today don't make the choice Laura and Alec did. The world might be a better place.This movie puts to shame modern cinema where the main characters are generally in bed within the first five minutes. Don't miss it!".

BEWARE  SPOILERS AHEADHowever if you want a little serious insight into this movie consider my unique take....Yes it's dramatically moving and intense that farewell touch of Alec's hand on Laura's shoulder. However I'm probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True the drama revolves around Laura and Alec their encounters at the train station their thwarted passions and their guilt ridden emotions especially Laura's. But let's remember Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband Fred obviously her best friend and the only one who would understand.Well isn't a new romance exciting the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches boat excursions out in the countryside daydreams of Paris and Venice hanging on each other's every word. Don't we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However if Laura and Alec had remained together before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts at least not in its original form it takes on a more meaningful form. Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts. Poor dull Fred! He's my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don't buy it! Really there's nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality longterm in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura's husband but not Alec's wife nor does it give us much information about her other than the fact that she's delicate. That's because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he's not present in that many scenes his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be sweeping Laura off her feet but he's actually very kind to her. In the end he realizes she's been having an affair and is grateful she's chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society's expectations not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and hopefully some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura I think she'll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN'T consummated occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity realize the depth of Fred's love and try to make it up to him for her emotional disloyalty. I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It's boring ? stable committed love versus brief romance and passion. No movie portrays the contrast better than Brief Encounter. Pity more people today don't make the choice Laura and Alec did. The world might be a better place.This movie puts to shame modern cinema where the main characters are generally in bed within the first five minutes. Don't miss it!";

Lean had great problems with intimacy and much preferred grandeur he virtually abandoned his son and didn't meet one of his grandchildren until she was about 30. I'm not knocking the epics because I've enjoyed them as well but at the end of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA one knows about as much about Lawrence as one did about 312 hours earlier. ..unlike Alec and Laura in this film whom we know very well after 112 hours or Pip and Miss Havisham in EXPECTATIONS characters who leapt off the screen and endeared themselves to us it also helped that some really gifted actors  actresses played these roles.I never tire of BRIEF ENCOUNTER  it's one of the screen's great romances perhaps because it doesn't quite end happily ever after.

	schema:reviewBody "Steam ... cutglass accents ... Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto ... the refreshment room at Milford Junction ... the shame of the whole thing  the guiltiness the fear ...  it all adds up to David Lean's famous film treatment of the Noel Coward tale of love blossoming and withering at a suburban railway station.  Laura Jesson is a complacent middleclass housewife who gets a piece of grit in her eye one day and is helped by Doctor Alec Harvey and the romance begins.     Coward's screenplay is characteristic of his oeuvre.  There is the neat precision of the circular plot beginning and ending with the brainless intrusion of Dolly Messiter and the matching subplot of the AlbertMrs. Bagot courtship.  There are tongueincheek selfreferences on the cinema screen Flames Of Passion coming shortly and the trademark Cowardian grounding in exaggerated Englishness One has one's roots after all. Most typical of all is that overwrought cascade of middleclass vocabulary  ...so utterly humiliated and defeated and so dreadfully dreadfully ashamed.  Coward patronises workingclass people abominably.  Albert and Mrs. Bagot amble effortlessly through their romance because bless them they are simple folk.  Alec and Laura suffer torments having so much more sensitivity and you see they have reputations to lose the furtiveness and the lying outweigh the happiness.     Having made the transition from editor to director in 1942 Lean was at the helm for the fourth time for Brief Encounter all four films being Coward projects  and a highly creditable job he made of this one.  The scene in which Alec explains coaldust inhalation and Laura falls in love is a model of sensitive direction.  Reflections of Laura's face in the train window and the makeup mirror suggest in visual terms the existence of her 'other self' the id to her ego.  Thundering steam trains and Rachmaninov stand for the irrepressible sexual urge.  Stephen Lynn's flat with its bachelor urbanity contrasts cleverly with Laura's safe staid home and safe staid husband Fred I don't understand!  Alec's silent hand on Laura's shoulder is wonderfully poignant the suppressed emotion eclipsed by stupid Dolly Messiter her face filling the screen and 'wiping out' the great moment.     Sex has to be dealt with obliquely but it is very much the drivingforce of the film.  If we control ourselves and behave like sensible human beings ... offers Laura hopefully but hollowly.  Neither man nor woman is capable of restraint at least until after the climax in Stephen's flat.  The boathouse and the little bridge hint furtively at sexual union.  Other reviewers have declared the liaison to be 'unrequited' or 'unconsummated' but I am not so sure.  In the grammar of 1940's cinema the return to the lovenest of touslehaired hatless Laura is the equivalent I would suggest of our modern bedroom scene.  Isn't that why Alec suddenly decides to take the job offer?".

It feels REAL.The subject matter was scandalous for a film made in the 40's primarily because the two parties involved in the affair were portrayed so sympathetically. Of course this tale of illicit love will barely raise an eyebrow of outrage from modern filmgoers we've 'Been there seen that'. Although no longer shocking in content this film is still very powerful because of the deeply felt emotional states of the two characters Alec and Laura.Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfectly cast as the ordinary housewife and married doctor. Johnson has more share of the action as it is through her character that we view the pair's infidelity achieved through flashback  voiceover. The pair are not glamorous or showy stars so they are utterly believable in their roles as the ordinary lovestruck Britons. Johnson's soulful eyes and capacity for displaying emotion is brilliantly used here we the viewer feel her repulsion and disgust at what she has allowed to happen 'I felt like a criminal' but feel her torment too. Howard is occasionally stiff but still very very good as the doctor who meets Johnson after she gets a piece of grit stuck in her eye. Alec like Laura is painfully aware of their situation yet he is much more boyish and romantic Indeed when Alec talks about his desires to further himself in the field of medicine Laura remarks 'You looked like a little boy just then'.Every 'brief encounter' between the pair has that sense of urgency desperation. The constant use of trains and the Rachmaninoff music is symbolic of their restrained inner desires as are the films playing when the two meet together every Thursday to attend the cinema. The use of shadows and lighting exemplified when Howard kisses Johnson passionately in the shadows at the train station as an engine blowsare terrific. Lean's direction is wonderful every scene is beautifully handled.Amazing film.1010.".

For those who 'don't get it' or find it boring well what can those who do 'get it' say? How sad perhaps that something so lovely and so humane and so complex in its dialogue and beautifully formal in its British tone cannot be enjoyed by a few who demand ..DEMAND.. it suit them in 2009. Hilarious! Maybe the multiplex mind thought BRIEF ENCOUNTER was about colliding underpants which just might be right for them. CLASH OF THE TIGHT'UNS anyone? Maybe a remake with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore called HERENOW might be the right update. This gloriously stuffy and furtive Noel Coward play is transformed in this film to be the black and white smoky British damp equivalent of HUMORESQUE or NOW VOYAGER.. and if you love those films so easy! you will love this.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean's final collaboration with Noel Coward stands head and shoulders above his previous efforts. It is also one of the greatest achievements in British cinema of the 1940s which is saying something.Firstly this is quite simply a brilliant piece of writing from Coward. Much has been made of how daring it was in its acceptance of an extramarital affair but perhaps the real breakthrough was the frankness and realism with which it dealt with the universal experiences of love and heartbreak. It's beautifully simple and perfectly constructed. The idea of opening with the end of the affair when we the audience know nothing about what has gone on gives the final scenes such greater resonance when they come round again. The use of language is also inspired. Take for example Laura's daydream on the train as she imagines dancing and dining with Alec in various exotic locations. As reality sets in again her monologue trails off into flat everyday sounding words taking us from the Caribbean to Ketchworth in a single sentence.All through the picture Lean's direction matches pace with the screenplay. I've mentioned in other comments how much Lean has in common with Hitchcock even though they made very different films. Brief Encounter shows the kind of thing Hitchcock could have turned out had he wanted to make a romantic drama. The use of jarring sound effects emotional closeups and voiceovers to convey the intense psychological states is perfectly suited to this kind of thing. More than once Hitchcock used whistling trains to mimic a nightmarish scream. Lean uses them to symbolise the soaring emotions of his protagonists.This is a wonderfully rhythmic picture right from the start with the two trains perfectly timed to fly past at the beginning and end of the opening credits. The Rachmaninov piano concerto is ideal  just like Coward's play it runs the gamut of emotional tones and there is enough in there to score a whole picture.The decision to return to black and white after the uninspired use of Technicolor in This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit was an essential one. From start to finish the film is packed with atmosphere with drifting smoke light and shadow. The tone would simply be unachievable were in not in monochrome.As in The Happy Breed Celia Johnson gives an amazing performance. Her delivery and her emoting are so natural and believable she helps prevent the film getting bogged down in staginess or melodrama.For those that like to think of directorial careers in that way this could be considered David Lean's graduation picture. It's also his masterpiece yes I'd say it's better than Lawrence of Arabia. Brief Encounter is a timeless and monumental piece of filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean's great masterpiece has slipped in and out of fashion over the years and since it deals with so much that is mundane and is so terribly terribly British it was inevitable that it would be lampooned mercilessly. Yet few films have struck the kind of emotional chord with audiences as this one has. Although it deals with a milieu that is regimentally insular and with characters whose very ordinariness strikes you as somewhat peculiar it has a universal appeal. Who isn't susceptible to a chance encounter with someone who perhaps only for an instant appears more handsome more exciting than anyone or anything else in our lives. Innocence isn't an excuse and feelings are everything.Laura Jesson's idyll with the handsome doctor she meets on a station platform is hopelessly romantic because it is so innocent and so inconsequential. What Laura and Alec feel for each other transcends the drabness of their lives and their surroundings and creates possibilities that in the everyday we can only dream of. Of course one reading is that of gay wishfulfillment the impossibility of the central conceit and as Laura says 'the shame of the whole thing the deceit the fear' something Coward would have been well aware of as a gay man in the 1940's dreaming of the perfect partner outside of the constraints of society. It's only one reading naturally but it can't explain the film's universal popularity. Love not sex has no boundaries.It's magnificently made. Lean uses only a few sets and locations. It's as if Laura and Alec are caged in by their surroundings and their emotions and can never escape the shabby tearooms and cinemas where they meet. Yet Robert Kraser's luminous blackandwhite cinematography keeps adding a dimension to proceedings as if the shadows thrown up only serve to heighten the protagonist's guilt. And as Laura and Alec Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were never better. Indeed Johnson gives one of the cinema's great performances the simple mundane words and actions stand in complete contrast to the naked emotionality on display. If the film is heartbreaking it is Johnson who breaks your heart. Today we may feel smugly sophisticated and think of films like Brief Encounter as 'oldfashioned'. If we do then the loss is ours. Brief Encounter may never again make the lists of time best films yet it will always remain a timeless classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Two people meet in a train station and have a Brief Encounter in the 1946 film directed by David Lean based on Noel Coward's beautiful story of love found and love lost. There is much talk of a negative first review on this site I confess I didn't read it.Celia Johnson plays a married woman Laura who once a week goes into town to shop and see a movie Trevor Howard is a married doctor Alec who helps a friend out one day at a week at a nearby clinic. The two meet while waiting for their trains the assignations becoming more and more important to each until they realize they've fallen in love. This is the 1940s in Britain and there's no decision to be made.This is a very famous movie and I can still remember the scene in Touch of Class as Glenda Jackson and George Segal cry over it. That's far from the only film in which Brief Encounter is referenced there's also 84 Charing Cross Road Truly Madly Deeply The Heidi Chronicles The Care and Handling of Roses The Mirror Has Two Faces and many others. And with good reason. It's a tender love story about two good people who have probably never hurt anyone in their lives and find themselves in a precarious situation.The story begins at the end before the audience realizes what is going on when a chattering friend of Laura's Johnson joins her and Dr. Alec Harvey Howard in the caf. Just then Harvey's train is called and he rushes off. Laura looks stunned. Her narration begins continuing on the train and once at home as she in her mind tells her husband the story of her relationship with Alex how they met quite by chance. Then he went with her to the movies. Before long she was meeting him on Thursdays outside the hospital. Laura is riddled with guilt and finds herself lying to her husband Cyril Raymond. We don't get the impression that Harvey is feeling equally guilty in fact one gets the impression that he would do anything to be with Laura. However in the end he takes drastic measures not to be with her.Was the affair consummated or not? Nowadays with email relationships going on we know there's such a thing as emotional infidelity and these two are definitely guilty of that. Physical? I have to agree that it's unclear. They have their special places  the bridge the boathouse...it's up to the viewer. But Alec's decision certainly hints that something went on.Johnson and Howard weren't beautiful Hollywood stars which lends realism to the film. They were both attractive Johnson with her huge eyes and Howard with his chiseled features. Johnson by the way was the sisterinlaw of Ian Fleming and her children purchased the rights to his books. Laura's marriage is conveyed realistically as well  not unhappy but not really exciting either. Yet she knows her husband is a good man. He gets the last line in the film and it's one of its most beautiful moments. Perhaps they will come together as they once did and appreciate one another all the more.The film is scored with the music of Rachmaninoff  maybe it's a little too much at times but at other times it's achingly beautiful. The moment when Alec places his hand on Laura's shoulder as he leaves is one of the great moments in film and a testament to the fact that love doesn't have to be shown using obvious sexual scenes only with the use of some imagination.Despite Brief Encounter being dated today it serves as a strong metaphor for postwar Britain. During the war both men and women experienced more freedom from class and social restrictions than they ever had but afterward things returned to their conventional ways. It was a hard adjustment for many. Brief Encounter shows what happened to two people bound by the mores of the times.".

Who among us hasn't had strong feelings for someone they can never have? Trevor Howard delivers stoic but believable lines. Celia Johnson conveys her inner conflicts with amazing realism. What really surprised me how Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto was so welcome to me as a viewer. Many times especially in the older classics I find the music a distraction. In Brief Encounter each time the Concerto came on it was a stirring moment.Love is such a strange emotion. It is silly when we see it in others and how it causes them to behave. On the other hand it is very real to us when it hits home. This movie lets us inside the heads of two respectable people as they struggle with selfcontrol and social boundaries.I couldn't help thinking about how were this movie made in today's Hollywood maybe it has been remade??? we would have been treated to a bedroom scene or two. In my opinion that would have cheapened the film and taken away from the intense romantic mood. Watch for Howard's hand on Johnson's shoulder in their final scene together. If it does not give you goosebumps then you have been officially desensitized and should stick to modern Rrated romances!".

In my opinion that would have cheapened the film and taken away from the intense romantic mood. Watch for Howard's hand on Johnson's shoulder in their final scene together. If it does not give you goosebumps then you have been officially desensitized and should stick to modern Rrated romances!";

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean's small masterpiece about forbidden love and failed relationships set amidst the atmospheric sects of suburban London is one of those movies that certainly stays with you and not for all the happy reasons. Cella Johnson and Trevor Howard perfectly portray two people in rather normal marriages and lives yet feel unfulfilled and begin a simple yet passionate romance that lasts for weeks and changes them both especially the woman whom we see from her point of view. As the story progresses we see the dullness and melancholy she goes through and the one chance at excitement and change she has when going out every Thursday. It is here she meets a handsome doctor and they obviously have feelings for each other. This story has been done many times but in director Lean's hands the film is centered on the two lovers and their tumultuous relationship. The film is very brief at only 86 minutes but I think it is a testimony to the relationship of these two people and how it will impact their future. As mentioned before the acting is strong especially in some small supporting parts with Stanley Holloway as a flirtatious stage conductor. The photography is moody and perfectly captures that dark eerie feeling of postwar England. All elements come together in this terribly tragic but ultimately moving story about men women and everything that can happen between them.".

	schema:headline " The Original Doomed Love Affair Beautifully Restored With a Soaring Johnson";
	schema:reviewBody "Long before he made his grand widescreen epics master director David Lean made small intimate films about normal people who find themselves outside of their comfort zones. His most famous of these early works  and arguably the gold standard by which all illfated love stories are compared  is this 86minute treasure from 1946. It is the rather simple story of a chance meeting between housewife Laura Jesson and Dr. Alec Harvey in the refreshment room of a suburban London train station. The plot starts innocently enough when Alec removes some smut from Laura's eye but then they inevitable become drawn to each other and fall in love.Lean employs a flashback technique to tell the story penned by Noel Coward along with Lean and Anthony HavelockAllan and actually begins with the quiet farewell between Laura and Alec. From there Laura recalls the entire story narrating in a breathless and at times frantic voiceover. Watching the events unfold in her memory and listening to her narration we are drawn completely into her mind as Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto floods the soundtrack. Despite their respective marital statuses the two begin to fall in love and soon enough romance and even lust at least in typically stiff upperlip British form have shown up on the scene. After a while they start to meet on a very regular basis and though both know it will never work they still spend time together.Leave it to Lean to transcend the tendency to produce a predictably romantic and masochistic wallow and come up with a more complex set of conflicting emotions. Probably because Laura's narration is so honest and involving this movie resonates far more than a more Baroque chick flick like Irving Rapper's Now Voyager or Jean Negulesco's Humoresque. Granitejawed Trevor Howard portrays Alec with sympathy and unapologetic yearning but it's Celia Johnson who galvanizes the film with a multilayered performance as she makes Laura's desperation palpable but never offputting. With her saucer eyes and emotionally pinched demeanor she truly brings a genuine soul to this vulnerable emotionally closeted woman who is unable to come to terms with her unconsummated affair. Providing just the right amount of comic relief are Joyce Carey as the haughty refreshment room hostess and Stanley Holloway well before his ne'erdowell Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady as the persistent train station attendant who constantly flirts with her.Criterion has once again done a superb job in bringing this movie to life as the pristine print really brings out Robert Krasker's crisp cinematography. Film historian Bruce Eder provides informative audio commentary on an alternate track and goes indepth into not only the production but also the careers of Lean Coward and all the actors with speaking parts. Beyond that there is the original trailer and an interesting demonstration of the restoration process. If you have seen Claude Lelouch's A Man and a Woman with Anouk Aime and JeanLouis Trintignant or Ulu Grosbard's Falling in Love with Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep or Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy or Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson....you owe yourself to see the original inspiration.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hunger opens with the by now familiar Goth anthem Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus.  Not a bad way to open a vampire film though nowadays it would seem almost a parody.  Undead undead undead indeed.  Enter Cathy and Bowie into a slick sleek neon nightclub filled to the rafters with postpunks  preGoths playing dead.  Too bad they weren't as ready for the real thing as they thought they were.  You see Cathy and Bowie are vampires.This is a visually stunning film making up for in effects what it sometimes lacks in coherence.  It seems that lovely immortal Cathy called Miriam is a vampire queen who has been around since the Sphinx was built apparently.  Bowie is her consort a once mortal man whose two hundredodd year lifespan is suddenly winding down at a frighteningly rapid rate.  Desperate to find a cure he seeks out scientist Susan Sarandon who at first disbelieves Bowie's claims but is soon convinced when the young and handsomely androgynous man suddenly ages over the course of a few hours time into a decrepit ruin. Miriam who has had countless lovers over the centuries gives Bowie the heaveho and turns her attention to lovely young Sarandon.   But Sarandon though initially easy to seduce in an erotic lesbian scene proves to have a will stronger than Miriam's and Miriam's habit of keeping her collection of exlovers cadavers close at hand proves to be a mistake.This is a strange film almost as cold and dispassionate as one might well imagine a vampire to be.  It seems to hold the viewer at arms length not allowing them to experience the emotions of the characters...but the characters for the most part are severely lacking in emotion anyway so the stark emptiness of the film becomes a brilliant mirror.

	onyx:emotionText "The Hunger opens with the by now familiar Goth anthem Bela Lugosi's Dead by Bauhaus.  Not a bad way to open a vampire film though nowadays it would seem almost a parody.  Undead undead undead indeed.  Enter Cathy and Bowie into a slick sleek neon nightclub filled to the rafters with postpunks  preGoths playing dead.  Too bad they weren't as ready for the real thing as they thought they were.  You see Cathy and Bowie are vampires.This is a visually stunning film making up for in effects what it sometimes lacks in coherence.  It seems that lovely immortal Cathy called Miriam is a vampire queen who has been around since the Sphinx was built apparently.  Bowie is her consort a once mortal man whose two hundredodd year lifespan is suddenly winding down at a frighteningly rapid rate.  Desperate to find a cure he seeks out scientist Susan Sarandon who at first disbelieves Bowie's claims but is soon convinced when the young and handsomely androgynous man suddenly ages over the course of a few hours time into a decrepit ruin. Miriam who has had countless lovers over the centuries gives Bowie the heaveho and turns her attention to lovely young Sarandon.   But Sarandon though initially easy to seduce in an erotic lesbian scene proves to have a will stronger than Miriam's and Miriam's habit of keeping her collection of exlovers cadavers close at hand proves to be a mistake.This is a strange film almost as cold and dispassionate as one might well imagine a vampire to be.  It seems to hold the viewer at arms length not allowing them to experience the emotions of the characters...but the characters for the most part are severely lacking in emotion anyway so the stark emptiness of the film becomes a brilliant mirror.  Some vampire enthusiasts might find this boring and confusing but it's a good effort and not a total loss.The three main characters are worth watching simply for their amazing beauty and grace.  Tony Scott brother of Ridley has made a nice if somewhat bizarre and chilling work of art here and like most works of art it's up for interpretation.";

I keenly remember anticipating its release and seeing it at the 8th St. Playhouse theatre where the weekly Rocky Horror movieshow ran for years in NYC. The mood and cinematography attest to its aspirations and for me are quite successful. In particular the choice of soundtrack music is quite adept and urbane although only those very familiar with classical music will appreciate the tieins Deneuve's playing of Ravel's Gibet from Gaspard de la Nuit for piano after John passes and after Sarandon's character makes her first kill...her husband. This piece is Ravel's programmatic interpretation of a French poem which describes a person wearily walking under the intense scorching sun and seeing something in the distance approaches only to find a corpse strung up rotting in the midday sun. Beautiful usage of Schubert's Piano Trio as well as haunting movements of a Schubert piano sonata. Then there is the obvious thematic tiein with Lakm by Dlibes. Lesbian love And you've got to love the use of the band BAUHAUS in the opening sequencewith the lead singer singing Bela Lugosi's Dead in the suspended cage. Deneuve is absolutely ravishing and used to great effect and lovingly photographed. David Bowie does an exceptional turn as her lover. What I admire most is the movie's ability to paint a feeling and mood of their existence outside time eternally present yet eternally on the fringe startlingly beautiful yet shrouded veiled amorphous and ultimately predatorial. Finally the thought that Deneuve's past lovers never die but are trapped eternally in a constantly decaying shell is absolutely frightening. Did I mention that Deneuve is sublimely beautiful?!".

	schema:reviewBody "Hey! Like what in the name of Count Chocula is going on here!?...... Why is it that modernday movievampires are such messy buggers?? They are. When it comes to their favourite drink BloodThick Slurpees they splatter and spill the stuff around all over the place like it was going out of style.Take The Blaylocks that's the ohsorefined BowieDeneuve vampire team for example they get more blood on the walls and on the floor than they ever do in their mouths. I'm not kidding. And half the time they can't even get it into their own mouths at all. Most of it ends up dribbling down their chins and onto the fronts of their very fashionable frocks. tsk. tsk I'm tellin' ya  Vogue magazine would never approve of this. Never.The Blaylocks are total messcats when it comes to cadaver snacks and fullmealdeals. And not only that but they are unbelievably reckless and yes stupid too. When these ultrachic bloodsuckers are finished with their feed for the night they actually haul the torn and chewed up scraps of their dinner down to their cellar and get this burn it up in their very own incinerator.I don't know about you but I'd say that this is none too bright. After all their trendy townhouse is situated right in the centre of a New York City neighbourhood. And unless the locals there have all lost their ability to smell the stench and smoke caused by the burning of flesh surely must have 1 or 2 folks around the hood wondering about The Blaylocks' barbecue specials. But the strange thing is no one ever complains or anything. I don't get it.In the good ol' days of movievampires pre1950's The Count Nosferatu and all their assorted cronies always seemed to be so careful whenever they drained a victim of their lifeblood. It's true. You rarely ever saw even a trickle of blood run down a vampire's chin or drip from their victim's neck wound. It seemed back in Hollywood's heyday that these movievampires meant business and sucked the body dry. Yeah'Good To The Last Drop' was their motto I'm sure. Everything was so clean and easy back then.But these hipcat movievampires of today let the blood fly everywhere making big bloody messes from one end of their fashionable condo to the other. What in the world are vampires coming to? And not only that but Miriam Mrs. Blaylock has a neurotic habit of not letting go of her previous lovers. So whenever she moves from place to place she literally lugs around a dozen goddamn coffins that contain the remains of these driedup deceived ones who she had promised 'forever' to. If a pile of coffins isn't the sort of thing that will draw attention and suspicion to this particular vampire's undead activities I don't know what will.But Miriam is also big on betrayal and even before her present lover has actually set foot inside his own box she's out shopping for a replacement. She likes to pretend that this isn't so but she's no fool and besides she is utterly repulsed by the touch of old wrinkled flesh. Who isn't baby?I have to give Miriam credit for her latest choice for a lover. Sarah Sarandon is actually kind of hot as opposed to the scrawny Bowie but on top of that she really seems to have a brain in her head. At present Sarah's working at a clinic and researching the connection between sleep and ageing. This could well prove to be worthwhile research. And I suspect this is one of the reasons why Miriam chose Sarah. Miriam I'm sure has very strong desires to slow down her own ageing even more.

	onyx:emotionText "Hey! Like what in the name of Count Chocula is going on here!?...... Why is it that modernday movievampires are such messy buggers?? They are. When it comes to their favourite drink BloodThick Slurpees they splatter and spill the stuff around all over the place like it was going out of style.Take The Blaylocks that's the ohsorefined BowieDeneuve vampire team for example they get more blood on the walls and on the floor than they ever do in their mouths. I'm not kidding. And half the time they can't even get it into their own mouths at all. Most of it ends up dribbling down their chins and onto the fronts of their very fashionable frocks. tsk. tsk I'm tellin' ya  Vogue magazine would never approve of this. Never.The Blaylocks are total messcats when it comes to cadaver snacks and fullmealdeals. And not only that but they are unbelievably reckless and yes stupid too. When these ultrachic bloodsuckers are finished with their feed for the night they actually haul the torn and chewed up scraps of their dinner down to their cellar and get this burn it up in their very own incinerator.I don't know about you but I'd say that this is none too bright. After all their trendy townhouse is situated right in the centre of a New York City neighbourhood. And unless the locals there have all lost their ability to smell the stench and smoke caused by the burning of flesh surely must have 1 or 2 folks around the hood wondering about The Blaylocks' barbecue specials. But the strange thing is no one ever complains or anything. I don't get it.In the good ol' days of movievampires pre1950's The Count Nosferatu and all their assorted cronies always seemed to be so careful whenever they drained a victim of their lifeblood. It's true. You rarely ever saw even a trickle of blood run down a vampire's chin or drip from their victim's neck wound. It seemed back in Hollywood's heyday that these movievampires meant business and sucked the body dry. Yeah'Good To The Last Drop' was their motto I'm sure. Everything was so clean and easy back then.But these hipcat movievampires of today let the blood fly everywhere making big bloody messes from one end of their fashionable condo to the other. What in the world are vampires coming to? And not only that but Miriam Mrs. Blaylock has a neurotic habit of not letting go of her previous lovers. So whenever she moves from place to place she literally lugs around a dozen goddamn coffins that contain the remains of these driedup deceived ones who she had promised 'forever' to. If a pile of coffins isn't the sort of thing that will draw attention and suspicion to this particular vampire's undead activities I don't know what will.But Miriam is also big on betrayal and even before her present lover has actually set foot inside his own box she's out shopping for a replacement. She likes to pretend that this isn't so but she's no fool and besides she is utterly repulsed by the touch of old wrinkled flesh. Who isn't baby?I have to give Miriam credit for her latest choice for a lover. Sarah Sarandon is actually kind of hot as opposed to the scrawny Bowie but on top of that she really seems to have a brain in her head. At present Sarah's working at a clinic and researching the connection between sleep and ageing. This could well prove to be worthwhile research. And I suspect this is one of the reasons why Miriam chose Sarah. Miriam I'm sure has very strong desires to slow down her own ageing even more. And maybe Sarah's knowledge is the key to an answer.But as vampirelovers these two highfashion females are doomed. Domination is their downfall. One must rule. One must die. Who that is to be all comes down to the one with the more cunning mind. Who that turns out to be will certainly be of no surprise to anyone I'm sure.Anyways  From a visual point of view 'The Hunger' is a very impressive film to look at and admire.

	schema:reviewBody "ENDING SPOILERThe Hunger is a difficult film to categorize. On the one hand it's great because of the stunning cinematography and the performances by the actors. On the other there is a noticeable lack of a coherent story here. Unless you have read the novel by Whitley Streiber you may find it difficult to understand what is going on. Furthermore the film jettisons the entire concept by tacking on an inexplicable ending that defies the story's own sense of selfcontained logic.The plot involves an ageless vampire currently under the personage of Miriam Blaylock. She is immortal and out of loneliness and the desire to love she develops the ability to turn humans into companions that seem to share her immortality. The problem is eventually their bodies give out after a couple hundred years and they begin to age rapidly. This is the problem with Miriam's current lover John. Adding to the horror is the fact that although her lovers are emaciated and crumbling they cannot truly die and are sealed into coffins forever hungry. Miriam keeps the coffins with her wherever she goes although the film never really decides why. Is it out of her love for them? Or guilt over what she's done to them? Or is she simply afraid of being found out?The film seems faithful at times abbreviated at others. In the novel Miriam was not human but rather a member of a race of humanoid creatures that Whitley Streiber suggested were the truth behind the vampire legend. Miriam clung desperately to her own life because although she could live forever she could also die if she lost a significant amount of blood and lived her life in fear of dying.In the film these weighty subjects are glossed over in favor of dreamlike imagery which is actually a fair trade to certain degree. Catherine Deneuve is certainly a stunningly beautiful woman and David Bowie is perfect as her currently disintegrating partner. Susan Sarandon gives a typically engaging performance as Sarah the new object of Miriam's affection.The problem is that the movie doesn't seem to have time to explore the deeper meanings behind the motivation of the characters. Miriam comes off as beautiful but empty because we aren't really given a clue as to what she really is. Whitley Strieber's conception of vampirism is quite different from the traditional one yet the movie doesn't define it for the viewer so there could be some confusion about the contradictions that seem to arise Why can the vampires come out during the daylight? Why don't they have fangs? Why are Miriam's lovers wasting away when she isn't?. Miriam's past is only vaguely hinted at in fleeting images most notably her memory of an agesold lover making a first killing out of an Egyptian slave.However the film's biggest weakness is not the Playboystyle lesbian scene between Sarandon and Deneuve but rather the confusing ending. Somehow it appears as if Sarah has usurped Miriam's position as the queen vampire which is impossible in the context of the original novel. There was no way Sarah could have become what Miriam was so the movie seems to be suggesting something else was going on here.On the positive side there are a number of great actors in this cast even other than Deneuve Sarandon and Bowie. Cliff De Young is good as Sarah's lover Tom and there is a memorable performance by Beth Ehler as Alice a young girl who studies music with Miriam and John. Dan Hedaya is always a pleasure.What Tony Scott sacrifices in plot here he makes up for in style. The narrative is carried by the visuals of the film as much as the script and he makes excellent use of the classical music in the soundtrack. Today it is not uncommon for a film to run more than two hours long and The Hunger could have been much much better if Scott had been given full reign to flesh out Whitley Streiber's original concept.".

My advice is don't go and set aside the time for this piece. It's rather interesting to watch once but if you have better things to do do them!The movie uses a lot of visual effects and sounds to create a spooky vampiry atmosphere. While the blue theme and the whole dark setting works quite well and the outcome is quite impressive some people would say that the method is too slow or frustrating. Just keep in mind that this is a visual film. Don't expect too much dialogue but remember to listen carefully to the things that are said especially to Miriam Deneuve. Otherwise you might miss some points and end up in a confused state.As for the acting David Bowie is remarkable in his little part Catherine Deneuve is all class and beauty and Susan Sarandon has some good scenes. If you're seeking to watch this movie solely because you want to see one of these actors like I did you probably won't regret it. But what will get your attention is all the fantasy about how the vampire life works in this story. There are some illogical and not too well thought out theories playing at hand but when you're watching any fantasy movie you have to let your imagination take over.Personally I think this movie is more fantasy and drama than horror or romance. The whole vampire idea will get your attention because of its relatively novel qualities but the story is also about a vampiress and her tragic love affairs. I suppose the movie doesn't explore too much into this area. It would've been better if they had. For those who're interested I recommend the book by Whitley Strieber which does a better job of explaining things.".

Here John and Miriam can enjoy all the benefits of the yuppie vampire lifestyle a beautiful apartment exquisite furniture passionate lovemaking performing classical music with their teenage friend Alice and the seeming ability to murder disco goers to drink their blood without ever arousing the suspicion of the police.Did I say John and Miriam were young? I had better qualify that somewhat. John is actually over two hundred years old and Miriam is even older in fact she is immortal and ageless. John however is not. He is not a vampire born and bred but a human being converted to vampirism by Miriam. This causes one problem. Although such converted humans have a lifespan way beyond the normal threescore years and ten they are not immortal and after reaching a certain point start to age rapidly whereupon they start to decompose into a sort of living corpse. Miriam keeps all her previous lovers in their coffins in her flat. This starts happening to John in the course of the film and he doesn't like it. He consults Sarah a scientist specialising in research into the ageing process in a vain search for a cure. He kills Alice after learning that Miriam is planning to take her as her next lover the modern vampire chick swings both ways although it is not clear why he does so. Bloodlust? Jealousy? The thought that this is the only way he can save Alice from a fate worse than death? Or given that the actress who plays Alice was only fifteen at the time the thought that this is the only way he can save the film from the fate of being condemned as kiddie porn?In the event Sarah calls at the Blaylock apartment thinking that John will make an interesting subject for her research but ends up being seduced by Miriam who is hoping to convert Sarah to both vampirism and lesbianism. Cue the famous love scene between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon followed by an ending that makes very little sense even by comparison with what has gone before. 'The Hunger' is a mood a look an ambience created by Tony Scott. It is the lighting of Stephen Goldblatt it is the production design of Brian Morris it is the clothes created by Milena Canonero. This quote from the publicity material for the film taken from Halliwell's Film Guide' makes interesting reading and indicates that although the film may not have many intellectual pretensions it seems to have aesthetic ones. Those who made it clearly had an ambition for it to become some sort of arthouse classic. The look of the film is certainly unusual. Whereas most vampire films and horror films in general have an atmosphere of darkness and gloom The Hunger' is frequently light and airy accompanied by soaring classical music rather than the spooky chords normally associated with films of this type. The lesbian scene is a case in point. This is in fact surprisingly tender and erotic with effective use of background music. Today Delibes's Flower Duet' from Lakme' is a familiar piece possibly overfamiliar from its repeated use in TV commercials. In 1983 however it was still relatively unfamiliar at least it was to me and its ethereal otherworldly quality seemed strangely appropriate in this context.The reviewer who compared this film with Flashdance' another film from the early eighties may have had a point despite the very different subject matter of the two films both clearly bear the hallmarks of the pop videos of the period. The Hunger' however lacks completely the joie de vivre which is the main redeeming feature of the other film. Despite the look of the film it revels in death and decay in a way that is more reminiscent of the Decadent movement of the 1890s than of anything else from the 1980s. A film can have elegant artistic touches and beautiful music on the soundtrack and still be deeply unpleasant and sadistic as well as deeply silly. The Hunger' is such a film. It falls a long way short of its ambition to be an arthouse classic at most it is a cult movie for those with decadent tastes. 410.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a film with such a haunting and depressing scenario 'Beginners' is a surprisingly powerful and perceptive piece of cinema. When I first read the synopsis I was a bit doubtful about the concept and was uncertain as to whether it was worth a watch however after learning that the film was partially autobiographical and based on the life of writerdirector Mike Mills I decided to give it a try convinced by the inspiration of Mills' firstperson experiences. 'Beginners' blends comedy and romance against a dramatic backdrop in order to create a charming and characterdriven story. In my opinion it is Christopher Plummer's Oscarwinning performance that really sells the picture accompanied by some assuring performances from Ewan McGregor and Mlanie Laurent. 'Beginners' is a powerfully understated piece of independent filmmaking that maintains it's emotional resonance from start to finish.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to see the world premiere of Beginners at the Toronto International Film Festival this weekend and it completely took me by surprise. It was a bit of a last minute pick and it has been my favourite film so far and probably one of my favourite films in general. To be simple I will just say that this film is about life and the emotions and experiences that we all go through within it. Christopher Plummer plays a 75 year old man who after the death of his wife is finally able to explore his homosexuality and we see him come to life through this experience. It is not only about him but mainly about his son played by Ewan McGregor whose relationships with both his mother and father shape him as a person. These relationships and his own romantic relationships make up the core of his character and it is through love loss and discovery that the three main characters display an authentic view of humanity. It is an original film and requires a certain audience but I recommend that everyone should see this true gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Mills' 2005 debut Thumbsucker is a film whose quirky charm was completely lost on me but where that film was drenched in artificiality he somehow turned that charm into something grounded and serene with his sophomore feature Beginners. This is a movie that honestly transcends words for me. The kind of impact it had on me will never be able to be described but it's one that touched me at my soul and deeply moved me in a profound way. The film is built around this message from Mills' personal life that you have the capacity to assess your situation at any point in life and make a change for the better. However in the most unHollywood sense Mills never beats you over the head with the message or panders to it's audience it just exists in it's own world and you can embrace it or not but the film doesn't exist solely for that reason. It may not particularly exist for any reason it just exists and for me that was all it needed to do to hit me right in the heart.In taking on a subject matter as emotionally strong as this a father coming out of the closet at a late age and then being diagnosed with terminal cancer Mills was open to a plethora of moments for overbearing melodrama to bring the audience to tears but he never embraces this in a traditional way at all. He treats the subject with this delicate grounded approach that feels fully original and honestly quite daring in it's subtlety leading to an experience much more effective than if he had gone the traditional route. His background in graphic design leads to some wonderfully charming editing techniques and Woody Allen circa Annie Hall uniqueness in the story structure but it never overpowers the center that is ultimately a charming emotional and entirely natural character study. The study of a young man finally seeing who his father is contrasted with his first experience in true love. All three of the central characters charmed me off my feet but Mills creates genuine flawed and sometimes annoying human beings out of all of them.Once again as with everything else in the film he transcends the general approach and just creates these full real human beings. Oliver and Anna instantly became one of my favorite couples in the history of cinema with the incomparable chemistry between Ewan McGregor and Melanie Laurent and Hal reminded me so much of my grandfather it really brought me to tears several times. Mills plays everything in an understated way but by doing this he allows the film to really get under your skin and sink in a much more effective technique than just hitting you on the surface over and over again. The performances by all three are truly out of this world.I find McGregor to be a great talent who rarely gets the opportunity to demonstrate that but this character allows him to give his finest performance to date. He is so grounded and honest in his portrayal bringing comedy both light and dark along with genuine emotion that sunk into me deeply over and over again. I related to his faults and his gifts and McGregor really made me feel like I understood this guy through and through. Laurent is a delight and makes you fall in love with her almost instantly again I have to mention the overwhelming chemistry that the two of these had. Before we even got a chance to fully comprehend their relationship I was in tears by the simple act of them holding hands with one another. Mills and Laurent take a character that could have been conventional and tossed aside for the fatherson dynamic and make a fullyfleshed person out of her complete with her own demons and turmoil and I fell in love with her all the way.Then comes Christopher Plummer as Oliver's father who is everything you could want from this guy charming chaotic filled with life and regret. He's absolutely enchanting and devastating simultaneously a guy that makes you want to live your life to fullest potential. In fact enchanting is a word that is perfect for the film as a whole. Beyond the authenticity and the emotional impact that it had on me which is not small by any notion the film truly seems to dance at times and it's in those moments that I felt something...beautiful and serene beyond anything that words could hope to encapsulate. This movie transcended everything for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. This is a terrific little arthouse character study with comedic elements fine acting and superb writing. Mike Mills is responsible and he was also the writer and director on another excellent little movie from about 5 years ago called Thumbsucker. When I say little movie I mean intimate and poignant with a nominal budget.Three time periods are presented in overlapping form to an effective end. One period shows us Oliver Ewan McGregor as a young kid interacting with his mother Mary Page Keller. Another period shows Oliver's father Hal Christopher Plummer confessing to him that he is gay this is a few months after the motherwife dies. The third period has Oliver trying to forge a relationship with Anna Melanie Laurent whom he met at a costume party.While that may sound like a simple setup I assure you that the complications created by these characters is both realistic and headspinning. It turns out Hal knew he was gay prior to marrying Oliver's mother but claims she promised to fix him. Once he proclaims his gayness Hal jumps in with both feet to all causes gay. He thoroughly enjoys himself and even meets a new younger lover. And just when he admits to joy inoperable cancer is discovered in Hal's lungs. This begins the second major secret of his life.The scenes from Oliver's childhood provide crucial evidence on why he is so solemn and afraid of relationships. He suffers just as his mother did. Things begin to shift for him when dressed as Freud his party sofa becomes occupied by Anna  a beautiful alluring French actress who it turns out is just as messed up emotionally as is Oliver. They make the perfect threesome ... including Arthur Hal's Jack Terrier who speaking through subtitles lets us know when things are OK or not. Arthur takes a great deal of the heaviness away.There are many elements of this film that I really like. The houses of both Hal and Oliver are full of as much personality as either of the characters. The look and pace of the film is meticulous and steady given the material. It seems to be naturally lighted from windows and interior sconces. Nothing even comes close to looking like a Hollywood set.Ewan McGregor plays his part very close to the vest and conveys the pain and uncertainty that Oliver has learned over the years. His defenses are up! Melanie Laurent was my favorite part of Inglourious Basterds she was the cinema owner on a mission and here she offers both hopefulness and melancholy. To me the heart of the film is Christopher Plummer's performance. He portrays an elderly gay man with grace and then takes it to another level in his sick scenes. He is a wise man who may or may not understand how selfish he was but is intent on showing Oliver that it's never to late to be a beginner in love.".

Hal is largely absent from Oliver's motherdominated boyhood he later admits to having sex in mensrooms but we don't see any of that. We see his decline and death but not his wife's. We are not shown any of Oliver's life between boyhood and his father's 'liberation'.The performances are nothing less than brilliant. Christopher Plummer plunging into gay life in his seventies and dying with curmudgeonly dignity will very likely be nominated for an Oscar and miss out like Colin Firth going down the gay road in A SINGLE MAN. Ewan McGregor gets perfectly under the skin of Oliver who finds it easier to love his gay dad than commit to a new girlfriend. And Melanie Laurent's Anna is beguiling and disturbing the viewer to feel what Oliver feels you want to love her but something holds you back.There is also a scenestealing Jack Russell Arthur the love of Hal's life who becomes the love of Oliver's. A talking dog!  that is to say writerdirector Mike Mills gives Arthur subtitled thoughts every now and again. Kind of weird and kind of wonderful  kind of like the movie.".

	schema:headline " On your mark get set go! Here is my take on Beginners";
	schema:reviewBody "I really do not think it was beginners' luck that made Director Mike Mills' indie film Beginners a critical success. This quirky little film about an aging widower who announces to his son that he is gay and has terminal cancer is not your typical terms of endearmentesque formulaic weepy. Mills direction includes experimental artistic elements into the narrative which many times are very engaging but a few times are a bit baffling nevertheless kudos to Mills for thinking outside the beginners box. Beginners stars Ewan McGregor as Oliver Fields an artist who shies away from romantic relationships until he begins to romance the freespirit French actress Anna. Oliver's dad is Hal the aforementioned geriatric homosexual who finds a new flamboyant lease on life in his twilight days even with the terminal situation he has been handed with. Christopher Plummer's performance as Hal has been lauded by many critics and it's the frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. And why not? It is about time the legendary Mr. Plummer gets a little of that Oscar liquid. Whatever that means! Sorry something is wrong with my cerebral pipes! Anyways Plummer's multifaceted performance was sure a delight to watch. Mills' idiosyncratic screenplay was of people speaking in eccentric tongues which one could say was not too authentic on how people really talk to each other but it was still a strong script mainly because it is based on his real life experience with his father. I was not too fond of the overwhelming nonlinear aspects of the narrative but it did not take away too much of the emotional strength of the picture. McGregor continues to be one the most under the radar actors working today because he continues to deliver with every character he portrays as he did with his fine work as Oliver. French actress Melanie Laurent who was so good in Inglourious Basterds proves that performance was no beginners luck by delivering another charismatic thespian effort with her portrayal of the lovely Anna. I will end my review of Beginners by stating that this movie is mostly a celebration of the unforgettable moments of life no matter how old or new and that it's not such a bad thing to begin again.  Good".

This quirky little film about an aging widower who announces to his son that he is gay and has terminal cancer is not your typical terms of endearmentesque formulaic weepy. Mills direction includes experimental artistic elements into the narrative which many times are very engaging but a few times are a bit baffling nevertheless kudos to Mills for thinking outside the beginners box. Beginners stars Ewan McGregor as Oliver Fields an artist who shies away from romantic relationships until he begins to romance the freespirit French actress Anna. Oliver's dad is Hal the aforementioned geriatric homosexual who finds a new flamboyant lease on life in his twilight days even with the terminal situation he has been handed with. Christopher Plummer's performance as Hal has been lauded by many critics and it's the frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. And why not? It is about time the legendary Mr. Plummer gets a little of that Oscar liquid. Whatever that means! Sorry something is wrong with my cerebral pipes! Anyways Plummer's multifaceted performance was sure a delight to watch. Mills' idiosyncratic screenplay was of people speaking in eccentric tongues which one could say was not too authentic on how people really talk to each other but it was still a strong script mainly because it is based on his real life experience with his father. I was not too fond of the overwhelming nonlinear aspects of the narrative but it did not take away too much of the emotional strength of the picture. McGregor continues to be one the most under the radar actors working today because he continues to deliver with every character he portrays as he did with his fine work as Oliver. French actress Melanie Laurent who was so good in Inglourious Basterds proves that performance was no beginners luck by delivering another charismatic thespian effort with her portrayal of the lovely Anna. I will end my review of Beginners by stating that this movie is mostly a celebration of the unforgettable moments of life no matter how old or new and that it's not such a bad thing to begin again.

	schema:reviewBody "I got the chance to attend a sneak peek of director Mike Mills' latest film last night at one of the Reel Affirmations film festival's monthly screenings. I like Mills' films. They've got a moody tortured aesthetic and this one is no different. The story is primarily about the relationship between a man Oliver Ewan McGregor and his father Hal Christopher Plummer. When Hal dies Oliver is left to contemplate his life their relationship and all the poor choices each of them had made up until this point. We see the world through Oliver's eyes and so the whole film is suffused with an overall tone of deep sadness. He can't seem to make any of his romantic relationships work but then he's never really had any good role models. You see after the death of his mother four years prior Hal finally came out to his son as gayat the ripe age of seventyfive. It's a very touching and lightly sweet moment. Oliver is happy that his father hasn't given up on life and is finally pursuing true love but he just can't forget the years of isolation and loneliness his mother went through. Commence the sad wallowing.Of course all this changes when Oliver meets an alluring winsome French girl Melanie Laurent. Anna is an actress and she's just about as bad at relationships as Oliver. They don't know much about each other but they're both beautiful damaged souls so they get on like a house on fire. And somehow Oliver is thinking less and less about his parents. Those ladies can be mighty distracting! But not distracting enough to totally conceal either of these attractive kids' inherent personality flaws. But they're pretty fetching while they're working out their demons!This is a wonderful film. It really captures the deep emotions people feel for each other and even lets the audience feel some of them for themselves. There were definitely moments during the screening that had people surreptitiously wiping tears from the corners of their eyes. But it's also sexy and funny too. We get to enjoy Oliver and Anna's uncertain flirtation. And we also get to savor Hal's belated but not too late! blossoming. He's as giddy and nervous as a schoolgirl at her first dance but he ultimately takes to his new life like a fish to water even as late to the game as he is. This movie is a real crowd pleaser and it's one that just about everyone will enjoy. The pacing is deliberate and solemn but the story sucks you in enough that you barely notice. You can even bring a date to this one. It's not one to miss.".

And along comes a giraffe. You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.Beginners is one of those movies that stands out due to the strong performance from the cast. The actors tell the story and sometimes a look can say more than actual words. Ewan McGregor has this look in his eyes that constantly reminds us in this film that his character is a very sad and lonesome guy. There is no need for him to tell us we just know it by the way he acts. From the opening scene you will also notice this isn't your typical Hollywood romantic movie it's different and actually rings true to life. Beginners is a romantic drama with a strong and special chemistry between the two lead roles played by McGregor and Melanie Laurent from Inglorious Basterds fame. In order for a romantic movie to work it's a must for the two lead characters to have a strong chemistry between them and these two have it from the start from the very first moment they meet. Ironically when they first meet she can't talk but they say so much to each other with their eyes. That is true in life sometimes. From that moment I knew this film was going to be good and it was. Their relationship is the center of the story although the movie is nonlinear as we get to see McGregor's relationship with his now dead mother and father. Those interactions with them shaped him and made him the man he is today. He witnessed how his parents respected one another but lacked real love for each other. He doesn't want to make the same mistake.Oliver Ewan McGregor is the narrator of the movie in which he is telling the story of his life. It's 2003 and his father Hal Christopher Plummer has recently passed away. We get several flashbacks dealing with their relationship together. His mother Georgia Mary Page Keller who he was closer with had died five years ago. After this Oliver grew closer to his father who opened up to him and let him know he has been gay all his life. Hal really begins living after he comes out of the closet and has a relationship with a much younger man named Andy Goran Visnjic. Oliver begins to see a version of his father that he never knew. At the same time he realizes his father has terminal cancer and therefore has to take care of him but in a way they form a stronger bond with each other. Oliver is now on his own working as a graphic artist who keeps to himself most of the time and spends time with his father's dog Arthur but one day his coworkers invite him to a party and insist on him joining them. There Oliver meets a young French actress named Anna Melanie Laurent and despite the fact that she can't speak at first due to laryngitis they spend the night together and the relationship grows from there. The two seem perfect for each other neither of them is in a relationship but Oliver is afraid they won't last. The movie jumps back and forth from Oliver's relationship with his father and his present relationship with Anna. We get to see how some things of the past have affected him and shaped him in the present. Beginners is not a movie for everyone some might find it slowpaced but it is a very smart film with a good script written by Mike Mills himself this is his first film since the 2005 movie Thumbsucker and it has some great performances. I already mentioned how strong McGregor and Laurent were together but who really has been getting all the praise is Christopher Plummer for his supporting role. He plays an openly gay seventy five year old man who is enjoying life after trying to repress his feelings for so many years. Just when his life begins to look good he is diagnosed with cancer and has to deal with this as well without telling his young lover that he's dying. He gives a terrific performance and will probably get nominated for the Oscars. I however found Laurent's performance to be the true heart of the film. She is just so natural on screen and was so believable she was just amazing. McGregor is a terrific actor as well and we've grown used to seeing him give strong performances. Beginners is a movie for film lovers they won't be disappointed. I recently saw New Year's Eve and that movie had so many romantic stories going on that none of them really rang true but this one is really authentic and worth seeing. The characters are really complex and you can tell it just by looking into their eyes. Great film.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The ultimate measure of a terrible film is I think if you fall asleep during it. I watched this film in broad daylight when I was wide awake and it put me under. It's better than Ambien! To be fair I watched it again and...yup I fell asleep during it again.I've seen enough to know it's twee and very pretentious and wildly overrated by critics. I believe this is because of Christopher Plummer's sympathetic role as an elderly man who comes out of the closet just before dying of cancer. That has movie of the week written all over it and Plummer is quite good in the part. He's actually OLD so this isn't a lot of creepy makeup and he's convincing enough about being a repressed gay man.A film about just this would have been fine even interesting. My only problem here is that the year is 2003  the film states this often  so he came out of the closet at a time when homosexuality was embraced and accepted. Heck it was pretty well embraced and accepted by the 80s and certainly the 90s.But unfortunately the movie is only briefly and occasionally about the father's foray into the homosexual community. 90 is about the SON played by Ewan McGregor and this is boring beyond belief  selfpitying and maudlin and purposeless.Even worse the entire film is based on director Mike Mill's real life almost exactly. So it's autobiographical with all the pitfalls that entails. Obviously Mr. Mills feels sorry just unbearably sorry for....HIMSELF. As if having a gay father is so terrible yet at the same time he must be so politically correct as to not show any discomfort in the protagonist at this development!I must pause here and say that after viewing the bonus making of feature on the DVD I looked Mills up and found that he is actually married to indie filmmaker and performance artist Miranda July  umm not a famous blonde french actress as in this film. In fact Ms. July's fame and indie creds far outweigh his own. She's American so they clearly had no language barrier a big part of their courtship and romance in this film.So as an autobiographical sketch the movie is pretty dishonest. Oliver McGregor is depicted as an cartoonist not a graphic designer as many reviews state! who can barely draw in the general way of James Thurber and who never seems to be actually working. This gives him lots and lots and lots of time for romance caring for his sick dad feeling sad taking care of his supercute dog who talks in SUBTITLES! feeling more sad thinking a lot about the past and angsting over his superpretty French girlfriend.The film kinda of takes a brickbat to slam you over the head  again and again  about how really terribly sad all this is....losing your parent. Now I'm only a bit older than the director and I lost both my parents mom when I was in my 20s and my dad almost exactly when he lost his dad. Sure it's sad but LIFE GOES ON....most of us have jobs kids marriages responsibility and we can't just blubber and whine indefinitely. Also having odd parents or even parents who do not love one another does not handicap most people for life in their own romances or marriage. If this was true half of all people would never get married!One could easily pick up the implication from this film that Mills or Oliver was ruined for adult life and relationships because his dad was a closeted gay man....and I am sure that was not the director's intent.Goran Visnjic plays the father's gay lover and for whatever reason ? they have made him look creepy and weird. I am not sure why since he's a good looking guy.Also I am seriously tired of films where nobody in them has any form of gainful employment yet they lead posh lives in Los Angeles and New York City! and live in huge beautiful homes. Oliver's home here appears to be a cliffside Mediterranean home in Los Feliz that would cost millions of dollars. The romance between him and Anna comes off as false and cute in the manner of old films from the 60s and 70s  the characters go roller skating and steal the skates! graffiti up buildngs take their talking dog into restaurants and generally act childish even though one assumes they are well into their 30s.I think this comes off as false because while director Mills really did have a gay dad he did not have a whimsical romance with a French actress....but instead with a rather famous fellow filmmaker who was American. Frankly this film did not call for ANY romance on Oliver's part it should have stuck to the story about the father and that might have worked. What is left is just meandering jumping back and forth in time confusingly and full of selfpity and gloominess despite the character's wealth privilege and creative success!.ALL OF THIS is made 100 times worse by a musical score so depressing and slow and pitying and which is constantly present without variation that well...what can I say it put me to sleep TWICE.The bright spot of the film is the cute Jack Russell terrier but what the heck did this have to do with anything? It's the father's dog but we don't see HIM interacting with it  only Oliver. Is there a point here besides the dog is very cute? Would a Great Dane or a cat have made the essential storyline any different? NO? then leave it out!In short boring beyond human endurance and twee to the max. Avoid at all costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Selfindulgent piece of neomodernist crap people.Buoyed by the relatively positive ratings and reviews for this film starring the amiable Ewan McGregor and the ever dashing Christopher Plummer I was led to believe that I was going to watch a quirky lifeaffirming tale about the notion of carpe diem in the lives of two proverbially lost people Oliver and Anna. I was so WRONG. Do not set foot in the theater unless you relish feeling as though you've been completed bamboozled by the trailers for this film.The premise seems interesting enough three months after the death of his gay and ailing father Oliver struggles to retain a hopeful and positive outlook on the potential for real human connection in Los Angeles. In flashbacks we are supposed to see the tender and open relationship that Oliver and his father Hal strive to cultivate during the last few years of his life interspersed with brief flashbacks of Oliver's parents attempting to make the best of their marriage of convenience. Shortly after the death of his father Oliver attempts to start a meaningful relationship with Anna a beautiful yet commitmentphobic French actress is there any other kind?. The movie is mostly a kaleidescope of earlyEisenhower era Pop imagery pertaining to sexual identity and gender roles that set the premise behind the disenchanted marriage of Oliver's parents who stayed together for decades out of social obligation and acceptance rather than attraction.So the old man is dying the son is trying and the gays are crying... but what is this movie really about I ask you? This is just another disappointing attempt to create a socially conscious indieflick set in Los Angeles but without the dreary and discomforting presence of any part of town east of the Hollywood Hills. It was basically '500 Days of Summer' sans the effortless charm of Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt or the killer soundtrack. Oliver and Anna's passivity and unblinking acquiescence to everything from Hal's protracted death from cancer to cathartic jaunts around the city to their nearundetectable breakup halfway through the film leaves the viewer completely cold  we're not even really sure what happened. Did they have a fight? If so what was it about? Was I eating popcorn when it happened? Sufficed to say this movie is really light on the plot heavy on the symbolic imagery. And I resent paying twelve bucks to experience what basically feels like a Rorschach test. I left the theater feeling completely cheated out of two hours and not a little frustrated with the lack of flow in the film. Readthroughs of the script must have been a breeze since there were so many breathy protracted pauses and stilted narrative readings by McGregor to make up for the lack of actual plot. The French actressgirlfriend played by Melanie Laurent is so simultaneously chic and weird that you have a hard time taking your eyes off her except to note how unbelievably contrived their first meeting and pursuant relationship is. They meet at a costume party with him dressed like Freud and she looking like a sexuallyconfused schoolboy. Riiiiiight... could have been cute I guess if the actors had even a spark of chemistry between them. The French actress comes off as slightly bipolar not sure if that was part of the script. Nothing about this movie seemed very deep or genuine not the tears nor the laughter what little of it there was.Beware this film and all the hype portraying it as a feelgood drama. Let's call it what it was  a derivative and highly uncomfortable attempt at expressing love between beautiful people on the bigscreen. And  this is just a peeve of mine  next time let's not be so eager to cast an Englishman a Scot and a Frenchwoman in a movie set in a city populated by Hispanics Asians and AfricanAmericans. I got the distinct feeling that Ewan McGregor was terrified to speak for fear that his Scottish accent would take over the scene.".

	onyx:emotionText "Selfindulgent piece of neomodernist crap people.Buoyed by the relatively positive ratings and reviews for this film starring the amiable Ewan McGregor and the ever dashing Christopher Plummer I was led to believe that I was going to watch a quirky lifeaffirming tale about the notion of carpe diem in the lives of two proverbially lost people Oliver and Anna. I was so WRONG. Do not set foot in the theater unless you relish feeling as though you've been completed bamboozled by the trailers for this film.The premise seems interesting enough three months after the death of his gay and ailing father Oliver struggles to retain a hopeful and positive outlook on the potential for real human connection in Los Angeles. In flashbacks we are supposed to see the tender and open relationship that Oliver and his father Hal strive to cultivate during the last few years of his life interspersed with brief flashbacks of Oliver's parents attempting to make the best of their marriage of convenience. Shortly after the death of his father Oliver attempts to start a meaningful relationship with Anna a beautiful yet commitmentphobic French actress is there any other kind?. The movie is mostly a kaleidescope of earlyEisenhower era Pop imagery pertaining to sexual identity and gender roles that set the premise behind the disenchanted marriage of Oliver's parents who stayed together for decades out of social obligation and acceptance rather than attraction.So the old man is dying the son is trying and the gays are crying... but what is this movie really about I ask you? This is just another disappointing attempt to create a socially conscious indieflick set in Los Angeles but without the dreary and discomforting presence of any part of town east of the Hollywood Hills. It was basically '500 Days of Summer' sans the effortless charm of Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt or the killer soundtrack. Oliver and Anna's passivity and unblinking acquiescence to everything from Hal's protracted death from cancer to cathartic jaunts around the city to their nearundetectable breakup halfway through the film leaves the viewer completely cold  we're not even really sure what happened. Did they have a fight? If so what was it about? Was I eating popcorn when it happened? Sufficed to say this movie is really light on the plot heavy on the symbolic imagery. And I resent paying twelve bucks to experience what basically feels like a Rorschach test. I left the theater feeling completely cheated out of two hours and not a little frustrated with the lack of flow in the film. Readthroughs of the script must have been a breeze since there were so many breathy protracted pauses and stilted narrative readings by McGregor to make up for the lack of actual plot. The French actressgirlfriend played by Melanie Laurent is so simultaneously chic and weird that you have a hard time taking your eyes off her except to note how unbelievably contrived their first meeting and pursuant relationship is. They meet at a costume party with him dressed like Freud and she looking like a sexuallyconfused schoolboy. Riiiiiight... could have been cute I guess if the actors had even a spark of chemistry between them. The French actress comes off as slightly bipolar not sure if that was part of the script. Nothing about this movie seemed very deep or genuine not the tears nor the laughter what little of it there was.Beware this film and all the hype portraying it as a feelgood drama. Let's call it what it was  a derivative and highly uncomfortable attempt at expressing love between beautiful people on the bigscreen. And  this is just a peeve of mine  next time let's not be so eager to cast an Englishman a Scot and a Frenchwoman in a movie set in a city populated by Hispanics Asians and AfricanAmericans. I got the distinct feeling that Ewan McGregor was terrified to speak for fear that his Scottish accent would take over the scene.";

	schema:reviewBody "As with many of the other reviewers I was sucked into this abyss by the intrepid trailers that were somehow cobbled together to make this seem like it would be a very interesting film. I should start by saying that whoever made those trailers should get an Oscar nod for best editing. So the film is artsy and jumps all over the place. Yes that makes sense to people who live in a nonlinear world where things that happened ages ago are happening now. It was done in 500 Days of Summer someone else mentioned that with characters that I actually found interesting. The basic plot is that there is some guy who has a dad who comes out at 75 or so. The dad also has cancer and a stupid boyfriend and then he dies. The son has this nonconformist mom who has already died off so we just see her in flashbacks. He meets a French actress and they have a relationship ? and yes there is the obligatory cute dog who can't be left alone. The guy and the girl split up ? and then he goes to see her in NYC and she never left LA and then it still drags on for like another 20 minutes. Then they are on the bed talking and it's the end. Mike Mills directed this and his directing skills are great in small doses. Like music videos by the band Air for example. Overall Ewan's acting was wooden and flat. And no he did not disguise his Scottish accent all that well. The main character has such a flat affect that I wondered if he is supposed to be autistic or if I was just thinking that so there might be something I could find relatable to myself in this film. The actor playing the father was great the other incidental characters were just that and the 35 years younger boyfriend was horrifyingly stereotypical and annoying. I did not find any of the characters all that believable or bearable. The plot is ethereal at best. I find the splicing time from then to then to now and back again to be a gimmick to cover up a weak story. Which was basically all this was.".

Ewan McGregor and Melanie Laurent have beautiful chemistry and the performances are even more beautiful because Melanie Laurent's character has laryngitis and she communicates only with her eyes smile and notepad. The little dog Arthur is a delight whenever he's on screen and he has huge chemistry with his owner. There's a few incredibly well written lines especially Mills' decision to place dialogue captions over Arthur's piercing eye contact. Christopher Plummer has a very showy part as a lifeloving cancerstricken openly gay old man. That and the fact that 82 year old Plummer had only chalked up a single nomination in his career are the reasons he won the Oscar in 2011. That's not to say that Plummer isn't good because he does a good job but compared to performances like Jonah Hill Moneyball as well as unnominated work by Ryan Philippe The Lincoln Lawyer Stellan Skarsgard The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and half the cast of Midnight in Paris Plummer comes up short. His performance in Danny Collins is far superior in every way.This film had no business being 105 minutes long. Some things that are sweet at first become grating. Even Melanie Laurent can't keep me engrossed in the film as she and McGregor go through their inevitable love story. The editing of the film does much to create confusion. I don't know why this film is set in 2003 but for a viewer the timeline jumping can be confusing if we don't know that 2003 is the film's present day. Beginners serves as a reminder than Melanie Laurent is a treasure who should be in more movies but little else.".

I thought this was a film about a man's elderly father who comes out of the closet late in life. Yes that is a component of this film but it was not essential nor even that interesting. Nor was the story of Oliver Fields Ewan McGregor's weakest role to date. Oliver seems to have difficulties maintaining relationships. Okay so what? Who cares? Then he meets Anna a charming Melanie Laurent who is apparently an actress on a shoot in Los Angeles. If as she says she is always spending her life in hotel rooms she must be a big enough actress that a production company can fly her here and there and put her up. And yet she doesn't seem to have any work commitments in this film. Oliver who is some kind of quirky graphic artist who apparently had one success now seems to be utterly bizarre and out of touch with what his clients want. At any rate they seem to have tons of time to do nothing but this strange limbo dance sexquasiromance thing. The movie spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to get Oliver and Anna together while it also tries to convince us that Hal Fields Christopher Plummer has been welcomed into the gay community an older gay community and not ONE of them was goodlooking it looks like the producers scoured some Silverlake gay dive and found whoever they could get and is finally getting to have the life he wanted. Okay intriguing. At least Hal seemed ALIVE and INTERESTED in LIVING. Anna and Oliver have that sort of I've been hurt I'm depressed I want to love you but I can't I'm confused maybe I should run away look in their faces. Barf. And let's not forget the endless scenes with Oliver's mother when he was a child her quirkiness her weirdness her depression. Okay yeah maybe but... it didn't engage me. On top of all this the movie looks really lifeless. The colors are dull the locations are dull the homes hotels and apartments the producers managed to secure all had this slightly dumpy look about them not to mention some inexplicably bizarre artwork in Oliver's pad. We are supposed to feel sorry for Oliver and we are forcedfed that message for the majority of the film with images and voiceovers and flashbacks ad nauseam. But I didn't because he did not seem worth caring about. He seemed selfinvolved depressed hurt and the sort of person you'd want to say You know what? Get over it. And then slap him. Because that's the only therapy that's going to work. I guess the filmmaker was trying to somehow dovetail the two stories and show how Hal was a beginner in love because he was finally going for what he wanted and that Oliver and Anna two damaged souls were also beginners in love because they finally agree to start. So that said can anyone explain to me why in the middle of this film Oliver and one of his weird buddies decide to go graffiti a wall on some public property in the middle of the night? In what way did that scene enhance the story or further the plot? I kept asking myself Okay when does the movie START? and Whatever happened to Hal? since he seems to vanish for a huge swath of the film. All the actors are good actors but this film does not provide a vehicle of any sorts for their talents. And dear Wardrobe MasterMistress We do not need to tie cute little colorful kerchiefs around the necks of men in their 70s to show how colorful they are or to let everyone know that they're gay.Two thumbs down and I really came to it wanting to have a good enjoyable heartwarming experience.

So he's all really depressed not that he's an orphan he's actually in his thirties and spends his days working on sad cartoons looking sad feeling sad and wondering why this whole world is such a sad place. The word sad crops up about every two minutes and must be the most widely used word in the entire film both spoken and in writing. Now before you feel too sorry for this bloke you should understand that he's got a great house a good job a few friends and wait for it a really hot girl friend why she is attracted to him is anyone's guess. But when they move together he can't even enjoy this but keeps being sad about err honestly I don't know about what he just is sad for the sake of it. You could think that this is a film about clinical depression as mental illness just like A Beautiful Mind being about schizophrenia but there is no hint of that and I don't think it is meant to be.

He's even more upset when Plummer gets a lover Goran Visnjic who is easily 30 years younger than him! After his father dies I'm not giving anything away he deals with a beautiful girl named Anna Melanie Laurent and is afraid of committing to her. For some reason this has something to do with his father!What a mess! This film is all over the place. No consistent tone and seemingly no rhyme or reason to how scenes were set up. The episodes between McGregor Plummer and occasionally Visnjic are fascinating. If they had just concentrated on those relationships this might have worked. However the scenes between McGregor and Laurent are monumentally boring and seem to have nothing to with the sequences with Plummer! Even worse Laurent's heavy French accent makes most of her dialogue unintelligible. To make things even worse than that an adorable French Terrier is given lines shown in subtitles and they're better than any of the spoken dialogue! Also those scenes come out of nowhere and lead to nothing. Acting is all over the placelike the script. McGregor is a wonderful actor but he covers up his Scottish accent here and it seems to drain all the life out of his performance. He's just dull! Laurent is beautiful but I could have cared less about her character and got annoyed at trying to decipher her lines. Visjnic is a joy here but he's gets too few scenes. However Plummer is wonderful! He easily blows all of the other actors off the screen effortlessly and gives a tremendous performance. When it's on him and his relationship with McGregor it works. But more often and not it doesn't. Boring and disjointed. Too bad. I give it a 2.".

Can't say that I'd really recommend it and would be surprised if it was bought by anybody other than BET or Mtv. Decent directing but ultimately a tired and weak production. Acting was pretty bad. No actors possessed any musical skill in my opinion and the lyrics were absolutely horrid. I don't like to trash anything with out good reason and if you take my word on anything about how bad this film is trust me on the lyrics. they're sad. not to mention there's some character in the movie which should not have been given a rap line at all... including an old stubborn white guy and a snobbish white girl. The actors playing the rappers couldn't even really pull it off. The actress playing Jewel was the only real upside to the entire project. She was beautiful and had a decent voice but nothing that could save this project from disaster.".

Can't say that I'd really recommend it and would be surprised if it was bought by anybody other than BET or Mtv. Decent directing but ultimately a tired and weak production. Acting was pretty bad. No actors possessed any musical skill in my opinion and the lyrics were absolutely horrid. I don't like to trash anything with out good reason and if you take my word on anything about how bad this film is trust me on the lyrics. they're sad. not to mention there's some character in the movie which should not have been given a rap line at all... including an old stubborn white guy and a snobbish white girl. The actors playing the rappers couldn't even really pull it off. The actress playing Jewel was the only real upside to the entire project. She was beautiful and had a decent voice but nothing that could save this project from disaster.";

Everyone was as professional as anyone on any set that I've ever been on! I worked most closely with Les Feltmate The Other Police Officer Lindsey Haun Jewel Stephanie Dyann Kara Nate Parker Rome Cole Griffin Jay Russel Howard Perry and a host of very young Extras. Everyone was great on this set and I have extremely fond memories of working on this film last August and Sept.Working with Director Charlie Kanganis was a distinct pleasure! Charlie is a very intense yet a personable and fair director with an extraordinary eye for detail. One of my favorite memories is when he took the 78 pound 35mm film camera on his' own shoulder to demonstrate what he wanted done in one particular shot. He was awesome to work with and I would like to work with him again someday.I happen to have had three films playing in The Film Festivals this year but of all Rome And Jewel was the best and it was my only fulllength feature in the festivals this year.Furthermore this movie was done on a very tight budget. I thought that with our budget that this turned out to be a very good looking film! Of course it isn't Oscarworthy it wasn't mean't to be such a film. This is more of a film with a message and I hope that it's message is understood and heeded to by today's young people.See this film! Don't see it because we worked hard to make it but because it's a good movie it is entertaining and the message against racial bigotry is strong and it is a good lesson for all audiences that prejudice can lead to extraordinary tragedies. This is a message that is timely even in the early 21st Century. David Cubero".

At first I thought Oh not another take on Romeo and Juliet... but I was really drawn into this story mainly because of the strong acting and the catchy and memorable songs. And let's face it anything that gets our kids to accept Shakespeare is a good thing. I show Baz Luhrmann's excellent movie when I want to ease them into the nuances and rhythms of Elizabethan language.But Rome and Jewel is even more accessible viewing.Set in Los Angeles present day  hence contemporary dialects and language it tells the story of a young white girl who falls instantly in love with a young black guy who crashes her sweet sixteen party. This causes a clash between the white kids and the black kids at the party that spills out into the streets of LA. Meanwhile there's an intense political back story just as in Shakespeare's play and the lovers do their best to keep their romance secret...The actor playing Mercury was fantastic. I hope he gets discovered soon. Okay I just looked him up and he will be playing a character named Goatee in the fourth Die Hard installment. I hope it's a substantial role.This movie is gorgeously shot and well edited. See it whenever you get the chance. Now I want to look up and watch everything this director has done because he really knows what he is doing behind the camera.".

Seeing that the film went straight to cable really didn't surprise me espescially seeing as how this isn't really for mainstream audiences but then again neither was Monster's Ball. Anyhow I'm rambling so let me get to the point here. The Badge didn't go to theaters because certain people felt that Billy Bob's character Darl was too similar to his character Hank in Monster's Ball.  Whatever the reason I don't really care.  At least I got to see it and I AM thankful for that. The Badge tells the story of a Louisiana Parish Sheriff who normally doesn't appreciate gays but has to put aside his predjudices and personal beliefs to solve a murder of a transexual.  Sound strange? Well it is and it isn't.  That depends on what kind of person you are.  Personally I found the movie to be quite accurate in showing the deep south for what it really is.  The politics were espescially accurate and it was pretty brave of Robby Henson to delve into that matter as deep as he did.  Obviously this movie isn't just about politics but the southern and smalltown mentality as well.  How do I know? Well I was raised there so I have a good understanding of how things work down there.  Another thing  While some of the characters have been called comic book or stereotypes they're pretty accurate as well.  Much like in Sling Blade I felt like I knew some of these people.  I also found the plot turns and acting to be very well executed.  As far as that goes no one gives a bad performance here.  All that said The Badge is definitely worth a look.".

I have said as much before and I will say again here Mr Thornton is the very best character actor in the US today and one of the best in the world.It is no surprise to find a great actor tackling scripts that are well out of the main stream this shows a thinking caring actor who is prepared to take risks and give more credibility to the work than to the star spin offs.This movie is not a great one but it is a very worthwhile experience that is at least thought provoking and contains some very fine acting from most of it's cast. The only real problem was the writerdirector combination. This is not to say that the writing or the direction was bad on the contrary the direction particularly was very sound and the writing was fine though a little too formular in its shape. It's nearly always a mistake to direct ones own work like reading ones own poetry it becomes very hard to let a line go in an instant when one is aware of how long it took to birth it. The Badge is fine and has some real strengths its weakness lies in the denouement where there is the sense of a rather obvious ball being suddenly rushed to the goal post before time runs out for the some what staged final scene.This work is worth the effort on many fronts B.B.Thornton is excellent and that woman! what a sterling performance she gives in a very difficult role and against all kinds of odds.

	schema:reviewBody "Patricia Arquette and Billy Bob Thorton are at their best in this gritty quasinoir crime drama set in Louisiana. Thorton's character is similiar to the one that he played in Monster's Ball. This role however was more sympathetic but not as complex. Arquette is good at playing characters that live on the edge but still manage to be morally strong and honest. She also has an extremely potent sex appeal that is simultaneously mature and girlish. The story is a coplex one with lots of twists and turns. There are secrets in the small town of LaSalle Parrish and they are artfully revealed by the director whose style is a little clunky but engaging nonetheless. I recommend this movie. It's message of tolerance is very important and could not have been more clearly stated.".

Yes the film is paced slowly but as the sheriff in hot water finally realizes the only way to regain his honor and perhaps his job is by solving the case the action picks up.  Billy Bob Thornton gives another perfect performance and Patricia Arquette is stronger than ever.

There are a lot of similarities between these 2 movies not just the fact that BBob Thornton is in both although he was definitely much better in the former. He pulls in a fine one in this movie as usual but I wouldn't say it's his best role yet.  I don't see Patricia Arquette too often so I don't really know how good an actress she is in this movie she's passable. William Devane usually plays the villains but this time he plays a crooked judge but he doesn't really quite have that evil persona that he usually has. I kind of miss that. The other supporting cast members were rather good especially the real murderer. If you're perceptive enough you'll probably know it's him somewhere along the movie but if not just watch to the end. The movie might test your patience and seem like it would end in predictability but just sit it out. It's not a great movie but it's a good one.".

Sheriff Billy Bob Thornton blearyeyed from a night of boozing arrives on the scene. He and his deputy find the body of the young female laying nearby in the ravine. She's dead but not from the truck.

However the only way to fairly review 'The Badge' terrible title is to point out some of its flaws and that requires spoilers.WARNING SPOILERSThe medical examiner discovers that in regards to the female victim 'the lady is no lady'. He's a borderline transgender that is his breasts are feminine but he still male sex organs. Here in lies the beginnings of the movie's deepest flaw because this shemale is legally married to Patricia Arquette. Since at least at the time of the release of 'The Badge' same sex marriage was illegal in Louisiana Arquette MUST be a FEMALE. Billy Bob would KNOW that but still anguishes over his attraction to Arquette not sure she's a woman. Shemale or not Billy Bob's attraction to Patricia Arquette is pretty understandable since Patricia like her sister Roseanna has those world class 'knockout body' genes. Most heterosexual males would be turned on by since they're looking at the 'appearance package' and not 'checking out the interior.' If Arquette's shemale husband wanted to 'go all the way' with the sex change what's he doing with Arquette?END OF SPOILERSPerhaps the worse aspect of 'The Badge' is it's overly optimistic ending. Most of us would like troubles to be wrapped up in such neat little packages but they virtually never are.However 'The Badge' can be highly praised for one of its 'Playboy philosophy' truths. Organized religion to the contrary sex is about a whole hell of a lot more than procreation. Perhaps the BEST attribute of sex is that is the most dramatic method to display intimacy and affection for another person. If this were not true all those 'righteous religious' married couples who cannot conceive but continue to have sex would be committing sin. Perhaps just as importantly if sex can thus be disconnected from procreation does it really matter what kind of sex it is? Isn't it more important that the two people care about each other and are not just using each others bodies? 'The Badge' boasts fine performances by Thornton Arquette and Thomas Hayden Church as Billy Bob's brother. Despite it's flaws 'The Badge' is good for a '6'. See it whether you are open minded or not.

It's quite interesting as a groundlevel look at the culture of corruption in preKatrina Louisiana and there's some human realism in its story of a simple man dealing with his complicated life. But the mystery that runs through this film is really put together out of spit and bailing wire and the story as a whole starts out reasonably smart then gets dumber and dumber and dumber as it goes along until hitting an ending that's like something a 4th grader would come up with.Darl Hardwick Billy Bob Thornton is the good ole' boy sheriff of LeSalle Parish in rural Louisiana. He's got an alcoholic burnout for a father Tom Bower an exwife Sela Ward who's the county District Attorney and a daughter that dresses like a goth stripper. Darl likes to drink and then sleep it off in his truck. He's also more of a peace officer than an agent of law enforcement meaning he sees the job of sheriff as being more about things like chasing off the kids who are loitering in front of the local grocery store and not about investigating crimes. As sheriff Darl is also a cog in the parish's political machine. He's answerable to The Judge William Devane the richest and most powerful man in the local Democratic Party but Darl is free to indulge in whatever little graft he can.Darl's life in LeSalle Parish is disturbed when he and his deputies discover a dead woman in a ditch. They're disturbed even more when the woman turns out to be a transgendered man. Darl isn't all that interested in finding out who killed what he considers a freak even after the man's wife Scarlett Patricia Arquette shows up demanding justice. When The Judge makes it clear that he wants the whole thing hushed up because it might affect his plans to open a new casino Darl is ready to let the whole matter drop. But then he finds out the Democratic Party is kicking him off the ticket and running his black deputy for Sheriff. That makes Darl a little more interested in what happened to his transgendered murder victim. Then Darl gets framed for statutory rape by the local powersthatbe and that makes him very interested in finding the killer.Teaming up with Scarlett and getting an assist from his estranged brother Thomas Haden Church Darl uncovers a sordid tale of political intrigue that reaches all the way up to the governor himself and the even more seedy reason for the murder of Scarlett's husband. By this point in the film things begin to get very stupid very quickly so I'll stop right here.I enjoyed the way The Badge depicted the commonplace unquestioned venality and crookedness of life in LeSalle Parish. Louisiana has been renowned for its relaxed attitude toward ethics good government and the law for long time and this movie shows you what that means at the local level with public officials who don't think twice about enriching themselves and always make sure to spread a little around to keep everybody else happy. LeSalle Parish is kind of like a bayou North Korea a closed society that runs things the way they've always been run and doesn't cotton to outsiders.Darl Hardwick is a part of that world and it's a part of him. He's not exactly happy but he's comfortable and he doesn't think more than that is possible. Billy Bob Thornton does a good job portraying Darl with honesty. He's not a good person or a bad person. He's somebody who does moderately good things and moderately bad things without knowing enough or caring to distinguish between the two. Darl is the sort of man you condemn when looking at him from the outside without ever being able to understand him.Unfortunately as the movie rolls on it casts Darl as more and more of a generic noir hero. That robs the character of his uniqueness and Thornton appears to become bored with the role and just goes through the motions. None of the other characters are given enough to do to make any impression on the audience one way or the other.And the mystery of the transgendered murder victim iswell pathetic is the best word to describe it. It's the classic case of having every clue point in one direction and then throwing in a twist that completely changes things. The problem is that the twist involves people simply telling Darl what all the answers are while he stands there with the proverbial thumb up his butt. And those answers are things that neither Darl nor the audience could have figured out before hand because they're pulled in out of left field with nothing shown in the movie to support them. And the one question that isn't specifically cleared up for Darl is one the audience has figured out before the film is halfway over.The Badge does have a smattering of female nudity and Patricia Arquette in a thong which added to its other virtues should have made this a decent movie. But its flaws are so noticeable that it's impossible to know how anyone will respond to this film. I like and I can imagine someone else enjoying it even more. However I can also imagine someone thinking The Badge is garbage and being justified in thinking so. So if you're thinking about renting this DVD flip a coin. You might get luckyor you might not.".

But its flaws are so noticeable that it's impossible to know how anyone will respond to this film. I like and I can imagine someone else enjoying it even more. However I can also imagine someone thinking The Badge is garbage and being justified in thinking so. So if you're thinking about renting this DVD flip a coin. You might get luckyor you might not.";

Still interesting but something is missing from the plot. You really don't believe the trouble Darl gets in when Monas wife gets the grip of him...Due to this it's not easy to give this more than a 7 or 8 out of ten but I think many fans of Thornton and Arquette will like this one.Absolutely worthwhile watching and not far from becoming a cult classic.

Try to guess what's going to happen a scene or two ahead and you can't. Billy Bob plays a very believable somewhat lethargic lawman who'd just as soon take a nap in his pickup as solve a bizarre crime. Number two... the conflict Billy Bob vs. the powers that be who want a baffling crime to remain unsolved. In most films Southern Politics either makes for good drama or it comes off as silly and pretentious. In this case it's the basis for numerous tense situations involving ethical questions. Number three...the humor drama just doesn't work as well without it and this film gives the giggles when it counts.The action is truly about Billy Bob's sheriff character finding his own true self among the corrupt local and state politicians. He manages both to find himself and to serve justice to the underground sex community which serves the state politicians in a noquestions asked deal. Also William Devane delivers a satisfying performance as the rich guy manipulating local politics. Sela Ward is good in a small if predictable role as Thornton's exwife now the assistant DA. All in all it is a great drama for adults who aren't offended by sexuality and bad language and children who are old and mature enough to watch this type of movie.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

The mystery starts off a little slowly but after all the characters are introduced the plot becomes more and more interesting.

It was LaSalle's Sheriff Darl HardwickBilly Bob Thorton who started to get the ball rolling by coming across a dead body on the highway where a tractortrailer carrying a truckload of shoes overturned in order to avoid hitting a fleeing women who got it front of it.As things turned out the woman later identified as Mona Cindy Roubal a stripper at the Johnny Angel club in New Orleans was actually a man undergoing a sex change operation! It's when Mona's grieving wife Sacrlett Pattricia Arquette showed up at the local morgue to identify the body that things started jumping at the Parish. It's discovered that she Moma was involved with Governor BeakNose Beraton and his top honchos including Da' Judge William Devane who happened to be the biggest political powerbroker in the state the night she was murdered!As it soon came out Mona was invited by the Gov to preform at an exclusive sex club outside of LaSalle Parish doing her famous strip tease act. It's when it was discovered that she was in fact a man Mona was kicked out and left on her own with no way to get back home in the Big Easy! Shot by an unknown assailant Mona bleeding and running for her life ended up dead on the side of the road with a bullet in her or his back! It's now up to Sheriff Hardwick to track down Mona's killer but with Da' Gov Da' Judge and all the political big shots in the Perish determined not to let the truth of Mona's involvement with Da' Gov see the light of day it was Sheriff Hardwick not anyone else who found himself behind the eight ball!Then movie The Badge never really takes off and meanders around for a good 90 minutes with Sheriff Hardwick getting arrested in a statutory rape frameup with 15 year old Hardy Party Girl Audrey Marie Anderson whom he drove home after she passed out drunk at a club that Da' Gov attended. It's then that Hardwick drives down to New Orleans and finds out what Mona was all about which has both him and Scarlett Mona's wife almost killed by Da' Judge's goons!

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERS Confusing and jumbled crime drama involving a murder in LaSalle Parish Louisiana that can implicate the governor BeakNose Joe Breraton Michael Arata and not only destroy his bid for reelection but put him behind bars as well. It was LaSalle's Sheriff Darl HardwickBilly Bob Thorton who started to get the ball rolling by coming across a dead body on the highway where a tractortrailer carrying a truckload of shoes overturned in order to avoid hitting a fleeing women who got it front of it.As things turned out the woman later identified as Mona Cindy Roubal a stripper at the Johnny Angel club in New Orleans was actually a man undergoing a sex change operation! It's when Mona's grieving wife Sacrlett Pattricia Arquette showed up at the local morgue to identify the body that things started jumping at the Parish. It's discovered that she Moma was involved with Governor BeakNose Beraton and his top honchos including Da' Judge William Devane who happened to be the biggest political powerbroker in the state the night she was murdered!As it soon came out Mona was invited by the Gov to preform at an exclusive sex club outside of LaSalle Parish doing her famous strip tease act. It's when it was discovered that she was in fact a man Mona was kicked out and left on her own with no way to get back home in the Big Easy! Shot by an unknown assailant Mona bleeding and running for her life ended up dead on the side of the road with a bullet in her or his back! It's now up to Sheriff Hardwick to track down Mona's killer but with Da' Gov Da' Judge and all the political big shots in the Perish determined not to let the truth of Mona's involvement with Da' Gov see the light of day it was Sheriff Hardwick not anyone else who found himself behind the eight ball!Then movie The Badge never really takes off and meanders around for a good 90 minutes with Sheriff Hardwick getting arrested in a statutory rape frameup with 15 year old Hardy Party Girl Audrey Marie Anderson whom he drove home after she passed out drunk at a club that Da' Gov attended. It's then that Hardwick drives down to New Orleans and finds out what Mona was all about which has both him and Scarlett Mona's wife almost killed by Da' Judge's goons! SPOILERS It's only at the very end that the movie starts to makes a bit of sense in what was the real motivation for poor Mona's murder!

	schema:reviewBody "Three issues dealt with in this movie. 1 Who murdered Mona the transsexual? 2 Will the sheriff Billy Bob Thornton overcome his revulsion for queers men who dry flowers women who like to wear spike collars people of either sex who lust after cold sauerkraut and other assorted wimps and preverts sufficiently to come to be truly in love with Mona's wife Scarlett Arquette? And 3 whatever is going to become of all these corrupt politicians? The movie is nicely shot on location in Louisiana. The direction is competent with only a few quick shots to dizzy the viewer. And the plot has a lot of texture to it. We honestly get the feeling that everyone in the parish knows everyone else. When a truck overturns and spills its load of shoes along the side of the road Thornton makes several phone calls to the folks to come out and get some free shoes! Thornton's performance is really quite good. His morals are no better than they should be perhaps. He shags his deputy's wife in the back seat of her own car. He hands out spilled shoes recklessly. He cheated on the wife who now despises him and has virtually no contact with his daughter to whom he is irrelevant. Yet he comes across as a laid back sort of Southerner easy going but a man who will stand firm when he feels he's being given the business. Not that he's one of those super action heroes. Thornton himself is no muscle man and a black guy in a New Orleans strip club easily subdues him. Patricia Arquette is such a cool blonde she seems positively Icelandic. And what eyes! It's impossible to put the color of her irises into words. Sela Ward is beautiful classy and voluptuous and Thornton is a cretin for having cheated on her. I enjoyed William DeVane as the Southern judge too. DeVane is always reliable and it's fun to see him as a genial and corrupt old pol hobbling around on his walking stick. But it's Thornton who makes the movie and he's very good.Who killed Mona? SPOILERS Mona was shot by a factory reject with an IQ in the negative numbers and a moral code to match. The killing was simplicity itself. Almost everything else layered on in between tells us more about the community and its politics than about the murderer. Simply put in the beginning Thornton finds Mona's dead body. At the end he discovers that the overweight garage owner has a hole drilled through the wall of the lady's room so he can watch what goes on. When he discovers that Mona is anatomically male he goes berserk and Thornton gets him. The end.But that brings us to issue numbers two and three. The movie draws a clear line between the righteous members of the community and the oddballs who live in New Orleans. Thornton at first is between the two but is repelled by hookers no matter how sympathetic amused when he finds that the victim's body has a penis. He has kicked his gay brother out of the Parish in order to be elected sheriff. By the end it turns out that unfettered righteousness is more dangerous than open paraphilia. The reason Mona was in the Parish in the first place is that she had been brought from New Orleans to attend a stag party given by the politicians. And she was killed by a man who believes her murder was justified because she shoulda never used the lady's room. Thornton rethinks his morality and comes to accept the oddballs for the human beings that they are.I don't mean the movie is that preachy. Nobody makes speeches about it. It simply shows us Thornton's greater tolerance which makes it possible for him to rebond with his family and with Arquette. It's a decent flick although people who think homosexuals are sick preverted and deserving of death are unlikely to find it enjoyable in any way.".

He always refers to his need to kill as a profession and even has a mentor. Through them we see the world as if it were a game. The mockumentary parts are not only hilarious we get to see the monsters side of things. The door that won't stay open? Probably rigged.

The second half of the movie is when we get to see Leslie in action. Because we have seen him as human in the first half seeing him as a monster in the second isn't as scary as one might expect. It is not supposed to be. Leslie Vernon has become a person we know who made us laugh who keeps pet turtles. He is not some random resurrected guy with an axe to grind. He is a guy at work albeit disgusting and immoral work he is still a guy at work. Set up this way it is a bit like watching two movies. The two parts play off each other very well. This movie is darkly funny. No one wants to laugh as scary things happen but when things work out just as Leslie predicts they will even the documentary crew gets very enthusiastic. Robert Englund Freddy Kreuger read this script and was impressed. being a big name in horror he admittedly gets swamped with scripts. This movie interested him enough that he accepted the role. If you can't decide if you should watch it remember that. And then rent it with friends.Everyone needs someone to look up to.

These comments such as why didn't they run why didn't they kill him why don't they group together are all addressed in the documentary part of the film. This movie was genius because it shows you how the slashing will happen beforehand and the victims are victims because they are too stupid act properly against the killer's foreshadowing. That's the movie that's what makes it funny. Although it's a slasher flick it's not a serious slasher flick at all.Watch it again and you'll see why it's an awesome movie. It makes fun of the genre in a way that has never been done before. It doesn't steal from the Scream series. The Scream series made fun of the horror film in general this movie pretended the killers in those films were real and makes fun of how stupid victims can be and how predictable the sequences are in a slasher situation.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love how people complain about the slasher part of this movie and their complaints are exactly what this movie was making fun of. These comments such as why didn't they run why didn't they kill him why don't they group together are all addressed in the documentary part of the film. This movie was genius because it shows you how the slashing will happen beforehand and the victims are victims because they are too stupid act properly against the killer's foreshadowing. That's the movie that's what makes it funny. Although it's a slasher flick it's not a serious slasher flick at all.Watch it again and you'll see why it's an awesome movie. It makes fun of the genre in a way that has never been done before. It doesn't steal from the Scream series. The Scream series made fun of the horror film in general this movie pretended the killers in those films were real and makes fun of how stupid victims can be and how predictable the sequences are in a slasher situation.";

	schema:headline " Original and clever alternative to Scream";
	schema:reviewBody "Wes Craven's Scream was a strikingly deadon persiflage of the Slasher genre while at the same time including enough scares to become more than just a parody but an important part of that genre itself. Behind The Mask The Rise Of Leslie Vernon is very similar in that aspect but it's also completely different in others.For the most part the movie is a fake documentary in true Spinal Tapfashion. A TV crew follows Leslie Vernon around a guy who has the ambition to become the next slasher legend after his idols Michael Myers Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger who exist in the movie's reality. As Leslie shows the team how he prepares for a killing spree he deconstructs one horror rule after the other with pretty amusing results. The movie observes the genre pretty well and the sort of Backstage look we get of a horror icon lovingly planning his big night is nothing short of hilarious. Where Scream made fun of some ridiculous horror clichs and toyed around with them Behind The Mask is merely explaining just how those seemingly supernatural killers are able to work so effectively. So although both movies cover similar ground Behind The Mask is never in any way repetitive.Leslie Vernon turns out to be a really sweet guy who just loves what he's doing. He's friends with an older more experienced slasher who's also very warm and talkative. Neither of those guys look like typical maniacs so when Leslie does make his first appearance masked and all it's rather amusing.However the movie makes a pretty amazing turn in the final third. For the big showdown we leave the moviewithinamovie scenario created by the documentary setup and are taken right into the movie's reality. All of a sudden Behind The Mask turns into a real slasher film. Although this last part isn't halfbad it's not quite as enjoyable as what preceded it. The twist is a bit predictable and the movie lacks real gore and suspense at the end in order to work as a slasher flick. One has to say that Scream coming from an old professional such as Wes Craven was more successful in that aspect. Still regarding the fact that this movie strictly concentrates on fun in the first two thirds and only begins to throw in full on horror bits in the end the showdown works quite well.Leslie's mask was chosen wisely. It can look ridiculous and scary depending on the mood of the scene. Nathan Baesel who makes his movie debut here was chosen even more wisely. He can play the nice guy and the psychopath without ever overacting and hands in a great great performance. The other member of the cast that must be mentioned is horror legend Robert Englund who does a nice Donald Pleasanceimpersonation.The subtle little homages to Friday The 13th Halloween and A Nightmare On Elm Street throughout the movie are the icing on the cake and will make the heart of every true horror fan beat faster. And that's the only true flaw of Behind The Mask right there it's for true horror geeks only who can laugh about the inside jokes. Everyone else will probably not be entertained as much. If you're into the genre though there's no way you should miss this excellent motion picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those considering if they should invest the 80 minutes or so to watch this film allow a true horror fan to give you his ten cents. First let's talk about the bad...because lets face it...it's rare for a film to get something right.BAD 1. Plot holes There are a few plot holes in the film in regards to a few of the central characters Leslie's background Eugene is never explained and of course neither is the doc's sorry forgot his name.2. The reaction of the film crew...at times they seem to be having fun with this whole 'real life' slashermovie guru but there is a big shift at the end when the killing starts. This is odd because earlier in the film someone gets killed too and nobody seemed that worked up over it...oh wait...it must have been because she was some short old woman.3. Acting This is hard to classify seeing as this is a lowbudget B movie but sometimes the actors do a great job and then other times it didn't work for me. Some of the lines seemed forced and the acting here and there a bit stiff and wooden. Especially all the teens oh man they sucked! 4. Gore hounds will be disappointed in this movie because most of the kills aren't shown or are shot at a distant. This didn't bother me in this day and age where gore is constant in films HostelSaw. However when making a parody of 80's slasher films gore was everywhere. I mean hell it was the rise of the splatter flick! How can you make a movie like this without having gore? Feddy Michael and Jason created the slashergore genre in the states! If they were going to do this part of the film better they should have made the gore over the top in a kind of Peter JacksonSam Raimi style. Oh well maybe it wasn't in their budget.4. The last five minutes of the movie was a bust. Things happened so quick I couldn't help but thinkoh no they're running out of money. It was either that or the editor made a few too many snips. I won't point anything out because it spoil a few kills but you'll see it when it happens.GOOD 1. Extremely funny! I wasn't sure about this movie when I got itwent out on a limb after hearing some decent reviews. This movie hooked me from the start with its campiness black humor and twist. A lot of people point at Scream as being the movie that turned the horror genre upside down by playing with a particular genrebut I think BEHIND THE MASK did a much better job.2. Great lines and for the most part good performances. The main characters Leslie Reporter chick Eugene etc. where all acted really well. Sure they missed a few spots here and there but over all they were good. Leslie really sold his role well better than some of the leading Hollywood actors these days that's for sure.3 Fun story! This is what the horror genre needs people who make fun camp movies. In today's sick age where we got all these stupid TORTURE PORN movies it's nice to sit back and just enjoy the story. Sure as I mentioned above the gore was missed to an extent but at least it wasn't in my face the whole time replacing good storytelling with some cheap splatter effects.4. This movie is great for drinking games! Man there are so many symbols inside jokes and references that I want to see it again just to see what I missed during the first viewing.Okay overall it's an enjoyable filmespecially for us guys from the 80's who grew up with the movies referenced in this. For those looking for something scary or full of goreskip it. You'll only be disappointed but if your looking for a fun flick check this one out.".

There have been very similar movies made in this vein such as MAN BITES DOG and in some respects THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT but the best and most effective examples of this subgenre have always come from overseas. BEHIND THE MASK is the first independentlymade American feature that finally gets it right. Nathan Baesel is a name you should be watching for in the future because in his film debut as the titular 'hero' of the piece he's funny charming selfingratiating and as focused dedicated and meticulous as any upandcoming hardcharging young hopeful should be.

It's all a good time until somebody gets a posthole digger shoved through their chest...There are really so many things I want to blab about concerning this great deconstruction of the slasher horror genre one of the best since the first SCREAM installment.

I won't say where you'll see them...just pay close attention.And I also want to mention the best part of the flick  when it makes its startling transition from faux horror documentary to outandout horror film. Don't worry you'll pretty much know when it happens. Glosserman and cowriter David J. Stieve have done a great job in finding an imaginative way to recharge the batteries of the slasher flick on a lowbudget using clichs in a manner that nobody has ever thought of rather than simply giving in to the temptation to simply use them like every other 'FRIDAY THE 13TH'NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREETHALLOWEEN knockoff.Gorehounds will find the relatively light bloodletting a little disappointing but there's so much more to enjoy here than the raptures of evisceration and dismemberment.I'm excited that this is Glosserman's first feature because it makes a great calling card and gives us fans so much more to look forward to from him. So if you are a fan who's become a little jaded with the horror releases of late go rent BEHIND THE MASK immediately!. You won't be sorry I promise. And DO stick around for the credits if just to hear the Talking Heads' original rendition of the great and fitting song Psycho Killer...you'll be glad you did!".

That being said the second part turns into a fullblown slasher. The break is WAY too rough to really make it believable plus the slasher part does not deliver the suspense nor the action nor the gore we would expect from that kind of movie which makes it quite monotonous and basically dull. The director did an okay job alternating between handheld video cameras for the documentary parts and stable HD cams for the slasher parts. The guys does have a respect for the genre but that won't necessarily make the movie good. The cast is pretty solid especially the guy who plays Leslie Vernon like I said earlier. So the ''mockumentary'' part is pretty funny but the ending is terrible. Watchable but not amazing.".

In the final third of the film the camera settles downalas the lighting is so poor that you cannot really see anything clearlydoubtless because the director does not want you to know that you are seeing nothing.

The film begins as a supremely witty comedy as the student filmmakers follow Vernon through his training regimen en route to honing his craft as a serial killer but turns progressively dark as the film enters its second and third act.Peppered with absolutely brilliant dialog Glosserman manages to deliver a movie that belies its limited budget by deploying a keen eye for cinematography acting talent and crackerjack scriptwriting. I started this movie laughing heartily and concluded it squirming in my seat as the joke was off and things got serious.In an interview given after the screening Glosserman who is currently in negotiations to find a global distributor cautioned that due to potential copyright and classification hassles with the MPAA the film might end up being released under a different or modified title.

	schema:reviewBody "Hoping for an exclusive look at serial killers a film crew follows a fanatical killer as he prepares to slaughter a group of smalltown teens before getting caught up in their ethics and try to stop his rampage.This was an utterly enjoyable slasher effort. One of the more impressive aspects of this one is the fact that there's plenty of utterly clever sendups of what's at stake in a slasher film that aren't all that obvious which gets spelled out here. From the pointing out the clique that gets targeted to all the preattack tormenting that takes place around the town training and working out for the chase as well as the behindthescenes planning for the whole event at the location and how to plan out a typical slasherfilm style battle is all unique and quite original in concept and execution. Both of those areas are explored fully in here as the attempt to explain the thinking behind what is obviously a heatofthemoment type of situation that doesn't really inspire a lot of thinking when it really comes down to it makes for a rather engaging series of events throughout here as he goes about his plans. The actual execution of the plan both in the early attack scene at the library as well as the ambushes at the diner make for some rather great stuff while the big moment here is the actual final stalking of the group in the house as the crew attempts to help them deconstruct the evening before it happens as they try to stop him from going after the group and killing them which is all done in fine fashion with a lot to like here throughout this with a lot of explosive stalking fantastic action and plenty of wonderful deconstructions of the slasher film norms that allows for a frenetic sequence that's tense chilling and quite fun. While some of the stuff doesn't work here namely the fact that this is supposed to be funny when it clearly isn't as the comedy instead comes from the absurdity of the situation rather than anything really done in the film itself so it can get rather annoying thinking this is funny when it really isn't and as well the fact that the majority of the gore comes offscreen does get old a little fast. Otherwise this was a rather impressive and enjoyable outing.Rated R Language Violence Brief Nudity a mild sex scene and drug use.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hoping for an exclusive look at serial killers a film crew follows a fanatical killer as he prepares to slaughter a group of smalltown teens before getting caught up in their ethics and try to stop his rampage.This was an utterly enjoyable slasher effort. One of the more impressive aspects of this one is the fact that there's plenty of utterly clever sendups of what's at stake in a slasher film that aren't all that obvious which gets spelled out here. From the pointing out the clique that gets targeted to all the preattack tormenting that takes place around the town training and working out for the chase as well as the behindthescenes planning for the whole event at the location and how to plan out a typical slasherfilm style battle is all unique and quite original in concept and execution. Both of those areas are explored fully in here as the attempt to explain the thinking behind what is obviously a heatofthemoment type of situation that doesn't really inspire a lot of thinking when it really comes down to it makes for a rather engaging series of events throughout here as he goes about his plans. The actual execution of the plan both in the early attack scene at the library as well as the ambushes at the diner make for some rather great stuff while the big moment here is the actual final stalking of the group in the house as the crew attempts to help them deconstruct the evening before it happens as they try to stop him from going after the group and killing them which is all done in fine fashion with a lot to like here throughout this with a lot of explosive stalking fantastic action and plenty of wonderful deconstructions of the slasher film norms that allows for a frenetic sequence that's tense chilling and quite fun. While some of the stuff doesn't work here namely the fact that this is supposed to be funny when it clearly isn't as the comedy instead comes from the absurdity of the situation rather than anything really done in the film itself so it can get rather annoying thinking this is funny when it really isn't and as well the fact that the majority of the gore comes offscreen does get old a little fast. Otherwise this was a rather impressive and enjoyable outing.Rated R Language Violence Brief Nudity a mild sex scene and drug use.";

Its like the director thought that the failed attempts at making a joke out of horror clichs was going to make up for the lack of kills I think the first kill doesn't take place until like 45 minutes into the movie and gore. Pitiful.I watched this movie with high expectations as it seemed to have garnered a few decent reviews but damn was I disappointed. For a film that is trying to say its giving you a killer in the vein of the great slashers IE JASON FREDDY MICHAEL MYERS its misses its mark completely. I ended up turning it off when the predictable ending kicked into place and I was like gimme a break. I would best compare this to The Village in that I was mislead into believing I was going to see a horror film and was fooled into watching some ineffective boring crap that couldn't lift a scare laugh or emotion other than thinking This Sucks!!! People got to stop giving Anchor Bay props for releasing movies like this and advertising them as horror films when they're not scary horrific or funny.".

NOT a good idea if they were planning to make this movie successful. All 3 characters had intricate back stories.. they shouldn't ruin that.Secondly i didn't think the use of a handheld camera was a particularly good idea. Even though the characters were filming a documentary i think they should have used it for the whole film it would have given a better perspective on things. Other movies have made better use of this for instance Diary of the Dead and Cloverfield which i recommend. Anyway why would these people volunteer for filming this in the first place they must be screwed up. What were they doing in the first place anyhow? Giving a step by step killing guide. Okay it may look fun..you think it'll hold up in court?I did like the twist near the end when they discover who the real virgin survivor girl is all along. You could blatantly see it was coming but made the movie that little bit more entertaining. Overall An Awful movie with the bad acting adding to the disappointments. Worse than Friday 13th Part 7! Yes that bad.".

I kid you not it was the best movie I've seen in months.The basic premise of the movie is as follows Freddy Jason Chucky Micheal...they are all real and their killing sprees were real. The lead character Leslie invited a camera crew to document his first killing spree. They followed him around before the first killing getting background on the victims Leslie himself and the precise manner that each victim would be killed. In the process we meet a retired serial killer from the 1960's named Eugene and his very supportive wife. They discuss the differences in old timey serial killers versus the newer breed that came out after Micheal Myers and Jason.Now I can't really give anything else away about the movie plot wise without spoilers so I won't. But here are some general observations.1. I laughed with not at this movie more than any comedy in recent memory.2. It was very well done on a small budget. It was the directors Scott Glosserman first job...and he wrote it as well. Cheers! 3. Robert Englund is in it.4. Don't think it's going to be a Scream ripoff. It sets it's sights way higher. However it may get inspiration from Man Bites Dog but I don't know I haven't seen that flick.5. It was filmed in late 2004 and didn't get a theatrical release till late 2006.I'll be re watching this one soon  I missed the Hellraiser puzzle box...I was told it was in the flick in the background... and I hope you go out and watch it as well. I'll be buying this one on DVD.9.510.editupdate...I have now seen Man Bites Dog and I can say that beyond the superficial comparisons serial killer and movie villain  monster serial killer the two movies are very different. There is no more similarity between these two movies then between Schindlers List and Life is Beautiful. I also found Behind the Mask more enjoyable.".

She is taken to a strange underground club where the clients wear elaborate masks and costumes and forced to perform various sex acts on stage. As a porn film Behind the Green Door is likely to be a bit too strange for some and as a film  there's far too little going on in the plot departments and despite the setting it soon degenerates into a simple collection of porn sequences. It is very well filmed however and while we're seeing things like blow jobs and lesbian sex that we've all seen in many other films the Mitchell Brothers somehow manage to make it seem different to what we've seen before due to the execution. I can't say that the film works as a complete whole  I didn't find it very erotic and there's really not a great deal going on outside of the many sex scenes. Still this is undoubtedly an interesting film and followers of XXX stuff will likely want to track it down.".

The plot deals with Gloria being kidnapped from the hotel she's staying at and taken to a seedy sex club where she is relished and is then forced to perform sex acts where she is loved as never before. This is by far the most artistic porn film I've ever seen with an almost tenminute slow motion cum shot that uses different angles and backgrounds to make a quite trippy viewing experience. Pro football player Ben Davidson has an amusing nonsex cameo as an intimidating bouncer. Best musical score cinematography writing and acting ever seen in a porn film.".

	schema:headline " Inducted behind the green door a male fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "Behind the Green Door has a deceptively simple central story which nevertheless is layered with a great deal of really rather sophisticated exploration of sexual desire and the potentials of pornographic spectatorship.The film begins in a truckstop diner as two drivers come in and are pressed by the chef to tell him the story of the green door. The men are a little coy at first but free coffee loosens their tongues. One of them begins to tell the story which we see... A single woman is kidnapped from her hotel and taken to a secret location where she becomes the centrepiece of a bizarre sexual show. Before the kidnapping she is shown sitting isolated at an outdoors restaurant keeping herself to herself and wrapped up against the cold as a boor at another table drones on to another fellow about what he got up to at the weekend. The film then posits that beneath her solitary exterior lurks a desire to be opened up to sensual pleasure and exhibitionism. She is kidnapped by significantly characters played by the film's directors the Mitchell Brothers and taken to the show venue. She is met by a woman who tells her that she will not be hurt and that she will experience delights. She is stripped massaged and dressed and then taken onto the stage.The stage is set before a small audience of mostly masked onlookers who have been told the rules of the club and seem to be all in on the secret society  they have to negotiate their way past burly doormen and agree to keep their counsel during the performance. After a slightly grotesque Marcel Marceautype clownerie the kidnapped woman is led on the stage and sexually explored by a gaggle of ladies. After she has been woken to feeling by touching and cunnilingus the green door at the back opens and a black man with a large and already engorged penis enters to the sound of funk. He then licks and fks the kidnapped woman driving into her until they reach mutual orgasm.This inspires the audience to begin masturbating touching each other and finally indulging in an orgy. The kidnapped woman fellates three acrobats who descend on ropes and the cast and watchers come together for a Dionysian romp. This ends with a series of slowmotion money shots involving distorted special effects. After she has been covered in cum the kidnapped woman is suddenly rescued by a member of the audience and taken back through the green door. Then we're back in the diner with the chef desperate to know more. The drivers have nothing more to tell him and one of them drives into the night. As he drives he sees the lights of the city shining and a vision of himself making uninhibited love to the kidnapped woman.The central story of the kidnapping and show is specifically structured as the fantasy of the drivers at the diner. All of the more controversial aspects of the show  the strangely acquiescent victim the secret society of privileged voyeurs the black man as representative of sexual prowess and primal sexual urges  are suggested by the film as fantasies of these working class white men tales they tell to enliven their rather barren powerless and sexually frustrated lives they have no real women in their lives within the film.There's also an intriguing strand of the film which posits that watching a pornographic performance will inspire an audience to indulge in its own licentious sexual activities. The audience of the show are soon touching and screwing each other and its telling that their bodies are mostly not as attractive as the performers in the show and the driver is lost in his own selfgenerated pornographic fantasies at the end.The film is a remarkable and wonderfully selfconscious dream of male desire a desire which wants women to agree to their own induction into a realm of uninhibited pleasure. It isn't suggested in the film that such a realm can exist in reality but the audience participation suggests that the filmmakers hoped that their spectators might be inspired to sexual activities of their own. The most intense section of the film is the entrance and sexual performance of Johnny Keyes the black ravisher  he is an astonishing presence and the moment before he enters Marilyn Chambers a woman with considerable star quality suggests a collusion between the two characters which could also be a collusion between the two performers  it is genuinely erotic and laden with the temptation to see these two people as genuinely wishing to transgress social and ethnic sexual barriers.The film fully deserves its reputation as a classic of the golden age of porn a genuinely seminal work. The title refers to the popular song a 1950s hit for Jim Lowe and itself possibly inspired by a story by O. Henry also called The Green Door.".

Behind The Green Door is the least erotic of the 3 but maybe the most important film artistic wise. Marilyn Chambers performance has no dialogue  but it was her wholesome pure girl next door good looks that made this the centerpiece..not plain jane looking like Georgina Spelvin and Linda Lovelace  and not as whorish and sleazy looking as the various other performers in the early years..Chambers represented the pretty girl who's looks werent so beautiful she was threatening or plastic. However the film itself suffers from it's heavy emphasis on artsy film making techniques ..such as the final money shot scenes running in multicolors and freeze frames and slow motion...kinda ruins the feel. Also the scene between Johnny Keyes and Chambers missed any penetration angles giving the scene a simulated sex feel. Plotwise Chambers is kidnapped and forced to perform sexual acts on stage in front of an audience of vouyers  the trapeze oral sex scene and the group orgy are it's standouts. View this in the mind that it's a look at the adult industry in it's classic years before it all went down the toilet because of it's low video standards910".

It takes its sweet time with the sex scenes and constructs a veritable cinematic inferno of lust and licentiousness. Although the initial tone is dark it becomes lighter as Chambers' enjoyment of her predicament increases the countryandwestern music helps too. There is no narrative but Ms. Chambers does take a fascinating journey from fear to enlightenment and conveys these changes nonverbally. Her performance is strong and even led to a starring role a few years later in David Cronenberg's Rabid where she acquitted herself very well. Not surprisingly Chambers is the most attractive female in the cast by far. It is her movie as it should be.".

The plot line doesn't sound that complex and it isn't either but this movie has one great and interesting character played terrific by Marilyn Chambers. The story is also very artistically stylish and most erotic. Behind the Green Door isn't just a porn movie is actually much closer to an artmovie. Is like if Kubrick ever made porn than I guess it would look something like Behind the Green Door. Behind the Green Door is really a masterpiece in its genre and one of the most important movies in the history of America. 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Behind the Green Door 1972  12 out of 4One of the classics from the era known as the Golden Age of Porn. The film has a couple truck drivers stopping at a diner where the owner asks them to tell him the story about the green door. When then flashback to a rich socialite Marilyn Chambers who is kidnapped and taken to a strange location where she's forced to perform wild sexual acts. This golden age as it was called seemed to feature people wanting to make mainstream movies not unlike what you'd normally see at a theater yet we'd also have hardcore sex in them. The strange thing about this movie is that it features poor camera work poor acting silly editing and an all around bizarre feel yet that's what makes it rather special. The movie wasn't glossy or pretty to look at and instead of it trying to come off like something you'd see in a mainstream theater it seemed more at home being like various other grindhouse movies that featured nothing but weird images and in the case of this film the hardcore sex. I can't say I found anything here erotic or overly sexy but at the same time the film kept my attention just because of how strange it was. We have very little dialogue and instead we're pretty much just treated to the sexual images going on but even they are done in strange ways. Most of them don't feature any music and are as silent as silent can get. Ever so often we'll get a few moans or groans but for the most part they're silent until much later in the movie. The cheap looking stage and pathetic lighting are just perfect for the film because they fit the atmosphere that the Mitchell brothers have going on. It seems out of all the mainstream porn stars Chambers has come out the best which might be because she's the most naturally beautiful of all of them. She's certainly got that girl next door image and she's certainly easy on the eyes. As someone who came to know her for her nonhardcore roles it was a little strange seeing her here but that quickly went away. No one else in the supporting cast really stood out with most of them just delivering cheap dialogue and bad performances. That's not a major fault as I'm sure most are going to be checking this out for Chambers. I'm not sure if the final scene was just added on because the movie would be too short without it but it sort of sticks out more like a deleted scene than anything else that came before it. Is this a good movie that would rival something in mainstream theaters? No. Is this an important film? Yes. Is it a good adult movie? Why not?".

Well BTGD doesn't compare very favourably. Whereas Manos is a fairly ambitious but ultimately botched feature film BTGD is a 15 minute stag movie spoof of Histoire d'O set in the American boondocks instead of saucy France which has been stretched by the factor 5 to bring it to feature length. Dash that it's a gonzo shoot which has been racked beyond the point of tediousness with some psychedelia Histoire d'O and a pantomime thrown in. The movie consists almost entirely of one long orgy scene in a swinger club with former washing powder model Marilyn Chambers who doesn't have a single line except Eek! and Ugh! and a handful of talent thrown in. Marilyn gets thoroughly eaten 15 minutes she gives head another 15 minutes then there is a general orgy mle with not particularly attractive people 15 minutes and eventually another stapledon car sex scene 15 minutes. The remaining 15 minutes are filled by the flimsy background story in which two lowlifes tell their mate about this classy swinger club where the special attraction was a freshly abducted girl Chambers who had apparently warmed up to the whole idea of ravishment surprisingly quickly.Overall it's simply not a good film although it holds a certain historic interest and well it's a hardcore porn movie. Chambers is its absolute highlight because of her natural good looks and not least because she is one of the few porn actresses who actually made good money whilst not being loth to a good hard shag. So at least you don't have to feel guilty for getting off on someone getting traumatized for life.By contrast the other three goldenageofporn stalwarts are good movies Debbie Does Dallas is a well made and very enjoyable porn movie The Devil In Miss Jones can pass as an exploration into the darker niches of playing hide the kreplach and Deep Throat at least popularized a previously obscure technique. Behind The Green Door however is two strip club owners venturing far out of their depth with a camera.".

Having finally gotten a chance to see it I ultimately found it disappointing.Simply put I did not find the film erotic. As an adult film its ultimate goal is to create arousal and this is the first criterion on which it should be judged. The action takes place largely in silence with the participants in its central orgy forbidden from speaking. Chambers has no actual dialogue other than sighing and moaning. This prevents the viewer from engaging with the characters.The film does deserve kudos for trying to establish a narrative however limited. It is also noteworthy as a time capsule of a period when pornography was on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. It features cameo appearances by football star Ben Davidson and by local San Francisco celebrity Toad Attel. Imagine a major celebrity like Davidson appearing in an adult film today! It gives a glimpse of an era of sexual freedom that was sadly lost with the AIDS crisis and the incursions of the religious right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Artie and Jim Mitchell's Behind the Green Door like most early films of the porno chic movement has some interesting attributes. For one it's believed to house the first interracial sex scene between a black male and a white female in American pornography in addition to taking a known commercial model Marilyn Chambers who initially worked as the recognizable lady in the Ivory Soap commercials and on the product's packaging and having her headline in a pornographic film. Finally the story for this film came from an idea that was passed around through various carbon copies. On these bases alone Behind the Green Door has a heavy nostalgia factor and just the name likely inspires subtle smirks from males of the baby boomer generation who fondly remember sneaking out late at night to a seedy adult theater on Harlem Avenue to witness the kind of lowgrade smut in motion that their magazines just couldn't cover.Unlike its companions such as Debbie Does Dallas and Deep Throat Behind the Green Door really can't hold up in the modern age. Its entire premise is a drudgery of unerotic imagery and longwinded events that don't involve any kind of characters. Something that made this time period in porn so special was the fact that screenwriters decided to include characters and story lines when they really didn't need to. They could've stuck to just showing a montage of sex scenes with little to no connective tissue but were brave enough to try and give life to a genre that needed to be taken seriously.Unfortunately Behind the Green Door cops out at simply settling for a lengthy sex scene rather than anything along the lines of wit. We focus on Marilyn Chambers' Gloria who is abducted by two men and forced into a live stage show where she'll be forced to allow her body to go into a state of complete tranquility in order to perform a barrage of sexual favors before a horny audience. This includes cunnilingus interracial sex and an orgy all for the pleasure of a  mostly masturbating  wide audience.Chambers embodies the idea of a sex object here for she has not a single line of dialog unless you consider the frequent moans of ecstasy a line worthy to pen on a screenplay. The Mitchell brothers settle for a mediocre array of camera angles that fail to capture any arousing shots as well as making one long sex scene that loses power and gusto after about fifteen minutes.What infrequent charm there is in Behind the Green Door comes from the absurdity of all the situations in this film. Before Gloria is brought on stage several miming clowns perform their act before the eager audience in a way that can only be described as fascinatingly disturbing especially in a pornographic film. On top of that there is a very kinky fellatio by Chambers towards the end of the film and a series of slowmotion moneyshots that on their own could serve as one of the most artful shots in any pornographic film I've ever seen.With that Behind the Green Door doesn't lack any conceivable charm but given the fact that Chambers nor the male performers like Johnnie Keyes don't have any characters or any creative dialog to work off of makes this film a depressingly narrow exercise of redundant depravity without the vaguest element of wit. There's occasional art sure but it's like getting on a heavily hyped rollercoaster just to get a middling ride and comment on how you could see the next town over from the coaster's averagesized peak.Starring Marilyn Chambers and Johnnie Keyes. Directed by Artie and Jim Mitchell.".

I know the classics from back then but she appeared in Behind The Green Door which created controversy and also became a cult classic. The controversy laid in the fact that Marilyn had a pretty face and was used in commercials like Ivory Snow. A very popular washing product in the days made by Procter and Gamble. Her face vanished shortly from all commercials once this flick became successful. It isn't a common porn because Marilyn doesn't say a word in it doesn't really has a story. In the heydays of porn those flicks really had a story to tell but here it's rather simple two guys telling at a diner what happened behind a certain green door. From there on the movie slowly turns into a gangbang. Normal for the days back then but in editing they made the ejaculation clocking in at 7 minutes mixed with psychedelic effects. And it is that part that made it a cult classic. Shot for only 60k it made 25 million dollar profit. When it came out it was shown in normal theatres another thing that gave it some controversy. But it was also the moment that porn started to conquer the world and became the next big thingGore 05 Nudity 55 Effects 25 Story 15 Comedy 05".

Whitman on the other hand believes the contaminated man to be an innocent victim. Either way the contaminated man must be found because after he touches people they live only a few minutes.";

One other person is immune because he went through tests with the same chemical a pesticide that has become very dangerous possibly because there were plans to use it as a chemical weapon in war.Whoever made this movie had trouble making up their mind what type it would be.  There were some quite exciting chase scenes especially in the second half but sometimes it was quite slow.  At one point it seemed like the solution would be too easy but the movie had thirty minutes to go so a new twist was added to make it more interesting. Sometimes the movie could be chilling with otherworldly music as danger was suggested.  Once the video looked normal but the audio resembled a 78 RPM record played at 33quite effective. And sometimes it was more of a romantic comedy.Overall the result was pretty goodfor a TVmovie anyway.  Not too much violencethough one person got shot and the blood just spurted out.

	schema:reviewBody "Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated Man when it premiered on TV back in December of 2000.An infectious disease expert William Hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them.  Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace.  I'm not sure where exactly all I know is it takes place somewhere in that area.  Anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers.  One of them a disgruntled security guard named  Joseph Muller played Peter Weller best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back.  He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support.  So he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things.  It's soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen.  In fact it's so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds.  Soon word gets out and the disease expert Hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire Russian population.Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down.  We have a disturbed person Weller here Michael Douglas in Falling Down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process.  Next we have a herotype person Hurt here Robert Duvall in Falling Down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist.Contaminated Man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances.810".

	onyx:emotionText "Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated Man when it premiered on TV back in December of 2000.An infectious disease expert William Hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them.  Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace.  I'm not sure where exactly all I know is it takes place somewhere in that area.  Anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers.  One of them a disgruntled security guard named  Joseph Muller played Peter Weller best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back.  He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support.  So he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things.  It's soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen.  In fact it's so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds.  Soon word gets out and the disease expert Hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire Russian population.Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down.  We have a disturbed person Weller here Michael Douglas in Falling Down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process.  Next we have a herotype person Hurt here Robert Duvall in Falling Down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist.Contaminated Man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances.810";

There is the government conspiracy angle the crusader protagonist who has personal experience...And one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos.  Although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied he is not.  Without the pity the movie is pointless.  The other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous.

I started watching mostly because William Hurt is a quality actor it's unfathomable to me why he would accept such a badlywritten part in such a ludicrously told story and also because I have a weakness for killer virus stories  even though this genre of film is rarely worth the effort. Even a relatively ambitious project like Mick Garris's TV adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand was disappointing in the extreme.Anyway I soldiered on and increasingly began feeling as if a creeping virus were taking over my own body. One that made me at first restless and then sleepy. After the film's prologue in golden California we are transported to the cold grey winter of Budapest presumably because production costs are cheaper there. A lab worker Peter Weller virtually unrecognisable from his Robocop days accidentally becomes infected with the virus but like Hurt's character is able to live for a week or so as a carrier while those he touches die within a minute of contact. Hurt shows up looking a little geeky it has to be said with long hair and no hairpiece to at first lock horns with Natasha McElhone before they join forces to track down Weller who bizarrely goes on the run with a large model airplane with whom.Hurt shares an increasing affinity.Things get progressively sillier as the film blunders towards its daft climax and we are left to presumably cheer two 'heroes' who gleefully infect a hardnosed government agent with the very virus they had been attempting to stop Weller from spreading. Weller and McElhone belong to that breed of secondstring actors who live off the pickings those higher up the pecking order instantly dismiss but William Hurt is clearly slumming here and presumably only in it for the money  a fact which is almost as disappointing as this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been said about the outsourcing of call centers to India but so far I haven't seen one portrayed in a film in this manner where Ifelt the portrayal of its inner workings was one of the better moments in his romanticcomedy. As far as I can recall those who make cold calls to me for surveys credit sign up and the likes seem to sound local or have that distinct regional accent that wasn't disguised but if things happen per the movie I won't be surprised that I was duped to believe they're calling from somewhere locally rather than from abroad.So welcome to the world of telemarketershelpdesks agentssalespersons where inhouse training centres established take their employees through continuous training in order to ensure their accent are masked their popculture knowledge brought up to speed and they're wellversed in local colloquial terms so that they seem to be your friend from next door when they talk to you rather than a feeling of resentment knowing that their neighbours job has gone offshore. It's no easy training and naturally one that calls for great measure of patience for facing phones being slammed down or worse to stand up to verbal abuse in many forms.The Other End of the Line is your standard romantic comedy which in my opinion got lifted from mediocrity thanks to this aspect of the story that I had a peek into. However like most eastwest fusion films made by Hollywood on Indian culture or aspects of India it does get romanticized a great deal and shots of Mumbai looked far too much like it's being lifted from a tourism board promotional video or some tourist's excitable travel video of an exotic locale that he came back from. Think along the lines of Mistress of Spice and Bride and Prejudice and you have an idea how this story by Tracey Jackson had been approached by director James Dodson.Priya Sethi Shriya works in a call centre in Mumbai belonging to CitiOne Bank no prizes here and her daily night shift to be on the same timezone as the USA gets frowned upon by her conservative family Anupam Kher from Victory as Dad and Sushmita Mukherjee from Dostana as Mum even though she's earning good money to become the chief breadwinner versus than her insurance salesman dad. She adopts her Jessica David profile for calls she makes to CitiOne's customers putting on a perfect American accent as she speaks to strangers every night only to call on a handsome young man she knows because she Googles Granger Woodruff Jesse Metcalfe of John Tucker and Desperate Housewives fame who had his identity stolen and a whole host of credit card transactions erroneously billed to him.The both of them strike up a friendship as they speak frequently to clear up and verify his credit card transactions and with one thing leading to an impulsive another they set up a date even though she knowingly lives on the other side of the world in India while fibbing that she's actually in San Francisco a city which Granger would be going to for a make or break advertising deal with a hotel chain.As with any romantic movie the chemistry between the couple is important for it to be believable that they're falling for each other and in this aspect both Jesse Metcalfe and Shriya excelled in looking good on screen as they share plenty of romantic moments the plot had thrown at them. You'd find yourself inevitably rooting for them as they overcome expected challenges knowing that these issues will probably not be show stoppers since they conflict with the type of characters they are strongwilled and stubborn as a mule toward tradition that the modern generation do not buy into or just don't buy into spending time with someone they don't believe in.Possessing some amazing powers and ability to hear from a distance The Other End of the Line is a longdistance infatuation that took on a life of its own where characters step out of their comfort zones to pursue what their heart tells them. Since it's just a few days after Valentine's this movie got made and released now for a reason to have you partake in some loveydovey movie with comedy courtesy of a traditional family thrown in for good measure. Need a movie for a romantic night out? Then The Other End of the Line will satisfy that objective. Nothing fancy but it works.".

Its a simple romantic comedy with a dream romance between an Indian girl and an American guy and it scored pretty well there. Some of the moments with Anupam Kher were really very very hilarious. Though I would say that at some points the movie lifted up from reality and went into the ideal state. But then again romantic movies are usually like that only.I liked the movie to give it a decent 710. I'd suggest that you go and watch the movie it'll be a real fun to watch!!!".

Some may call it simple because it won't have you on the edge of your seat with drama but it is nice movie that shows that simple love is better than all the wild life that is out there. Someone else commented that her family is a little over done but if you watch Bolywood movies you know that the humor is funny in its own way even when exaggerated. Plot line is nice and I like the ending and the fact that she never bows to sleeping with him before marriage. After all his past ways and choices have not produced real happiness and her class far excels anything he had before and he realizes this. There is enough slut junk out there to watch it was nice to have a quality story line. I did not think the bachelor party part or the comments on strippers by Granger gave him much class but he later redeems himself by chasing after the good that is in Priya and realizing that all his former girlfriend has to offer self gratification is not as valuable as someone you love Priya. A good movie that I enjoyed.".

Plot line is nice and I like the ending and the fact that she never bows to sleeping with him before marriage. After all his past ways and choices have not produced real happiness and her class far excels anything he had before and he realizes this. There is enough slut junk out there to watch it was nice to have a quality story line. I did not think the bachelor party part or the comments on strippers by Granger gave him much class but he later redeems himself by chasing after the good that is in Priya and realizing that all his former girlfriend has to offer self gratification is not as valuable as someone you love Priya. A good movie that I enjoyed.";

If that is the case there would be a lot of Indians coming to the USA now. Second can Granger actually ask to meet a girl without even seeing her pictures first? After all he can just ask her to send him a picture via the email. Third the speech Granger gave at his friend's wedding just doesn't sound real. And he stopped talking and had to rush to the airport right away that is not what a normal person will do. Fourth the whole call center people stopped working while they talk and the whole group clapped their hands when they kissed. That is just unreal.I have seen a few Indian and US movies it seems that those movies are always about marriage. Indian daughters want to find some nice husbands who live in the USA to marry to. Anyway I enjoyed watching this movie despite a few blemishes.".

They make a sultry and suggestive presentation to Kit Hawksin of Hawksin Hotels a very demanding businessman. Hawksin is very disappointed that the ad executives do not get his conservative views but he agrees to give them another chance.While in bed with his intimidating girlfriend Emory Granger receives a call from CitiOne Bank saying his identity has been stolen. It is the first of many contacts Granger will have with Jennifer David who claims to be from San Francisco. Actually she is Priya Sethi of Mumbai India.Priya is engaged to Vikram but doesn't love him. As is often the case in India it is an arranged marriage and her conservative parents don't care what Priya wants. They are even bothered that she works the night shift because that is daytime in the United States where CitiOne wants its customers to think the callers are from and seem to want her to leave that job. But Priya is very good at her job and enjoys it she mimics an American accent perfectly. And we see the training the employees get it's quite detailed and we see how her employer expects everyone to convince people they are American.Charlie meanwhile is also about to get married and Granger will be his best man. This provides even more distractions.As part of his effort to win over Hawksin Granger and Charlie have to go to San Francisco. This gives Priya a chance to meet Granger and she reluctantly agrees to do soin order to talk about business. She has relatives in the area and her family believes she is visiting them. Never mind how she gets so much time off work. But when Granger arrives at the meeting place he sees several girls who could be Jennifer. Realizing she has seen granger and knowing she will never live up to his expectations she gives up on trying to meet him. But then Granger bumps into herliterally. Granger and Priya immediately make a connection and to make sure their relationship will work Priya keeps quiet about her real identity claiming to be a nurse from India on vacation.It just so happens Priya is staying at Hawksin Hotel and Hawksin meets both Granger and Priya. He asks Priya for an evaluation of his hotel and she does a wonderful job worthy of one of his commercials. For that he rewards her with one of the finest rooms.Meanwhile Priya's parents wonder what has happened to her and they angrily take off for San Francisco to retrieve their wayward daughter.Over the course of the movie Granger and Priya run into numerous obstacles. Will they overcome them?Well I can say this much. The ending is nothing short of amazing.Shriya Saran is beautiful adorable easy to like and quite talented. She does a very convincing American accent and comes across as very intelligent though she's just cute enough not to be threatening. Unlike Sara Foster who is merely pretty but we don't want to like her and we're not supposed to want her and Granger to make it.Jesse Metcalfe also does quite a good job. Especially in one scene toward the end but I don't want to give away too much. I'll just say he talks about the time he and Charlie went to summer camp. The clash between cultures provides some opportunities for comedy and both leads make this work.Austin Basis is appealing coming across as an friendly but somewhat incompetent. I especially liked how Hawksin intimidated him and pointed to his proper and quiet Japanese associate of thirtyplus years. Larry Miller as Hawskin also does a very good job as a demanding businessman. The conservative Indian relatives make this movie different. The father Rajeev is determined to keep his family in the past but realizes he is fighting a losing battle. He is appealing in a bumbling way.There is one hilarious scene at the San Francisco hotel involving words that can have more than one meaning. The movie does get slightly naughty from time to time and it would be hard to describe it as a family film but the version I saw likely had some offensive material cut out for broadcast TV and was relatively clean.It's mostly formula but it's a winning formula.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Other End of the Line is a decent film but it frustrated me to no end. It seemed that there was an awful lot of good but also a lot of clichs and a plot that seemed to need some editing. However on balance it's still worth seeing this multinational production.When the film begins you are introduced to and American named Grangeran incredibly shallow and difficult to like guy. One day he receives a phone call from his credit card company as his credit card has been compromised. Because him number has been stolen he ends up spending a lot of time on the phone with the credit card rep Priya. However like many companies they outsource this work to India and Priya has learned well to sound just like an Americanand she tells Granger she lives in San Francisco not Mumbai.Over time the pair talk more and more and Granger becomes interested in actually meeting her face to face. After all his job is taking him to San Francisco. So she hops a plane to San Francisco to meet him. However she makes a lot of insane choices. First she does NOT meet him in their prearranged location. Second they end up meeting by chance and they begin to dateand she does NOT tell him that she's the lady on the phone. Third she never tells him she's engagedand this ends up causing LOTS of problems when her very protective parents drop everything and chase Priya to America. Through some silly misunderstandings they think Granger has kidnapped her! What's next? See the film.So here are the problems with the film. First when the film begins Granger is a shallow selfish jerk and is sleeping with another shallow selfish jerk. This makes it VERY hard to care about him. Second while you initially really like Priya she lies again and again for practically no reason at all and ends up behaving rather selfishly herself. You know that by convention they SHOULD eventually have their happy ending together but the writers just didn't provide the proper context for this. But on the plus side if you can ignore the clichs and predictability of the film the supporting characters are WONDERFUL and the film has a nice sense of humor. In particular Priya's father Anupam Kherwho is ALWAYS wonderful and Granger's boss Larry MillerI loved his bluntness combined with his sweetness made the film very enjoyable. Overall I say this is a very flawed but enjoyable film. Had they simply polished a few of the sharp edges it could have been great. As is it's a decent enough date movie if you are not especially demanding. Odd though how the weakest aspect of the film are the two main characters.".

Her big advantage is that she can sound American and people don't know she is in India. Why does that bug me? Because it reminds me of the thousands of jobs that have been outsourced to other countries for cheap labor at a time when our country is in the biggest recession since the 30s. It was hard for me to be sympathetic to the characters when in the back of my mind I kept thinking of the outsourcing problem.I did like the actors.".

Nothing special and it has its flaws but it has its moments too.The story idea is cute enough  an ad agency man falls in like with a credit card call desk operator who sounds like an American woman but is actually halfway around the world in India. The Indian call desk operator falls in love with the ad agency man. All this happens over the phone. So the Indian woman flies to San Francisco to meet Mr. Sexy Voice. Then there are the typical miscommunications and misunderstandings until...you guessed it...they live happily ever after.So what are the problems? The main problem is the woman's father Anupam Kher a popular Indian actor. I don't like this portrayal at all. It really detracts from the film. It's not that the overall idea is bad but it's not handled well at all...at least for American audiences. The other problem is that the young man's profession...well why not take it a little seriously to lend some credence to the plot instead it's handled at an almost juvenile level. And then there's the casting of Larry Miller as the hotel executive Larry Miller has his place...this was not it.On the other hand it's nice that there was onlocation shooting it lent credence to the story line. Personally I liked the chemistry between Jesse Metcalfe and Indian actress Shriya Saran. I think Metcalfe is significantly underrated. Let's face it you don't get much more handsome than that but in a number of films and television shows I think he's at least a reasonably good actor admittedly not one of the great actors...but few are and this type of role is perfect for him. I was not familiar with Saran but she is very pleasing in her role here.Bottom line this was a decent little love story. Perhaps with a better director it would have been a better film. I still give it a 7.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a movie to watch on TV  unless you recorded it. There are so many scenes you need to cut through  and a few to go back to it is not funny. It's about two different people Priya from India and Granger from the United States who first meet when when he calls a call center after his credit card was used illegally. She flies to San Francisco to meet him and lies about who she is. Spoilers ahead It is the usual boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back. What is interesting is the lesson in the movie about taking Chances. Granger never takes a chance in life He tells a story how his best friend  and business partner Charie are at summer camp and only Charlie has the guts to go across the river to the girls side and meets a 14 year old girl who he says he will marry. Then a decade later on a date sees her and drops the date for that same girl and marries her. Granger is more popular then Charlie but never gets what he really wants in life. There is a scene where Charlie tells Granger  Do you know your problem is? You never put yourself out there never take a chance and do not let people know who you really are. at the end of the movie he finally takes a chance and flies 18 hours to India for Priya on the slim chance she did not get married  she was engaged when they met. It turns out she did not get married because she fell in love with Granger and would not make her fianc happy. She risked turning her family against her. Especially her father who was a strict Hindi businessman. But her father loves Priya and when the fiance's father called her a tramp he stood up for Priya especially noting Above all this is my daughter and I love her. At the end Granger and Priya end up together. Her father is especially impressed when he said  I will give your daughter all the love and respect that she deserves. He gives his approval when he offers some tortilla looking bread and has him sit down with the family. Meaning Granger has been accepted into the family. 510 Stars mostly to look at Priya  she is hot and adorable at the same time and for the ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1953 composer Theo Mackeben died he was a very good composer of songs light film music serious music etc. he was very important for the German cinema in the 30's and 40's.Hardly surprising then that a film about or around him would be made. However this film is centered around the music of Mackeben but  as the credits state  not the life of Mackeben is portrayed. In stead the bio has been replaced by a story about an invented composer who composes the music of Mackeben the script is that bad that words fail to describe it let us hope that Mackeben had a more interesting life and certainly wife. The cast tries hard to make something out of it but to no avail. Ingrid Stenn as the composer's wife has nothing else to do than to look worried. When the wife separated in the meantime from her husband does not want to reveal a difficult situation she is in and in the same conversation says that lately she has had no appetite for coffee ! the viewer is of course aware of the situation  her conversation partner is not. Who ever wrote this scene must have had a bad case of caffeine poisoning.If you are willing to forget the story and Hans Wolff's soso direction as well though he directs much better than in his first films you still could have a wonderful time with Mackeben's music and the good performances of it. You also may want to indulge in game of association like I did during watching Margot Hielscher superbly sings the title song and also the song Frauen sind keine Engel incorporated in a nice revue number this song she already sung in 1943 in the film with the same title and that was directed by Willi Forst and I repeat what I wrote about Hielscher then she might have been an angel herself that voice!. And look who has a guest appearance as film director Willi Forst for whom Hans Wolff formerly worked as editor and assistantdirector. Forst refers to his own classic Bel Ami of 1939 and in his subtle and charming style sings the title song. You may want to find the association Forst and the bare breasts yourself.His first films Hans Wolff made with Sonja Ziemann in the lead. In this film she has a guest appearance as ballet dancer and as far as I know this film has given her the only opportunity to show herself in the profession before she turned to acting that of ballet dancer. The production number for her may not be Hollywood standard but it is very entertaining welldanced and very imaginative. Other guest appearances are those of Zarah Leander and what a fine lady she still is and Kirsten Heilberg whose performance of the second song towards the end of the film gave me shivers down my spine.Of the cast I want to mention Georg Thomalla. This is a comedian I am not always to friendly of as he has the tendency not to keep himself in check. Here however he is charming and his acting and thus the comedy he provides is welltimed. He also has a songanddance number in which he gives a very good Maurice Chevalier impersonation.All in all I find this a very curious film that despite the terrible script but thanks to the spirit of Mackeben entertained me enormously.".

	schema:headline " Even thieves have a code of honour.";
	schema:reviewBody "Utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a dropdead gorgeous blonde acting as pullstring doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling latenight feature. This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat antiheroes Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. Really they don't get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy midsection where they hide themselves in a building during the Christmas break to crack a safe with 10000 possible combinations. Oh fun! But this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between Delon and Bronson's characters. After a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect. This would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curveball. Still their encounters early on suggest there's more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that 'What just happen there?' ending that might just make you jump. YEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! Glad to get that out of the system. The pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension.

	onyx:emotionText "Utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a dropdead gorgeous blonde acting as pullstring doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling latenight feature. This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat antiheroes Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. Really they don't get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy midsection where they hide themselves in a building during the Christmas break to crack a safe with 10000 possible combinations. Oh fun! But this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between Delon and Bronson's characters. After a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other's involvement and have a mutual respect. This would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curveball. Still their encounters early on suggest there's more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that 'What just happen there?' ending that might just make you jump. YEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHH! Glad to get that out of the system. The pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension.

I believe this film was originally in French but Delon and Bronson dubbed their own English.The two men are home from the French Foreign Legion in North Africa. Franz Propp Bronson is a mercenary and invites Dino Delon to join him. Dino says no. Figuring he has something interesting on the horizon Propp starts following him around which infuriates Dino. He's supposed to help a woman who was a friend of his buddy replace a huge amount of bonds in a safe over Christmas break. The company she works for is in need of a doctor which Dino is and Dino takes the job and sets up a camera to record the numbers of the safe. He then finds out there is 2 million to be left there over Christmas. Unfortunately the camera only shows 3 numbers clearly of the combination.Propp of course wants the money and won't leave the premises. The two stay in the basement of this building for the Christmas weekend with Dino desperate to get rid of Propp most of the time. They take turns trying safe combinations and as time goes on play tricks on one another. Dino buys all the food in the vending machine and then hides it in a table later as they're hiding guards take the table thus leaving them both with no food. They lock each other in and out of places. Then their room becomes a sweat box when they are locked in and Propp tries to go through a wall and cuts the air conditioning wires by accident. This gives them an opportunity to remove their shirts so we can see their bodies. Needless to say they both look great. The questions are  can they open the safe can they get out of the building when it opens on Tuesday and the big one can they live until Tuesday?This film which looked to be an adventureheist type of thing is actually very funny. Bronson and Delon work beautifully together and have a lot of chemistry. And they do learn they have one thing in common  loyalty.Someone said this film is slow  I didn't find it so. It's a real macho film with charming stars and a lot of humor. And the gorgeous Delon is given many closeups and at one point is in blue pajamas which emphasize his eyes. I enjoyed it.".

The film is essentially a twohander with Delon trapped in a bank vault alongside the great Charles Bronson for much of the running time. The two men bicker and fight a lot but eventually have to work out a way to escape together. Overall this is a stylish but sluggish production which has a good premise but goes on and on and on particularly at the climax which really drags. It's certainly promising and has plenty of interest for fans of the two actors but it's not particularly memorable.".

Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays. Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious. With exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women. One gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion. A last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu l'ami farewell friend.I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical heman superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. They are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout. The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like Deliverance. It is also very stylish. The safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. It is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. The wardrobe is also very good. The ultra stylish Citroen DS maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement.I can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone. Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting. Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics. I have never seen Bronson better than here he really acts  and speaks French throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed. And it is certainly the man himself we hear. So the French language version is highly recommended. The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackman's partner in French Connection II. He is the best brainy police inspector I know. Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingnue who as it turns out is not so Innocent as it first seems.Anyone who expects the old inanout of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film. For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake.".

With the help of the Hubert Bals Fund of the Rotterdam Film Festival the project was able to go into production in early 1992. Production money was derived from the personal resources of its four producers Cui Jian Zhang Yuan Shu Kei and Christopher Doylre. Zhang Yuan graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1989 and directed a series of Cui Jian music videos for MTV one of which was lensed by Christopher Doyle. Doyle collaborated with Hong Kong filmmaker Shu Kei on the latter's directorial feature SOUL 1986. It was only natural that the four of them would eventually join hands to produce BEIJING BASTARDS.Principal photography for the film took place entirely in Beijing over 12 months. Shooting was often suspended due to lack of money. Postproduction of the film was completed in June 1992 and was made possible with a grant from the French Ministry of Culture.Ever since BEIJING BASTARDS other independent films have emerged in China  the products of a whole new breed of independent and experimental Chinese filmmakers.".

	schema:headline " A deeply human odyssey";
	schema:reviewBody "Beijing Bicycle by Sixth Generation director Wang Xiaoshuai is an unsettling look at modern China in transition that depicts the relationship between two young men of different social status both yearning for acceptance and stubbornly determined to succeed. Guei Cui Lin is an unexpressive working class 17year old who has come to Beijing to find work while Jian Li Bin is a sophisticated middleclass student desperate to belong seeking approval from his biker friends and his beautiful girlfriend Gin Zhao Yiwel. The film explores the consequences when Guei's bicycle is stolen and ends up in Jian's hands. The bicycle represents an escape for both from the competitive pressures of their lives. For Guei it is a means of access to a job an income and survival. For Jian it is the pathway to being cool and being in the ingroup much like what the flashy sports car represents to young men in Western countries. As the film opens a group of boys are being interviewed for a job as a courier. Enticed by the prospect of owning a silver mountain bike Guei takes the job and begins to save money to buy the bike given to him as a loan the bike is his once he has earned 700 yuan which is about 85. Out of his element in the bewildering city Guei runs into an awkward situation almost immediately when he makes a delivery in a luxury hotel and is directed to the gym where he is forced to strip for a shower before he can deliver his package. He is then asked to pay for the shower when he leaves but does not have enough money. When his bike is stolen just one day before he can become the owner Guei's job is threatened. Xie Jian as Guei's manager is both abrasive and compassionate and offers to take Guei back to work if he can find his bike. In a city where bicycles are still the most common means of transportation against all odds he sets out to find it. The film is about the bicycle but is also about the city of Beijing. Guei's search for the bicycle takes him into all corners of the city. With an original score by Felix Wang and magnificent cinematography by Jie Liu the city comes alive with streets littered with traffic juxtaposed with mysterious alleys where old men play board games or do Tai Chi. Wang adds the little touches as well such as two friends sharing a toothbrush and a single spigot of water in an alley serving an entire neighborhood.Like De Sica's The Bicycle Thief the stolen bicycle is central to the story but here it is not about the hunt but about the consequences that follow from its recovery.

	onyx:emotionText "Beijing Bicycle by Sixth Generation director Wang Xiaoshuai is an unsettling look at modern China in transition that depicts the relationship between two young men of different social status both yearning for acceptance and stubbornly determined to succeed. Guei Cui Lin is an unexpressive working class 17year old who has come to Beijing to find work while Jian Li Bin is a sophisticated middleclass student desperate to belong seeking approval from his biker friends and his beautiful girlfriend Gin Zhao Yiwel. The film explores the consequences when Guei's bicycle is stolen and ends up in Jian's hands. The bicycle represents an escape for both from the competitive pressures of their lives. For Guei it is a means of access to a job an income and survival. For Jian it is the pathway to being cool and being in the ingroup much like what the flashy sports car represents to young men in Western countries. As the film opens a group of boys are being interviewed for a job as a courier. Enticed by the prospect of owning a silver mountain bike Guei takes the job and begins to save money to buy the bike given to him as a loan the bike is his once he has earned 700 yuan which is about 85. Out of his element in the bewildering city Guei runs into an awkward situation almost immediately when he makes a delivery in a luxury hotel and is directed to the gym where he is forced to strip for a shower before he can deliver his package. He is then asked to pay for the shower when he leaves but does not have enough money. When his bike is stolen just one day before he can become the owner Guei's job is threatened. Xie Jian as Guei's manager is both abrasive and compassionate and offers to take Guei back to work if he can find his bike. In a city where bicycles are still the most common means of transportation against all odds he sets out to find it. The film is about the bicycle but is also about the city of Beijing. Guei's search for the bicycle takes him into all corners of the city. With an original score by Felix Wang and magnificent cinematography by Jie Liu the city comes alive with streets littered with traffic juxtaposed with mysterious alleys where old men play board games or do Tai Chi. Wang adds the little touches as well such as two friends sharing a toothbrush and a single spigot of water in an alley serving an entire neighborhood.Like De Sica's The Bicycle Thief the stolen bicycle is central to the story but here it is not about the hunt but about the consequences that follow from its recovery. When the student Jian is found with the bike both he and Guei assert ownership and the bike is stolen and reclaimed by both boys several times each time ending in a scuffle with Jian's friends. In a powerful confrontation with his father Jian in a rage against his father for reneging on his promise to buy him a bike finally admits to stealing his father's money to purchase the bike himself at the flea market after it was fenced. The two boys are pitted against each other but mutual need brings them together and allows them to work out a compromise by alternating the days when each can use the bike.

A poor man having recently come to the city from the country wins a job at a bicycle courier business and on a delivery gets his bike stolen. He then proceeds to search the city of Beijing to retrieve it. Luckily it quickly veers away from being a simple update of that classic story. He finds the alleged thief a high school kid and steals it back. For the first hour or more the bike moves back and forth between them. The two characters are compared and contrasted and it works as an effective class study.The direction and editing are particularly great in the film. The climax involves two intersecting chases and it is one of the best stages sequences I've ever seen. There are a couple of problems small ones for me but perhaps big ones for critics and audiences. The high school kid is extraordinarily unlikable. A person behind me declared loudly What a brat! And he is. I personally don't mind if a character is unsympathetic although we are asked to sympathize with him I believe. My own biggest problem is that the ending is slightly unsatisfactory. There's not much closure. Still Beijing Bicycle is an excellent film. 910.".

His desperate strident and continuous cry when being forced with violence by Jian's gang to let go off his bicycle is simply heartbreaking. Who is to blame for Gui's aphasia? Is it class division?

	schema:reviewBody "Quasiremake of De Sica's Ladri di biciclette' set in the sprawling metropolis of contemporary Beijing.  Director Wang Xiaoshuai borrows not just the seedling idea but much of the approach of the Italian NeoRealist classic.  A stolen bicycle leads two boys from one sad situation to another and Wang lets those situations determine the film's form rather than using deliberate techniques to give it shape.  This result is going to inspire different responseslike Ladri di biciclette' itself it's going to seem refreshingly artless to some frustratingly aimless to others.  Likewise the film's tremendous stillness is going to draw some viewers in while alienating others.  There are passing comments on image perception and class divisions but the style ChineseItalian NeoNeoRealism? really prevents the director from exploring any of these ideas too thoroughly. Personally while I appreciate the respectful approach to the film's inspiration I wish Wang would have really cut loose with some radical new take on Ladri' as Tim Burton did with his masterpiece PeeWee's Big Adventure.'  As it is Shiqi sui de dan che' left me a little bit cold it was all done is good taste but the result was curiously lifeless.  For all his deference to De Sica Wang can't really recreate the Italian director's emotional depth no matter how precisely he recreates his style.  Without that depth this film is as beautiful as a series of still photographs but no more alive.  6 out of 10.".

Director Wang Xiaoshuai borrows not just the seedling idea but much of the approach of the Italian NeoRealist classic.  A stolen bicycle leads two boys from one sad situation to another and Wang lets those situations determine the film's form rather than using deliberate techniques to give it shape.  This result is going to inspire different responseslike Ladri di biciclette' itself it's going to seem refreshingly artless to some frustratingly aimless to others.  Likewise the film's tremendous stillness is going to draw some viewers in while alienating others.  There are passing comments on image perception and class divisions but the style ChineseItalian NeoNeoRealism? really prevents the director from exploring any of these ideas too thoroughly. Personally while I appreciate the respectful approach to the film's inspiration I wish Wang would have really cut loose with some radical new take on Ladri' as Tim Burton did with his masterpiece PeeWee's Big Adventure.'  As it is Shiqi sui de dan che' left me a little bit cold it was all done is good taste but the result was curiously lifeless.  For all his deference to De Sica Wang can't really recreate the Italian director's emotional depth no matter how precisely he recreates his style.  Without that depth this film is as beautiful as a series of still photographs but no more alive.  6 out of 10.";

The story revolves around ideas of going up the social ladder... about how material goods can change your status and what can happen due to greed.    The main character a peasant from the countryside finds himself in the wild urban enviroment and all its impersonal aggresiveness. The big city is unforgiving. The way the main characters tend to react to otherwise incredibly hard situations with silence sure is different from western standards.     Overall a beautiful movie with some very good scenes... still slow at times and could have been better  7 in 10.".

In fact we suspect this director is telling a story that seems to mirror the other film but it's Chinese to the core.Young Guo who has arrived in Beijing from a rural area is hired as a messenger for an agency that delivers important packages and mail throughout the city. Part of the deal is a shiny new bicycle that will be paid by the new hires after being in the job for a while. The bicycle for Guo means the improvement of his lot in life as well as freedom to go everywhere and be his own master.Jian on the other hand is a student that is seen hanging out with a rough bunch of school mates. Jian is excelling academically but in order to fit he must have a bicycle. The film doesn't make clear if Jian himself steals the bicycle or as he claims he bought it at the second hand market with the money he stole from his father which seems to be the case. He views the bicycle as a sign of status and of belonging a means to have been accepted by his peers. Young Guo shows a stubbornness that seems to be a trait with people from the area where he comes from. Instead of accepting the fact that his bicycle has been stolen he decides to investigate on his own something that must be a super human task given the millions of bicycles one sees in that city and a mode of transport for the masses. One can't follow Guo's logic in not going to the police or when he realizes who has stolen his bicycle he never challenges the thief. In fact Jian and his friends show a cruelty for the newly arrived country bumpkin that is scary. In fact Jian shows a stubbornness himself that is unusual for a city boy that should have known better and who should have realized the plight of Guo.Beijing Bicycle shows a side of city living in a city that is crowded and can be cruel to anyone trying to make a life in a decent way.

I think this film is well made. The pace is smooth. The acting is superb. I especially like the acting of the employer who hires the main character as a messenger boy.

I think this film is well made. The pace is smooth. The acting is superb. I especially like the acting of the employer who hires the main character as a messenger boy. He is what you would call a prudent business man with heart! Please take some time out of your day and watch this tense movie with moralistic themes rich versus poor right versus wrong bullying versus stubbornness. A winner in my book!";

	schema:reviewBody "BEIJING BICYCLE'Victor Bloom MDBeijing Bicycle' has been compared to Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief' a classic of decades ago but this film is a landmark classic that raises the bar on movies about poverty and the city.  The director Wang is being called a 6th generation Chinese film director from a long tradition of great moviemaking despite the political censorship inherent in communist China.  I am sure the censors let this one through because of the theme of peasant nobility and capitalist corruption.  They let this one pass because it also shows the tremendous urban development of China's ancient capital where great projects of highrise housing are dwarfing and replacing the old hardscrabble alleyways.  It is clear that Chinese entrepreneurs are beginning to accumulate great wealth as capitalistic enterprises are being not only tolerated but encouraged by the old guard who are realizing the tremendous economic potential of a billion energetic and hardworking people.Since China is becoming more open and industrialized not to mention technologically sophisticated  the powers that be are showing off with this stunning film.  Beijing is beginning to rival Tokyo in terms of developing garish areas of entertainment including the adrenalinrushing venues of video games and carnival arcades populated by hopping and haremscarem teenagers.  There is a pulsating intensity that is almost New York City or Las Vegas luring the kids to blow their allowances cut school and smoke cigarettes.  Into this hodgepodge of posh highrise hotels and downanddirty slums we have a voyeuristic view of presentday Beijing.If you were a normal American tourist you would never see this interior view so the movie is worth the price of a socioanthropoligical tour that would have cost in  5 or 6 figures.  Therefore the movie is a great bargain because in less than two hours the viewer is exposed to cinema art at its highest level with a synthesis of a classic story one dramatic situation after another subtle and powerful acting original and creative cinematography tied together with a pounding and relentless soundtrack that keeps the forward motion escalating to the very end.The Shakespearean plot is mindful of Romeo and Juliet' and West Side Story.'  The protagonists are teenagers but the story is such that this overused American term simply does not apply.  These adolescents are young men and young women.  And what emerges is the fact of China's onechild policy in which many female newborns were dispatched leaving the present China with many more young men than young women.  At a billion and growing China needed birth control.  They formulated a plan and enforced it.  Now what is the fallout?The consequence of this policy seems to lead to whitehot competition between the males and therefore gets primitively brutal at times.  That has always been the case given human nature but we see that Chinese young men have not developed their aggression to the point of shooting up their classmates.  They are not above braining each other every now and then with a brick but bruised and bloody they wake up from being knocked out and are ready for more conflict.  Their 5000 year civilization keeps them trying to compromise and halting their aggression just short of murder unlike the Europeans.The competition is naturally about who's going to win the heart of the lovely girl.  In this bicycle film the heroes are those who can do the greatest tricks with a bike and especially the latest mountain bikes with shock absorbers rugged tires and multiple gears.  They can bounce up steps with them whirl around on wheelies and even maintain a precarious balance while stationary.  The girl is attracted to the Marlon Brando type who performs the best tricks barechested and who is cool enough to smoke cigarettes and carry a Zippo lighter.  Instead of motorcycle gangs the rich boys ride their daredevil bikes up the high stories of construction sites.If you know anything about Beijing it is a city of millions of bikes swarming like taxis in New York.  Most are for simple transporation to and from work and shopping but some are used to transport multiple birdcages and even mattrasses.  One bike is shown failing to support a refrigerator! The camera is everywhere recording the waves of bicycles amid the swarms of automobiles from groundlevel up through flashing spokes and chains to panoramic views from above.  The camera shows the poor neighborhoods with newcomers brushing their teeth in the street even sharing a toothbrush as well as the interior of posh hotels where the hapless bicycle messenger must undress completely and take a shower in order to deliver a message to a Mr. Zhou.  We find Mr. Zhou getting a comically assisted workout by the masseur and he is not the right Zhou.  There are many Zhou's in China! Try Zhou Yimou' is the inside joke as that is the name of the director's mentor the Great Zhou.The bicycle messenger is a stubborn lad from the country and gets caught in a revolving door and into the machinations of the new posh living and thus we are caught in the neverending struggle between wealth and poverty sophistication and ignorance.  No need to go into the details of the story suffice it to say it is a gripping one a coming together of ageold irresolveable conflict that of young men looking for romance and poor people looking for a better life.  As we observe the young men struggling with inborn instincts of sex and aggression there is sure to be shock pain bloodshed and important lessons learned.  The audience of this great film is priviliged to observe them as it was first hand.".

He's smitten with blond blueeyed Kevin Simon Van Buyten who works at a restaurant run by his openminded mother Marina Karlijn Sileghem. Though normally a slick pickup artist Bram who deals cocaine as a sideline to his job with an upscale caterer is unsure of Kevin's sexual leanings.At home however Bram is Ibrahim exemplary eldest son to migr parents Ergun Simsek Tanja Cnaepkens proud to have resisted liberal Western ways more firmly than many back home in Turkey. The thorn in their side is Ibrahim's younger sibling Furkan Lukas De Wolf an angry teen who's turning into a little thug skipping school and committing robberies with equally rudderless pals. Wise to his brother's hidden life Furkan outs Ibrahim to take the heat off himself but the family simply doesn't believe him.That leaves Bram free to invite Kevin along when he goes to Turkey  a trip intended to confirm his arrangedmarriage plans with educated cousin Elif Gamze Tazim though that becomes a mere obligatory aside to the two men's joyful consummation of mutual attraction. Their cavorting doesn't go unnoticed by a hotel porter Hakan Gurkan whom notsochaste Elif has been fooling around with. Presented with evidence she proves too hellbent on moving West to be swayed from Plan A. But those photos will wreak havoc yet.Mix of comedy romance intrigue and religiouscultural tensions is smoothly handled for the most part even if the film's increasing seriousness feels a little lopsided particularly when a late instance of turnabout violence prompts allaround reconciliations a mite too conveniently. Nonetheless Mixed Kebab enjoyably balances numerous themes and plot strands with brisk skill presenting the gay relationship in an upfront manner without ever turning into a solely focused item. Ensemble cast location choices and techdesign contributions are all lively and spoton.".

I liked how petty criminal brother Furkan is pretty much a little punk converts to fundamentalism white pajamas and all and is still a punk. Some things never change. The best part of the movie by far was its star Cem Akkanat as the conflicted main character Ibrahim. He is handsome expressive yet understated  a natural!

	schema:reviewBody "In order to fully appreciate The Apostle it might help to have some experience with southern Pentecostal culture.  I do and was completely taken in by the film.  My wife on the other hand doesn't have that experience and understands neither the film nor my fondness for it.  But I think that if one is not distracted or confused or simply put off by the loud emotional sometimes corny religiosity portrayed here one can see a strong compelling story of a seriously ultimately fatally flawed man whose faith in God and in God's mission for him reaches to his very core.On the surface one can view Sonny Dewey as just another example of a certain type of religious fraud  the backslapping perpetuallygrinning wisecracking good old boy who uses religion and exploits his flock for his own selfish ends.  He looks like someone who doesn't practice what he preaches.  He womanizes he's not above taking a snort from this pocket flask he has a troubled marriage and we get the hint that he is the source of more than his share of the trouble even to the extent of driving his wife into the arms of another man.  He seems to be just another Elmer Gantry or  to pick from the real world he's just like one of the fallen televangelists of recent years.  But just when you're comfortable with that judgment of him Sonny proves you wrong.  He admits to his faults some more freely than others.  But he makes no excuses for them and in the end he knows that he is going to pay for them.What really draws me into the film and what really makes  Sonny interesting for me is the way Duvall has made him such a complex character.   He's a bad guy and a good guy.  He is darkness and he is light.  He is sometimes endearing and other times someone you really don't feel comfortable trusting.   But by creating this ambiguity Duvall does a service not only to the way religious leaders are characterized in film he also pays homage to core religious issues.  By diving into the murky waters of Sonny's soul Duvall goes into territory known to any seriously religious person.    As much as you might want things to be black and white a good portion of the time you're being pulled back into the shadows  there are good intentions and evil deeds there are selfless aspirations and appetites to be fed. Sometimes you swing wildly from one side to the other.  Sometimes you are on an even keel.  Sometimes you're not sure.Faith and work determine how such a struggle will turn out.  Sonny is energized by both.  He believes in what he is doing.  He believes that God has given him a mission and he is determined to accomplish it even in spite of himself.  While it might be tempting to make a stark contrast between the message Sonny preaches and the actions he has done that are contrary to it one must always remember that a good preacher always preaches to himself as well as his congregation.  But some of the more revealing moments of the film are not when Sonny is in front of a congregation or even with other people generally but when he is alone with God  ranting at God in anger dedicating himself to God in the moment that he becomes the Apostle the soulsearching moments when he forgives his wife and resigns himself to his fate.The nopunchespulled realness of Sonny's struggle is a refreshing departure from the usual film portrayals of religious figures  plaster saint conman onedimensional milquetoast.  But it also brings to the forefront the question of whether Sonny or any of us can be used for divine purpose.The Apostle is beautifully filmed and captures well a portion of the rural South  you can almost feel the humidity and smell the swampwater.  And while the wellknown actors in the film Farrah Fawcett Billy Bob Thornton Miranda Richardson all turn in fine performances it is the unknowns the church members and townfolk  that really give the film an added authenticity.".

Robert Duvall is an ambitious actor and film maker and The Apostle hits home with its perceptive and loving portrayal of country people in the United States. It is refreshing to see that culture portrayed as something other than gaggles of yahoos.  The Apostle focuses on the community spirit of the church and thereby shatters some of the mystery of its appeal in a culture as selfcentered as our own.  There are no saints in this story just a protagonist and his supporters trying to make sense of a country in which there is little love and way too much usury.  The film is harsh on a number of levels very nononsense though drawn out at various moments. But it's real and that's more than can be said for ninety per cent of what passes for films about U.S. culture these days. It's said by some folks that Robert Duvall has been trying to make this film for a lot of years and there are parts of The Apostle that contain faint echoes of his 1983 project Tender Mercies. It hardly matters since both are interesting films for different reasons.  Some day we'll see Robert Duvall as the vast repository of Americana he really is until then The Apostle is one of the best testimonies to his strengths that I know of. Can I get a witness?".

The other 'actors' in the film also contribute to give The Apostle a realistic warmth rarely achieved in mainstream films. I refer to the cast as 'actors' because aside from numerous character actors Duvall being one of the greatest the film is inhabited by nonactors. In other words the people in church from the Holiness preachers to the warm smalltown folk are real people not trained in acting. Duvall's story is engaging and beautiful in the way it shows the flaws amid great talent in a man who chooses for himself the calling of Apostle. I love this film the accurate portrayal of some aspects of southern U.S. life and culture and especially Duvall's performance.".

I refer to the cast as 'actors' because aside from numerous character actors Duvall being one of the greatest the film is inhabited by nonactors. In other words the people in church from the Holiness preachers to the warm smalltown folk are real people not trained in acting. Duvall's story is engaging and beautiful in the way it shows the flaws amid great talent in a man who chooses for himself the calling of Apostle. I love this film the accurate portrayal of some aspects of southern U.S. life and culture and especially Duvall's performance.";

	schema:reviewBody "My husband and I have loved this movie since we saw it the first four or five times.  After recently buying a DVD and getting The Apostle in DVD we found a new since of excitement.  The director's insights given have enriched the movie and given it deeper personality. Here is a few thoughts to help capture this wonderful creationEulis Sonny' Dewey is a Southern Pentecostal Holiness Evangelist and Preacher from Texas living a seemingly happy life with his wife Jessie and his two beauties' children.  Suddenly his flashy hyped world comes apart Jessie is having an affair with youth minister Horace.  Sonny gets drunk enraged and hits Horace with a baseball bat putting him into a coma in which he later dies.  Sonny escapes town takes a new name The Apostle E.F.' and goes to Louisiana.  He starts to work as a mechanic for local radio station owner Elmo and Elmo lets him preach on the radio.  E.F. starts to preach everywhere on the radio on the streets and with his new friend Reverend Blackwell he starts a campaign to renovate an old church. Along the way he wants to have an affair with Elmo's secretary Toosie' and all the time he is preaching he knows his time is running out.  His past sins are catching up with him and so is the law.The character of Sonny is developed in every scene.  Each scene reveals another complex part of Sonny's character.  One scene will show his humility and the next shows his pride.  These contradictions of sanctification versus earthiness generosity versus possessiveness and open affability versus anger are developed to show the complexity in Sonny's character. Robert Duvall's sense of evil is simple and forgiving things most all people deal with.  Robert Duvall constantly explores how good a human can be and how much good he can do when sold out' to God.  His personal communication scenes with Jesus make his character seem vulnerable open and honest.The Apostle is set in a Southern God Fearing Right Wing Conservative setting.  Even though Sonny has had a womanizing' problem in the past the morality is certainly conveyed as an absolute and conservative religious morality.  This is a community of a small group that belongs to Jesus and Sonny's little church'.  Since the Southern Pentecostal Church containing both Blacks and Whites together is not a stereotype The Apostle is developing new territory in genre definition.  The ideas of feminism or gay liberation are hardly understood in this rural religious Southern setting. Morality and fidelity are high on their social standards.  However overeating and gluttony are accepted weaknesses.  Getting drunk is one weakness that most of the men have had in their younger rebellious days.The charismatic convincing conniving and calculating Sonny describes a most entertaining and flawed Man of God'.  The theme of an uneasy coexistence of the holy part of Sonny with his flesh is brought to film for the first time.  The protagonist Sonny is the most authentic portrayal of a Southern Pentecostal Holiness EvangelistPreacher with almost every other word being Praise the Lord' Hallelujah' Amen' Thank you Jesus' which all come from his heart.The other earthly side of Sonny is aptly convincing.  Earthy examples are his description of his womanizing to his wife his drunken fight where he strikes his wife's lover with a baseball bat and his cruelly dragging his wife off the ball field by her hair and showing his obvious drunkenness anger and cruelty when he blew up.  Another subtle example is when he is doing his charismatic preaching on the radio while the secretary is watching his intensity and he follows it by preaching to her meanwhile there is this calculating sales pitch with sexual subtext between the two people.A subtle but revealing example of Sonny's character is shown by Duvall's acting in two saleslike asking for the order' scenes.  The first scene takes place where Sonny and the secretary have had several encounters and Sonny is trying to get into her life house and bedroom.  After a couple of hot intense smothering kisses Sonny keeps saying Come on now' for his closing pitch' to which she keeps answering Next time'.  The other is in the closing scenes of the movie inside the One Way Road to Heaven' church. Sonny and members are having an altar call' and have been singing Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling' and as a final plea to a parishioner to accept Jesus into his life Sonny keeps using his sales phrase Come on now!'  Even though the words are previously used for his earthly desires in this scene he captures his passion to perfection and his tears are genuine as he pleads with all his heart.In my mind I can describe Robert Duvall's Academy Award deserving character acting as a poignant perplexing portrayal of a paradoxical problematic passionate preacher.  Even though I could also choose Jack Nicholson's role in As Good As It Gets'who won the Oscar the depth and breadth of Nicholson's acting don't measure up to the job done by probably America's greatest actor Robert Duvall.  I believe this technique of documentary style filmmaking places the burden of carrying the movie on the acting and solely on Robert Duvall's Academy Award winning shoulders and he delivers".

Duvall's performance was so convincing that had he performed this role live I'm sure he would have moved the whole audience to tears.I resisted seeing this film at first expecting that it would be the usual tired antireligious stereotype that late twentieth century script writers revel in.  But The Apostle does not blindly follow any stereotypes.  The premise is plausible and the realistic character portrayals give the viewer the feeling that they are right there in the story.  This is a riveting tragic tale of a very flawed man who has the gift of inspiring others to better and greater things.  Had Shakespeare been around today he would have borrowed this storyline but I doubt he could have done a better job.It is a cautionary tale for anyone in a position of leadership.

As a church worker who is a moderateliberal Christian there are few other movies like it out there. It presents a pastor who is clearly flawed and sinful as all of us are. However it also presents someone who simply wants to serve the Lord and help people whether they are poor black or prisoners. The filming locations and use of real pastors give the movie an extremely authentic feel. Great music as well! Highly recommended movie with great acting a story that makes you think and a balanced portrayal of evangelical Christianity.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Apostle is a gripping film on a most unpromising subject matter. The film has none of the obvious flash of movies such as Elmer Gantry and The Rainmaker which covered some of the same territory. The Apostle is based on straightforward storytelling great character development and nice gentle pacing  but with a strong kick.Robert Duvall one of the best actors of the last thirty years gives a powerful performance as the preacher driven by his inner demons  and gods. Over the years we've seen preachers played by actors ranging from Burt Lancaster to Steve Martin but Robert Duvall comes up with a truly individual and original interpretation. What makes the character Sonny stand out is that he is so real! Ranging from his most charismatic doing a Joe Dolan impersonation? to his most personal one feels that Sonny the apostle EF is real believes what he is doing is real and is confident in his destiny  no matter how odd or quirky he appears at times.The film is character driven with a good sprinkling of incidents throughout. Story points introduced early on and developed before half way give the film a strong feel of The Fugitive the TV series  laid back story based but with the undercurrent of a ticking bomb under the table Alfred Hitchcock.Minor quibbles Miranda Richardson's character is a little too young for Robert Duvall's. June Carter Cash both the actress and the character seem under utilised. And at times it is possible to see the joins. The version I saw on video appears to be shorter than that shown originally in the US cinema. This pruning may account for some of these minor points.Overall The Apostle is highly recommended. Filmgoers without a strong interest in religious matters should find the characters their treatment and the landscape in which they operate fascinating. Most people of a religious disposition should have little difficulty with the film as a film though they may not always like what they see from a religious viewpoint. 8.75.Amen!".

No Central Casting actors could ever give the depth of characterization that these local people bring to the story. Sister Johnson in her pink Sundaygotomeetin' outfit and Sister Delilah are just terrific as is Rick Dial as Elmo the local radio station host who gives The Apostle a chance to evangelize.And whether he's preaching on radio or directly to a church congregation The Apostle with deep emotional conviction shouts out his pronouncements using literal verbal imagery consistent with a literal interpretation of the Bible holy ghost preaching machine a holy ghost explosion we're going to short circuit the devil. The congregation sequences are largely improvisational built on real emotion and feeling from real people nothing canned here remarkably genuine.The film's weakness is the contrived plot that revolves around Sonny's marriage. His wife is played by Farrah Fawcett a usually fine actress who seems miscast here. In addition some of the scenes especially in the first half could have been edited out.You can't have a film about Pentecostal preaching without gospel music. And in The Apostle the hymns are old traditional Biblebelt favorites I Love To Tell The Story Softly And Tenderly and I'll Fly Away. The film's subject matter largely implied about death the heartfelt hymns and the film's lighting combine to render a general tone of sadness and depression although laughter and joy find their ways into the story as well.Despite a hokey contrived plot The Apostle is mesmerizing in its authenticity of those in the American South who abide by the Pentecostal faith. Some viewers may find all the shouting and foot stomping offputting. But it is genuine. In addition to being entertaining for the most part the film will be a real eye opener for some viewers.".

Sonny Robert Duvall winds up starting a rural church from scratch in a small town in Louisiana and is eventually discovered and sent back to Texas to jail.Duvall gives a tremendous acting performance in here one of the best I've seen on film. He dominates the picture from starttofinish. There are some good messages in here including the one that you reap what you sow and accepting that even when it's bad news and you wind up paying for your sins.Speaking of that the bad news about this film is yet another portrayal of a minister who acts very unministerlike. Here's a preacher who carries a pistol slugs a man with a baseball bat runs away from the scene and his family and later settles a dispute with his fists and makes sexual advances to a woman.I don't know ANY minister or priest who would do these things  especially all of them!  but it makes for a good story filmwise. Another horrible message was seeing the minister's wife played by Farrah Fawcett having an affair with the youth minister! I mean all of this is ridiculous. To those antichurch readers out there I'm sorry but this is not the way it is by any means.Yet despite all that this is not your typical antiChristian film which is why no major studio would fund this movie. Duvall had to put his own money into this. Hollywood didn't want to back a film in which people being saved means a lot where people unashamedly praise the Lord and are converted. In this film are several touching conversions including a dramatic one with Billy Bob Thornton of all people! Hey with God all things are possible. Many of the people in this movie were not actors either but real ministers. Also shown are supporting characters who are all sincere good people who help The Apostle E.F. Duvall build the church and help make it grow.In the end despite all his flaws Duvall's character turns out to be one of a sincere evangelist who truly loves God and wants to do His work wherever and whenever even on a chain gang as the ending credits attest.The more I watch this movie the more I appreciate the cinematography in here. I enjoyed the music too. This is a strange film full of good and bad people and their actions and a movie I suspect people would either love or hate. I loved it.".

	schema:headline " Vast....Duvall strikes gold with 'Sonny'";
	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Roberty Duvall I saw on entertainment T.V. in an interview that Robert even put millions of his own dollars into the 'making' of this. Propelling is just the intro to this superbly crafted story of doing the 'Gospel' your way. This shows me many with good intentions can go almost terminally wrong. I was sitting watching this on cable at the hotel when my wife at that time would not let me go out with her that morning on her route in Sierra Vista. It wasn't that I would get in the way of her talking to the doctors on her pharmaceutical rounds due to the fact that she had already ask me to go with her a couple times before and I knew how things shake out with it it was that she was having an affair with a coworker and needed to give him a private long distance call from a pay phone. At any rate this was probably one of the most upending and unsettling and touching films I had seen in years. It was good that I stayed and watch Duvall's story of betrayal and violence. I came to a better grip with the circumstances that I was in believe it or not. When he becomes E.F. the Apostle you can see he seems starting to come apart just before it happens. There is a much misgilded thought life that he has when he boldly steps up and decides that it's better to blame God than to 'take responsibility' for his very own misconduct and rage trouble. Farrah Fawcett provides an aging but provocative exwife that can't take the 'jambing' effect that Sonny seems to boldly posses. I.e. the baseball field assault on his ex's new man. It seems that at the end of the assault he just disconnected and said let's go home now. As if whatever he does even when totally wrong he can justify to himself despite the damaged inflicted on anything or anyone else that is around him then. Then there is the scene at the church with Billy bob's character and they quickly end up in a brawl on the side of the church while the deacons look on. But that was what that character of BillyBob's needed to respect a man of God. A strong man. A wimp couldn't have probably reached him in the condition he was in right there.I have a lot of respect for Robert Duvall for taking and making something that wouldn't get muddled by Hollywood and it's sense of God. It was different. I got quite a large helping of calm and understanding after my wife had departed our life together. I think I learned even more about human nature and intentions motives etc. It shows that even when people mess it up there is always something on a subtextual level it's not always just 'Face value'. I am not a Billy Bob fan by the way but even his character that came to destroy Sonny's church and ended up changing his own life in that process. Remember as well even if he can 'justify' his own bad behavior God did not let him go on and on he had to be brought to 'Justice' himself. You can mock God but only for a little while. This film definitely touched me and caused me to think deeper.Thanks IMDb.com.... I recommend this to those with discernment about life and people and especially the Bible. ".

Though The Apostle is a work of fiction it does a great job of presenting faith that is shunned by the world and continuously proved by God. When Sonny stops to pray at a carcrash it appears that the wife is probably dead and the husband is in fairly critical condition. Sonny prays with them despite an officer's orders and drives away. As Sonny is leaving the viewer sees the wife's hand grip her husbands presumably showing God's work in the situation Sonny's reply Momma we made news in heaven today. Duvall's film also deals greatly with the humanity of Christians. Though Sonny is a murderer and a womanizer God still chooses to use him. One cannot help but to think of Abraham being called and leaving his idols behind. Some say that art imitates life while others argue that life imitates art.

This simply portrays a man who loves God and His people with a pure heart but is a human being subject to fall and make mistakes the same as anyone else. I especially enjoyed the flavor the extras gave the movie as you could tell they were real people and not actors.

	schema:reviewBody "I have always appreciated Robert Duvall as an actor but everything he's ever done pales in comparison to his performance as The Apostle E.F. in this movie. Duvall carried this from beginning to end. The rest of the cast was good but this belonged to Duvall. He perfectly captured the essence of a charismatic fundamentalist holinesstype preacher and was totally convincing in the role. There are a lot of issues that come through in this movie. One is the ease with which a charismatic in both the secular and spiritual sense charlatan can capture the minds and souls of those around him. Having said that E.F. is a more complicated character than that. Yes he was charismatic and yes he could manipulate but the character to me at least had a fundamental integrity to him. He was sincere in what he was doing. He loved Jesus he loved the church he loved the people in the church. I bought into that  I believed it. And yes he was a sinner  he was a womanizer who then went on  in a fit of anger  to kill the man for whom his wife had left him. Terrible things but they came across as human rather than hypocritical. Strangely even the fact the E.F. was a murderer didn't seem to take away from his fundamental decency. On the run after committing the murder he establishes a new church in a small town in Louisiana and again he captures people's hearts and turns them toward God and even at the end of the movie in a prison chain gang he captures the hearts of the other prisoners and turns them toward God  and I never doubted that he was wanting to do that. He wasn't doing this to glorify himself he was doing it for what he perceived to be the glory of God. And I believed that.As a very mainline Christian pastor who has some suspicion of charismatic preachers it wasn't easy to convince me of E.F.'s sincerity  but Duvall did. That was the brilliance not only of his performance but of the movie as a whole. Whether in personal repentance or in leading someone through a conversion experience E.F. was real. Thank you to Robert Duvall for this powerful performance.The movie had flaws. For the first few minutes I was confused about the relationships here. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention but I honestly thought E.F.'s mother was his wife and that Farrah Fawcett was playing his daughter and the kids were his grandchildren. I was thrown a bit when Fawcett turned out to be playing his wife who had left him and taken his children away from him. I also thought that the playbyplay radio commentary from the church picnic of the bigot's conversion experience was just downright silly. But there weren't many weaknesses. Duvall's performance the essential dignity he provided the character with and the overall realism of the film makes this a mustsee!".

	schema:headline " Duvall's ability to portray his character with his dynamic voice and strong appearance allows his performance to transcend his film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Duvall Gods And Generals' has long been known as one of America's finest actors. His ability to portray characters with his dynamic voice and strong appearance allows his performances to transcend the films that he acts in. In his most ambitious project The Apostle' in which he directs is a screenwriter acts and is an executive producer Duvall finds himself in uncharted movie territory as a preacher whose unhealthy obsession with God and his church leads to his own downfall. Although the film incorporates superb performances and great direction it does suffer from being too lengthy and drawn out. The Apostle' is the story of Eulis Sonny' Dewey Duvall who parish is taken away from him when his adulteress wife Jessie Farrah Fawcett decides to leave him and take their children away for a younger preacher in the same parish. As such Eulis under the influence of alcohol and his own convictions attacks Jessie's beau putting him in a coma that eventually leads to his own death. Eulis leaves town and decides to start his life anew. Finding a small village with a broken down church he sets up a new congregation and develops followers who listen to his radio program as he appears as the Apostle E.F. The one problem with The Apostle' is the lengthy church scenes. It seems as if Duvall just goes around and around again with the same things to say over and over. Although this could work in reality if preaching to different congregations to a movie audience it's not necessary to continuously drag them through the same scenes in a different church. After all there are only so many times in a twohour film that we can bare to hear praise Jesus.' However it does show the zealous nature of the character of Eulis and his deep affinity to the church. The performances in The Apostle' were outstanding. Duvall comes off as both enlightening through his sermons and utterly terrifying through his anger towards his wife her boyfriend and to an unruly member of society Billy Bob Thornton who doesn't want the Apostle E.F.'s church around. Fawcett's character as Jessie Eulis's much younger wife is well portrayed however it's arguable that she is underused in the film. The performances of Miranda Richardson The Hours' John Beasley The Sum of All Fears' and Billy Bob Thornton Bandits' were excellent as well.Duvall's direction of the film was wonderful. It's easy to grasp that The Apostle' was his personal masterpiece that he'd been trying to craft for several years. One element of avoiding conventional cinematography was used that added an artistic sense to the feature in which Eulis baptizes himself to absolve himself of his sins.

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Duvall Gods And Generals' has long been known as one of America's finest actors. His ability to portray characters with his dynamic voice and strong appearance allows his performances to transcend the films that he acts in. In his most ambitious project The Apostle' in which he directs is a screenwriter acts and is an executive producer Duvall finds himself in uncharted movie territory as a preacher whose unhealthy obsession with God and his church leads to his own downfall. Although the film incorporates superb performances and great direction it does suffer from being too lengthy and drawn out. The Apostle' is the story of Eulis Sonny' Dewey Duvall who parish is taken away from him when his adulteress wife Jessie Farrah Fawcett decides to leave him and take their children away for a younger preacher in the same parish. As such Eulis under the influence of alcohol and his own convictions attacks Jessie's beau putting him in a coma that eventually leads to his own death. Eulis leaves town and decides to start his life anew. Finding a small village with a broken down church he sets up a new congregation and develops followers who listen to his radio program as he appears as the Apostle E.F. The one problem with The Apostle' is the lengthy church scenes. It seems as if Duvall just goes around and around again with the same things to say over and over. Although this could work in reality if preaching to different congregations to a movie audience it's not necessary to continuously drag them through the same scenes in a different church. After all there are only so many times in a twohour film that we can bare to hear praise Jesus.' However it does show the zealous nature of the character of Eulis and his deep affinity to the church. The performances in The Apostle' were outstanding. Duvall comes off as both enlightening through his sermons and utterly terrifying through his anger towards his wife her boyfriend and to an unruly member of society Billy Bob Thornton who doesn't want the Apostle E.F.'s church around. Fawcett's character as Jessie Eulis's much younger wife is well portrayed however it's arguable that she is underused in the film. The performances of Miranda Richardson The Hours' John Beasley The Sum of All Fears' and Billy Bob Thornton Bandits' were excellent as well.Duvall's direction of the film was wonderful. It's easy to grasp that The Apostle' was his personal masterpiece that he'd been trying to craft for several years. One element of avoiding conventional cinematography was used that added an artistic sense to the feature in which Eulis baptizes himself to absolve himself of his sins. The camera was used in slow motion at the end of the scene with the morning sun light behind Duvall as he wades in a river giving him a mysterious appearance.  In the end the film does work and is highly recommendable regardless of its prolonged ceremonial scenes that just seem to make the film drag rather than flow. ";

	schema:reviewBody "Just because the main character is oh so COMPLEX does not mean the movie is going to be interesting. And just because Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors in the world does not mean he is also going to be a great director and screenplay writer. The Apostle certainly supports the idea that great actors make lousy directors.Obviously I am of the minority opinion. Much like a charismatic preacher with a gullible flock this movie seems to have bamboozled a large number of respectable critics and laypeople including my brother whom I love and who insisted I watch this movie. Whether I will be able to forgive him remains to be seen.Like many actordirected projects this one creaks under the weight of its creator's humongous ego. As somebody else here rightfully pointed out Duvall is way too old to play a guy who was a toddler in 1939 whose mother looks like his wife is married to Farrah Fawcett and who would slobber over Miranda Richardson without her laughing at him as a dirty old man. Apparently Duvall did not want to let a younger actor play Sonny because he could not resist the chance to preach.And does he ever preach. All the time. At least 80 of the scenes consist of him preaching. SPOILER COMING Even when he is about to be arrested for the murder of his wife's lover we still have to put up with 20 minutes of preaching and singing and shouting and praising the Lord before the police can finally lead him away. An actual sermon would not go on as long as this movie does at two hours and 14 minutes. The Apostle is a sermon punctuated by the occasional plot point.And unless Sonny was going to get some sorely needed humility quickly I did not care what became of him. He is a despicable character but not very interesting in his odium because as we hear over and over ad nauseum he Loves the Lord and therefore is not a villain. He is Complex. He has Weaknesses. Apparently he cheated on his wife because they talk about it. Why they couldn't have substituted one womanizing scene for one of the many preaching scenes is unknown. What makes the movie so boring is that this supposedly complex character does not develop. He does not change. He does not undergo any spiritual experiences himself despite the fact that he is a murderous drunk. The phrase Physician heal thyself comes to mind. One could say here Preacher save thyself.Why so many people are singing this movies praises is odd though not entirely a mystery. A brilliant actor directed it. It is about Serious Matters and it attempts to do something Different. Its settings are rural which seems to charm a lot of people. And it certainly seems to go out of its way to avoid being confused with entertainment. No it aspires to be High Art. Just because it has aspirations does not mean it succeeds in those aspirations. It is a prolonged selfcongratulatory onenote boring plot less abomination.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched the Apostle two nights ago and I rented it partially out of guilt. I saw a film called The Ice Harvest that made me realize I wanted something a bit more inspiring more wholesome more spiritually focused in film. The Ice Harvest strangely enough also has Billy Bob Thornton along with John Cusack as some of the most profane and greedy but not nearly the most messed up characters in a rural Kansas town. Sex violence the whole mix and what's worse a sloppy ending. So I rented this because I wanted to be uplifted.The Apostle often delivers a brand of Southern comfort simplicity and humanity that's quite refreshing without being naive I thought it was an important and sobering note that the old man who gives Duvall a tent also sleeps with his rifle on his chest watching him. That combination is very human and very American we live at once in love and fear of each other very often.Another wonderful thing about this film is it is raceconscious but very much about integration all God's children like Duvall says. I love the moment when Blackwell tells Duvall how black he sounds on the radio for a white man. As for being inspired spiritually I almost cried when Duvall prayed over Billy Bob Troublemaker. As a matter of fact I think that moment is the spiritual high point of the film the sinner converting another sinner and saving a church. If we had immediately seen the police coming for Duvall after that it would have served as a great coda to reminds us that within sinners like Billy there are saintsgood men and within apostles like Duvall there are sinners.None of us are as pure as the driven snow but none of our souls are so black that they can't be redeemed. That's one of the great things about CRASH that is a film that shows both corruption of the decent and the unexpected decency lying within the corrupt.The main problem with Apostle like Ice Harvest oddly enough comes down to a sloppy ending. SPOILER Duvall draws it out for far too long with the sermon once the police have arrived it needs to come to a close. Would an officer wait that long to arrest a man for first degree murder? Duvall's rally cry of Get Behind Me Satan is quite effective but it drags on for ten minutes. Finally Sammy's acceptance of Jesus given what has already happened to Billy Bob lacks the punch it should have.It brings me back to an eerie feeling that I got throughout the movie this particular branch of Christianity that the Apostle is representing seems to shout a whole lot what really shouldn't need that kind of volume. I was taught a year or so ago the phrase Preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words. It means that it's in our actions that we show our love not just in our words and it's not just love for other Christians but for nonChristians as well. And we don't just gather together and praise God so that we may be saved but we continually strive to be closer to God and bring others closer to God and further from the devil and to CREATING RECONCILIATION AND JUSTICE in the world working alongside the devilish as well as the saintly.Remember that scene where Duvall drags the guy out of the bar? It reminds me that there are those who say there's the world of the devil and the world of God and we should steer clear of the former. However I think it's a world we need to engage and learn about we need to be in those bars not just dragging men out but learning why they're in. We need to figure out about why men really go to strip clubs why women work there WHY women abort their children WHY teens have premarital sex WHY divorce occurs and not just dismiss them as things of Satan to be steered clear of. Good fences do not make good Christians.Now if the worlds of The Apostle and The Ice Harvest could be combined that would be a very powerful movie about Jesus in the real world. I will say though that the last bit of the Apostle SPOILER is a great reminder of Duvall's power he continues to preach even as a prisoner on a chain gang. Now THAT is Holy Ghost Power. Amen. Continue to seek Him praise Him serve Him and love Him!".

It takes the main teaching of the Christian faith that we are all sinners yet through Jesus Christ we are all forgiven and paints an eloquent story of a real man's faith and how difficult it can be to believe so powerfully. Bobby Duvall is spectacular in a role that must have been important to him. All the technical aspects of the film follow in the footsteps of the fantastic script. The cinematography is beautiful as are the rich southern locations. The actors that comprise the congregation are all so full of life that it makes one wonder if they are acting at all. The opening scene where Sonny Mr. Duvall's character stops at the scene of an accident to be with a dying man is sublime. I highly recommend this film especially for anyone of any faith that appreciates the power of faith and spirituality.".

	schema:reviewBody "My opinion is very clear but not shared by many!This film is everything but erotic and the overkill on editing made it look like an MTV video clip instead of what it should have been a porno. The cast including Jenna acted totally uninspired. The sex boring without intensity looked staged and at times unreal. I like to watch sex that expresses something like passion but here I watched people having sex for money. This was not fing on the job but fing as a job. There was a lack of enthusiasm I seldom witnessed in a porno and grounded in porno as I am as I have seen a few thousand films in 17 years this really shocked me. From Jenna and her crew I expected something extraordinary beautiful but instead I watched the opposite. Most negative things about this production are the constant interruptions caused by the numerous cuts and filmtricks and the really terrible lighting too dim  too bright. It distracted my attention from the sex and that is something which only happens to me if the sex is not hot enough.Or in this particular case Mr Willy didn't move an inch!The many experiments spoiled my appetite. What could have been a first class porno turned out to be a boring film with an unmotivated cast. This film is no masterpiece and therefore it deserves no high marks. This feature is what I would call a very cheap copy of an Andrew Blake production. Andrew Blake however knows to combine sex art and editing in a way Jenna Sterling and their team have to learn.Performing a porno is totally different from directing and editing one. Fortunately more people also editors at major studios shared my thoughts and therefore there must be some truth in what I write.With the reputation of Justin Sterling the raw video materials must have been good there's no doubt about that but due to the artistic mindsideas of both editors Jenna Jameson and her finance Mr Sterling the real attention was not paid to the sex as it should have been but they did focus everything on the cast and the settings.This film is the first of a series and in my view the experiment already failed. Some people only like the movie as it shows them Jenna after having been away for two years. As a film critic I only look at the end result and not at the cast. Despite of being a fan the film could not convince me and is in my view the third worst production she made. Phantasm because of the sex and Wicked Weapon as it is also shows an overkill on editing.I voted this film with 1 for one reason only it has absolutely nothing which excites me. As a Jenna fan since 1993 I feel disappointed about this production and hope that the next in these series are much much better.Some people may see this negative review as an attack but I only wrote about what I felt watching this movie disappointment and no excitement.Yours trulySpetz".

I'm a big fan of both Jenna Jameson and Briana Banks and I really had high hopes for this one. But unfortunately the director messed up big time.The biggest problem with this one is the editing. Usually it is the hot sluts who suck the most in a porno movie. But here it is the editing who sucks the most and that is not a good sign. The editing is all over the place and we don't get to see a single scene that is good in this one. They have also messed up the sound so we don't get to hear the sweet moaning of Jenna and Briana either without interruptions.The sad thing is that this would have been a good porno without the horrible editing. Jenna and Briana both looked good from the little we get to see in this one.I would not recommend this porno to anyone. This is the only porno so far that I have given a 1 out of 10 and it totally deserves it. What really gets me mad is when I listened to the audio commentary on the DVD and heard that the director and Jenna were actually proud of making this piece of shit. It's like they have no clue about what the audience wants to see. Everybody stay away from this garbage.".

	schema:headline " A motion picture that celebrates the art of survival the gift of laughter and the miracle of friendship.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Boys on the side' is a very touching movie that looks essentially at what it means to be a woman trapped inside a man's world. It also shows that friends really do stick together through thick and thin. With the three leading ladies in roles that are really well written here is a classy 'chick flick' that one guy really likes. It also looks into what it means to be sick which I have been no stranger too either....Three women sharing a car going west team up in this winning celebration of camaraderie caring and friendship which quickly becomes a family in 'Boys on the Side'. One is a wisecracking club singer one is a finicky realestate agent and one is a free spirit. Each has secrets to reveal strengths to impart and vital moments of selfdiscovery awaiting. Now is their time.What a fine cast for such a dramatic movie. The three main girls in 'Boys on the side' include the 'lesbo' Jane Whoppi Goldberg Robin well acted by the talented MaryLouise Parker who is being helped to drive across America by Jane and the fun loving and partly liberated Holly Drew Barrymore. All these women are amazing in their roles.I love how Jane stands up for herself and her sexuality in addition to the fine music she can sing. Robin is a girl hiding a big secret but we are aware that her life has not been an easy ride which seems ironic because of what the movie shows. Then what Holly is enduring is quite staggering being involved with a brutal man Nick Billy Wirth that no woman should have to put up with. It is Holly's great personality and character that turn these best friends into a very closenit family. Her situation is not as easy as it seems either.While men are not talked about in a very good light in the film we do see some men that are decent to these women. Robin admits to having a thing for barman and on the road trip she meets up with Alex James Remar a caring barman who is really hooked on Robin. The way their relationship goes is an interesting aspect of the movie. James had an interesting character in HBO's 'Sex and the city'. Holly with such a bubbly personality meets a cop cutely named Abe Lincoln Matthew McConaughey. He dearly loves Holly wants her as his wife so she can live a life that can be happy and troublefree. I am interested in seeing McConaughey's latest film titled 'How to lose a guy in 10 days'.The director of BOTS was Hebert Ross from the brilliant 80's movie Steel Magnolias. He is a very game sort of director and does not shrug away from any of the important issues within the film. I love how he brought out the movie's main themes of sex and sexuality gay and straight the empowerment of women friendship sickness humour and what it means to be a family.But the movie's story was also a highlight from where I viewed it. Written by Don Roos it was very touching and emotional but also holds a large amount of subtle clever humour. The way he wrote the three main characters was terrific with them all having very different situations for us to learn about. This I believe allows us to fall in love with each one of them. The use of quick flashbacks is another aspect that was well written into the screenplay by Roo's as were some of the lines in BOTS which are unforgettable. Lines like when Holly asks Robin at the dinner table We're you?' in reference to her and Jane having a sexual relationship the next few lines are great. The title of the film was well thought up considering the line that Robin's mother says to her daughter You can't fight nature God knows you women keep trying treating your men like side dishes stick a fork in when needed just like men used to treat us.' That line is basically what the film is all about.Another great part to this film was its soundtrack. It was not only clever to incorporate it via one of the movie's characters that of Jane it makes the whole movie all the more compelling. Whoppi Goldberg and Mary Louise Parker sing a fine solo of the Roy Orbison classic 'You got it'. Then for the movie to have another performer actually sing the song I found to be just original as some films would just throw in the old song but not here. Another ironic part of the soundtrack is a song written and sung by known lesbian Melissa Etheridge titled 'I take you with me'. I am sure that the powers behind this movie wanted such a performer considering one of the main characters in the film was also gay.I watched this film just a few weeks after seeing a movie that I am sure inspired the writer of the script that being 'Thelma and Louise'. Parts of 'Boys on the side' has a similar feel to 'Thelma and Louise'  that of women on a road trip trying to break free of men's hold on them. While a lot of the film is original it has a very touching ending to what can only be described as a very emotional movie. I also feel that director Herbert Ross allows us to experience what each character is going through in life and does not shrug away from any issues that other movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack 'Boys on the side' is a movie that we can all learn from to try and improve not only our friendships that we have but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side' 4 Very Good Film".

I am sure that the powers behind this movie wanted such a performer considering one of the main characters in the film was also gay.I watched this film just a few weeks after seeing a movie that I am sure inspired the writer of the script that being 'Thelma and Louise'. Parts of 'Boys on the side' has a similar feel to 'Thelma and Louise'  that of women on a road trip trying to break free of men's hold on them. While a lot of the film is original it has a very touching ending to what can only be described as a very emotional movie. I also feel that director Herbert Ross allows us to experience what each character is going through in life and does not shrug away from any issues that other movies might simply try and avoid. With a cleverly incorporated soundtrack 'Boys on the side' is a movie that we can all learn from to try and improve not only our friendships that we have but how we live our lives in a world that can be cruel harsh and unfair.CMRS gives 'Boys on the side' 4 Very Good Film";

The faces which Barrymore pulls to dramatize her part will keep you laughing e.g whilst on the Greyhound bus whilst in labor.  Moreover this film shows that Barrymore can not only play the slutty seductive parts e.g The Amy Fisher Story Poison Ivy but a role which mixes both.    What will surprise you about this comedy and tear jerker is that it's not as predictable as you may except.  Although the story line is simple there are always the odd parts which you don't expect. The fight at the beginning with Nick will keep you shocked and probably laughing. It's definitely a chick flick although the guys may drool over a blonde Barrymore.  However the actor who plays Abe Lincoln is an eye catcher.This is not one of Whoopi Goldberg's best roles and I didn't think her part as the lesbian was believeable yet she did display both strength and humor to keep you interested.  Mary Louise Parker was excellent and her performance was on line with her part.Definitely a movie for a Barrymore fan and if you need a heart warming movie to keep you interested at night.

	schema:headline " A Testament to Female Friendship";
	schema:reviewBody "A rare and lovely movie focusing on female friendship Boys On the Side explores 3 women the way they sabotage themselves and how they love each other anyway. MaryLouise Parker is Robin an uptight real estate agent dying of AIDS. She wants to make a crosscountry trip from New York to California one that she made as a child and now holds sacred as it was shortly before her younger brother died. Whoopie Goldberg is Jane a black lesbian singer who also wants to go to California in hopes of getting more work. A stop in Pittsburg introduced Drew Barrymore as Holly an adorable ditz with blond corkscrew curls and an indomitably upbeat view on life. When Jane and Robin arrive she's being beaten up by her drugdealer boyfriend Nick. Violence insues and they take off leaving him tied up. Unfortunately Holly hit him a bit too hard with a baseball bat and he croaks. No one will miss the loser except his customers and Holly who is far too forgiving for her own good. There is some talk of going to the police but in the end they decide that it's good riddance to bad rubbish. They continue with the trip until they are stopped in Tucson by Robin's bought of pneumonia. And in Tucson they stay with Jane getting work at a local bar Robin getting involved with the bartender that works there and Holly who is pregnant maybe by Nick or maybe not falls in love with a cop named of all things Abe Lincoln. Relationships get more complicated from there with the director keeping a firm eye on the interaction of women as friends. I don't really have any sympathy over the darth of strong or likable male characters in this movie largely due to the fact that I've seen dozens with half a five main male characters and one female sexpot. That's the standard and it's both amusing and irritating when guys grumble or scream when someone has the audacity to make a movie where that is reversed. This is a movie made about women for women. One woman will be punished one will be forgiven one will more or less die and one will be born before the movie ends. You won't be sad to see it end it's exactly the right length but you will be both satisfied and perhaps a bit meloncholic.".

Relationships get more complicated from there with the director keeping a firm eye on the interaction of women as friends. I don't really have any sympathy over the darth of strong or likable male characters in this movie largely due to the fact that I've seen dozens with half a five main male characters and one female sexpot. That's the standard and it's both amusing and irritating when guys grumble or scream when someone has the audacity to make a movie where that is reversed. This is a movie made about women for women. One woman will be punished one will be forgiven one will more or less die and one will be born before the movie ends. You won't be sad to see it end it's exactly the right length but you will be both satisfied and perhaps a bit meloncholic.";

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't seen this film since it was in theaters almost 20 years ago but it is currently in heavy rotation on a cable movie channel. It has not aged well influenced by popular 80s films like Thelma and Louise Fried Green Tomatoes or Steel Magnolias  female pal movies that were much better than this one.In fact MaryLouise Parker is pretty much reprising the same exact role from Fried Green Tomatoes only in contemporary dress. There is even an identical lesbian angle Parker is the pretty straight girl who has a lesbian who adores her futilely. My guess is that for most women being adored by a mannish lesbian is not very flattering but creepy and you wouldn't go on to hang around with that person as your bestie  you'd avoid them.Drew Barrymore is about 20 years old here and just adorable with a mop of curly hair. There is also Matthew McConnaughey in his first role as a straight arrow cop who loves Drew. And of course Whoopie Goldberg basically playing herself  she simply has no range at all. Her character is not very convincing as a lesbian it seems like a plot device. She too is reprising her role from Sister Act  the flamboyant lounge singer.So though the actresses are all quite attractive and there is some cute snappy dialog amongst them the plot structure is ridiculous. Whoopie is driving from NYC to LA and needs someone to share gas expenses in a minivan? and MaryLouise joins her. They pick up Drew who is running away from an abusive boyfriend whom she accidentally murders. On the way MaryLouise's AIDS flares up so they stop and STAY FOREVER in Tucson  where none of them have roots or family or any reason to be there.Amazingly they are able to rent a huge adobe MANSION in the remote desert ??? though none of them has money or a job and one is pregnant and one is dying of AIDS. How do they pay for this? It's like a 3 million dollar palazzo. BTW I've been to Tucson and it is staggering hot desert country something you'd never glean from the film  it's like they picked Tucson by throwing a dart at map blindfolded  for starters it is NOT on the way from NYC to LA but hundreds of miles out of the way.Let me repeat none of them have real jobs or health insurance yet it's no problem to rent a huge house constantly filled with hundreds of friends  in a strange city  and lavish parties. It's all about bonding between these 3 very different women who honestly have nothing in common and one is dying and another has a deeply creepy crush on her.There is a timeline here set by Drew's character's pregnancy  she is visibly pregnant as soon as they are in Tucson and has her baby near the end so the whole film must be happened in under 7 months and more likely 34 months. Yet it is very clear in the plot that over a year goes by  the longest pregnancy in history. Furthermore it ends up that Drew's baby is fathered by some black guy who is never mentioned in the plot at all. Matthew recovers from this shock in a nanosecond and presumably marries her anyways.In short this is less about female friendship than pure science fiction. These are not dear friends but casual acquaintances from a road trip and their stayover in Tucson makes zero sense plotwise or commonsense wise. Most treasured friendships evolve over a lifetime of shared experience  not forced through contrived shortterm events. It's beyond obvious this was written and directed by men.".

Beyond the  at first sight  simple plot hides unexpectedly deep and complex characters brought to life in stunning acting performances by Whoopi Goldberg MaryLouise Parker Drew Barrymore and cameo Anita Gillette.

The few male characters in the movie are as the title indicates kept on a side track though they are of great importance to the development of the three women.However what I like the most about Boys On The Side is its delicate mixture of humor and drama taking you on an emotional journey with equal room for laughs and tears. With charm warmth and wits this movie gives you a story about love friendship solidarity and discovering the true values in life as it also treats delicate issues like homosexuality and AIDS in a nonoffensive way that most people will be able to relay to.Another successful addition to this fantastic movie is the soundtrack which is a carefully selected collection of songs performed by strong female artists i.e. Sheryl Crow The Cranberries Annie Lennox Pretenders and more.Boys On The Side may not be the perfect movie for a romantic evening with your boyfriend but as a girls' movie on a night out with your friends it is highly recommendable.

This film may be a bit soapy and seems more like a Lifetime film but this soapiness enhances the drama. This film may also be a little more on the feminist side but I didn't mind that much since women are equal to men and should have their stories told as well.Herbert Ross's film is about a wisecracking club singer an uptight saleswoman and a young free spirit all joining crossroads so they can travel crosscounty from New York to California.The acting is very good. Whoopi Goldberg actually proves me wrong by showing she can be a good actress. MaryLouise Parker has some very powerful scenes and should have been nominated an Oscar. Drew Barrymore is also very good and she seems to be my kind of girl.Overall this is very powerful film about womenhood and some of the problems they face. People call this a chick flick but is it really? I think guys should watch this film in order to gain a higher appreciation of women. This film is about bonds that will never be forgotten. I'm surprised how such a good movie this drama was. I rate this film 910.".

The lack of oversexed plots slower shots and relaxed pace are some of the things that make them great IMO.This is one of those films...like most Hindi films there are so many characters and stories going on all at once Note probably needs this to fill 3 hours. We see the main character Vijay Khanna a wiley funloving law student with idealist aims but a somewhat cowardly heart become transformed into a man who will become a great politician someday. In Hindi films character development happens so often through plot and a character's conduct rather than through dialogue...so different than Western films usually.We imagine that Khanna learned the courage and bravery he needs to be a hero for India as he is enmeshed and then untangles himself from a dark and violent political subplot he gets caught up in unexpectedly. The green young idealist becomes a veteranhero whose risked his life for love and justice albeit not necessarily because he wanted to but circumstances made it so.We also see a bit of this development in the heroine Sunita a young and innocent princess living a fairytale life who alongside Vijay becomes involved in the violence and corruption.The two undergo trials both as a couple in their commitment towards each other and in saving their own lifes from the politicalcriminals who are after them. By the end their love is forged into something much stronger than superficial beauty and physical attraction as we hope is Vijay's respect for the work of past leaders of the country and his commitment to continue their fight against injustice or in the present times against corruption.The picture we see of the masses in India was complicated. Their vote seems so important to politicians but we see how uninformed and easily swayed the masses are and how corrupt politicians are there. It was an uneasy picture. The film also exposes concepts of mob justice or mentality in India of community justice or vigilantism occurring in India as well. Lastly we see a dedicated father and mother in Vijay's family who on the one hand curse their son's immaturity early on but will go to any lengths to save him from the trouble he becomes involved in. Family loyalty has a hand in saving our hero...These are things I saw when digging deeper into the film but the seriousness is balanced against comedic moments and songs and dance scenes found in Bollywood films. It embraces multiple genres a political thriller a romance comedy and an action film.You can expect to see great sets like a grand ballroom and other beautifully recreated rooms inside and outside a palace a torture scene in a medieval dungeon and scenes filmed onsite at memorable locations in India the best one for me being the Taj Mahal love scene. The sets are very creative and wideranging and entertaining. So if you're a Westerner like me be prepared to put aside any expectation of realism in this film don't hope to watch anything similar to a Western film let go of any aversion you have to melodrama any desire for plausibility and finally remember the film is about 50 years old. If you can do that the film should be entertaining.Be prepared for those tinny sound tracks from old movies as well ".

	schema:reviewBody "A trend had started in Bollywood cinema during the late fifties which continued through the sixties that an entertaining flick was made by weaving the script around some melodious songs and beautiful locales and adding some comic and romantic punches to it. Thus a formulabased product was prepared to satisfy the entertainment appetite of the typical Bollywood viewer without caring two hoots for the story of the movie. And why not ? The typical Hindi cinema spectator has always wanted a formulaic entertainment lasting for around two and a half hours in which a dish is served to him with spices like comedy romance action music and dances being mixed in different proportions. And when the served dish is like that only why should it not become a box office grosser ? Today I am reviewing a movie which falls in the same league. Made by Sasadhar Mukherjee Joy Mukherjee's father and directed by his nephew Ram Mukherjee Raani Mukherjee's father this movie is Leader 1964 starring Dilip Kumar and Vyjayantimala in principle roles.The leader of our movie is a youth with multiple talents and multiple facets of his personality  Vijay Khanna Dilip Kumar who on one hand is the ringleader of some loafer boys and a fearless journalist on the other. He is a law graduate and that's why able to defend himself in any lawsuit filed against him in the court. He dislikes the selfish and ethicless politics being played in his country and can sing patriotic songs as well as deliver inspiring speeches at his will. And he is quite jolly as well as highly romantic also who falls in love with Sunita Vyjayantimala who is the princess of the erstwhile princely state of Shah Garh. Her brother is said to have been induced by Vijay Khanna as a member of his loafergang. However she is smitten by the charm of our allrounder hero who masquerades as an astrologer before her. With comic and romantic moments and classic songs the story moves ahead and the twist comes when Vijay is charged for the murder of a highly respected politician Motilaal. Sunita helps him in escaping and now both of them are on the run. All's well that ends well in the expected climax when everything is set right for them.I had watched this movie first on Doordarshan decades back in its complete form and watched it again recently on internet. First time I had watched it in complete form but now the version that I saw uploaded through Shemaroo VCD was a motheaten one with several scenes missing from that including that of the murder and the hero's getting reaching the spot. However the thing is that the movie contains a highly entertaining first half but loses its way in the later half. In the first half too the entertainment is illigical. You just keep your brains under lock and key to enjoy the nonsense comedy romance and patriotism. Logic coherence and connectivity is seriously missing here. Still the movie is quite entertaining. How ? Because of the comic timing and the romantic gimmicks of the legendary Tragedy King of Bollywood i.e. Dilip Kumar and his amazing onscreen chemistry with evergorgeous Vyjayantimala. Dilip Kumar does comedy quite effortlessly You cannot stop your laugh at his performance in many scenes in the opening hour of the movie. And then he romances also with equal proficiency. You know that whatever is being presented on the screen defies logic but you don't complain because the hero is entertaining you like anything. He won the Filmfare Best Actor award also for his performance in this movie.And then there is Vyjayantimala the great Bharatnatyam dancer as well as the highly beautiful Bollywood heroine whose onscreen chemistry with Dilip Kumar was always extraordinary may it be in Naya Daur 1957 or in Ganga Jamuna 1961 . Leader was the last movie done together by this beautiful pair and they win the heart of the audience in this movie also. Forget the logic and feel the romance which is tender emotional and striking a chord in any romantic heart.Naushad's outstanding music is a very big plus point of this movie which has ably supported the lead pair in taking this weak movie home. With the brilliant lyrics of Shakeel Badayuni and the great voices of Rafi Lata and Asha this legendary music director has composed unforgettable gems like Apni Aazaadi Ko Hum Hargiz Mita Sakte Nahin Daiya Re Daiya Laaj Mohe Laage Hameen Se Mohabbat Hameen Se Ladaai Mujhe Duniya Waalon Sharaabi Na Samjho Ek Shehenshaah Ne Banwa Ke Haseen Taaj Mahal and Aaj Hai Pyar Ka Faisla. My favourite two songs from this mesmerizing music album are  1. Tere Husn Ki Kya Tareef Karoon Kuchh Kehte Huye Bhi Darta Hoon and 2. Aajkal ShauqeDeedaar Hai Kya Kahun Aapse Pyar Hai which are in the enchanting voice of Mohammed Rafi which was perfect for Dilip Kumar. Aajkal ShauqeDeedaar Hai is picturized as a song being sung over telephone and Dilip Kumar's performance on that is both comic and romantic at the same time.This is a colour movie and the cinematographer has left no stone unturned in capturing the beauty of different locales. In the song Ek Shehenshaah Ne Banwa Ke Haseen Taaj Mahal he has captured the beauty of Taaj at Agra with a great amount of aestheticism. This movie is not only a musical and romantic treat but also a visual treat. Editing is bad but when the script itself was lackluster what could the poor editor do ? All in all Leader is an entertaining movie and was a box office hit of its time. Please don't look for any logic and enjoy the fun just like the hero of this movie.".

In the song Ek Shehenshaah Ne Banwa Ke Haseen Taaj Mahal he has captured the beauty of Taaj at Agra with a great amount of aestheticism. This movie is not only a musical and romantic treat but also a visual treat. Editing is bad but when the script itself was lackluster what could the poor editor do ? All in all Leader is an entertaining movie and was a box office hit of its time. Please don't look for any logic and enjoy the fun just like the hero of this movie.";

The creators of the film Zolushka 1947 Cinderella told this old story with so much tenderness humor kindness and style that it will be loved and watched by spectators of many generations past and future children and adults alike. Cinderella is the film of lasting and never aging charm. Its directing is effortless the familiar plot never fails to captivate the music by Antonio Spadavekkia is enchanting and absolutely fits the magic of the film. The old story is retold by Yevgeni Shvarts who also wrote the screenplays to the masterpieces of Russian Cinema To Kill a Dragon 1991 Ordinary Wonder 1978 Twelve Chairs 1977 and Don Quixote 1957 and he added the jokes that are still funny and biting after all these years. I just have to say a couple of words about acting. The best Russian actors of the time participated in the Cinderella. I would never forget a touchy but kind King Erast Garin tender and loving Zolushka Yanina Zhejmo who was 38 when she took a role but she was absolutely believable as 16 year old Zolushka and one of my favorite actresses of all time one and only Faina Ranevskaya as an evil but unforgettable Stepmother who believes that with her powerful connections she will rule the Magic Kingdom.".

The story is simply enchanting the Cinderella story is an old though timeless one but with Zolushka it doesn't feel that way the tale is told with freshness wit charm and warmth and all that by being faithful in spirit to the story. The two leads are great and utterly believable even when much older than their characters as has been said already and the stepmother is appropriately formidable while the fairy is nicely benevolent and the king is both regal and funny. The voices are also good. All in all really beautiful and any Soviet film or fairytalemusicalor both aficionado will be under its spellas corny as that sounds. 1010 Bethany Cox".

The step mother looks more like grandmother. The Two step sister could be her  Cinderella's  mother and aunt.And because the two step sister's were vying to be the wife of the prince would make it very campy by todays standard because of age differences. But I was surprised to discover that the actress who played Cinderella Yanina Zhejmo was born 1909 and the actor who played the prince Aleksie Konsovskywas born 1912 They didn't look that old. These actors might be dwarfs may be . They are taller than midgets and have youth appearance. The actors playing the rest of the roles were taller than them . I might be wrong about it.It's not impossible for people to have youthful appearances but they arn't tall neither.This moves designs and costumes were shot as if it was going to be shot in color. At that time AGFA color was now available in Russia whay didn't they use it ? This version the prince had a single parent. His mother the queen must have died . Although I don't understand Russian It had excessive talk. The king was a bad temper character  throwing his wig and crown off every time he lost his temper .It's still very campy by todays standards".

However the real winners here are the set designers and the costume makers.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an outstanding film and should be considered a landmark in Indian cinema. The subject matter is the 1947 partition of British India into India and Pakistan. The story is about a Muslim family in Agra and the central figure is that of Salim Mirza Balraj Sahni in his memorable last role. The film deals with the state of Muslims in the Hindu India immediately after the partition when the situation is full of anger and passion hence the name Garam Hawa meaning Hot Winds resulting from people uprooted out of the political decision to divide the land based on religion. While his brother sister and the older son decide to move on to Pakistan Salim Mirza stays in India to live and fight for his rights as a citizen. Along with him is his younger son who had just finished college at the time of the partition and he joins the activists demanding proper  just government of this new born democracy. The film is no doubt influenced by Satyajit Ray's work and of De Sica in use of actual locales using many nonprofessional actors and staying away from the trade mark Hindifilm song and dance numbers. Balraj Sahni is the main stay and delivers a superb performance although the supporting performances are equally wonderful. M.S. Sathyu as the director deserves to be remembered just on the basis on this single effort. Color cinematography is very good and the background of Taj Mahal in Agra and the old Mughal city of Fatehpur Sikri has been well used. Music by Sarode maestro Ustad Bahadur Khan adds to the value of this production. This film with English subtitles is now available on DVD in US and Canada. Definitely a mustsee.".

Directors like Ritwick Ghatak had also earlier dealt with the Partition of Bengal. But Garam Hawa made in 1973 marked the first time that a Hindi film director had handled the subject with so much sensitivity and realism.I went to the market to purchase a DVD copy. But alas!!..It was not available in the Indian market. It is such a sad situation that being a Indian movie it is not available in India!!!...if anyone who reads this and has any knowledge as to the address where i can buy a copy IN India please email me at the foll address vinamra88yahoo.com.I shall be ever grateful.".

In those hard times when the Indian government forced him to give up Ancestors home. Rejected by banks and Moneylenders for a loan worst of all accused of being spy. I was thinking how much time an honest man could stay in this intolerance political Environment?! Other actors done their job very well it's felt like director set cameras around normal people's life.One other thing I like about this Urdu movie that It's bittersweet Dialogues Usually I dont care abt it much. Some satire lines r so funny n heart breaking at the same time.The movie is great because there r many great moments like When mother refused to go away so Salim lift her to leave the house. It's hard to watch how Salim's big family left him one by one and immigrate Pakistan!Garm hava possibly most thought provoking movie abt that era. I could think of a reason why this movie is so controversial n why it has a limited release! It is an important movie to remind us our mistakes! 45 years have passed yet it's topic is still relevant!

	schema:reviewBody "This is another one of Maria Elena Velasco's starring as La India Maria and her clumsy antics. For those of you who have seen her previous works you will not be surprised as many of the same type of jokes and plots are repeated. The worst part is that unlike her previous movies you will fall asleep and will NOT laugh a single time.It's basically another TwinSwitch Prince and the Pauper with a twist of the My Fair Lady but also the Evil Greedy Gringo.  Let me give you a little introduction Many years ago a rich man was campaigning for mayor in a predominantly Native Indian in southern Mexico.  During one of his rallies a pregnant Indian not Hindu of course woman begins to give birth to twin girls but dies after doing so. Not as a gesture of humanitarianism the man adopts one of her daughters while the other one is raised by her relatives.  The adopted one grows up a very educated and cultured woman who creates her own party centered around Women's Rights.  She is now running as mayor of her town and is being successful but gets into an accident and falls into a coma.Her campaign strategists and friends are afraid she will have to forfeit the election but one of them remembers she had a twin sister and try to get her to take her place.  Eventually they succeed and win the election.The scene you will remember the most is when the Evil Greedy Gringos complete with cheesy Gringoaccented Spanish come to town and are trying to transform some Indian ruins and temples into an amusement park complete with a dancer who looks and dances like Micheal Jackson. What a ridiculous stereotype!  No wonder some Mexicans have that attitude against Americans! She as a Nationalistic Mexican refuses their offer.  Ironically she later quotes one of JFK's famous quotes but gives no credit.  Which one is it? See for yourself.I turned it off about 20 minutes after the Gringo scene as I expected nothing else besides more yawning.".

The worst part is that unlike her previous movies you will fall asleep and will NOT laugh a single time.It's basically another TwinSwitch Prince and the Pauper with a twist of the My Fair Lady but also the Evil Greedy Gringo.  Let me give you a little introduction Many years ago a rich man was campaigning for mayor in a predominantly Native Indian in southern Mexico.  During one of his rallies a pregnant Indian not Hindu of course woman begins to give birth to twin girls but dies after doing so. Not as a gesture of humanitarianism the man adopts one of her daughters while the other one is raised by her relatives.  The adopted one grows up a very educated and cultured woman who creates her own party centered around Women's Rights.  She is now running as mayor of her town and is being successful but gets into an accident and falls into a coma.Her campaign strategists and friends are afraid she will have to forfeit the election but one of them remembers she had a twin sister and try to get her to take her place.  Eventually they succeed and win the election.The scene you will remember the most is when the Evil Greedy Gringos complete with cheesy Gringoaccented Spanish come to town and are trying to transform some Indian ruins and temples into an amusement park complete with a dancer who looks and dances like Micheal Jackson. What a ridiculous stereotype!  No wonder some Mexicans have that attitude against Americans! She as a Nationalistic Mexican refuses their offer.  Ironically she later quotes one of JFK's famous quotes but gives no credit.  Which one is it? See for yourself.I turned it off about 20 minutes after the Gringo scene as I expected nothing else besides more yawning.";

	schema:reviewBody "Appaloosa is based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Robert B. Parker. It's directed by Ed Harris who also cowrites the story with Robert Knott. Harris also stars alongside Viggo Mortensen Rene Zellweger Jeremy Irons  Lance Henriksen. Music is by Jeff Beal and Dean Semler provides cinematography on location in Albuquerque Austin and Santa Fe.Appaloosa is in the grip of bully boy rancher Randall Bragg Irons who finally oversteps the mark when the latest Marshall and his deputies are killed in cold blood. The townsfolk decide enough is enough and hire no nonsense travelling lawmen Virgil Cole Harris and his sidekick Everett Hitch Mortensen to protect and serve the town. Ruling with a rod of iron Cole  Hitch start to bring order to Appaloosa but the arrival in town of pretty Allie French Zellweger causes quite a stir between the two men. Bad timing too since the guys are trying to get Bragg to his rightful execution.In the modern era the Western has been the hardest genre for film makers to tackle. You can probably count on one hand the number of great or agreeable ones that have surfaced post Costner and Eastwood's efforts of 1990 and 1992 respectively. Enter Ed Harris who undaunted by the long odds of getting a Western to be successful and suffering worrying overtures from his backers at New Line Cinema got Appaloosa made. Well made as it happens.Since the story itself is etched like the Wyatt Earp legend there's really no fresh perspective on offer here. In fact anyone familiar with Edward Dmytryk's excellent Warlock from 1959 will feel some narrative dj vu. But Appaloosa does have strong performances and lush landscapes to see it successfully home. Slotting in a good helping of action romance and humour also goes some way to making Harris' movie a worthy modern day Oater. True the cliche's are many but Harris wasn't after revisionism he wanted and got old fashioned Oater values. A film that follows those old beloved B movie Western conventions but one that still retains a topical criminal thread.The best reward in the film comes from spending time with Harris  Mortensen. Their characters are nicely drawn and not over cooked by the script. Cole  Hitch are devoted to each other lots of straight love and respect exists between the two men. Their bond is believably brought to life by Harris  Mortensen who formed a friendship when making A History Of Violence for David Cronenberg in 2005. Zellweger and Irons too are not without high merit value. She stepping in when Diane Lane walked over delays is pleasing and captivates in what is the critical glue role. While he is dandy dastardly supreme a well spoken villain of much intelligence and crafty as a cat.Appaloosa is a subtle film both in story and as a technical production. Beal's score is unobtrusive while Semler's photography manages to deliver that old fashioned feel that Harris was after the low lighting for the interiors is particularly on the money . Harris' direction is smooth and unhurried in pace with the odd inspired bit thrown in for good measure check out the uptilt camera work during a train on a bridge sequence. While the production design can't be faulted. All that and you got the likes of Henriksen and Timothy Spall in the support cast too. A lovely film that is as tight as the friendship at its core. 7.510".

The writing is solid the dialog sparked with humor the heroes are more than caricatures and cardboard cutouts the villains are worthy antiheroes and the backup is wonderful. The performances of Ed Harris Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons as the main protagantagonists are sterling. Harris is the lonely paladin uncompromising in his ethic drawn in by the warmth and softness of a needful woman artfully and convincingly played by Renee Zellweger Mortensen is the slightly jaded sidekick who both respects and doesn't completely understand his hero. A parallel villain is offered by Lance Henrikson a kind of poor man's Clint Eastwood giving an interesting twist to the story. Some comic relief is offered by veteran character actor James Gammon and fine British actor Timothy Spall without reducing the tension in the story line or reverting to a burlesque. The mythic theme of the knighterrant works well in this presentation brought to light by the competent direction of Ed Harris. My only fear is that it being devoid of ballettype ritual killings CGI and only a mild spattering of violence it will likely fly under the radar of much of today's theater goers which is a shame.

	schema:reviewBody "Films are made for us to escape to a new reality whether that reality be complete fantasy present day the future or in this case the good old West. What we have here is a great western that looks and feels like a classic in the making an old school western with an old school touch of directing and acting from Ed Harris. Appaloosa is very accessible in a film genre that isn't so accessible. It's a straightforward film that despite that never becomes predictable and formulaic. Harris's wonderful job on all fronts make Appaloosa one of the most complete films of the year. It's got it all great writing killer acting and a great atmosphere that allows the viewer to get trapped in this old western world.Set in 1882 New Mexico Appaloosa follows the fate of the town of the same name which has fallen into the control of a ruthless outlaw Jeremy Irons and the powers that be have hired new hands to take control of the situation Harris and Viggo Mortensen. However when a mysterious widow Renee Zellweger arrives in town loyalties will be tested friendships will be put on trial and guns will be fired.The strong point as I've said is Ed Harris who pulls the quadruple threat of acting directing writing and producing. Despite all the work he did on this film he still manages to turn in an Oscar worthy performance as the steadfast and unwavering commander of the town. Harris is subtle nuanced and never out of control. He commands the screen every time he's on it without yelling or doing anything too crazy. Viggo Mortensen's near silent performance is not short on talent either as one of silent acting's kings continues to show incredible versatility the guy is a fantasy king Russian mobster and now an old west Deputy Marshall. To complete the trifecta of greatness Jeremy Irons is the only guy I can imagine in the role of the film's villain. His freezing stare mixed with the icy cold voice he is most known for makes him one of the most memorable villains of the year.Renee Zellweger really didn't add anything to the movie though her character wasn't too interesting and just serves as a plot device. This is what keeps the film from getting that 10 from me. The rest of the supporting cast is really a nonissue as the story really only revolves around a few characters.What I enjoyed most about the film is that it really made me feel like I was out west...right down to the little details such as sandstorms the presence of Native Americans small drawls from the actors thankfully none besides Zellweger had a bad one and the different kinds of horses  guns in the film. Harris keeps the film moving nicely and there's only a few moments where I felt it dragged a bit. Like I've said it's hard to find a real fault here...the film is just well done all around from a production standpoint.When all is said and done I knew how I felt about this film the second the lights went on. I clapped and said that was great. Appaloosa is an old school western that has everything a fan of the genre could want...including a suspenseful and tense gunfight and crazy Native Americans on horses! It's definitely one of the most complete westerns and films I've seen this year and should be in contention for a few awards come Oscar season.".

As the novel as written the story is actually told through the eyes of Everett Hitch played here by Viggo Mortenson. I love the way even though he is somewhat of a sidekick he was allowed to remain the viewpoint character. My only complaint was Renee as Allie. Reading the book I visualized a Faye Dunaway at 35. Diane Lane would have been more in line with the way the character was written in the novel. Renne struck me as a little too coquettish and obviously needy rather than manipulative and needy. It's a matter of taste but I would have preferred it. However the rest of the casting was spot on and I hope Harris considers doing the sequel Resolution.".

This is entertainment the way I like it straight up without a lot of foolish over the top action. The real west must have been fraught with similar dilemmas as that confronting the town of Appaloosa What to do with a lawless band of men determined to live as they please by preying on timid town dwellers? I doubt there were many men like Virgil Cole or his partner Everett Hitch in the real west having lived among their great great grandchildren I've no idea what the real genealogy is for a time but men have often tried to live like they do with the result that they lived undeservedly short lives. Still guys like me can't get enough of their stories and Ed Harris apparently feels the same way. Only Clint Eastwood in my memory has attempted to tap into this same wellspring of folklore as in The Unforgiven. Though we all love Clint I'd have to say Ed outdoes him here. He's got a wonderful sense of what a real gunfight might have been like. And though he's trimmed off the cries of pain and the gore it still has the ring of truth.".

Viggo should have had two or three Oscars by now. His rendition of Everett Hitch made the whole movie more than worthwhile. He's a man of little words but great thought. He also an observant man of things and people. He's loyal but with practicality. He knows what the two of them do and why they do it and he know enough about Virgil not to step on his toes. But he also knows when to say what he as to say and leave it at that. I'm never that impressed by Renee Zellweger but in this movie she sort of fit in. 710".

	schema:headline " Compelling and Weird Western";
	schema:reviewBody "On the immediate surface Apaloosa occurs as an old school Western grounded in the battle of good against evil. For the most part first time director writer Ed Harris's Apaloosa is the traditional tale of gunslingers hired to protect the town against the malevolent rancher who terrorizes the town of Apaloosa. This slithery and wily Rancher is Randall Bragg well played by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons. Irons is amazing. In the opening Bragg Irons kills the town Marshall and his deputies in cold blood. So there is no question surrounding Bragg's character. Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch who are lawmen for hire. The town of Apaloosa signs a contract with Virgil and Everett paying them to protect the town from Bragg. As part of the deal Apaloosa surrenders legal jurisdiction and autonomy to Cole and Hitch. This is pretty straight forward until femme fatale widow Allison French Renee Zellwegger arrives in town. Virgil takes a quick fancy to Allison but her motives are vague and questionable at best. Will she threaten Virgil's partnership with Everett? First off I ultimately liked Apaloosa because Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Everett. Despite the movie's quirky idiosyncrasies Mortensen commands the heroic presence as the sensible man of honor. Mortensen is the Western hero in the tradition of Clint Eastwood. As Everett we always know where Mortensen stands and he is both charismatic and cool. In a great scene a rival asks Everett about Virgil's gun prowess. Everett says plainly I haven't seen anyone as good as Virgil. Mortensen's Virgil salvages the movie's sense of honor.As mentioned previously Apaloosa is not really all that traditional just below the surface. And this is not necessarily a good thing. This is not the antihero masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. In one sense I think Harris would like it to be. For one thing although Harris's Virgil is brave and noble he is an apparent partial nut job. He goes nonlinear on some hoods in a saloon among other weird out bursts. Harris's Virgil is not an educated man and clumsily forces his diction and stumbles through Emerson. Instead of coming off as charmingly eccentric his Virgil occurs as a little weird. Renee Zellwegger is an amazing actress but here she struggles to carry off pretty. Her character Allison also has the propensity to have sex with virtually any man with a pulse. Straight and narrow Virgil in love with psycho whore Allison is not the most conventional love story nor is it the story's most endearing plot line. Again this may be more artifact of the screenplay by Harris and Robert Knot based on Robert B. Parker's best selling novel.In spite of its quirkiness and kind of nutty characters Harris manages to reign in the movie as it concludes opting for the more heroic. There is a great scene before one the climatic showdowns where Allison asks Virgil and Everett Aren't either of you at all afraid? Virgil says I guess I don't think about that so much. Also in Apaloosa the action is not leveraged for the utmost drama. Director Harris's action sequences lack crispnessthe gun fight blocking is mostly single shot without any interesting angles. Aside from the last gun fight most of the action is diluted of high drama. The action is well done just not spectacular.Apaloosa is an amalgamation of the traditional Western with the idiosyncratic melodrama of the new. The overall effect is compelling and also makes you scratch your head. Viggo Mortensen's strong and charismatic performance as Everett Hitch eventually wins out and makes Apaloosa worth watching.".

	schema:headline " authentic and poignant western";
	schema:reviewBody "Appaloosa is a classic western and a sophisticated drama.Appaloosa unfolds at the right pace for a drama. The scale is intimate close and minimalist more like Tender Mercies or Hud than The Magnificent Seven. There is some action and a couple of very impressive gunfights but it is not an action movie. That's what I like about it. It is willfully and deliberately not an action movie. Why does everyone assume that a western must necessarily be an action movie? How refreshing to finally see a western that's a characterdriven drama and it is through character that it generates tension suspense and interest.Appaloosa is authentic because it's about stoic people living in harsh frontier conditions. These characters are maturely written and they behave in a credible 19th century way. The acting is deeply felt all around. Even Jeremy Irons who plays the corrupt rancher with political connections is accurate casting. The American west was full of English and Irish immigrants who participated in range wars county feuds and townsite disputes. I don't think I've ever seen a female lead quite like Mrs. Allie French in a western before. She's a complete original for a western and reminds me of the real women I read about in historical and biographical texts about the American west. I don't mind that she is played by Renee Zellwegger. Ed Harris and Viggio Mortenson deliver understated performances as towntamers who are loosely inspired by historical lawmen. These two actors play off of each other's nuances with alertness and selfdeprecating humor. The audiences can tell their friendship has been tested and we can believe they are only still alive because of their mutual trust. How their conflict plays out over Mrs. French works against our expectations of the genre. They both love Mrs. French despite her weaknesses. They will not hesitate to sacrifice for her but nothing can break the respect these two men have for each other. There is a refreshing gentlemanly quality to this bittersweet triangle that I haven't seen since the early westerns of Zane Grey.Appaloosa is authentic not only because of its characters but because it's filmed in New Mexico locations that are correct to the time and place in which the story is set. The scenery includes the old adobe pueblo of Rancho de los Golindrinas which western buffs may recognize from The Man From Laramie 1955 the antique narrowgauge railway near Chama and the pristine landscapes of Glen Hughes's Bonanza Creek Ranch below Santa Fe with its frontierera town set one of the oldest operating cowboy ranches in New Mexico. It's dusty and appropriately weathered and the cinematography by Dean Seamler is a pleasure. The filmmakers work hard to get props firearms and set dressings correct to the period. The actors work hard to capture the vernacular of western speech and they wear the right costumes and haircuts. They even stop to carefully reload their weapons instead of firing a ridiculous and endless number of bullets like in spaghetti westerns.The R rating is so unfair. There is one fourletter word and a foursecond shot of two bare behinds in the distance but that hardly merits an R rating. There's no gore and less violence than in most PG films. This is the kind of mature drama and appreciative Americana that adolescents need to see at the movies.Ed Harris has made a kind of acoustic folk ballad of a western. There is no cgi no cartoonish action. Nothing is faked everything is real including the weather. The train rattles and the wind blows inside because it really rattles and the wind really blows inside the cars. A lot of attention is paid to authentic sounds and visual textures of the period. Don't miss Appaloosa when it comes your way. Go to see it expecting an authentic western drama that credits you with intelligence and appeals to your intelligence.

	onyx:emotionText "Appaloosa is a classic western and a sophisticated drama.Appaloosa unfolds at the right pace for a drama. The scale is intimate close and minimalist more like Tender Mercies or Hud than The Magnificent Seven. There is some action and a couple of very impressive gunfights but it is not an action movie. That's what I like about it. It is willfully and deliberately not an action movie. Why does everyone assume that a western must necessarily be an action movie? How refreshing to finally see a western that's a characterdriven drama and it is through character that it generates tension suspense and interest.Appaloosa is authentic because it's about stoic people living in harsh frontier conditions. These characters are maturely written and they behave in a credible 19th century way. The acting is deeply felt all around. Even Jeremy Irons who plays the corrupt rancher with political connections is accurate casting. The American west was full of English and Irish immigrants who participated in range wars county feuds and townsite disputes. I don't think I've ever seen a female lead quite like Mrs. Allie French in a western before. She's a complete original for a western and reminds me of the real women I read about in historical and biographical texts about the American west. I don't mind that she is played by Renee Zellwegger. Ed Harris and Viggio Mortenson deliver understated performances as towntamers who are loosely inspired by historical lawmen. These two actors play off of each other's nuances with alertness and selfdeprecating humor. The audiences can tell their friendship has been tested and we can believe they are only still alive because of their mutual trust. How their conflict plays out over Mrs. French works against our expectations of the genre. They both love Mrs. French despite her weaknesses. They will not hesitate to sacrifice for her but nothing can break the respect these two men have for each other. There is a refreshing gentlemanly quality to this bittersweet triangle that I haven't seen since the early westerns of Zane Grey.Appaloosa is authentic not only because of its characters but because it's filmed in New Mexico locations that are correct to the time and place in which the story is set. The scenery includes the old adobe pueblo of Rancho de los Golindrinas which western buffs may recognize from The Man From Laramie 1955 the antique narrowgauge railway near Chama and the pristine landscapes of Glen Hughes's Bonanza Creek Ranch below Santa Fe with its frontierera town set one of the oldest operating cowboy ranches in New Mexico. It's dusty and appropriately weathered and the cinematography by Dean Seamler is a pleasure. The filmmakers work hard to get props firearms and set dressings correct to the period. The actors work hard to capture the vernacular of western speech and they wear the right costumes and haircuts. They even stop to carefully reload their weapons instead of firing a ridiculous and endless number of bullets like in spaghetti westerns.The R rating is so unfair. There is one fourletter word and a foursecond shot of two bare behinds in the distance but that hardly merits an R rating. There's no gore and less violence than in most PG films. This is the kind of mature drama and appreciative Americana that adolescents need to see at the movies.Ed Harris has made a kind of acoustic folk ballad of a western.

	schema:reviewBody "Of recent times the only Western movie that I liked was Kevin Costner's 'Open Range'. Now there's another one 'Appaloosa' which is produced written directed and performed in by Ed Harris. The film pretty much has the ingredients of the 60s and 70s Western hits. It starts off a little slow but gradually picks up. 'Appaloosa' is more a comedy than an action but action movie lovers need not worry because there is plenty of that too all 60's Western style. The dialogue is great and some of them are laugh out loud. The desert and mountainous visuals are stunning to look at. The two lawenforcement heroes are brilliantly played by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Harris is totally hilarious yet we sympathize for him when he falls hopelessly in love with the promiscuous nevertobefaithful Ali. Mortensen is more restrained reminding one of Clint Eastwood at times but equally effective. I initially thought Renee Zellweger was cast as the typical love interest but man was I wrong. Here she is cast against type and the actress is simply great as she deceptively uses those innocent sweet girl looks to mask her frivolity and promiscuity. Likewise Jeremy Irons is an excellent villain with a touch of comedy. Lovers of Western cinema wold enjoy this. This is most of all Harris's achievement as he scores high on all counts. Hope he makes more movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Westerns go this is probably more typical than I would have liked. Though a very fine actress I believe that Zellweger was the not right person for this particular part. She is great at loves stories but there was no love in this move between the characters  just a relationship of convenience. The movie would have actually been much better if the womanmarshal relationship had been totally cut out but then it wouldn't have been true to the book. Unfortunately it just wasn't handled well and most viewers will see the weakness. You really felt no connection between the good guys and the bad guys  you really didn't care if any of them live or die. In fact the relationship between the characters is so tenuous that it sometimes seems there is none  just actors reading their lines. The problem was not the actors but the script and the connection to the audience. I knew it was somewhat of a dud when I started falling asleep toward the end and missed part of the movie. Considering I started watching it at 1230 P.M. this says more about the movie than words can tell. I am reminded that in the movie Aliens James Cameron did not shoot the scenes where the Marines are coming out of hibernation until the very end of the movie because he wanted them to have real camaraderie  which you feel between the characters. That is what this movie is missing from beginning to end  Camaraderie. It is just seems like scripts being read which is too bad because you want a villain to hate and the good guy to love. You neither hate nor love in this movie  you just kind of drift off".

	schema:reviewBody "I have always adored Westerns. My love affair with the genre started when I was about five years old and began watching Bonanza. A dining room chair became my horse as I rode the dusty plains of our house in a dull London suburb the chair festooned with string reins and stirrups Little Joe stirring my prepubescent heart. Bonanza was followed by Wagon Train reruns of Gunsmoke then The Virginian Lancer and The High Chaparral. At the theatre Clint Eastwood reigned supreme I read Zane Grey and I absorbed High Noon The Searchers Liberty Vallance and just about anything else on TV involving a horse and a man in a Stetson. Sad really Then I took up horse riding for real and knew without a shadow of a doubt that I'd been born the wrong sex and a hundred years too late. I should have been a cowboy.So I went to see Appaloosa ready to enjoy it. To be honest this film would have had to be a complete dog not to get at least 810 from me. And Appaloosa is a Western of the best kind peopled by taciturn men women with a past unshaven outlaws with big guns and simple but good hearted townsfolk. Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole a gun for hire lawman while Viggo Mortensen is his sidekick Everett Hitch a man of few words but a very very big gun. Hired to clean up a small town in New Mexico the Appaloosa of the title Cole and Hitch take on Randall Bragg a wonderfully grizzly Jeremy Irons the local bad guy. Cole and Hitch are best buddies who cover each other's backs but the appearance of Mrs French Renee Zellweger in town threatens to distract them from the job in hand. After arresting Bragg for murder and seeing him tried and found guilty Cole and Hitch set off to take him to jail but when Mrs French is kidnapped they are forced to release Bragg in exchange and then to track the outlaws and the captive woman across country. Mrs French's morality is called into question  she will give her loyalty and her sexual favours to whoever she perceives as being Top Dog but Cole weighs up the pros and cons and decides he loves her anyway. After all she bathes every night. Appaloosa tries to show the importance of the friendship between the men policing this tough frontier land and the survival skills of the women who could never compete with the men physically but must try and make their own lives bearable. The story is fairly simple and as in all the best Westerns it's a morality play where good and evil exist in plain view where life is lived in black and white. Bragg is a murderer and a bully who has the town in his thrall Cole and Hitch kill too but where Bragg kills the defenseless and those who get in his way Hitch and Cole kill in the name of the law and prefer to arrest the baddie and send him for trial trying to impose order on an untamed land. But the introduction of the alluring Mrs French with her wavering loyalties introduces more complex shades of grey to the scene. It tests the men's loyalty to each other and suggests that we do whatever we have to do to survive in a world with no safety nets. I liked Zellweger in the part she is attractive and sexy but doesn't play it as ridiculously beautiful or stick thin. She is attractive enough to turn heads in this small town but doesn't look unrealistic. We know that any woman of truly stunning beauty would not be in this situation she'd have been snapped up long before. Zellweger brings an air of brave and slightly knowing vulnerability to the role rather than girly helplessness. She's a survivor not a princess waiting to be swept off her feet for happy ever afters. In the end Hitch does what a man must do to protect his friend and as in all the best Westerns rides off alone into the sunset.Directed by Harris Appaloosa's beautifully shot the landscape of New Mexico is stark and harsh. The dialog is very well written and often suffused with dry humour all the performances are well nuanced and I got the feeling it was a labour of love for all concerned. I thoroughly enjoyed it might even buy the DVD a rarity for me! and Ed Harris seems to be shaping up as an interesting director. My only slight comment might be that Viggo Mortensen plays yet another enigmatic man of few words. How often have we seen him do this now? Appaloosa Eastern Promises Hidalgo LOTR even his first role in Witness all men full of meaningful silences and deep thoughts. I'm not saying I don't like these roles I do. But I'd love to see him do something totally off the wall.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a nonfan of the Western genre I must say I enjoyed this film! And despite the fact that Appaloosa New Mexico is actually almost 2000 miles from the REAL Palouse a prairie region on the WashingtonIdaho border and the source for the name of the famous horse breed a Palouse horse and eventually appaloosa horse I got the sense of more or less authentic period settings.One thing absent from this movie which I found refreshing was the lack of the old school movie logic of the tragic hero and the whole Western theme. Those themes were fine I guess back in the day early in TV and way back in cinema history. But those themes also ring a bit false overly dramatic in fact melodramatic and as fake and sugary in their way as any Doris Day or Rock Hudson movie.This film's theme seemed to me to be about how I'd do it. That doesn't make it real nor better of course. But it did for me ring true. Despite the Clint Eastwood  Steve McQueen  Yul Brenner history in movies actual history not the sensationalised 1800's novels and tabloid stories written by Easterners who never even visited the old west let alone reported anything real is closer to THIS film's portrayal.The ending was just right SPOILER the bad guy was killed simply and without fanfare. The hero buddies made the inevitable decision to part ways but realistically. And the whores continued to ply their trades I am referring to the professional whore whose name I didn't catch and the de facto whore played by Renee Zellwegger. Kind of mundane. Not heroic or poetic or pretty BUT exactly as I and maybe you would have done.Superb acting all around makes this a pure pleasure to watch!".

And despite the fact that Appaloosa New Mexico is actually almost 2000 miles from the REAL Palouse a prairie region on the WashingtonIdaho border and the source for the name of the famous horse breed a Palouse horse and eventually appaloosa horse I got the sense of more or less authentic period settings.One thing absent from this movie which I found refreshing was the lack of the old school movie logic of the tragic hero and the whole Western theme.

My only criticism was the roles played by Mortensen and Irons.Both very fine actors but this was a buffer for both of them. Viggo Mortensen did not to me come across as a tough guy lawman. I thought Lance Henrickson would have been more suited. When i saw on the credits that Jeremy Irons was to play the bad guy i thought again another English Actor playing the villain. A bit like Michael Gambon in Open Range which was a better movie and played by veteran Western Actors Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner.The problem with Irons was he was playing an American character but sometimes you could hear his English accent coming through. Ed Harris was flawless. I was impressed by the fact this was his first Western. Not a bad movie but i was disappointed with Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons especially as i am a fan of their works. For something to watch for a Saturday evening it is fine but don't expect a classic.".

Widow Allison French shows up and you think there is going to be a love triangle but there really wasn't much of one. She takes a liking to Cole but also gives Hitch mixed singles.

The side plot involving Allison is she seems to go after any man with power.

You would think that with an allstar cast an Ed Harris playing in another movie that he directed that it would soar and be a great flick. CNN.com said it was one of the best movies of 2008.Trust me after watching this movie if you spent 20 on you and another person you are going to want a refund.The positives are that the scenery is gorgeous the set is fairly accurate and the actors are first rate.Unfortunately the story is weak. Without giving away too much in the way of spoilers Ed Harris' character apparently wants revenge for the murder of a fellow colleague. And yet he is willing to be with a woman who apparently will sleep with anyone who comes across as the Alpha Male in any group. She flirts with everyone sleeps with several men and gives no reasoning as to why she behaves in this self destructive way.The plot surrounding Ed Harris revenge is very weak. The gun fights are over too quickly and there is too much drivel in this story. I realize that gun fights accurately aren't going to be that long but there is no build up in any of the action sequences. There's no explanation as to why Ed Harris would care so much as to why one particular college's death would matter so much to him especially when he seems to eager and nonchalant about killing others.Viggo Mortensen plays the reserved quiet but educated partner. And yet for some reason despite having sat through the entire movie never even raising his voice he decides to have a gun battle with the protagonist in this movie and rides off into the sunset.I gave the movie a 2 because at least the actors are top rate big names and the photography is decent. But the bottom line is you will regret paying much to watch this movie. I would wait until it is in the cheap section and you have watched all the other movies this fall and winter and are desperate for something else. Ed Harris really needs to go back to the drawing board with this one.".

It has the feel of being quite a personal film to him perhaps most notable with the bizarre end credits sequence and maybe he is quite fond of westerns himself. You have to wonder then why he's delivered such a bland and unremarkable piece that simply goes where you expect it to and offers little in the way of surprises. Appaloosa simply offers what any Clint Eastwood western from the '50s or '60s would have given you without any particular flair or style. With material so weak none of the cast deliver any exceptionally brilliant performances with Harris Mortensen Zellweger and even a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall all just going through the motions. Irons reappears out of nowhere as the baddie but his over dramatizing just makes things even weaker.There are one or two plus points. The cinematography and sweeping western landscapes are at times breath taking and beautiful and it's made with just enough affection and panache to mark it out.

Just seeing the Gothic Woolworth building when it was still the tallest structure in the world or hearing Tony's reaction to meeting a girl named April an unusual name at the time is a priceless history lesson in itself.Even if you aren't interested in any of those elements it's a touching timeless welltold story ... and it's available now on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "If any film clearly illustrates how the socalled 'PreCode' films differ from the postcode lot this one is it. In 1934 the Production Code governing what is acceptable and unacceptable in films was greatly changed. No longer were obscenities nudity adultery extreme violence or premarital sex tolerated in filmsand the films were now heavily sanitized. Among the many precode films I have seen Applause is probably one that would never have been allowed to be made due to this rules change. However the film would have been banned simply because of the setting of the film and a few obscenities would have been eliminatedbut the film believe it or not is not a 'dirty' filmthough I wouldn't take preschoolers to see it! The film begins with Kitty Darling Helen Morgan working in a Burlesque house. Back in that day that meant lowbrow comics dancing girls and strippers. She learns that her husband's appeal on Death Row has been deniedand she is left pregnant and anticipating raising a kid on her own. As the years pass it's obvious that Kitty loves April played as an adult by Joan Peers but she also seems a bit dim and unaware that this is NOT the best environment. So reluctantly she sends April off to a convent school where she lives for the next decade or more.Time passes. Kitty is now middleaged and still 'dancing'. But in the meantime she's begun shacking up with a Burlesque comic with a heart of lead. He simply wants to use her and when she tells him she's having difficulty paying for April's schooling he insists she bring her back to the Burlesque houseespecially since April is now a goodlooking teen. And soon it becomes very apparent that this boyfriend is very interested in April....way too interested. But mom being a bit foolish and dim doesn't seem to see it...or perhaps she's just living in denial.This horrid jerk of a boyfriend insists that April also needs to dance they never say strip....I think it's implied. April is a nice kid and not at all comfortable with this lifebut will do anything her mom says. And Kitty is like putty in her boyfriend's hand...and prompts April to get to work.Later in the film you see the sleazebag boyfriend attempt to molest April. However a niceguy sailor comes along and saves hersocking the jerk and taking her out for a nice even together. Soon the two are headoverheels in love and when the sailor boy soon asks her to marry him April is faced with a tough choice. Should she stay with her motherafter all she is just getting to know her once again. Or should she leave this sordid life and marry? It all is decided in a very dramatic and satisfying mannereven if a tad predictable which it probably wasn't back in 1929.Despite very sordid material the film is not really salacious often leaving a lot to the imagination and is fine for a wide audience. Plus after all the film emphasizes that April is a good young lady and her religious values leave her feeling conflicted. A nice morality tale and an excellent film for 1929. What I mean by that is that the sound is poor because the system was so new and the bugs hadn't been worked out yet. It's a darn shame then that Kino Video did NOT choose to include DVD captions. It was understandable but you have to struggle. However the print is in excellent condition. Strong points are the script with hints at such films as Madame X Stella Maris and Mildred Pierce and style of the movieit's very good even more than 80 years later. Deficits are of course the sound. And in addition the acting is occasionally a bit rough and the story not perfect April's sudden desire to stay with Mom and her molester boyfriend really didn't make sense. But overall the positives way outweigh the negatives.By the way this is not meant to be mean but I appreciated how the film portrayed the dancers and strippers. They were NOT the least bit attractiveoften looking very hard quite chunky and not particularly glamorous. I think this served to make the film both realistic it could be a harsh life unless you were a major star and repulse the audiencea good choice in hindsight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Made in 1929 this film was directed by Robert Mamoulian and features some pioneering camera work. Specifically the static camera of other 1929 films is absent here. Mamoulian does some of this by shooting part of the picture silent with sound dubbed over it such as in the scene where Kitty first arrives in New York and the camera follows her line of sight as she looks around the hustle and bustle of Grand Central Station. In scenes with lots of motion that have dialogue Mamoulian has the players walking away from the camera so he can dub in the dialogue unsynchronized to the players' actual speech. If you didn't know how he did this you wouldn't notice it.If you are expecting to see Helen Morgan the torch singer doing the same type of act she did for Ziegfeld in his Follies you'll be disappointed. Instead be prepared to see Helen Morgan the actress in this one. Here Helen Morgan plays Kitty Darling a woman of burlesque whose husband is sent to the electric chair for killing a man in a fit of jealousy. Kitty gives birth to their daughter April at about the same time. Convinced by a friend that the burlesque backstage is no place for a child to grow up Kitty sends April to a convent school in Wisconsin. She remains there from age 5 to age 17.When April returns home she finds her mother's world in sharp contrast to the peace of the convent. Plus Kitty has taken up with a younger man. He is a parasite who is two and three timing her and soaking up what money she has. He tries to put the moves on April but with no success. Kitty dealing with the end of her career and both her private and professional humiliation is hard to watch. Morgan gained weight and donned an unkempt blonde wig just for this part and her acting is superb. Do realize that much of the film focuses on April Kitty's daughter. Joan Peers was the actress playing April and this was her first credited screen role. She handles the part quite well but by 1931 her career in films was over.By the way the video quality is excellent and the audio is fine too if you are viewing the Kino DVD. It is necessary to turn up the volume a little during some outdoor or crowd scenes that have dialogue. However there is no hissing and crackling in the audio nor is the sound of shoes clomping around and jewelry clanging in competition with speech as in many other early sound films.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest of the early talkies Applause was also the debut feature of Rouben Mamoulian whose later successes include the celebrated Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde 1931 starring Frederic March one of Garbo's finest vehicles Queen Christina 1933 as well as the groundbreaking Technicolor production Becky Sharp 1935. Lured into cinema after great success in theatre like Welles later on Mamoulian found out how to make films in a crash course partly of his own devising by absorbing the process at studios in New York resolutely watching the work of others until he learned what not to do. Hired ostensibly as a stage expert on dialogue to help make the most of the new sound medium Mamoulian again like the future Welles quickly proved himself an allround innovator looking at production with fresh eyes with an ability to reinvent aspects of cinema as he found them. All I could think of was the marvellous things one could do with the camera and the exciting new potentials of sound recording he said.Applause was the result  a film which still astonishes us today let alone those who saw it for the first time 80 years ago when sound had made considerable attack on the creative freedom previously taken for granted by silent films. Mamoulian's choice of subject matter for his first feature initially seemed to promise little that was striking a somewhat hoary old novel about a fading burlesque queen sacrificing herself for her daughter which promised much melodramatic moralising. But the fledgling director was to prove not so much interested in the story as in the way he could find of telling it invigorating the material.Mamoulian's practical experience of filmmaking was gained largely by sitting on the sidelines at Paramount's New York studios. His theoretical inspiration may one suspects but cannot prove have been inspired elsewhere notably the expressive use of fluid cinematography shown in Murnau's great American opus Sunrise made and released to huge industry interest just a few short years before. Indeed Mamoulian was later to use the great German's director of photography when he later came to make Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde. In Applause we find moments of expressionism mingled with lyricism with which the German would find himself at home. Like Murnau Mamoulian too set out to tell his story primarily through the movement of his camera adding to this some striking location work. The earlier director was not constrained by the mechanics of soundtrack where Mamoulian took a step forward was in the way he insisted that few of the limitations of the new format since then were necessary a fact shown by the fact many of his experiments in Applause have become common film language.This approach becomes apparent right from the opening scene where the thought is more more in terms of travel than of sound first a few shots of a closed shop front then a track along a newspaperblown street. A small dog is rescued from the litter by a girl before a brass band introduces her and us to the arrival of the burlesque queen Kitty Darling Helen Morgan and her progress in an open carriage. The film cuts to inside her theatre tracks steadily past musicians in the pit pans back and forth over the dancing bodies on stage before finally resting on the tired faces of the chorus girls. Mamoulian's concern with the delight of movement as he put it is everywhere. Such concerns brought technical considerations for the sound men that were at first considered impossible. One later scene in particular brought on a significant crisis where Kitty sings a burlesque song to her daughter by way of lullaby as the child simultaneously whispers her prayers this in a long single take. The primitive microphone picked up one and not the other so the director suggested using two mics and mixing it together later. From such guileless innovations are revolutions made after some strenuous initial doubts the studio heads gave Mamoulian carte blanche to continue the film just as he sought fit.Applause is one of those movies where virtually every scene demands attention for the interested viewer either by virtue of Mamoulian's skill or in the case of Helen Morgan through an especially moving performance. The director had filled his cast with those who were as new to the medium of film as he was. Some like Fuller Mellish playing the city slicker as well as Jack Cameron Kitty's predacious beau overplay slightly in that 1930s wiseacre fashion distracting to modern taste  one of the film's few weaknesses  but Morgan's pathetic dignity more than compensates for this and edges the melodrama onward into tragedy. Even the doomed blossoming romance between Kitty's daughter April Joan Peters and her sailor although somewhat hackneyed in expression becomes acceptable in the hands of such a sensitive director who to their scenes together as critic Tom Milne noted brings a simple lyricism which is neither faux nor naf. A particularly fine moment is provided by the lovers' subway platform farewell shot again in long take. The two have been forced apart by ironic circumstance but he does not know why. April's lover has little say in his despondency but almost absentmindedly buys and pushes a cheap packet of gum from a machine into her hand as a leaving present. Another director would have made this pathetic action trite Mamoulian makes it say everything there is to say about a closing relationship between two people where something so slight can be so precious.It would have been too easy to produce a first work that showed off for its own account. But Applause remains so compulsive because it succeeds both as an empathetic story of people and as a technical tourdeforce without one overbalancing the other. It is also exhilarating as it shows how imagination and creative determination liberated film even at this early stage from selfimposed limitations.".

Somewhere in all that time Helen was able to squeeze in filming Applause over at Paramount's Astoria Studio for Rouben Mamoulian who was making his debut as well as a motion picture director.The glamorous torch singer of the Twenties took a most unglamorous role as Kitty Darling burlesque queen who has seen a little too much hard living. The reason Helen was so good in this is that in too closely paralleled her own life. Morgan's given birth to a child whom she sends to a convent school to be raised away from the corrupting influence of burlesque. Mamoulian had an instinct for the cinema as he moves the camera and comes up with some really great cinematography. He does not use that in the burlesque sequence they're shot quite static and I think that was deliberate to emphasize the essential phoniness of burlesque this in fact is a show it's Helen's and the other characters off stage life where reality takes over.Daughter Joan Peers shows up and all the lowlifes start eying this innocent child including Fuller Mellish Jr. who Helen is shacking up with. Mellish is a burlesque comic and a real bottom feeder but in fairness to him he doesn't see too much other than the bottom where he comes from. He also sees Peers as a successor to Morgan as she's getting a little long in the tooth and hitting the sauce with increasing regularity. Despite that Peers only sees the mother she's been separated from and wants to get a relationship going.Applause still holds up well and it's so fluid you don't recognize it immediately as an early sound film. Like that other 1929 classic from Paramount that Ernest Lubitsch directed The Love Parade the acting is so natural and that makes it an even bigger achievement than The Love Parade because this cast of players were all New York stage performers. Like Lubitsch Mamoulian knew instinctively how to dial it down for the talkies.The story of Helen Morgan's tragedy is show business legend but Fuller Mellish Jr. died the following year and his career was cut short as well. He would have had a great career playing smarmy characters on the big screen.The big drawback to Applause and one that Mamoulian Morgan Paramount and the rest couldn't help was the artificial happy ending the Catholic church insisted on. It really cheapens the film.Other than that Applause is one of the best of the post Jazz Singer early talkies and launched a great career for Rouben Mamoulian.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh those early years of sound in movies. The things they tried the things that worked and the things that failed. Here there are both some success and failures but most work. One thing that comes out of it is that it is easy to see why this is one of the few remembered early musical films without a major film star in the lead. Helen Morgan who was the toast of Broadway in Show Boat and Sweet Adeline plays a vaudeville star who is desperately trying to raise her daughter well and keep her away from her sordid life. She is seen at the beginning saying goodbye to her husband who is being executed and her struggle as a single mother is dramatically very interesting. To see her slow fall from the top of the boards to the worst vaudeville theaters is quite sad. She has sent her daughter off to a convent school and years later her wretched partner orders the drunken Morgan to bring her back to spice up their act and for sickening reasons of his own. The young girl Joan Peers finds love with a nice young sailor and mom doesn't want to spoil it. Mom's name happens to be Kitty Darling which gives you a small idea of her personality. Helen Morgan gives a stagy but memorable performance as the harddrinking vaudevillian whose best days are behind her. She is the whole show. Rouben Mamoullien who directed Porgy and Bess and Oklahoma! on Broadway only did periodic films but the list of his credits is very memorable. He is an artist rather than a film maker and here he takes a creaky subject and makes it very interesting. The finale is gripping and will leave the viewer able to make their own guess as to what transpires. Fuller Mellish Jr. is slimy as Morgan's partner while Jack Cameron is merely adequate as the sailor. Peers is no star to be. But in spite of those casting shortcomings when Morgan is on screen the film is magnetic. She adapted a great deal more to the screen when she did the film version of Show Boat seven years later but unlike Marilyn Miller in her film versions of Sunny and Sally Morgan comes off here as more alive even under the influence. She may not be the ideal mother but for an early sound film she's more dimensional than most.".

One thing that comes out of it is that it is easy to see why this is one of the few remembered early musical films without a major film star in the lead. Helen Morgan who was the toast of Broadway in Show Boat and Sweet Adeline plays a vaudeville star who is desperately trying to raise her daughter well and keep her away from her sordid life. She is seen at the beginning saying goodbye to her husband who is being executed and her struggle as a single mother is dramatically very interesting. To see her slow fall from the top of the boards to the worst vaudeville theaters is quite sad. She has sent her daughter off to a convent school and years later her wretched partner orders the drunken Morgan to bring her back to spice up their act and for sickening reasons of his own. The young girl Joan Peers finds love with a nice young sailor and mom doesn't want to spoil it. Mom's name happens to be Kitty Darling which gives you a small idea of her personality. Helen Morgan gives a stagy but memorable performance as the harddrinking vaudevillian whose best days are behind her. She is the whole show. Rouben Mamoullien who directed Porgy and Bess and Oklahoma! on Broadway only did periodic films but the list of his credits is very memorable. He is an artist rather than a film maker and here he takes a creaky subject and makes it very interesting. The finale is gripping and will leave the viewer able to make their own guess as to what transpires. Fuller Mellish Jr. is slimy as Morgan's partner while Jack Cameron is merely adequate as the sailor. Peers is no star to be. But in spite of those casting shortcomings when Morgan is on screen the film is magnetic. She adapted a great deal more to the screen when she did the film version of Show Boat seven years later but unlike Marilyn Miller in her film versions of Sunny and Sally Morgan comes off here as more alive even under the influence. She may not be the ideal mother but for an early sound film she's more dimensional than most.";

What it does have in its favor is a good performance by Helen Morgan far more moving than anything else in the film and a real sense of the tawdriness of the lower burlesque route in its dying days. This is no slightly rundown theatre where the girls are immaculately dressed and styled even though they are working for peanuts in a grindhouse such as it would appear to be the case once the code went into full effect throughout the 30's to the 50's. These dollies are over the hill washed up harridans with baggy stockings and cheap outfits. For that matter the cast is one of the least attractive and most common looking in memory. Helen Morgan is supposed to be frowsy and worn but the actress playing her daughter is plain and the actor playing her cheating husband is plain ugly quite surprisingly he was only 29 herehe looks years older but perhaps he was in ill health since he died within two years at 31 of a cerebral hemorrhage. Considering its age and the transitional period movies were in at the time of its release not a bad film just very clunky.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rouben Mamoulian once said that before making his first movie APPLAUSE he was interested in New York with all its beauty as well as its ugliness in its variety of tastelessness vulgarity and sorrows. Initially hired as the expert of dialogue he broadened his Broadway experience in some most unpredictable fashion. Few members of the Astoria Studio at NYC as well as great Paramount pioneers could actually predict that he would contribute far more to the movie industry.One of the earliest dialogue films which at best can only be a poor substitute for the stage Paul Rotha still appears to invite us to applaud APPLAUSE  a truly solid production of cinema's dawn. Much credit here to its cameraman George Folsey and the director Rouben Mamoulian quite a newcomer at Hollywood in 1929 rightly described by Alexander Jacoby one of Hollywood's most fascinating marginal figures a creative filmmaker ready to experiment with the possibilities of the new medium. The strength of his works lies primarily in visuals moods character development along with the insight into a person's place in society but foremost a symphony of innovations a milestone in the development of sound film technique Audrey Kupferberg Magill's Survey of Cinema 1981.While BECKY SHARP may boast experiment with color and DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE the use of the subjective camera in the unforgettable opening sequence APPLAUSE offers an innovative for the time but still attractive use of a moving camera. George Folsey and Rouben Mamoulian's collaboration on that aspect aimed at absorbing viewers' senses and instill the understanding of the story. We cannot have such intense perceptive powers in movies nowadays. Images change with the places and the moods the atmosphere is sometimes brought to the higher levels of perceptions and may beautifully influence a variety of feelings. There is also or perhaps foremost a great experiment with sound consider the scene of a lullabyprayer some of the most cherished scene of the movie beautifully developed an aspect by Tom Milne. These innovations as dated as they may seem now after almost 9 decades hold a powerful impact due to one significant aspect. Alexander Jacoby rightly points out that innovations are at the service of the movie's themes and feelings. Consider for instance the depiction of the beef trust and the performers the moment they find out that Kitty Darling is pregnant the camera is placed in such a way that we see Kitty actually being adored by her fellows and we see th scene from the bird's view. Mind you the sublime almost mystical world of the convent with music swans silence gestures a depiction that inspired many movies to come also those of religious themes. This 'collaboration' or 'combination' of technical and artistic innovations going well with the movie's feelings is also best executed in AprilTony's scenes actually dates in New York City the love scenes Lewis Jacobs 1939 labels as exquisite and lyrical. But characters...let me highlight them in a separate paragraph because APPLAUSE would have been merely a display of director and cameraman's professional skills without any humanity if it were not for them.Within the portrayal of characters some viewers may find it truly surprising how fluid how unclear the distinction between cinema and theater actually might be. Characters and psychology seem to correspond. Jacoby calls APPLAUSE one of the most heartrending studies of human degradation. While many movie scholars admit Mamoulian's psychological over visual realism the heroes of APPLAUSE really appear to applaud life with its drama its joys its love and aspirations. The most interesting are Kitty and her daughter April in their individualists and mutual dependence. Again let me quote Jacoby when he mentions this tragic exposition of mother love something that movies exploited decades later with psychoanalytical attempts and thrill. Kitty is a declining star panicking about oblivion April is a young and naive girl who undergoes a shock from the blissful harmony of the convent world to the passionate carnality and temptations of the show business world. Both Helen Morgan and Joan Peers give unique performances and handle their roles with exceptional vitality realism and conviction. Among male characters Henry Wadsworth as flamboyant Tony April's naive young counterpart delivers something genuine. To the sweet question of his love Are there many people in the world? his seemingly silly but meaningful when applied to the character study answer Only two as far as I am concerned proves all romantic assumptions perfectly right.Although people these days have access to many many more movies of similar content as well as possess a far richer film experience as both viewers and filmmakers there is something powerful even magical about this film that invites us to applaud Mamoulian's APPLAUSE with even greater enthusiasm. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very interesting film to watch because of the year it was made1929when most talkies were limited in movement because of the way cameras of the time had to stay in certain places and microphones of the period had to be careful not to pick up unwanted noises of certain objects. How director Rouben Mamouliain attained his movements and sounds the way he wanted is a mystery to me but for the most part he succeeded in making a naturalistic locationshot film that looked like it could have been made today with some underscoring and some clear smooth sounds added. Helen Morgan is suitably pathetic as the overthehill burlesque singerdancer Kitty Darling who sends her only child April to a convent to shield her from her rough life. So after several years when her nearlygrown daughter played by Joan Peers at this point comes back this April can't believe how sleazy a life her mother lives especially when this mother's comic boyfriend Hitch makes the moves on her! I'll stop there and just say this was quite a revelation to me what with not only the innovative techniques of the director but also with how the material was obviously presented before the Production Code of 1934 cleaned things up for the next few decades. Ms. Morgan's singing performances aren't bad though she was better presented on film in Show Boat several years later. It's also a little harrowing knowing that she's one of the earliest of the popular female singers to fall victim to drugs and drink like latterday contemporaries Judy Garland and Whitney Houston especially when you see her character's fate here. Still Applause was enjoyable enough as both a historical and artistic film. P.S. As a Chicago native I have to note the birth of Ms. Peers there also and Ms. Morgan's parttime raising there. Oh and that my name is the same as the sailor April falls for here which tickled me since I knew a girl named April in elementary and high school that I had a huge massive crush on back in the day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ask anyone with a cursory knowledge of classic cinema what the early talkies were like and the chances are they will mention something about the lack of camera movement. Usually this is stated as if the static camera leads ipso facto to boring static films. How ironic then that this alltalking backstager is spoiled by a camera that just won't sit still.Applause was directed by Rouben Mamoulian one of many theatre directors brought to Hollywood at the beginning of the sound era and like many directors with a stage background James Whale George Cukor Orson Welles Laurence Olivier he was fascinated by the possibilities of cinema's mobile eye. Giving Mamoulian a camera was like giving a kid an expensive hitech toy and he wouldn't let it go to waste in a soundproof booth. Instead he has it swooping across rows of faces dollying in and out of dialogue scenes or lodged up in the rafters.This all gets remembered because it was unusual for the time and therefore clever. But what does it actually add? Sometimes the camera moves seem to have some purpose such as a dolly in on a significant object or a standard pullbackandreveal manoeuvre but these are so wobbly and badly paced all they draw our attention to is the picture's artificiality. Other times the camera pans wildly all over the place for no apparent reason reminding me of nothing more than a bad home movie. When the camera is still it is often at some daft high angle or pointing at the actors' legs to no real advantage.And it's not just the camera moves. Mamoulian is a shameless technique junkie throwing in dissolves screen wipes layered sound montages giant shadows and anything else the technology of the day allowed. It's usually fairly clear why he uses each of these in fact it's too clear as every cinematic point is laboured to death such as the overthetop montage reflecting April's troubled mental state after she finds out what her mother does for a living. It would be more bearable if Mamoulian like other directors who rely on exaggerated technique such as Michael Curtiz FW Murnau and Alfred Hitchcock at least knew some basic cinematic grammar but he is a novice when it comes to screen storytelling. His dialogue scenes are blandly presentational  no closeups no rhyming angles no thoughtful framing. All these things were by then established cinematic conventions and they still are for good reason they bring human interaction to life on the screen.Having said all that there are a few touches that do work. The allround coverage of the dance hall at the beginning shows us both the backstage pointofview and the diversity of the crowd with the silhouettes of tophatted pipe smokers in the balcony subtly pointing out that the burlesque gets some highclass customers as well. In the romantic caf scene there is a subtle dolly out to reveal that the couple are now alone but the moment is ruined by moving too quickly and clunkily to their exit. Helen Morgan's final scene makes effective use of background noise from the street outside but again Mamoulian fails to hold the moment instead following it with another wobbly shuffle of the camera and a meaningless high angle shot.Of course the whole point in bringing in theatre directors at this time was the notion that they would be the most capable in coaching actors with dialogue. There's no sign of this with Mamoulian. Helen Morgan's acting is just bad hamming or spamming as I call it. She was at her most sensitive and emotive when singing as her performance in the 1936 version of Showboat demonstrates but she is underused as a singer in Applause. Fuller Mellish Jr is OK but his cartoonish performance is wrong for this straight drama. The standout is Joan Peers whose turn I would describe as average the best anything can aspire to in Applause.Mamoulian's champions tend to paint him as a failed genius in the style of von Stroheim and Welles an artist whose artistry fell victim to studio straitjacketing. This is partly true  as time went by Mamoulian would be forced to rein in his technical excessiveness and would learn to temper it with standard cinematic method. It's actually during this process that his pictures start to improve and I'm even glad that he never totally lost his showy style because he was occasionally even great in genres such as the musical or the swashbuckler which require a bit of flamboyance behind the camera. Applause however is raw uncultivated Mamoulian fresh from the stage and wowed by moviemaking gadgetry. Cinema may be the more technologically advanced medium but like theatre the job of the director is to bring out the best in the actors and the story not to smother them.".

	schema:headline " Paramount's horrible first musical";
	schema:reviewBody "This Paramount 1929 film is supposedly the first talking musical. Well the music is minimal with Helen Morgan singing just bits of songs as Kitty Darling. The film and sound quality are poor and the show hall music of the day gets nerveracking after a while. It was made in Paramount's Long Island Studio of the time. That's before Hollywood became firmly Hollywood. This was Rouben Mamoulian's first film. It has a simple plot and his message or moral is clear. But the script is too full of the poor life and failings of Kitty. Hitch Nelson played by Fuller Mellish Jr. quickly gets the scorn of the audience. He plays the cad or villain we would see in a silent film which this talkie resembles far too much. The scenes of April played by Joan Peers in a convent are overly melodramatic. There are a number of other oddities in the film. The most obvious is the costumes of the nuns. They are wearing long flowing capes but I doubt there ever was such a habit in any religious order. Applause has what may be the most ridiculous scene ever in a movie. In the early part Kitty comes on stage in her tights costume and slim appearance. After she faints off stage and a doctor is called she has a baby. Then the whole troupe of show girls are amazed and walk by to look at what we are to believe is the baby. Lying beside a small wrapped doll is Kitty still in full costume from her recent stage number. I don't think the director or producer were thinking at all or even tried to make this whole matter appear real. Mamoulian got some of his artistry with the camera in this film but it couldn't salvage a mostly horrible cheaplooking melodrama. The chorus group in this film is hard to believe. Most of the girls are chunky if not terribly over weight and plain looking to homely. I don't mean to disparage anyone  many of us do not have the dashing looks of celebs. But the public generally wants and expects beauty in these types of performers. Paramount was one of the Big Five studios of early Hollywood but it looks as though it couldn't attract the beauties  or wouldn't pay to get them. For comparison check out the attractive chorus in the 1929 MGM film The Broadway Melody.I can't understand how anyone could rate this film higher than five stars even a diehard Helen Morgan fan. She isn't that good in this role which parallels her real life somewhat. After a short successful start on Broadway she went to Hollywood. But she got in with the wrong crowd had a bad marriage and became an alcoholic. She made only 15 films and her career was washed up by the mid1930s. She was only 41 years old when she died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1941. The rest of the leading cast is made up of people who went nowhere in Hollywood or barely beyond a start. Fuller Mellish was in just three films and died in 1930 at age 32 from a cerebral hemorrhage. Joan Peers was in one silent film and then nine sound films period from 1929 to 1931. Jack Cameron who played Joe King made only two films. And the only halfway decent acting role of Tony was played by Henry Wadsworth who had small parts in all of 22 films stretching from 1929 to 1945. No this was a real cheapie thrown together by Paramount possibly in a race with MGM and others studios for a sound musical. But it's mostly terrible in all aspects. I don't even see any historical value in it unless it would be as an example of the poor quality of some of the early sound efforts. For Mamoulian's little bit of artistry I stretch some and give Applause four stars. Apparently most other reviewers to date think much more of Mamoulian's work here though a couple seem to be taken by the precode nature of this movie. But there's just nothing that shocking in this film.".
