Three years ago Cuma was accidentally arrested by the snoopy detective Wilk Marcin Dorocinski after a successful heist in the house of the collector Lehman but he has not ratted his comrade Julian Borys Szyc. Cuma meets Julian now a police officer and law student and invites him to steal the painting but Julian is reluctant. They hire the falsifier Tadeusz Hagen Jan Machulski and the talented student Magda Kamilla Baar to paint a replica and carefully plan the robbery in details while Detective Milk does not give a break to Cuma who has to meet him every other day.Vinci is a surprisingly pleasant movie with comedy action and thriller. The story is a sort of a contemporary The Sting in Poland with funny situations witty dialogs nice characters and a very enjoyable screenplay. The direction of Juliusz Machulski is excellent giving the adequate pace to develop the simple plot of a heist in an enjoyable feature to be discovered by viewers very well supported by a cast that has great performances.

Juliusz Machulski was always one of my alltime favorite directors especially with his Va Bank films but here he proved that he still hasn't lost his touch and remains in the cohorts of the Polish living classics. Vinci is a typically Polish comedy with excellent Slavic humor twisting plot and hilarious characters. The plot seems to be so simple  some crooks want to steal a Vinci picture and then there are so many other criminals who also want to lay their hands on the work of art. What is great here is the vivid performance of Machulski in the role of an old but still effective thief who can do everything to fool other crooks down and to get his share of money. The picturesque views of Krakow excellent playing funny dialogs all add to the picture. Do not search for the skyhigh sense or extremely serious ideas. This is entertainment in its clearest sense.

As usual from this director you should rather expect funny crime story type of movie and so Vinci is. However I personally would not call Vinci the best movie Machulski ever made but fortunately all his movies never were time wasters even they were not brilliant. The plot ain't very unique and as you have probably guessed it's all about most famous painting of Leonardo Da Vinci and while it's still crimeotype movie you may also expect some bad guys sniffing around the painting with thievery in mind. Good acting and funny dialogs are the bright side of this movie however I'd expect a bit more complicated plot from Machulski.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to be a poker fan in the world of movies. Let's face it how many great poker movies can you think of? Rounders perhaps. Despite Texas Hold'Em growing extraordinarily popular over the last few years Hollywood has really failed to capitalize on the trend. I'm happy to report that the wait is over. The Grand not only emerges as a wonderful poker film but also one of the best comedies I've seen in ages. While it doesn't seem to be well known now I predict it will find a massive audience on DVD and Cable ala Office Space. The Grand is a mocumentary in the tradition of Christopher Guest following six players as they compete in huge Texas Hold'em tournament in Nevada. Along the way we meet many other supporting characters including family and friends of the main six as well as other participants in the tournament. The initial six areWoody Harrelson as One Eyed Jack Faro. He is a lifetime drug abuser who has inherited the Rabbit's Foot Casino from his grandfather. A large debt has forced him to enter into the tournament his Casino is hosting.Cheryl Hines as Lainie Schwartzman. She is a mother of five who supports her family which includes a deadbeat husband as a professional poker player. She is also the sister ofDavid Cross as Larry Schwartzman. He is also a professional poker player known around the circuit for his obnoxious behavior. The fact that his father puts his support behind his sister Lainie only motivates him more to win the tournament.Chris Parnell as Harold Melvin. A statistics expert who uses his knowledge of numbers to his advantage as a poker pro. He is also ludicrously AntiSocial and lives still lives with his elderly mother.Dennis Farina as Deuce Fairbanks. The old timer who's been on the scene for years and has nothing but contempt for what's become of the game over the past few years.Richard Kind as Andy Andrews. A novice player who won an online poker tournament by chance to win his seat at The Grand despite knowing absolutely nothing about the game of poker.Some supporting performers include Judy Greer Michael McKean Ray Romano Jason Alexander Hank Azaria and Shannon Elizabeth. Real life Pro players Doyle Brunson Phil Hellmuth and Phil Laak also make appearances as well as filmmakers Brett Ratner and Werner Herzog. As you can see this is a huge ensemble and director Zak Penn handles it impeccably. Every performance shines and the pace is fast and fun. I think I laughed three times as much in this film than in any feature all year. The humor is always there be it in the witty dialogue the great ensemble or the various clever scenarios.As stated before the film is structured similarly to a Chris Guest mocumentary alternating between testimonials of the characters and following the players around as they play in the tournament. The tournament itself is presented similarity to a telecast of The World Series of Poker complete with mismatched commentators. I'm not the biggest fan of Penn's superhero stuff but I thought he did something clever with his Herzog Loch Ness project. Here he hits a real sweet spot creating a real love letter to fans of poker and smart comedy alike.".

But once I got inside I forgot all about being wet because I was laughing too hard.Now let me just say that I'm not a fan of Zack Penn's movies. I hated XMen 3 and all the other superhero crap he's written. But I did love Incident At Lock Ness which I thought was pretty clever and I really loved seeing Werner Herzog who is my hero if you couldn't tell from my name playing with his mystique.But I guess I should get to actually reviewing this movie. It was hilarious. Even better than Lock Ness. The movie is also a mockumentary very much like Best In Show by Christopher Guest but follows a bunch of poker players who are all crazy as they reach the final table in a poker tournament. They are played by a bunch of recognizable comedians like Ray Romano the wife from Curb Your Enthusiasm but even better David Cruss my favorite character from the awesome Mr. Show and Chris Parnell from SNL. And of course the always awesome Herzog who plays The German a guy who likes to kill animals rather than drink caffeine.What was really cool is that Zack explained in his QA afterwords that the final poker table was played for real and whoever won the game won the movie. I won't spoil who wins but just say that it makes it totally impossible to predict who wins the movie because all the characters have the same chance of winning.I think the other reviewer who gave the movie five stars out of ten has something against the movie. It wasn't great art like Werner's normal movies but tremendously entertaining. It is very funny sometimes very slapstick and other times very absurd. I think anyone who likes Christopher Guest movies or any of these great comedians will love the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I managed to see The Grand a little while ago at the Puerto Vallarta Film Festival... I had no idea what to expect as I am admittedly not particularly familiar with the director's other work. I knew some of the actors but I'm not intimately familiar with their work either except for Woody Harrelson. I am a poker fan though so I was excited on that front. Well let me just say that sometimes it's good to go in with no expectations because you can really find yourself getting blown away.Woody is the biggest name in the movie and one of the funniest. He plays Jack Faro a downonhisluck guy who is trying to save the Rabbit's Foot Casino by winning The Grand poker tournament. David Cross from Arrested Development Chris Parnell from Saturday Night Live and Cheryl Hines from Curb Your Enthusiasm are also in the movie and are all hilarious. Cross does a fine job letting the air out of those poker players who are so full of themselves.There are real poker stars in the movie. My favorite as my friends will attest to is Phil Gordon who is funny in the movie along with his announcing partner Mike Werbe. Werbe is like the Ron Popeil of poker. I think I need to learn the Werbe method for my weekly game. Those of you who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. I could go on but I don't want to give anything away. From what I've read the guys in the movie actually played the poker straight and they didn't know who was going to win or lose so the movie was intriguing for its comedy and its poker. Who wants to watch a fixed hand like in ROunders? This is the real deal. Imagine if the World Series of Poker was a comedy like Spinal Tap or something and you have The Grand.I definitely will recommend it to my friends when it hits theaters and I'll definitely go see it with them and I usually won't see a movie in the theater twice.".

There are plenty of other astutely drawn characters like Barry 'Sob Story' the 'Bust You Crew' and need I say Fred Andy Larry Lainie and all the main characters are excellent.What story lines there are may be a bit obvious but they do effectively drive the comedy right through to the epilogue and outtakes  I mean who criticises the plot of Airplane? Story is not what The Grand is about it is about laughing at poker people and poker people.If you are a poker fan you should love this movie ... I am so I can't comment if not ... perhaps you won't find it funny at all.".

There are plenty of other astutely drawn characters like Barry 'Sob Story' the 'Bust You Crew' and need I say Fred Andy Larry Lainie and all the main characters are excellent.What story lines there are may be a bit obvious but they do effectively drive the comedy right through to the epilogue and outtakes  I mean who criticises the plot of Airplane? Story is not what The Grand is about it is about laughing at poker people and poker people.If you are a poker fan you should love this movie ... I am so I can't comment if not ... perhaps you won't find it funny at all.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Grand is funny in parts but overall there are three unfunny minutes for every funny minute. The movie starts fairly strong and I was honestly hoping that it would keep up the humor but it did not. Which is a shame.Interestingly what does not work in this film is the poker. At a QA after the movie at the Tribeca Film Festival the director made a point of immediately stating that the poker was real. They dealt the cards and the actors played in character and the results were up to fate. Very interesting idea. Unfortunately that did not carry to the movie. There was almost no excitement or tension to the poker tournament perhaps because it is impossible to build tension in the results of a game when that game is severely edited. I hate to say it but this film is less exciting and less entertaining than an episode Bravo's Celebrity Poker. Even though the poker tournament itself is boring this movie still could have been laugh out loud funny. Unfortunately it isn't. I hold no grudge against the filmmaker for taking a direct copy of the Christopher Guest play book and running with it. I only wish he'd been more successful so that I could have laughed more than infrequently.Hopefully this movie's failure will not discourage others from using this formula. I would love to have more comedies in this style. It is not like Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy are the only two people alive who can come up with a concept for a mockumentary. Actually it's my opinion that The Grand has a better premise than several GuestLevy creations. It should be very funny and entertaining. Unfortunately it is not.".

The way it is just doesn't work and shouldn't have been financed or released onto an unsuspecting public...I'll take a second look at anything Woody Harrelson is in from now on and won't spend my oney on anything Penn's in charge of...How does Jr. say it???...Trick me once shame on Penn...trick the public twice...and I get two terms to rape the country...that's not an exact quote but that's probably a bit more accurate!...";

I really don't have too much to say about this movie other than that the poker was pretty good in this movie. The movie is from 2006.

One thing you should be aware of however is that the movie is a bit crudeso you might want to think twice about having kids or your motherinlaw watch it.The film purports to be a film about a winnertakeall poker tournament in Las Vegas. And like Best in Show is features certain key players AND has a color commentator much like Fred Willard's clueless commentatorbut this one is intent on selling his book on how to be a great poker player and some of Mr. Werbe's tips are hilarious. Many of the individuals featured are quite funny. The one that struck me most was 'the German'played wonderfully by the film director Werner Herzog. His character was VERY scary and made me laughespecially since it was Herzogwho you DON'T think of as a funny guy! I also loved Gabe Kaplan as the demented father of two of the top contenders. He was absolutely horriblebut made me laugh. Overall it's original funny and engaging.By the way if you do watch it a couple things you may want to look for would include Harold Melvin who is a pretty classic individual with Asperger's Syndrome and the website. As for Melvin his name is actually taken from a 1970s soul groupHarold Melvin and the Blue Notes who sand If You Don't Know Me By Now a great song. And the website that one of them hawks on their baseball caps is NOT a real websiteI checked.".

It's a movie that does nothing wrong and I have awarded it a coveted 10 rating.It was only a month ago that I learned of the existence of the somewhat lowprofile 1998 sequel Couloirs du Temp. I scrambled to find it and now I have. I was afraid it might be terrible as most of the few user comments here are certainly pretty hard on it but to my delight it was pretty damn good. Of course not in league with the original and several plot points were rather contrived and a number of the gags went a bit out of hand but overall I had a great time watching it. There were lots of laughs lots of crazy situations and lots of really good ideas. This sequel afforded us the chance to get to know Cousin Hube's side of the family which I thought was brilliant. I think most of the inspiration and fun from the first movie were excellently maintained here and I was impressed with the substance and complexity of the story. And I loved the way the soundtrack riffed the Back To The Future theme!I almost want to rate this sequel an 8 but several factors contribute to its ending up a 7. Some of the plot developments weren't great and the end in particular seemed to just complicate matters unnecessarily while not being especially intriguing.Probably the single biggest thing that was wrong with this movie was that Hube's fiance was played by a different actress than in the first movie. This was a real shame I thought.Thus a 7 out of 10 rating but an entertaining and hilarious movie none the less! Absolutely recommended for fans of the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "My initial reaction when I knew about the The Visitors's upcoming sequel was 'Why?' What could ever get funnier than one of the funniest French comedies and what's more that ended in a very satisfying way? The film had to deal with the case of Jacquard who was sent in the MiddleAges? Well that was supposed to be a final gag the punch line of a great comedy I mean would you have wanted a Some Like it Hot sequel to know if Osgood Jr. and Daphne would really be married? This is the first of several reasons for which this film should never have been made NO REASON TO BE! Not to mention that they waited for five years the actors obviously changed and they couldn't get the whole casting back. Of course this is nothing compared to the most painful casting aspect the replacement of Valrie Lemercier by Muriel Robin. NO VALERIE LEMERCIER! To those who think that the absence of Tom Hagen ruined The Godfather Part III keep in mind that he was replaced by another character while Muriel Robin was supposed to be Batrice and Frngonde de Montmirail and no one could seriously buy it especially after Lemercier created such an unforgettable character. Only a good script could have redeemed Lemercier's absence but the script is probably the worst thing about the film.While the intelligence of the first opus was to use fantastic elements only to serve some key scenes in the sequel there is an abundance of subplots of time travels of goings back and forth that's it's impossible to keep track on everyone and even worse the script probably features the most exhaustive list of incoherences and continuity issues. In fact there's simply NO CONTINUITY Godefroy never drugged the Chief of Police there was no reason for Batrice to believe that Ginette was from the MiddleAge just because she wanted to marry Jacquouille and it was supposed to serve a comical subplot why would Jacquard find a cellphone in his pocket since he's coming from 1992 and why should the Duke's jewelery be missing since they were stolen during his funerals  that never happened after Godefroy's comeback? Well I might forgive the last one because the first opus didn't deal with time travel issues with more accuracy but it was still making sense. Besides it was the plot's starting point the whole issue about the missing jewels which left The Corridors of Time open threatening the world with a series of disasters. They made it such a big thing that the film oscillated between dark moments very unsettling for a comedy and too many buffoonish situations that were not even funny even by artificially exploiting the same tricks than the first even with the creation of lame catchphrases. Obviously they had the budget the late 90's typical CGIdriven effects. I could have forgiven the blatant displays of product placements as it can be seen as a realistic touch but I couldn't spot one miserable redeeming quality.Instead of a solid story with a few good laughs The Visitors II provides an assemblage of disjointed gags and sketches that try to make the movie funny every time through such a chaotic editing that it makes you wonder what the hell they were thinking. The film is one of the noisiest you'll ever see going from the cheapest jokes toilet and cream pie humor at its worst. Are we supposed to laugh when Jacquouille throws eggs on a supermarket manager's face? Is Jacquouille even supposed to act this way? He was a funny sidekick but not a buffoon here the film could have been subtitled the Clavier Show making him more unbearable than Beatrice's looks and Ginette's makeup combined. Every part was overacted the Police Officer who wanted to prove Jacquard's alcoholism Cora the snobby bitchy wife her dull daughter  just look at the entrance of the woman who comes for a dental visit and you'll have an idea.Another unnecessary subplot involves Jacquard's torture that made him prone to pee everywhere a random encounter with Jacquouille's brother and even more random JeanPierre's accidental travel in time. Why did they do that since it wasn't funny and didn't seem to affect the character? The film went in all directions and it was so difficult to stay focused that all I waited for was the mess to stop. Though it had its moments after one hour and four minutes the miracle happened with perhaps one of the funniest French comedic moments the scary closeup on a screaming Jean Reno. But one two or three hilarious gags can't redeem a neartwohour nonsense the ending could have saved it but there was NO ENDING! Since they made such a big deal about The Corridors of the Time and the way they would destroy not only Godefroy's lineage but the whole world what were they thinking with that ending? it's not even a gag it's indeed a disaster and the sight of Godefroy the Brave ready to fight and getting a bullet in his sword was very disturbing and not funny at all. Did they do this just to follow the 'Clavier show and show another descendant of Jacquouille as Bonaparte's counselor? Or did they think so much of the film that they felt it deserved a sequel? Well the film still did well 8 millions of spectators but even the authors are not fooled by these statistics people came expecting to laugh as much as for the first rediscovering endearing characters who penetrate popculture immediately for an inevitable disappointment.No ending no continuity no Valrie Lemercier no reason to be the film is just a bunch of 'No's even in the 'making of' Poir Clavier Reno and al had at least the decency to admit in the makingof that this 'was not as good as' the first one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les Visiteurs the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor but there was more. There were unexpected twists funny situations and of course plain absurdness that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.Now this sequel has the same characters the same actors in great part and the same time traveling. The plot changes a little since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down in history without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie. The duke Jean Reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing but his character has been emptied so there's not a lot he can do to save the film.Now the duke's slavehelper he has really all the attention. The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy  annoying  stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. Fact is this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience but he does not succeed. It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke you already know but he insists on telling that joke till the end adding details to make your suffering a little longer.If you liked Les Visiteurs do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel. If you didn't like Les Visiteurs you would never consider seeing the sequel. If you liked this sequel... well I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies.".

Then comes the sequel.Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs the first.

Explanation  it's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen  don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that's only one of many holes Poir tries to avoid... and fails.Let's have a look at the characters  Montmirail doesn't change he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story  Valrie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poir doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy.Forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old.".

Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poir and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode.

This is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. Indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard... Instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a consequence the movie becomes sometimes muddleheaded sometimes a bit of a mess.But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying. Then why did JeanMarie Poir the filmmaker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role? He made a mistake because she seems illatease and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors aren't better MarieAnne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau unbearable. Of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. Certain sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears hollow because Poir takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. Thus a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.A labored and disappointing followup. Anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?".

The actress replacing Jean Reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. No script since it was apparently written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shots in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101. How this pile got through no one can tell. It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. This movie has one good part ...its END! This film is my 1 worst film of all time finally Howard The Duck is no longer the goose.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the diabolical doings of psychomama's boy Ed Gein this film is guaranteed to leave you feeling uneasy for days after viewing. Some images are so horrific that they are fairly certain to haunt your dreams. Character actor Roberts Blossom in his best role ever is chillingly good as the overly devoted son who not quite all there to begin with goes completely round the bend when his beloved mother dies. He digs the old lady up brings her back to the family farm restores her corpse and kills an occasional female passerby to keep her company. It's every bit as strange as it sounds. But when it's over you can't simply shrug it off and say to yourself Oh well it's only a movie because it's based on the truth. Viewers familiar with the Ed Gein case will note that the filmmakers have for the most part stuck close to the facts. It leaves a strong impression and to put it mildly a rather disturbing one.

	onyx:emotionText "Based on the diabolical doings of psychomama's boy Ed Gein this film is guaranteed to leave you feeling uneasy for days after viewing. Some images are so horrific that they are fairly certain to haunt your dreams. Character actor Roberts Blossom in his best role ever is chillingly good as the overly devoted son who not quite all there to begin with goes completely round the bend when his beloved mother dies. He digs the old lady up brings her back to the family farm restores her corpse and kills an occasional female passerby to keep her company. It's every bit as strange as it sounds. But when it's over you can't simply shrug it off and say to yourself Oh well it's only a movie because it's based on the truth. Viewers familiar with the Ed Gein case will note that the filmmakers have for the most part stuck close to the facts. It leaves a strong impression and to put it mildly a rather disturbing one. What's truly amazing is that the filmmakers have brought a sense of humor to these gruesome events and it ISN'T offensive. DERANGED is one of the best scaryfunny movies I have ever seen.

There are some touches of black comedy in places but overall this is no funny gorefest ala the 'Evil Dead' flicks. Roberts Blossom puts in an excellent performance as Ezra Cobb the Ed Gein inspired protagonist. You may not totally understand why he ends up doing what he does but Blossom successfully conveys Cobb's loneliness and isolation which explodes into full blown delusional behaviour. The only negative comment I have about 'Deranged' is the clumsy and unnecessary intrusions of the narrator into the plot. Without that we'd be looking at a complete classic. Even so 'Deranged' is much more than a video nasty and deserves a much larger audience.".

This time i REALLY got to run to the John and spew my dinner out!The creepiest scene is when a wondering victim to be arrives in the living room of Ez's home and find this collection of rotten corpses yeah this is strange but the strangest is when Ez begin to play the organ with a corpse's top skull on his head ! We can really feel the insanity  the madness  the frustrations and the nastiness of the character  admirably played by Roberts Blossom  whose face and eyes are absolutely frightening in the film  the least we can say is that he physically fits well the character but not only  because he has added this verbal and muscular tics  for example the one he does the most is with his lower lip and this is very eerie. I think this is one of his most impressive performance and it's a shame producers underestimated him during his career and now cause the guy has talent.My overall rating is 8 cause this is a unjustified forgotten little gem of the macabre and bizarre and often subtle black humor and gives one of the finest performances by an actor in the genre psycho horror SPOILER don't watch it if you have a gastric indisposition of whatever sort  unless you have a big empty bucket nearby!".

	schema:reviewBody "Deranged is an adaptation of the same story that inspired such horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Psycho and Silence of the Lambs among others. It's the story of deranged psychotic Edward Gein only in this film the story is a lot closer to how it actually happened than in any of the classics that it influenced. Deranged is a film not for the feint hearted. Shot on an extremely low budget of just two hundred thousand dollars the directorial team of Jeff Gillen and Alan Ormsby have created one of the most vile and disgusting films that I've ever seen. Subtitled 'Confessions of a Necrophile' for the US market Deranged tells the story of Ezra Cobb a simple farm owner who lives with his domineering mother. After her death Ezra gradually slips into insanity starting with the unearthing of his yearlong dead mother from the grave. Ezra then decides that she needs patching up and so embarks on unearthing more bodies for the task. It isn't long however before the psychopath is on the rampage for fresher victims...Deranged goes all out to shock from the outset. The image of Ezra carrying his dead mother into her bedroom is sickening in a way that few movies manage. The amoral attitude of the character adds to this sickness and ensures that most audience members will be uncomfortable watching this film. Deranged benefits from a superb lead performance courtesy of Roberts Blossom. Blossom does an amazing job of convincing us that he really is the psycho at the centre of the film. Usually in films like this I am firmly on the side of the killer not really caring about the victims  but Blossom is so vile in this film that I was actually praying he DIDN'T catch his prey! The film has a short running time but this time is used excellently on a series of nasty and weird sequences and the movie never really lets the pace go once it has set itself up. On the whole this film has gained itself a cult following for a reason. It's certainly not for everyone's taste and it's not as good as the most famous of the films that the story has influenced  but if you like your cinema to grisly and shocking Deranged is a film that you should seek out!".

Deranged is shocking insensitive coldhearted and features a 'youdon'tlikeitgotohell'honesty you can't possibly walk away from! This is the pretty damn factual and therefore hugely disturbing reconstruction of the case of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. This guy was crazier and far more dangerous than any fictional horror character could ever be and therefore he was a nearly endless source of inspiration for independent filmmakers who wanted to bring a horrific tale. Deranged appears to be very cheap and amateurish but it's one of the rare films in which the low budget production values actually contribute in making the story more grim and realistic! Ed Gein really was a poor and simpleminded farmer who went absolutely berserk after the death of his beloved mother and he refused to accept her passing away by replacing her with cadavers that he kept in his house. The characters' names have been altered as well as the timing of the story but Ezra Cobb's actual crimes are frighteningly truthful and portrayed with a chilling eye for detail. The film's biggest trump is unquestionably the casting of the rather unknown actor Roberts Blossom whose impressive and straightfaced performance will make you more than once wonder whether he isn't a real madman! Other aspects that definitely increase the creepiness are the constant funeral music that guides the film and the colorless depressing set pieces. Deranged is not a total gorefest mainly due to the lack in budget but the murders are nonetheless explicitly illustrated and quite bloody. Strangely enough the film's devastating tone is regularly undercut with brilliant flashes of morbid black humor like Ezra's encounter with an overweight widow who talks to her deceased husband. In short Deranged is a typically 70's cult treasure that should be watched by every horror fan on this planet.".

	schema:reviewBody "This flick came out the same year as Texas Chainsaw Massacre but as TCM became an instant hit this became a creeper that slowly turned into a classic because so far up to this writing this is the closest story to the real life events of serial killer Ed Gein. There were a lot of flicks about insane Ed Psycho 1960 maybe also coming close but Deranged even as it isn't that gory after all tells us the story in details. But it's also Robert Blossom Ezra Cobb who gave a convincing performance that made this flick watchable. Also this was Tom Savini's second flick were he did special effects. And it shows because it took years before this flick came out full uncut. By this writing it's finally out on Blu Ray worldwide in a stunning version with lots of extra's and also full uncut which means that the brainscooping scene is here to watch.It doesn't stand up to today's standards which Texas Chainsaw Massacre still does but it do has a few 'deranged' scene's. The blood is so typical of that era thick red stuff running and it even runs from a nude girl hanging upside down. One of the notorious scene's and even killings of Ed Gein. Pat Orr played the full nude part and was never seen again in another flick. And I must say that she gave an excellent performance as Sally. This flick is only watchable for freaks out there who like stories about serial killers and also for those who liked the old school horrors made just before the gore came in in the slasher era. I can't say that it's slow but the horror lays in the story itself. Worth picking up.Gore 15 Nudity 055 Effects 25 Story 45 Comedy 05".

In a matter of time the graverobber discovers that fresh living tissue will work better on Mama than dead tissue.I really enjoy it when I stumble across a film that I've somehow missed over the years. I finally pickedup the Motel Hell  Deranged disc from MGM. The reason was Motel Hell not having heard much about Deranged. Discovering Deranged on the flip side of the disc was like finding money under a couch cushion  a very nice surprise. It's got most everything one could ask for in a horror movie  twisted characters flowing blood a familiar but compelling story and dead bodies everywhere. But the thing that most impressed me was the acting. Roberts Blossom gives an outstanding performance as Ezra Cobb. There are actually moments when you forget you're watching an actor and really believe what the character is doing. Blossom did that for me. It was as if I was watching a real person. Mannerisms facial expressions voice look and actions seem absolutely real.Even though the MGM disc is cut I still found many of the scenes very violent. I thought the waitress' death was brutal until I saw what Ezra had in store for the hardware clerk. It's not for the squeamish and not something you see in movies made today. It's raw and brutal. There's real violence without a happy ending. The movie is not however without a touch or two of comedy that work on some level. The best of these scenes is the contact with the spirit world scene. I actually laughed out loud.If you can find the Motel Hell  Deranged MGM disc I would highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Deranged";
	schema:reviewBody "A film inspired by the notorious killer Ed Gein has Roberts Blossom portraying Ezra Cobb a man who slowly grows sociopathic after his mother dies. We see more of how Cobb becomes crazy rather than his killing which comes out towards the end.I felt the film is completely a black comedy playing off the absurd gimmick of documentary even having a narrator popping in at times to tell us this and that about Ezra. It's straightfaced but one can see this is supposed to be parody. I'm pretty sure many might find this film a tasteless exercise sending up a sick individual who did horrible things but I felt the filmmakers were stating that Ed Gein was an absurd person quite deranged and aloof. He was quite simpleminded and a shutin from the outside world where his whole being swirled around the care of his mother. The mother complex one associates with Norman Bates in PSYCHO is played to the hilt here as we see Ezra seeing images of mom warning him about sin and it's curse to those who commit acts of lust. The film really has a weird vibeas I'm sure we would all feel weird if we peered into Ed Gein's nights at homes with his dead skin and body parts..and dear old mamaonce Ezra begins to bring home corpses and chats away with them believing wholeheartedly that they were quite alive. He even admits to having bodies in his house to neighbors who laugh it off as if Ezra is just joshing with them. That whole not taking Ezra serious attitude may've cost lives because once he admits to holding the body of a missing waitresswe see what happens to her when she tries to escape Ezra's clutches while throwing the corpses at him in desperation only to receive a femur bone to the skullhe is on a dark path to kill as many as it takes for fresh skin. The film really has only two disturbing death sequences the waitress and a beautiful young girl operating the register of a department storeshe is the girlfriend of Ezra's neighbor's sonwho almost gets away until she walks right into a bear trap her boyfriend's father just planted down.I think what makes this such a unique experience is that the film starts as a very dark comedy showing how goofy a man completely cutoff mentally from those around him living in his own created world can be in a realistic way. The bodies in his home is absolutely abnormal obviously but somehow seeing this man joyous with these lifeless shells of former people is fascinating in a sordid sad sort of way. He never much had a chance of a normal life because of his unfortunately sheltered upbringing specifically with how he was told by his mother that females were nothing more than sluts with disease. The film then takes a very disturbing ominous turn once Ezra begins selecting and destroying innocent women who have no ill will towards him and seem comfortable around him.The film lives and breathes because Blossom is absolutely convincing as an Ed Gein sociopath. I accepted completely as this strange quiet man whose little normalcy dissolves when he wishes to preserve the corpses in his home. The film is also quite well made despite a very low budget which can often either be a hindrance or a blessing. In this film using unfamiliar faces is indeed an asset as I felt it was as if we were watching real people in a grotesque situation no one could've imagined. I'm sure the Ed Gein situation was the same way.".

He digs her up and pretends she is alive but as if that weren't insane enough he has to get her some companions dig them up as well or even provide fresh corpses. While all this is going on nobody seems to suspect Ezra despite him leaving clues mostly comments all around him.Alan Ormsby's script is nothing short of superb. Seeing the black humor behind Ed Gein's story he incorporates it with great success. Apparently Gein showed his collection of corpses to children and told townspeople that he was more or less responsible for these actions nobody believed him quite simply thinking of him as eccentric and probably with a weird sense of humor. Ormsby who also shares codirecting billing here includes many downright hilarious scenes where Ezra brilliantly played by Blosom admits to his doings and isn't taken seriously.The nasty bits are also all too well depicted. The movie is gruesome with some startling gore and some very disturbing moments showing the extent of Cobb's mania. When showing off his skills to a soontobe victim his collection of manmade objects like a banjo made of human flesh... well I just get the creeps. But nothing packs more of a wallup than the final scene where Ezra hunts down his last victim. This is shocking stuff indeed and it's all true.Orsmby who also penned the excellent Deathdream cooks up one hell of a story depicting one of the most notorious maniacs ever. By focusing largely on the humorous aspects the story the film is all the more memorable but it's not for the squeamish.I think it could be a little longer though 80 minutes sure go by fast.".

In my many years of viewing I've never seen a weirder guy given so much screen time. But then his cadaverous frame and skeletal face are perfect for the role. Based loosely on the demented obsessions of 1950's Ed Gein the movie really delivers the goods. So why the disclaimer about no intended relation to persons living or dead when everything indicates Gein. For legal purposes I guess. The girls may be prettied up but nothing else is. Those desolate rural settings underline the desolation of Ezra's's state of mind. No wonder he goes nutzoid. Though not played up the real Gein apparently decorated his house interiors with human skin stolen from graveyards. But then the movie has enough to do with outfitting rotten corpses at the dinner table. And that's the horrorfest's weakest point. The death masks and skin effects are cheaply and poorly done. Then too I've got mixed feelings about that sadistic chase scene at the end but I guess they figured a bangup climax was needed. And they got it but in a stomach churning way. Surprisingly this cheapo is very competently made from the performances to the direction to the photography. All in all I can see why it's apparently become a cult classic. And oh yes I won't be traveling in the woods anytime soon thank goodness. Nor for that matter do I expect to see Blossom in a Hollywood picture book though he certainly merits it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ezra Cobb Roberts Blossom loves his mother and is intimated by women. When his mother dies he still hears her voice and decides to keep her around the house. But he does not want his mother to get lonely and has to get her some new friends...Blossom is amazing as Ezra Cobb. You can say what you want about this film but one thing you cannot say is that Blossom is a horrible actor  he made Cobb come to life and seem as believable as such a character could be. Cobb being the movie version of Ed Gein is more or less exactly the way I picture Gein being. Blossom's facial expressions make this whole picture worthwhile.I would like to commend them for the faithful version of this story. So many people take the Ed Gein story and add all these elements to it or just take a grain of it and run wild as in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or Silence of the Lambs. While not all of this movie is factually what happened in Gein's life the similarities are quite striking  right down to the death of the hardware store clerk and the gutting of the woman like a deer.Although this film is now almost forty years old almost nothing is lost from the passage of time. In some ways the film quality really adds to the setting the story could only take place in the past. Another great feature is the narrator who enters the story at random intervals to do an overview of the situation. Not only is he great but watch the camera  in one scene the camera leaves Ezra in one room goes to the narrator and returns to Ezra in another room in a seamless fashion no cuts or edits and visually showing the passage of time. It is quite well put together.For a great Gein film check this out. Whether Tobe Hooper admits to it or not I do not know but he owes a debt to this film much as John Carpenter owes a debt to the late Bob Clark  who coincidentally produced this. This film is plotted wonderfully acted wonderfully and flows wonderfully. With one small detail changed the plastic looking blood this would probably be considered a lost classic. Heck maybe it already should be. Okay and maybe we should not be able to read the license plate saying Ontario.For a bonus not only is the legendary Bob Clark an uncredited producer but Tom Savini worked as a makeup artist for the film's corpses. This was Savini's first film and the undisputed horror effects master is still going stronger today.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie indeed is disturbing and Ezra Cobb certainly is deranged. I must say Roberts Blossoms was perfect for this role. The themes and actions portrayed in this film are truly sickening but what do you expect about a movie based on true events concerning one of history's most notorious serial killers Ed Gein. Though some murders are extremely brutal DERANGED never gets excessively gory at least not in the version I've seen. Tom Savini even was involved in some of the makeup effects but they don't live up to his later work.Though DERANGED is a pretty good lowbudget film for 70's standards and it does manage to shock the audience there were some things I didn't like. The first part of the movie had most of the problems. It was a bit slow with only one highlight Ezra digging up his mother from the grave and afterwards giving her new skin. Also during the first part there's a sillylooking narrator appearing into the movie from time to time. He objectively sums up some of the gruesome facts. All this might have worked during the seventies but now it's just unintentionally funny to me. There's also some attempt at comedy in a scene involving a sance and a fat lady. But it doesn't work very well. I believe that if you're making a movie with sick and disturbing themes based on true events you should go all the way and refrain from comedyaspects look for example at THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE part I. Then there was the funeralmusic in some of the scenes during the first part of the movie. At the funeral itself it was okay. But during the other scenes it got a bit annoying.The second part of the movie from the point where he picks up Mary is considerably better and even excellent at some points the chase through the woods.... So all things considered this is a decent shocking horrormovie that certainly deserves its cultstatus. But I must say that I preferred that other Ed Geinmovie IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON 2000 starring Steve Railsback. It was more atmospheric and left a bit more to the imagination of the viewer. Either way Ed Gein or should I say Ezra Cobb was one sick bastard!".

	schema:reviewBody "This amateurish utterly disturbing motion picture is likely the closest portrayal of the true account of infamous Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein put on film at least until the Steve Railsback starring movie made in 2000. No one could ever suspect or believe in even their most horrific nightmares what ghastly acts and atrocities the plainlooking Gein had perpetrated. The events and ramifications of his ghoulish activities continue to shock  sicken American more than 60 years later. The film is interesting and quite unsensational in many ways but typical explicit shock  exploitation fare in so many others. Roberts Blossom is amazing in the lead role as Cobb. He is the kind of guy you see around town and probably know one or two fellas like him. You could never think such a shy simple man could ever be capable of anything untoward could you? That was the key to his success as a killer. Who'da thunk it of a fellow like GeinCobb. Blossom is an interestinglooking actor with a memorable face. Whether his mannerisms were specifically created for the role of Cobb or if they're simply a part of who Blossoms is we may never know. Either way they add layers to what could otherwise be a onenote performance in the vein of Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre memorable only for what he does. Cobb on the other hand was a character well before he went south. One you might actually find yourself liking! The rest of the film is ups  downs. The other actors especially the woman are amateurish and it hurts the film overall particularly the overthe top fat chick who foolishly tries to get into Cobb's pants. The neighbors who take pity on Ezra and are the closest things he has to friends are both pretty good. The production design is admirable. The dilapidated house Cobb and his mother occupy feels very earthy and real not like a set. The gore effects are minimal but stomach churning in their effectiveness. A young Tom Savini is credited with them so that makes sense. For me the real misfire of the film is the annoying inclusion of a news reporter  narrator character. He's onscreen a few times and a voiceover in others. It would have been better to just tell the story straightforward without this guy or else go the full documentary style approach but Deranged tries to straddle both sides of the fence and it really works particularly well.Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Real life serial killer Ed Gein has to be the one of the most notorious and sadistic serial killers to ever walk the face of the Earth. Countless stories and films have been made about him or at least modeled after him. 'Silence of the Lambs' 'Psycho' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was based off of Ed Gein's killings. Not only did Ed Gein kill his victims but he cut their skin off and wore their skin on his body.He carved them up and took their organs and bones and decorated his house with them and even made furniture with the body parts. Gein was into some other depraved acts as well but we won't get into that. In 1974 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' was released and changed the horror genre forever. It gave us a look at a crazy family in Texas that killed and tortured a variety of people. It started with a narration by John Larroquette telling us that what we are about to see is a true story.Even the movie looked like it could have been a handheld documentary and it gave the world Leatherface. That same year of 1974 a much lesser known film known as 'Deranged The Confessions of a Necrophile' was also released. While 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' only took a little bit from the life of Ed Gein mostly being how he killed and tortured people 'Deranged' pretty much followed closely the serial killer in his life before he started his killing spree his motive to start and him committing the heinous acts.One of the only things that was changed were the names as we follow a farmer by the name of Ezra Cobb played by Roberts Blossom. You wouldn't recognize Blossom here but you'd remember him as Old Man Marly from 'Home Alone'. Ezra lives with his dying mother Cosette Lee on the farm as she constantly yells at him about the evilness and sins of all women. After his mother dies and he buries her Ezra starts to loose his mind. Several months later he digs up his mother's corpse and decides to but her bones back together to make her a full person again but he needs skin. That's when he starts digging up other corpses and soon starts murdering fresh people and experimenting with their insides to further is creations and decorate his house.This film is quite suspenseful and has a good flow to it never slowing down to a crawl but what makes this movie work most is the character development we see with Ezra. There is even a documentary feel to it as a reporter enters the screen to narrate what's happening on screen. It's a fantastic addition to the storytelling in this film. In so many movies like this we only get the crazy murderous people from the start never understanding why they do what they do. Here we get a glimpse of what a terrible life Ezra had under the clutches of his sadistic and bible thumping mother. You begin to sympathize with him and that makes him have a human quality throughout rather than the monster he really was.Blossom does an amazing job conveying Ezra's transformation into a killer as well as showing those tender and raw emotions in dealing with his evil mother. It's a truly satisfying performance as is the whole film. The blood guts and gore are magnificent too as makeup legend Tom Savini was the makeup artist on this movie making this his debut film to work on. 'Deranged' is a long lost film that most people don't know about that follows one of the most vicious serial killers that ever lived and it holds up through the test of time as well as can stand with the other iconic movies mentioned in this review.".

You begin to sympathize with him and that makes him have a human quality throughout rather than the monster he really was.Blossom does an amazing job conveying Ezra's transformation into a killer as well as showing those tender and raw emotions in dealing with his evil mother. It's a truly satisfying performance as is the whole film. The blood guts and gore are magnificent too as makeup legend Tom Savini was the makeup artist on this movie making this his debut film to work on. 'Deranged' is a long lost film that most people don't know about that follows one of the most vicious serial killers that ever lived and it holds up through the test of time as well as can stand with the other iconic movies mentioned in this review.";

The characters were good and I especially liked Lake Bell and Josh Lucas. Terrence Howard played a weirdo but complimented the overall movie. This movie is about the murder of a young woman a mentally challenged brother that was blamed for it but really a plot to cover this is what they make you think it is about and a lonely detective that cannot let the past go and grows to love this woman he trying to help dead of course.Overall 5 out of 10. There are far better ones out there in this genre but wasn't as bad as some I have seen as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in New Orleans this film is a strange mixture of genres  part film noir and part ghost story. Josh Lucas plays a detective guiltridden over the shooting of an innocent boy by mistake. He is assigned to a stakeout in an empty house across the street from a suspect Terrence Howard who is possibly implicated in a number of bizarre serial killings. The detective soon discovers that the stakeout house has a reputation in the neighborhood of being haunted. A young female musician was murdered there several years earlier allegedly by her own brother who has been placed in an asylum for the criminally insane. When the detective discovers he is able to see hear and even touch the ghost of this murdered woman played by Lake Bell he realizes that she can only find rest if he can find her real killer and thus set the brother Nick Lashaway free. Deborah Ann Woll of True Blood and Sharon Leal play friends of the murdered woman and as such their own lives may be in jeopardy. Cary Elwes stands out as the villainous owner of a country club that may be a front for drug trading. The movie is an atmospheric indie thriller that manages to be both suspenseful and moderately entertaining thanks to sterling performances from Josh Lucas and Terrence Howard. Thus far its only DVD releases that I'm aware of have been in Germany and Australia. Hopefully it will be available in the U.S. before long.".

Deborah Woll and Cary Elwes are fun in their supporting roles and it's always good to see those two. Lake Bell is very pretty  not going to win any acting awards for this  but she didn't ruin the film. I'd say the cast must not have been overly inspired  hope nobody else gives this director a shot.

In the hands of Asia a needle and thread or even a drop of water becomes a deadly weapon. Jet Li is charming as the jovial drunk womanizing Ling.

Ling and his cohorts help their friends though Ling is largely indifferent and would sooner give up the martial world for a life at the bottom of a jug of wine.

Ling and Master Wu bust out and Master Wu's powers that have been diminished because he has been skewered and hung on two burly hooks are regained through his EssenceAbsorbing Stance. Reunited with his clan and using the hooks that imprisoned him as weapons Master Wu is bent on revenge against Asia. Ling is yet again taken away and tricked by Asia and returns to the Sect only to find almost everyone killed. Master Wu Ling and the three remaining members face off against Asia but they find a hollow victory because Master Wu has gone insane and become just as drunk with power as Asia.Ching Siu Tungs world is a wild one. Seems like everyone can fly. Swordsman who split trees in half spin their swords like blender blades etc. The flick of a finger can cause instant paralysis. Characters rip up the ground and use it as a shield or summon dust clouds and blow thier opponents away. Swords whips beads of water and even glances can quickly tear an adversary to pieces. And it all comes about with natural ease. It is pure fantasy never forced and it is why his world of action can be so much more interesting than any other.

She completely overshadows everyone else despite the starstudded cast incl Jet Li. The action sequences were stunning and kudos also for the meticulous costumedesign and music score  a classic!".

The androgynous leading role also revived veteran actress Brigitte Lin's career launching scores of other copycats casting her in such roles. She completely overshadows everyone else despite the starstudded cast incl Jet Li. The action sequences were stunning and kudos also for the meticulous costumedesign and music score  a classic!";

And for those who talked about the wire works hello this is a fantasy movie and even with the wiring have you ever seen body movements as beautiful as this in other movies say the matrix? Wiring doesn't neccesarily mean it's not googd KongFu This movie has some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen wiring is only a basic requirement for action fantasies but the thing they did with the fight scene that's art man. You have to be a KongFu master and an artist at the same time to be able to design to creat such beautiful things.In short advice for people from America Europe Africa...nochinaIf you wana have a better understanding of the movie READ THE BOOK FIRST  and before that LEARN SOME CHINESE!

I still remember when these two stars visited here to promote Brigitte Lin had to escaped from being run over by her fans in Korea.She plays Asia the invincible who's gave up his manly symbol to become the best sword man. Jet li plays another great sword man who's pure sincere to his belief. On the way to find his men came across Asia the invincible several times. although Asia the invincible is a villain who's so brutal when he eliminates his enemy starts attracted to Jet li. and Jet li does too.But the development relationship between Jet li and Asia the invincible can hardly describe. actually both of them are men. It can be called Homosexual interest. but it doesn't a big deal. In fact I think this made this movie more unique and sensual joyful to watch.Striking powerful performance by Brigitte. she had been my idol for years. it's a really pity that she had disappear from the screen after getting married. it's a role really hard to play. but she's charismatic enough to command the whole movie. her last scene still haunting me. can't believe she was almost 40 when she did shoot this one.The early Jet li so cute and I really admire his martial arts skills although most of his martial arts here are computergenerated or wire actions  I can't count how many times I've seen this movie. action sequences so beautiful and stunning.

On every other fields CTHD is simply crushed by this fabulous film.  I can't believe CTHD got 22843 votes and Swordsman 2 less than 1 of that.  Mwahahahehe have all these guys missed something! PIn Asia Jet Li is very famous and most Chinese who are interested in movies will probably have seen this already.  In the rest of the world this is probably only seen by people who liked Evil Dead Raimi 1982 Chinese Ghost Story also directed by SiuTung Ching 1987 AND at recently CTHD. Featured are Recoiling whip Flying bomb Rotation of the stars massive action scene with 6 swordfighters Essence absorbing stance Invincible Dawn Kiddo and Scum Bag last two are characters.  Some of the story elements are hard to follow but that doesn't diminish the entertaining value story continues AND action continues just go see it again if you didn't understand it 8THIS is groundbreaking not CTHD.  The action scenes in CTHD may be shot beautifully and without many cuts but Swordsman 2 definitely has more fantasy and the director isn't afraid of showing blood like Ang Lee WAS unfortunately.  Swordsman 2 tries to embed the story in Japanese civil war and therefore the film starts with Japanese swordfighters speaking Kantonese though and Japanese music.  After the titles we are left with gravitydefying swordfighters of Chinese AND Japanese origin and ninjas as they fight in South China in the 22nd year of Emperor Sun.  Also there is a megalomaniac who slowly changes into a woman and there is a girl who constantly is mistaken for a man not exactly like Vasquez in 'Aliens'. Don't ask for the significance of that plz.  Swordsman 2 haven't seen part 1 yet is NOT overrated with 8.6 211 votes and provided you liked Iron Monkey WooPing Yuen 1993 this one will blow you out of your socks and chop you in half.  Finally the popular Stormriders Wai Keung Lau 1998 also couldn't come near this masterpiece.10 points out of 10 ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a nifty little martial arts film that has some great supernatural elements with a good story and solid fight scenes!. All the characters are cool and extremely likable plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. It was cool to see Jet in a different type of film and I thought the fight choreography was just great plus it's very bloody and violent as well. It's very well made and written and I thought Brigitte Lin was quite menacing as the main villain plus while I thought Yee Kwan Yan was a bit too OTT as the psycho Master Wubut he still gave me the creeps especially near the end!. Jet and Michelle Reis had great chemistry together once more and I thought Jet's obsession with his wine bottle was quite funny however the dubbing was bad as usual. This deserves it's 7.4 rating and I thought the ending was really cool plus Rosamund Kwan had a great and very mysterious character!. The final fight is extremely good and it had some cool emotional moments as well plus I loved Wu's evil laugh!. This is a nifty little martial arts film that has some great supernatural elements with a good story and solid fight scenes I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great. SiuTung Ching and Stanley Tong both do a great job here with very good camera work excellent angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is very good!. Jet Li is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable funny had a great sense of humor as always had plenty of charisma kicked that ass it's just too bad his dubbing sucked his chemistry with Reis was also on! Jet Rules!!!!!. Brigitte Lin is great as the evil Asia she was quite sexy and was wonderfully evil she played the perfect villain I loved her!. Michelle Reis is extremely cute and does the same sort of thing worked so well in Legend 12 she's wonderfully perky and just plain adorable!. Rosamund Kwan is very classy and played a cool part here I liked her lots. Yee Kwan Yan is a bit too OTT at times but he still gave me the creeps as he was quite menacing as Master Wu I also loved his evil laugh!. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. 12 out of 5 almost a .".

All the characters are cool and extremely likable plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. It was cool to see Jet in a different type of film and I thought the fight choreography was just great plus it's very bloody and violent as well. It's very well made and written and I thought Brigitte Lin was quite menacing as the main villain plus while I thought Yee Kwan Yan was a bit too OTT as the psycho Master Wubut he still gave me the creeps especially near the end!. Jet and Michelle Reis had great chemistry together once more and I thought Jet's obsession with his wine bottle was quite funny however the dubbing was bad as usual. This deserves it's 7.4 rating and I thought the ending was really cool plus Rosamund Kwan had a great and very mysterious character!.

Also I was getting confused with who was who and why people were fighting each other without knowing who each other was. Anyway if I understood what was going on I'm sure that I would have liked it a bit more but I spent more time keeping up with the plot than actually enjoying it. Average!RoundUp Why do these oriental film makers have to make there movies so confusing when the concept is about different clans. Also I'm getting really fed up with these flying on strings and fighting in midair action scenes. Most people who are into there Kung Fu movies prefer the old ones which didn't have this flying in the air rubbish. I wonder if Bruce Lee would take to this style of action scenes if he was still alive? Anyway enough of my moaning and back to this film. Jet Li puts in a good performance alongside the different characters in the film but I'm yet to see a performance from Jet were he isn't flying in the air. Hopefully I will see a more realistic action movie from this fast fighting actor when I watch the earlier movies.Budget NA Worldwide Gross HK34.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a clan who are looking for there master whilst fighting against different clans. 310".

	schema:headline " One version of a famous novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is clearly based on the same novel which has produced several other versions notably two which were done as multiepisode television programs. The earlier from the 1980s starred Chow Yunfat as Linghu Chong as the name is given in most versions and ran at 20 episodes. I have not seen this though it has an excellent reputation but the more recent version shown in China in 2000 ran for 40 episodes and was shown recently in the US on the AZN cable station under the title Laughing in the Wind. The first half of the series will be available on DVD soon. It was a superb piece of work strikingly photographed brilliantly choreographed and more importantly written and acted with a depth and subtlety that did full justice to its possibilities.This version with Jet Li has many excellent qualities but the limited running time necessary for a theatrical film plus the unnecessary addition of the Japanese story robbed it of the ability to develop the psychologically and dramatically fascinating story to anything like its real potential. I can't see the smallest relation to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which it seems to me is an entirely different kind of story. For a Jet Li fan this is one of his more interesting films but anyone interested in the adaptation of this classic novel into a truly superior dramatic version should seek out Laughing in the Wind.".

The earlier from the 1980s starred Chow Yunfat as Linghu Chong as the name is given in most versions and ran at 20 episodes. I have not seen this though it has an excellent reputation but the more recent version shown in China in 2000 ran for 40 episodes and was shown recently in the US on the AZN cable station under the title Laughing in the Wind.

I fall somewhere in between tending towards the overrated. I have watched a lot of kung fu movies lately and this one from 1991 is nowhere near groundbreaking. No one who's watched the good stuff from the '60s and '70s can claim that there is much originality in Swordsman II.This movie disappointed me because it was too ridiculous. Admittedly it was also quite funny and I don't mind supernatural kung fu. But the story and the effects never really worked that well and as someone else has pointed out the English subtitles are really really terrible.So on a scale from one to ten I can only give this movie a 5 but I will raise that to 6 because of the attractive women in it. Not only Brigitte Lin but Rosamund Kwan and especially Michelle Reis who's got some great fight scenes here unlike in Fong Sai Yuk where she was just helpless are a big bonus for this movie and makes it well worth watching.Thus 6 out of 10.".

That is pretty much the basic plot that I could follow. The rest of the movie consists of action scenes that may or may not have been sliced off of the deleted footage of The Kentucky Fried Movie and the sound effects sound like bites from he Crippled Masters. Still it is consistently entertaining in parts even if it is unintentionally funny in a lot of parts the fighters say they're move before they do it in street fighter Super Nintendo style and the brothers have nicknames like scumbag and smart ass. Li is also pretty good even if the whole sum of the movie might be a tad lowered. Biggest flaw though at least for myself was that not only was there no dubbing but the Chinese sometimes didn't match the mouths! Oh well it's worth it. B".

There are a lot of great visual ideas in this film but they are shown in one scene and that's it. I thought the snakefu and the ninjas riding giant shurikens were cool but underused. As with most Ching Siu Tung movies the action scenes are too short. I thought the final showdown was especially disappointing more verbal jousting then sword jousting. There was better flying swordplay in Butterfly and Sword.I won't comment on the acting and characters as the version I watched was horribly dubbed in Hmong.

Somehow the movie remains upbeat as Matilda is able to find someone who will love her even though her parents don't appreciate her. Young Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. Each time I watch this I am amazed at her talents at such a young age. I haven't heard of her making any films lately...I hope this is by her own choice. In addition Danny DeVito Rhea Perlman Pam Ferris and Embeth Davidtz all were wonderful in their roles as Matilda's parents principal and teacher respectively. I have read the book and yes it is different as far as the setting goes but in my opinion they've kept the main ideas quite intact. Movies are almost never the same as books because by definition they can't be. We have enjoyed watching this as a family for at least 5 years now and will continue to. I just wish they'd release a special edition DVD with COMMENTARY. I'd love to hear from Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman about the making of this someday classic movie. At least it is in my family. My criterion for a classic? We are constantly quoting its script to each other.UPDATE They DID release a special edition. It does have some fine extras but I have to wonder why in the world didn't they offer a widescreen edition? That is a big disappointment.".

I find it very odd how few people have noted Roald Dahl's literary influence on the spate of children's fantasy authors today. All the elements for Harry are here in Matilda right down to her unpleasant 'Muggle' family  the Wormwoods  and a brutish Dudleylike brother. And for the record Mara Wilson does a good job!".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't say 'Matilda' was one of my favorite Roald Dahl books as a child but the movie adaption isn't that bad. Matilda is a very bright and intelligent for a girl of her age. She's quite different from her grouchy and ignorant parents. Danny DeVito was good as Matilda's grouchy father he often plays very grouchy characters. Mrs Trunchbull is as scary as she is in the book. She's worse than mean. She's a deranged and aggressive monster! She's an absolute monster! She hates children and does nothing except bully and intimidate them. As for Mrs Jennifer Honey she's the exact opposite of Mrs Trunchbull. She's kindest and sweetest teacher you could find. She's like a mother to her school children and tries to protect them but unfortunately she to is intimidated by Mrs Trunchbull. So when Matilda develops these telekinetic powers it is up to her to teach Mrs Trunchbull an ultimate lesson. I really liked the relationship Matilda has with Mrs Honey. It reminds me of the relationships I had with certain teachers at school. So I would say this movie is both frightening and touching at the same time.".

I was teased and bullied because I was slightly overweight and I had intelligence that had others feel intimidated. Ever since then I have been drawn to movies where the victim gets revenge on hisher attackers in ingenious ways. For as long as I can remember I have always been a big fan of Matilda and it is something that I would recommend to anyone who has troubles with bullies in school.From the day she was born Matilda was the shunned one and her brother Michael was always looked at like a golden boy...almost literally. As she got older she became able to look out for herself without help from her mindless ignorant parents Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. She became able to read at an adult level by the time she was 4 and stunned the librarian while angering her father at the same time.At 6 she has longed to go to school but her father won't let her because he's running a shady business out of his car dealership and needs her as his makeshift gobetween to sign for packages. It as at that point that Matilda Mara Wilson discovers that she is able to move things with her mind also known as telekinesis. When she is finally allowed to go to school she continues to wow her teacher Miss Honey Embeth Davidtz while drawing the scorn of her tyrannical principal Agatha Trunchbull Pam Ferris as well.As time wears on she makes friends and becomes very close to Miss Honey while doing her best to dodge barbs by Miss Trunchbull. The unwavering little girl then discovers that she and her family are being watched by investigators Paul Pee Wee Herman Reubens and Tracey Walter who are determined to bring her father down. She does everything in her power literally to slow them down but it is not good enough.By the time all is said and done Miss Trunchbull is ousted from the school for good while Matilda's parents and her brother flee the country leaving the young soul in the care of Miss Honey. There are no hard feelings of course seeing as how her parents and brother couldn't have cared less about her.From start to finish Matilda is a classic that will warm your heart. It has some priceless laughs in between but what more can you expect with a child with telekinesis who uses it to get even with her bullies? While I have never read the book of this by Roald Dahl I can only imagine that it is just as good.If you've got kids who are constantly being bullied in school show this to them to send a message that they are not alone. As the title of my review states cruelty has no age limit. Kids adults it doesn't matter. There are some who are more cruel than others. It is just that simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine being born into a family that doesn't want you that despises you. Not the happiest of circumstances. This is the foundation of Roald Dahl's delightful fairy tale 'Matilda' first published in 1988. And Danny DeVito's adaptation 1996 is equally as magical.Matilda's parents the Wormwoods not only make it obvious that they do not want her around but they are also the worst sort of people imaginable. Crooks twits bullies are some of the terms one can use to describe them mature audiences can notice a hint of infidelity in Mrs Wormwood brilliantly portrayed by Rhea Perlman DeVito's wife whose invitation of the 'speedboat salesmen' into her house who are actually FBI agents in disguise is questionable at least. In short the Wormwoods do not appreciate Matilda who is actually a child prodigy who is so intelligent that she started reading at a very young age and who can eventually move things with her mind. Unfortunately her parents are envious of her and do everything in their power to make her life a living hell. When her father finally and very reluctantly agrees to send her to school it is only because he knows it is run by the devil himself the Trunchbull who some might call a woman in human form. But Matilda finds hope in the compassionate Miss Honey.This is the story of 'Matilda' in the shortest way possible. Danny DeVito has done a fantastic job as the director of portraying all the themes that make Dahl's story so magical such as the Wormwoods' ignorance and Trunchbull's horrific character in a manner that appeals to both adults and children alike. As an actor he does an equally fantastic job of portraying Mr Wormwood one of the greatest characters in children's' literature. He is simply a natural in this difficult role and is undoubtedly one of this movie's greatest recommending qualities. Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that this movie is worth watching for his performance alone.There is a lot more to say such as how DeVito adapts Dahl's vision on screen Dahl was never fond of movies or TVs himself as one might deduce from 'Matilda'. What I can say here is that 'Matilda' is certainly one of those family movies that are timeless and that are enjoyable to watch over and over again.".

First this is Dah's Matilda through and through respectful to the original. If you ever read the book you know. One has to thank DeVito to respecting the classing and making a great movie out of it instead of morphing it into something unrecognizable. Secondly the movie has a great cast that delivers from the little tiny secondary actors to the main ones. The actors chosen for the main roles and the secondary roles are so fused with their characters in my mind that when I see them on TV the Internet or a magazine I say their Matilda's character name. How can't you fall in love with Mara Wilson as Matilda? She is the quintessential Matilda to me perfect for the role great acting despite her age and the circumstances on which she filmed the movie. Embeth Davidtz is utterly sweet and adorable as the motherly caring Miss Honey. All the little actors playing Matilda's classmates are adorable and believable in their roles Kiami Davael as Lavander and R.D. Robb as Roy will always be kids to me. Playing a baddie in a way that one forgets the actor behind is just nothing every actor can do. And we have a panoply of unforgettable despicable characters in Matilda played with great passion and conviction by DeVito Matilda's father Pearlman Matilda's mother and Pam Ferris as the villain par excellence Prof. Trunchbull they are difficult not to hate and to forget.The direction production ambiance dresses and cinematography are all magic and wonderful perfect for the story. You know there are many cute children movies with good acting and characters out there but what separates Matilda from the rest is that the film has an Universal message that is still modern despite Dhal's book and DeVito's movie being oldies. So what makes this script so powerful? To start with the story treats children with respect as individuals with their own volition personality and brain. Secondly the female heroine is clever is a good person is independent and strongwilled but also fun and naughty. Matilda is not the shadow of anybody especially of any male prince or hero character she is the hero. Besides she has depth she knows what she wants she is not a pretty empty doll. Furthermore the script focuses on highlighting those elements that make any child's upbringing successful good morals care for your family and love ones respect for people and puts a great emphasis on the value of education and on working hard to achieve what you want. Matilda doesn't want to be pretty doesn't want to be famous doesn't want to be rich. Matilda wants to be loved to be happy and get an education to develop what is inside her. Matilda reinforces positive female roles in a world in which social media disregard talent goodness and hard work and focuses on looks money fame number of followers you have and on anything that is not what basically matters in life at the end. Matilda teaches children especially little girls that you don't need to be an empty doll to get what you want in life you can be averagelooking and clever and succeed at anything you focus on. Overall the movie is great fun magic and unforgettable because everything I want in a children movie is just there.".

Plus you can never beat Danny DeVito and he is perfectly fit for the role as Mr. Wormwood. Bruce is always meeting trouble and Jimmy Karz plays that perfectly.

Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are Matilda's dysfunctional parents who treat her like dirt. She has two gifts and indomitable spirit and telekinesis. She finally is allowed to go to school but the school she attends is a nightmare where Miss Trunchbull an exhammer throwing Olympian is in charge. She abuses the children physically and mentally. Eventually it's going to come down to Matilda and this woman. Matilda enlists her teacher Miss Honey who finally gives her the things she needs love and respect.

All of the frankly are fun to watch but once again it gives kids bad messages such as 1 parents are no good 2 authority figures are no good 3 you be the boss not the adult etc. etc. I know this is an exaggerated wild story but those are irresponsible messages typical of filmmakers.

As for Miss Honey I have never seen Embeth Davidtz look so lovely and that's the truth. Indisputetably the acting honours go to Pam Ferris as the tyrannical Miss Trunchball. I have never seen that side of Pam Ferris and in real life she is not as ugly as they made her. The Bruce Bogtrotter scene was enough to make you feel sick for a week and you don't feel that in the book. The added scenes like in Magnus's house was a nice touch and I also loved how dark Devito made it mixing a bit of humour too. And the music score is superb. Check it out! 1010. Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay this yet another recovered piece of my childhood nostalgia. With all these movies I can find at least one or more good things to say about them Some are even my favourite movies. I decided to look at this and... Out of all of them I find myself disliking this movie more than almost all of them.The plot is that Matilda Wormwood is a little child prodigy who is raised by a crooked car salesman and a TV obsessed mother who consistently wears bad cosmetics. She has one brother but he is just as bad as the rest are. She learns to adapt to life and how to take care of herself by the age of 6 and a half. She then decides to go to school after reading so many books from the library and her parents don't care.The school is lead by a woman named Trunchbull. What she does is think up new ways to punish children. One of them being to lock them in a closet with nails and broken glass sticking out so they can't move. On Matilda's first day Trunchbull throws a little girl out of school by her hair... Why? Because she has pigtails! Matilda's teacher  Ms Honey is pretty much the boring character of saint figure.Over time Trunchbull figures out better ways to punish children if not that then sticking their photos on a dart board and then Matilda finds powers of telekinesis which she uses to accidentally throw a neut at Trunchbull and then she decides to experiment with these powers. Then we find out that cops are watching the Wormwoods because Matilda's father is selling used car parts. When they search the house Matilda fools them by ripping off a routine from The Secret World Of Alex Mack.Then we find out that Miss Honey's aunt is Trunchbull and she might have killed her father so she can get his house and she ran away to a cottage where she lives now. Over time Matilda gets Ms Honey's childhood doll out of the house while using her powers while along the way convincing Trunchbull that Miss Honey's father is haunting her. At school she uses her powers again to convince her that he is haunting her again while convincing every kid in school to throw stuff at her needlessly. To cut a long story short and they all lived happily ever after.So you see kids the moral of the story is that if you don't like someone  drive them insane and have people throw stuff at them. I mean with better direction and writing the moral could have been to stand up for yourself but with what happens there is never any balance... All it is is being dark and cruel just for the sake of being dark and cruel. That just simply doesn't work for a kids movie. What made something like Return To Oz good was that yes it was dark as well but you have kind leading characters who want to turn Oz into what it once was and to have Dorothy reunite with The Scarecrow and save him. Here?... I don't see anything like this only one character was kind and that was Miss Honey and she was as bland and transparent as water.Here's another complaint  Danny DeVito. His character in this film is a crooked car salesman and ignorant father so essentially  he's a prick. But that is contradicted heavily when you hear DeVito's narration over what is going on... I mean he couldn't hire a narrator to do the voices? It almost points the film to unintentional humour when DeVito badmouths his daughter then you have DeVito saying what's going on as we are following Matilda. That just doesn't work.If there was anything to compliment this movie on then I would say Pam Ferris does play Trunchbull over the top in the way that if the material was better it could be laughed at. It was in such a way that I knew she was giving all she could into the role. It wasn't much but it was something. Everyone else does admittedly an okay job even Danny DeVito with his schizophrenic narration in contrast with his character.So this movie deserves a three. I can see why some people like it if they can handle my complaints. The cruelty never amounts to anything it's just being dark for the sake of being dark without balancing out the right elements to make this seem more like a funny charming whimsical adventure and less of a meanspirited and unpleasant movie that doesn't get it's moral right by never having these elements balanced out. I can see why some people might like this movie but I personally thought it wasn't that good.".

	schema:headline " Great Hathaway action tale";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is a film that inexplicably has been given little exposure to modern audiences. Paramount threw in a lot of its top talent to tell a good story with drama humor and lots of action.Nuggin Taylor Cooper has waged a oneman war against slaves ships in the 1840s. His best friend Powdah Raft has been a slaver if a halfhearted one for years. The two board a packet from Liverpool to America in a plot to undermine the slave shipping lines but also on board is their main nemesis and his sister. Naturally Taylor has a thing for the sister. When a tragic accident befalls the ship Taylor must take drastic action to save passengers and is ultimately charged with multiple murders.Cooper again plays the awshucks persona he perfected but here combines it with the literate committed character of Nuggin. Note that in the lengthy opening sequence he says nothing but is the center point of every word. Raft who was always at his best for Henry Hathaway gets crimped hair and an earring and the package works for the uneducated footloose Powdah who is ironically terrified of water. Raft's trademark unblinking stare is used to great effect and even humor. Copper and Raft who sing together so pleasantly here remained good friends after making this film.The picture took three photographers. Estimable Charles Lang split the cinematography duties with Merritt Gerstad. Gordon Jennings was in charge of the special photographic effects in the climactic ship disaster. Their decisions were mostly excellent. Especially effective were the constant tilted angles aboard ship. The blackandwhite filming offers up rich tones and texture instantly setting the stage with the slave cargo sequence. The action scenes are outstandingly photographed and executed.In period pieces Hollywood tends to go overboard with layers of decorations. In 'Souls at Sea' art directors Hans Dreier and Roland Anderson are magnificently restrained and very accurate. That and A.E. Freudeman's interior decoration make the film seem really in Philadelphia really in Liverpool and really on board a ship in 1842.This is a great example of Hathaway's work weaving appropriate humor into the human drama and relationships. There is an amusing montage as Taylor is scouring Liverpool for Powdah and that relationship's integrity is maintained throughout.This is a classic well worth making the effort to find.".

But I am pleased to report that my headline is accurate because Souls At Sea is a very interesting story about a subject barely touched upon in Hollywood's long colorful history. Reading through other reviewers takes on the film it qualifies more accurately as a semihistorical drama although not the first story Hollywood has taken liberties with. The temptation is to call Souls At Sea a 'seafaring yarn' but as I said it is heavy on talk and light on second unit work.In any case this offbeat movie has Gary Cooper faced with a moral dilemma as an abolitionist involved in the slave trade in the middle of the 19th century. His sidekick is George Raft in as sympathetic a role as he ever had and one of his best acting jobs never one of his strong points. Frances Dee is an ingenue on board the ship in question and George Zucco plays a good guy for a change. Particularly effective is the background music which won an AA nomination for composer Milan Roder. Henry Wilcoxon is an effective bad guy and Olympe Bradna whose film appearances were too few is touching as a maidservant and love interest for George Raft. Very well done as is the norm with a Henry Hathaway picture. The story is so absorbing that the viewer nearly forgets about the lack of action scenes and is well worth my rating of seven.".

	schema:reviewBody "Produced by Paramount Pictures in 1937 SOULS AT SEA is one of the great seafaring stories of Hollywood's Golden Age! A fondly remembered movie by cultists it recently seems to be forgotten somewhat in the DVD age being available only  and for many years on a VHS tape. But it thankfully now has turned up on a region 2 disc in England in a really impressive issue. Splendidly directed by a young Henry Hathaway it was photographed in glorious black  white by Charles Lang Jr.With only one lifeboat left and too many passengers to be accommodated when a great ship is sinking it is up to the Captain to decide who is to live and who must surely die. Gary Cooper in one of his most memorable roles plays the part of the man left with this decision. Also in the cast is George Raft in one of the best roles he ever played! As Cooper's friend and buddy  and leaving his tough guy mobster parts behind him  his performance here is quite different and is altogether likable and appealing. His wooing also of the lovely and gentle Olympe Bradna is touching and engaging. Their well written scenes together are heartfelt and sincere! The sinking scenes of the great ship are really well done for its time and immediately brings to mind the spectacle of the sinking of another great ship we all know so well. Others in the well chosen cast are Henry Wilcoxon Harry Carey Porter Hall Paul Fix and watch out for a young Robert Cummings.The female lead is taken by a now wholly forgotten actress Francis Dee. Dee was a popular star in the thirties appearing in the best version of Little Women in 1933 she was also a contender for the plum role of Melanie in Gone With The Wind. In 1937 the same year as Souls At Sea she starred in the classic western Wells Fargo opposite western star Joel McCrea. She had been married to McCrea since 1933 and remained so until his death in 1990. After 57 years of marriage they would remain one of Hollywood's longest unions. Francis Dee died in 2004 at the age of 94! In Souls At Sea she plays the sister of slimy villain Henry Wilcoxon who is secretly running a fleet of slave ships and whom Cooper under secret orders from the British Admiralty is sworn to put out of business.An excellent film in an excellent DVD transfer that really looks spotless. Evidently they used a brand new print of the picture and it certainly shows. However it is disappointing that there are no extras not even a trailer. But collectors of vintage classic movies will love it just the same.".

Souls at Sea is an unusual film to come from that particular studio let alone any studio for very few dealt with the slave trade as an issue.In The Films of Gary Cooper book it mentions that as elaborate as this production was Paramount had budgeted Souls at Sea for a lot more. Apparently whole sequences involving Cooper's original rescue by the slave ship a ball at Queen Victoria's court and some scenes involving capturing slaves were left out. In some lists both Alan Ladd and Ward Bond were listed in the cast and their scenes were edited out.What they left though is both a rousing sea saga and a story about the immorality and inhumanity of the slave trade. It begins in a courtroom where Gary Cooper is on trial for murder on the high seas. A verdict is about to be handed down when George Zucco interrupts the proceedings as a representative of the British government. He tells the court Cooper's real story and the film unfolds in flashback.George Raft is surprisingly good here usually he's not when he's not either dancing or being a gangster as Cooper's friend. Frances Dee is one pretty Victorian heroine and sister of British officer Henry Wilcoxon who has an agenda all his own.I wasn't surprised to learn that Boris Morros's score for Souls at Sea got an Academy Award nomination. It is particularly lovely and poignant.The climax of the film is a shipwreck at sea and Cooper's actions therein. He has to make some grisly choices some of the same ones as was previously pointed out that Tyrone Power made in Abandon Ship.The beginning of the film has Gary Cooper seizing an opportunity to save some Africans from becoming slaves. The climax has him saving some other lives in a shipwreck. The point that Director Henry Hathaway was trying to make is that as human beings all of them had an immortal soul and none deserved to be the property of another. The lives saved at the beginning and the end were just as valuable.Souls at Sea holds up well today as good action entertainment with a profound message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Our memories of historic calamity is selective  from legend the great flood of Noah and Gilgamesh from Rome the eruption of Vesuvius over Pompeii and Herculaneum from the middle ages the bubonic plague from the Reformation the St. Bartholemew Day's Massacre the Great fire of London in 1666 all the way to the Chicago fire the San Francisco Earthquake the sinking of the Titanic the Hindenburg the Holacaust of World War II and a handful of others.  No films about the Lusitania the Andrea Doria the Teneriffe Airplane catastrophe the worst aviation disaster the Wilhelm Gustloff the eruption of Mt. Pelee in Martinique in 1902 there is a book THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED which was made into a movie  but the setting was modernized or the great influeza epidemic of 1918.  Occasionally a film briefly deals with a disaster MANHATTAN MELODRAMA with the the General Slocum fire or THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS with the Iroquois Theatre fire.  It is rare for a film to pick up and plant a tragedy squarely into the conclusion of a film.In 1842 a ship the William Brown hit an iceberg and sank.  The survivors faced a problem similar to the Titanic  there was only one lifeboat and too many people to save.  The Captain Harry Carey Sr. in this movie was injured and command went to the first mate.  The mate here played by Gary Cooper had one of the most agonizing decisions any seaman faces Who will live and who must we allow to die?  He went about the grim business with determination and about a dozen survivors died.  The remaining survivors owed their lives to his decision  because he was able to keep the one lifeboat afloat by not overloading it with survivors.  However he was tried for murder and convicted of manslaughter.  The film changes this in several ways.  First the bulk of the film dealt with the slave trade slowly being made illegal by the British and U.S. governments in the late 1830s and 1840s but still supported strongly in the American South.  Much of the film deals with Cooper and his friend George Raft fighting the slave interests represented by Henry Wilcoxon  for once away from his usual director Cecil B. DeMille.  Secondly the disaster that culminates the film is caused by a fire set by a little girl Virginia Weidler  who is killed in the initial explosion.  The disaster is well handled and gives Raft one of his most poignant moments when he takes the body of his girlfriend who was killed in the disaster and places the body on her bed in her stateroom and goes down with the ship to remain with her. The actual choices of death or life is given by Cooper  and done well. Finally the court does not convict Cooper who is freed by the eloquence of his lawyer George Zucco of all people!. It is a good movie and reminds the audience of how powerful an economic group the slavers were.  Many American fortunes in the shipping trade did use slave ships for profit on occasion.  In the 17th 18th and early 19th Century it was not considered an obnoxious trade until about 1828. Before condemning Americans for being so hypocritical remember England did not finally abolish slavery until 1833 just before the death of William Wilberforce the man who led the abolitionist movement there for decades. Russia did not abolish it's variation  serfdom  until 1861 four years before the U.S. abolished it with the 13th Amendment and  Brazil did not abolish it until 1889! I might add that in portions of North Africa it is still countananced by certain governments like the Sudan.  The latter detail does not get much attention in the press interestingly enough.Why was the William Brown tragedy lucky enough to get a film of it's own?  Why no film about the loss of H.M.S. Royal George which keeled over with the loss of 900 people at anchor in Spitshead in 1782 or the Andrea Doria surely an interesting film about the great rescue of 1600 people on board is worth consideration?  Neither appears on celuloid although photos and movies of the actual Doria disaster exist.  But why the Brown?  The trial does give the film a good culmination point but the sinking has nothing to do with slavery or the slave trade!By the way the story of the Brown was repeated in a modern setting in 1957 when Tyrone Power starred in ABANDON SHIP!.  Basically the story is kept the same  overcrowded lifeboat under command of the first mate Power when the Captain dies here the Captain was Lloyd Nolan.  The only difference was that Stephen Boyd was the one survivor who tries to stop Power.  Power survives but is put on trial and found guilty of manslaughter.  Since his decisions are put into central view the entire movie deals with the emotional problems Power faces in literal life and death choices.  It is a terrific film and one of Power's three or four best dramatic performances.  Footnote to Power and his sea movie  Tyrone Power was the third of four generations of Powers after an initial ancester also known as Tyrone Power who made a huge reputation as a leading stage actor of the 1820s and 1830s in England and the United States.  His greatgrandfather was sailing home in March 1841 on the largest Atlantic liner of the day the President.  It was last seen in a hurricane swept sea off Nantucket shoals.  Nothing further was ever discovered of it. Many Americans found it a sinister coincidence that that April for the first time in our history the U.S. President William Henry Harrison died in office of pneumonia.  Perhaps Tyrone Power thought of his missing forbear when he made ABANDON SHIP that retelling of the William Brown tragedy.".

This is almost a spy story albeit about a private effort to stop the lave trade.The cast here is interesting. The most interesting thing about Gary Cooper is that his speech pattern is not his usual. He does a nice job here. The role George Raft has here is totally different than just about anything you've seen him in before. Frances Dee is very good as the love interest and as the point of friction between her admirer Cooper and her brother Henry Wilcoxon a true slaver. I always thought that Wilcoxon was an actor who deserved better roles and while he is the villain here at least it's a good role. Harry Carey has a small role as a sea captain. Robert Cummings is here in his first movie role. Paul Fix has a tiny role as a violinist. Ward Bond and Alan Ladd have uncredited small roles.The shipwreck scenes are quite masterful with a few glitches in special effects but not bad for 1937.Highly recommended just get past the first 20 minutes or so.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is only a vague memory of seeing this film four decades ago but it impressed me for several reasons. It is like ZULU DAWN but more meaningfully the story of a military defeat and massacre. It is also one of the handful of American or British films dealing with the history of ancient Greece. And it is one of the few historical films that got the facts correct.If one thinks about it Hollywood only produced five other films dealing with ancient Greece between 1950 and 1990. They were Alexander the Great directed by Robert Rossen and Jason And The Argonauts and Clash Of The Titans the latter two not about classic Greek history but about the myths of the search for the Golden Fleece and of Medusa and Perseus. The fourth film was Helen Of Troy which starred Cedric Hardwicke but introduced Brigid Bardot to the U.S.. The fifth film was The Trojan Woman a film based on Euripides' tragedy and starring Katherine Hepburn. Italian productions were better including Ulysses with Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn and all those Hercules films with Steve Reeves. But the personalities of Golden Age Athens like Pericles Socrates Plato Alcibiades never made it onto the big screen.Alexander The Great was a fairly good film and recently a new film on the conqueror was made. Also a new film about the Trojan War. Both flopped at the box office. That is why such films rarely are made  the bottom line is will it sell movie tickets or DVDs. Neither did.So it is a losing battle. But we are losing a great deal of history by ignoring it. So it is rewarding to see a production that dealt with a critical military turning point.In 490 Darius of Persia attempted to conquer the free Greek states as they were constantly causing trouble in his Greek possessions on the eastern shores of the Black Sea Asia Minor and the Eastern Meditteranean. His forces were defeated at the battle of Marathon. Marathon has been immortalized by a summer Olympic race that is named for an event in the battle how Pheiddipides ran the twenty miles from Athens to Marathon and back without rest to report the victory and dropped dead a moment after he announced it.Darius died and his son Xerxes decided to try again. He gathered the largest army in history reputedly 2 million soldiers from his empire and crossed over into Greece determined to smash Athens. However this bulky army had to go through narrow mountain passes and reached Thermopylae. Here a small Spartan army of 300 men led by King Leonidas repeatedly held off the attack. Besides showing superior military abilities to the Persian commanders Leonidas had the added advantage of having a fighting area where the huge Persian forces could not manipulate their troop size in. He could have left several times after each bloody repulse of Xerxes' men but he refused because he wanted all of Greece to prepare for this onslaught. He finally told his last messengers to tell the Spartans that his men would never retreat and would die for Greece.In the meantime Themistocles the leading political figure in Athens had been arguing for the need of the sea port to take advantage of it's big calling card  it's huge fleet. Sparta was the great land power and Athens the naval power. Themistocles started making arrangements for what would be the devastating blow to Xerxes' plans of conquest. Xerxes needed his ships to ferry his huge army back and forth across the Hellespont. Wipe out the Persian ships and their huge size was not such an advantage anymore.Eventually a traitor gave Xerxes the key to destroying Leonidas and his men  a secret path behind Thermopylae. Surrounded the last chance to retreat was rejected by the King and the men of Sparta fought until all 300 were killed. But the death toll was like that at the Alamo as the Spartans just kept killing Persian troops. We don't have the stats available but several thousand troops mostly impressed slaves unfortunately were killed. Xerxes moved onward approaching Athens. On top of a hill overlooking Salamis Bay he watched as his huge fleet was faced by a smaller Athenian one. But Themistocles had set up his ships in such a way as to get the larger more cumbersome Persian ships jamming into each other. The Greeks destroyed most of them thus making ferrying troops or supplying two million men impossible. Xerxes himself went home  he could not bear to watch what was going to happen. A Spartan led Greek army destroyed his weakened army at the battle of Plataea in 279 B.C.E. Persia never again threatened to grab Greece.The story of the 300 Spartans is now part of western legend  that against all odds and in the face of death a small force can make a difference and frequently does. Richard Egan was quite good as Leonidas and Ralph Richardson did well in a supporting part as Themistocles. David Farrar played the arrogant but ultimately humiliated Xerxes nicely. A 19th Century Australian poet Adam Lindsay Gordon wrote this regarding the sacrifice of Leonidas and his army.We eat and drink or ere we die The sunlight flashes on the sea.Three hundred soldiers feasted high An hour before ThermopylaeLeonidas poured out the wine And shouted ere he drained the cup 'Ho! comrades let us gaily dine  This night with Pluto we shall sup' And if they leant upon a reed And if their reed was slight and slimThere's something good in Spartan creed  The lights are growing dim.".

Ever stoic Richard Egan star of Pollyanna Esther and the King and other fun films does a great job of projecting the inner strength of Spartan leader Leonidas.

The problem is that they've shoehorned a love story into this testosterone charge film to the point it distracts from the rest of the film it just doesn't belong. Actually most of the early part of the film before the troops move out is rather soapy. However once the troops march the film picks up and other than the damned romance is fine film.See this movie.

The film does a fine job choreographing the 23 day battle given the budget and FX limitations of the early 60's.  Very similar to Helen of Troy in these respects.  Richard Egan was excellent as Leonidas but the script was very limiting for him and the rest of the cast. I will look forward to seeing the film that results from Steven Pressfield's Gates of Fire.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie just came out on DVD and it's something to get your hands on no doubt.The Battle Of Thermopylae is a great story of heroism and captured here with great acting and breathtaking battle scenes sans special fx. I have no doubt this movie will be remade especially since it's been ripped off endlessly especially in recent times.Let's just start with the acting. Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson are on their own great actors. The chemistry between the two actors is endearing and honest. Richardson plays the older wiser Themistocles while Egan plays the strong respectful lionhearted King Leonidas. Both of them are wonderful to watch and with Egan it's nice to see an actor who plays a role as a human instead of a Shakespearean caricature. He's stoic yet totally sympathetic. Wonderful. Geoff Unsworth and Rudolph Mate succeeded in capturing the landscape of an ancient land though I obviously was not there to verify that this is in fact what the land looked like. Come to think of it neither were any of us! So to try to criticize the movie on details with such vitriol that its as if you lived it yourself is in all honesty laughable and pathetic. Great you derive joy from nit picking a MOVIE meant to stir discussion and above all entertain. Bully for you. Regardless 300 Spartans is a great story of courage sacrifice and selflessness. Oh and it was well done. Period. Anyhow if you've got wits get this movie.".

I have no doubt this movie will be remade especially since it's been ripped off endlessly especially in recent times.Let's just start with the acting. Richard Egan and Ralph Richardson are on their own great actors. The chemistry between the two actors is endearing and honest. Richardson plays the older wiser Themistocles while Egan plays the strong respectful lionhearted King Leonidas. Both of them are wonderful to watch and with Egan it's nice to see an actor who plays a role as a human instead of a Shakespearean caricature. He's stoic yet totally sympathetic. Wonderful.

They died with the Spartans citizen soldiers and professional warriors fighting side by side for the freedom of others. If you want drama pathos and tragedy the story of some sculptor farmer or smithie with a comfortable life a wife kids and a career sacrificing himself for freedom would impress me a lot more than a professional warrior taught to treat life with contempt from the earliest age.Not that I'd call Sparta a free state. Democracy does not equal freedom. Yes they did elect their governing council but free states don't take your male children from you at age 7 to turn them into killing machines don't murder slaves as a rite of passage and don't kill imperfect babies as a matter of law. The slaves in Sparta the Helots outnumbered the citizens by a wide margin and could never become citizens themselves. Even those who became emancipated but still could never be citizens were held in contempt and fear and were often massacred. Sparta lived in perpetual fear of a Helot revolt.The Thespians were a free people who worshiped Eros and the Muses and lacked a warrior class. Their version of slavery was closer to indentured servitude where you had legal rights and could earn your freedom. Thespia was burned despite the sacrifice of its people at Thermopylae. The survivors still managed to muster another 1800 for the final battle at Plataea.Incidentally there were about 57000 Greek troops total. It was realistic that such a force could have held the pass indefinitely. Most were dismissed when the Persians threatened to surround them. The Spartans and Thespians remained behind to cover their retreat. Apparently some Thebans also stayed behind but surrendered before the final battle.".

Enjoyable movie blends historic events  drama and breathtaking fights . Every little scene has been given maximum detail as gowns environment and set design . Evocative and glimmer cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth  being shot on location in Perachora Athens Gulf of Corinth Loutraki Greece . Vibrating and shaking musical score by Manos Hatzidakis . This historical picture was professionally directed by Rudolph Mate.Other adaptations about this historic tale are the followings  300 by Zack Snyder with Gerard Butler  Lena Headey  Vincent Regan  David Wedham  when Comic artist Frank Miller saw The Lion Of Sparta as a boy and said  it changed the course of my creative life. His graphic novel 300 about the Battle of Thermopylae was the basis for 300 2006 . Its followup 300 Rise of an Empire 2014 by Noam Munro with Sullivan Stapleton  Eva Greene  Rodrigo Santoro . And a phenomenal documentary The Last stand of the 300 produced by History Channel which is totally necessary seeing it along with 300 . The film will appeal to epic deeds enthusiasts and history lovers.".

In 480BC Are we still allowed to say 'BC'? the massive Persian army under Xerxes defiantly wishes to avenge the previous Battle of Marathon ten years earlier by the Greek states It was Athens' victory we're reminded. Although the Greeks are well aware of their military prowess the fear of a much larger army concerns them to the point that some 'citystates' would be better to capitulate before the invader.Naturally the 'special forces' of the day the Spartans with their counterparts the powerful Athenians dismiss rhetoric like this in the council chamber and hatch a plot to thwart Xerxes and his army at the narrow pass of Thermopylae with its topography a natural challenge to anyone who'd invade southern Greece They don't mind leaving the rest to rot it seems!King Leonidas played by Richard Egan presents his case to the Spartan council and strangely they're dismissive and apprehensive too. The Spartan kingdom has TWO kings one it seems for fighting Leonidas and the other for answering mail or something. Add to this the fact that the 'elders' say they can't dispense with the Spartan regular army until the 'holy festival' is celebrated or observed and this spells potential disaster especially as the Athenians' head honcho Themistocles Ralph Richardson is also getting impatient and upset that such a thing could happen.The only solution to at least get a force off the ground is for Leonidas to take his personal bodyguard of 300 Spartans to Thermopylae Who are exempt from the Spartan council's decision it's sort of like having your family go on ahead. The plan is to march and await the Spartan regulars holding the pass until they get there. Other Greek states arrive also in small numbers after hearing the Spartans are leading Unaware they are a small force too.As the Persians arrive at the pass they spout off what they're going to do to the Greeks and insist they're mad attempting to fight but they're made to eat their words. With the special closein fighting tactics especially in a narrow pass the Spartans and their allies manage to rout the Persians both easily and savagely to the disgust of Xerxes David Farrar. So much so he's more annoyed with his own minions namely Hydarnes Donald Houston.The fighting continues but the one weapon against the Spartans is actually found in a Greek traitor Ephialtes Kieron Moore. He informs the Persians of a secret old 'goat track' and leads Xerxes' army behind the Greek lines. The Spartans in the meantime have sort of been betrayed by their own lot namely in that the council made a secret decision to fortify a line of defence south of the Spartans and not to venture beyond it to come to Leonidas' aid. At this the Spartans show their true mettle in stating that they gave their word to stay regardless of reinforcement and that is what they do to the last man in a final epic struggle after the betrayal. Of course it's a classic portrayal of the outnumbered defiantly making their last stand much like Custer Although in his case he was a hotheaded idiot or Rorke's Drift though not with the same outcome. A good film talky in places with typical 'sixties applomb especially a loveydovey interest in the Diane Baker and Barry Coe characters. Worth a look!".

Richard Egan and director Rudolf Mate retell the story of western civilizations survival during the battle of Thermopolaye Pass. The battle scenes are very well done with little use of complex special fx and the acting is well paced. Overall a great movie and one that is rare to find on video and goes for a premium price when found.".

Richard Egan and director Rudolf Mate retell the story of western civilizations survival during the battle of Thermopolaye Pass. The battle scenes are very well done with little use of complex special fx and the acting is well paced. Overall a great movie and one that is rare to find on video and goes for a premium price when found.";

	schema:reviewBody "Persia Our arrows will blot out the sun! Sparta Good! Then we will fight in the shade... With these famous lines from the movie THE 300 SPARTANS I decided to begin my comment since the words best resemble what clash really took place a long time ago at Thermopylae  one of the most known and captivating battles in history when a mere wave of a few free men dared say NO to the ocean of immortal Asian hoards. But there are other more important words that immediately direct our attention on the right trackOh Stranger tell the Spartans that we lie here obedient to their word. For centuries the sublime words written at Thermopylae addressed to a stranger anyone who is passing by have touched people. Artists drew paintings writers wrote stories and in 1962 Rudolph Mate used perhaps the most powerful medium of our times cinema. At the heyday of epic movies he made THE 300 SPARTANS keeping to all significant commandments of a spectacle but also maintaining other important cases that have been noticed in time.It's true that THE 300 SPARTANS is a visually stunning spectacle. But it is very important to mention that this film besides the lavish sets costumes magnificent crowd scenes made in accordance with the spirit of a colossal movie is a very captivating and absorbing insight into the historical characters. King Leonidas Richard Egan also carries human responsibilities has a wife whom he loves owns a very balanced view of his people is aware of strengths and weaknesses knows the lack of loyalty the bitterness of treason but despite all of these he is equally ready to return on the shield or with it for his people for Sparta. Phylon Barry Coe is a simple Spartan soldier who is for the time being deprived of honor to join the army. Although he loves his beautiful woman Ellas Diane Baker he is ready to march a huge distance to become one of those who fight. Being granted the right to defend his country is of ultimate importance to him that's how he was brought up that's what he has been living for. The family shame his father's treason is something he has to cope with for long but individual effort and straightforward desire make him worthy dying for ideals at last. Therefore we can as well state that THE 300 SPARTANS differs from the latest movie 300 exactly in that character development  the characters here are not only strong men who only fight well and are directed towards dining in hell but human beings with the feelings that they are bound to control psychological strength that they must retain and ideals that they live and die for.The performances are absolutely terrific though some people may not appear to be cast well to their parts. Richard Egan is marvelous as Leonidas. He has that nobility in his manners and that undeniable courage which Leonidas must have had. His best moments include the final sequence when he talks to his men We must fulfill our duty so that Sparta can be free. Ralph Richardson is very appealing as Themistocles a remarkable diplomat for whom truth is a heady wine and according to whom there are no hopeless wars but only hopeless cowards. Barry Coe in spite of his youthful face and gentle manners does a fine job as persistent Phylon. And David Farrar as Xerxes...here opinions may differ even more intensely in the latest year when we have seen Rodrigo Santoro in this role. Despite possible comparison one thing is true Farrar is too old and through his acting he rather reminds me of some experienced tired and not a very convincing ruler than the exotic vital desirous of power and honors master of Persia. Moreover the pair of Xerxes and Artemisa Anne Wakefield makes it all a bit humorous. Yet I leave that open to everyone's view. Another factor except for character development that goes outside the rules of a spectacle are powerful moments and script. They make THE 300 SPARTANS more similar to SPARTACUS than THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. The absolutely memorable conversation of Leonidas and Hydarnes Donald Houston I entailed at the beginning became a symbol of the movie in years. Another brilliant moment is at the cottage of a mountaineer Gods create beautiful women and later transform them into wives. Moreover except for many other terrific script moments Xerxes is showed at the beginning on his throne saying memorably At Marathon my father sent a mere wave now I lead an ocean. The final scene though a bit too short has an unforgettable feeling that can hardly be expressed the shields kill all Spartans but they are not afraid they are with their king. I usually reflected on the fact what really made those Spartans immortal in history was it their tragic end or the absolute loyalty and obedience that they retained to the last breath?THE 300 SPARTANS is a must see not only for history buffs but for all viewers. The film is made in an accurate way constitutes a nice history lesson that also talks to modern times and explains much from human ideals universal throughout the world history. It's a captivating story of courage loyalty ideals protection and death in dignity. No wonder why this is the film which also moved Frank Miller in his youth and prompted him to write a graphic novel and finally to make a movie. Indeed it was the time when an oasis of free patriots clashed with the desert of warriors in captivity and the oasis won in human hearts. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is so very much a film about 1960 politics. Although much better than the recent remake in terms of historical accuracy it still leaves much to be desired. The battle scenes are good but other than the flying wedge they don't fight like Greeks. Not sure why they lined them up in 3 thin rows.The thing that annoys me about the movie is that the Greeks talk about being free and label the Persians as Tyrants. The Greeks were save masters  even the Athenians. The reason the Spartans were all soldiers is because all the work in the country was done by the Messenians who were enslaved by the Spartans. In contrast the Persians empire was a feudal state where local rules had a great deal of autonomy including religion and language. The Greeks wrote the history of their wars with Persia and they biased the portrayal to make the Greeks into the good guys.Typical of 19501960 films their is a love interest that really has nothing to do with the story. The romance in the film is rather boring.I disagree with the people who criticize the film for the politics. The politics of Greece was very important in terms of what was going on and to a large extend explains the Spartan willingness to engage in a suicide mission. Once committed they had to win or die... all the eyes of Greece were watching them and only through their actions would Greece unit to defeat the Persians.In the final analysis 300 Sparatns is not about the Greeks vs. the Persians its about the western free societies vs. the USSR and the communist block. When you look at it from that point of view it makes much more sense.".

	schema:headline " Very Good Epic Retelling of a Turning Point in History";
	schema:reviewBody "The 300 Spartans is a very good mostly accurate recreation of the battle of Thermopylae. The movie details the events leading up to the second Persian invasion of Greece then shows the battle of Thermopylae. The Persian king Xerxes assembles and leads an army of some one million men an unprecedented force across the Bosphorus and into Greece. The Greek meet to discuss their options and led by Themistocles played by Sir Ralph Richardson agree to unite and meet the Persians at the pass of Thermopylae. King Leonidas Richard Egan leads 300 Spartans of his bodyguard to the pass to defend Greece while the rest of the Greeks mobilize. There's a side story of a young Spartan in love with Leonidas's niece Diane Bakerwhose father is in disgrace. The young man and his love follow the army to the pass. The Spartans are joined by the Thespians and the Athenian navy protects their flank on the sea. Mountains flank the narrow pass which is the only land route into Greece. The Persians launch an attack with some of their subject troops but the Greeks easily turn them back. The Persians then use chariots but are again repulsed. Later the Spartans raid the Persian camp at night but can't get at Xerxes. The young outcast heroically saves an officer and is accepted. The king is persuaded to use his best soldiers the Immortals who are his personal bodyguard but they are also driven back. Xerxes is about to give up the attack when a Greek traitor Ephialtes who's been rebuffed by Diane Baker offers to lead the Persians over a secret mountain trail to get in back of the Greeks Leonidas learns of the treachery and sends the other Greeks back to warn their countrymen The Thespians stay as a rear guard and they and the Spartans prepare to meet the final assault. The Persians attack the Spartans in the pass and the Thespians at the end of the trail. Leonidas orders the Spartans into a wedge to cut through to Xerxes but he is cut down. The Spartans pull back and Xerxes offers to let them go if they'll give Leonidas's body up. They refuse and are all killed in a hail of arrows. The epilogue tells how the Persians are finally removed from Greece by sea and land battles. A rather modest cast but very good actors no real big names led by the under rated Richard Egan the fine British actor Sir Ralph Richardson David Farrar chews the scenery as Xerxes Barry Coe as a stoic Spartan officer and the lovely Diane Baker headline the film. The events leading to the battle the battle itself and its aftermath are pretty accurately presented. A very good film of an important battle.".

	onyx:emotionText "The 300 Spartans is a very good mostly accurate recreation of the battle of Thermopylae. The movie details the events leading up to the second Persian invasion of Greece then shows the battle of Thermopylae. The Persian king Xerxes assembles and leads an army of some one million men an unprecedented force across the Bosphorus and into Greece. The Greek meet to discuss their options and led by Themistocles played by Sir Ralph Richardson agree to unite and meet the Persians at the pass of Thermopylae. King Leonidas Richard Egan leads 300 Spartans of his bodyguard to the pass to defend Greece while the rest of the Greeks mobilize. There's a side story of a young Spartan in love with Leonidas's niece Diane Bakerwhose father is in disgrace. The young man and his love follow the army to the pass. The Spartans are joined by the Thespians and the Athenian navy protects their flank on the sea. Mountains flank the narrow pass which is the only land route into Greece. The Persians launch an attack with some of their subject troops but the Greeks easily turn them back. The Persians then use chariots but are again repulsed. Later the Spartans raid the Persian camp at night but can't get at Xerxes. The young outcast heroically saves an officer and is accepted. The king is persuaded to use his best soldiers the Immortals who are his personal bodyguard but they are also driven back. Xerxes is about to give up the attack when a Greek traitor Ephialtes who's been rebuffed by Diane Baker offers to lead the Persians over a secret mountain trail to get in back of the Greeks Leonidas learns of the treachery and sends the other Greeks back to warn their countrymen The Thespians stay as a rear guard and they and the Spartans prepare to meet the final assault. The Persians attack the Spartans in the pass and the Thespians at the end of the trail. Leonidas orders the Spartans into a wedge to cut through to Xerxes but he is cut down. The Spartans pull back and Xerxes offers to let them go if they'll give Leonidas's body up. They refuse and are all killed in a hail of arrows. The epilogue tells how the Persians are finally removed from Greece by sea and land battles. A rather modest cast but very good actors no real big names led by the under rated Richard Egan the fine British actor Sir Ralph Richardson David Farrar chews the scenery as Xerxes Barry Coe as a stoic Spartan officer and the lovely Diane Baker headline the film. The events leading to the battle the battle itself and its aftermath are pretty accurately presented. A very good film of an important battle.";

The classic story is ripe with potential which was recently exploited to a T by the movie 300. Except for Diane Baker the acting in THE 300 SPARTANS is wooden and the direction is uninspired. A bit too Academic for my taste. The story went on with almost no sense or purpose and it spent too much time on the Diane Baker subplot when the main story should have been sufficient for an entire movie.Personally speaking the movie lacks the qualities seen in Italian made Sword  Sandal films of the same period which were so much more rowdy and lusty compared to the big but staid Hollywood BiblicalHistorical epics. The same thing could be said of Spaghetti Westerns of the same period which were so much more organic groovier and pushed the limits of the genre compared to flat and predictable Hollywood Westerns. I can only imagine how much more spirited this film would have if it had been produced by an Italian crew and not by 20th Century Fox. Oh well.".

I was born the year the movie was made so some films from the late sixties do seem a part of the fabric of my own life.  I do understand how fans can get very passionate about a particular film even a bad one.  For me reading Leonard Maltin's negative review of CAMELOT felt like a slap in the face as a six year old child I loved that musical and saw none of the flaws.  I'm not poking fun at anybody who loved this movie I'm just giving my honest opinion about what I watched.I do want to point out one great fight scene before I start trashing and that is the one near the beginning in Xerxe's tent where the former king of Sparta duels with Xerxe's best swordsman.  Great sword play.  Also the scenes developing the story of how the 300 Spartans ended up in their legendary predicament are well written.All in all however this film viewed objectively might offer something to history buffs but mostly deserves the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment.  As noted by other reviewers there are major blunders galore. In particular the fight scenes are full of playground scuffling and some editing embarrassments.  My favorite editing gaffe happens at 1264244 on my DVD when an extra gets his finger stubbed by one of those spears with the wiggly rubber points.  Watch it a few times in slow motion for a belly laugh.  And also notice how many of the lamely thrown Spartan spears start going buttend towards the Persians.Remember the scene where a Spartan patrol raids the Persian camp?  They come up from the beach dressed in full armor but when the patrol was organized Leonides asked for good swimmers.'  Even Mark Spitz the famous US swimming gold medallist couldn't have swum two yards wearing bronze torso armor helmets and swords and carrying spears and shields!  Leonides should have asked for his best waders.  And for a sneak attack they were all decked out in bright scarlet robes and even scarlet bristles on their helmets!Am I missing the realism here?Enough about the action bloopers.  Acting is a significant element even in action epics.  We have Sir Ralph Richardson giving a fine Shakespearean performance as the leader of Athens and early on it does add a touch of class.  Soon though his performance makes all the other subpar acting look just horrible.  As for the few romantic scenes they are done so woodenly that we can clearly see that here is where George Lucas got his inspiration for directing the love scenes in STAR WARS II  ATTACK OF THE CLONES.It's a shame that so little was presented of the life and customs of Sparta which would have been far more interesting than the celluloid wasting romantic subplot.I didn't catch any specific political allegory as some other IMDB reviewers did but the notion of Greeks as freedom fighters opposed to the Persian slavers was played up.  The fact that Greeks also used slaves wasn't mentioned that I remember.  One scene seemed to be particularly vicious demonizing for 1962  Xerxes ordered his army's women slaughtered so that his soldiers would be more motivated to capture the Greek women.  This may have been historical but for such an old movie this seemed especially blood curdling.Wasn't ancient Persia mostly what we now call Afghanistan Iraq and Iran? Hmmm.Maybe this would be a good time to remake the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 1962 excellent historical drama takes us back to Ancient Greek Times during the Persian Wars. It's the very known and yet inspiring titanic struggle of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians under Spartan king Leonidas's Richard Egan leadership in Thermopylae versus the huge army of Persian King Xerxes who attempted to bring to an end the freedom of the independent Greek States incorporating them within his vast empire and become world's ruler. Although it ended in victory for the Persians the battle is noted primarily for the bravery shown by the Greeks and in particular by the Spartans and their king Leonidas I who won eternal fame as the ultimate symbol of the heroic death. The 300 Spartans revives the Battle of Thermopylae in this unfortunately not very known production of 20th Century Fox. Rudolph Mat both directed and scripted the movie brilliantly. The usual prerequisites of impressive costumes and sets and massive battle sequences that all Hollywood epics circa the mid '50s to late '60s had are all present in this film but unlikely to other contemporary historical films the script is historically very accurate inspired from Greek history. The battle scenes filmed in their original location in Greece are well made for it's time and hundreds soldiers of the Royal Greek Army take part as extras. Manly Richard Egan holds the main role of King Leonidas and replies in perfect Greek Molon Lave come and take it to Persian threats. Sir Ralph Richardson as Themistocles and David Farrar as ruthless Xerxes give memorable performances. Also note Anna Synodinou a great Greek tragedian actress in the role of Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo. Handsome Barry Coe Philo and lovely Diane Baker Hellas play a young couple of Spartans in love. The problems begin when they learn that Philo's father is collaborating with the Persians along with the exiled exking of Sparta and Xerxes's military adviser Demaratos. This love story although fictional adds a romance's tune to the whole plot. Kieron Moore stars as repulsive Ephialtes the Greek traitor who advised Xerxes that by following a mountain path the Persians could outflank the Greek forces. Manos Hadjidakis conducted a wonderful melodious musical score for this movie".

It's also fairly unoriginal as it's merely one of many Godzilla knockoffs made cheaply to make a quick buck. Still if you want to watch a cheap kaiju knockoff with shock violence it's worth hunting down a copy.

	schema:reviewBody "This is regarded as the worst kaiju eiga ever made. I believe people always have a right to their opinions but this is vastly underrated. This film about an obsessed paleontologistdubbed by Robotech's Greg Snegoff who comes back to his home town in search of a plesiosaur living in the lake. A pteranodon also makes an appearance as they duke it out at the end of the movie. There is graphic violence in this film but it's used quite effectively in quick cuts sending a jolt to the viewer. Most notably is when we catch a glimpse of a girl's bloody thrownup arm and a headless horse. The music by Masao Yagi is of the times but is often effective and very original. It's unheard of for any monster movie to have a stylish jazzy film score. The precredit sequence is eerie. The cinematography is atmospheric showing the misty forests of the lake and MT.Fuji. I admit this is a bad movie but one that should looked closer on artistic terms. However the movie has some obvious logic missing. Why would the reappearnce of dinosaurs cause massive earthquakes? Why would the ever so dormant MT. Fuji erupt after such a long time? How could anything hatch from a petrified egg?Also plesiosaurs and pteranodons ARE NOT dinosaurs. The best scene in the movie is when the ptreanodon attacks some villagers. The editing is top notch and the discoesque music that plays over it adds to the fun. The most disturbing part of the scene is when the winged reptile picks up a victim flies high into the air and sadistically drops him. The dubbing is also very good. If you're a fan of Kaiju Eiga or bfilms pick this up.".

Godzilla and his palsenemies were on vacation and had become too beloved Gamera was for the kids and you can forget about another Gappa or Dogora movie especially the former. When was a studio going to make a kaiju flick for a more grownup audience? Granted there already was one of sorts with The Last Dinosaur and there would be another with next year's The Bermuda Depths but how about something with a little oomph factor that others seemed to lack? You know exploitable elements. That's what they tried to do with this movie.The story deals with an egg that hatches and unleashes a none too friendly Plesiosaur who has taken a liking to munching on the citizens. To make matters worse a Rhamphorhynchus also comes into play and as will happen in these movies a fight's going to break out. Oh and there's some s!t involving a scientist and a hot girl but I really didn't care about that.As I said Legend tends to offer a few things that other kaiju films of the time didn't offer namely gore and nudity. Granted the female nudity is brief and the gore is mostly of the found a severed limb variety but it was more than other such movies were presenting. At best the people behind this at least deserve kudos for that.Sadly there isn't much else worthy of kudos. The two creatures we get are unconvincing and goofy even for the time and one can just imagine audiences in Japan laughing their asses off at the sight of these creatures. Then there's the score from pinky violence regular Masao Yagi which while catchy is a jazzy score that really doesn't fit the proceedings. Hearing bouncy jazzfunk play while a girl is menaced by one of the least convincing dinosaurs ever put to screen is funny no matter how you stretch it. The conclusion is also too bleak for a movie like this. I wanted the hero to come out on top here but that doesn't happen which just left me scratching my head.The biggest problem though is that it really isn't that much of a kaiju film. Granted it's not the worst one ever made that some make it out to be I'll take this over Gamera vs. Zigra any day of the week but it's still nothing much and that's mostly because at the end of the day it's nothing more than a rip off of a certain shark movie Spielberg directed. No matter how you dress it up it's a knockoff of a much better movie and not even a very entertaining one at that.While it deserves credit for trying be a kaiju flick for adults Legend of Dinosaurs and Monster Birds isn't much to get excited for. Believe me you've seen better and all the brief boob and butt shots in the world won't change your mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie and yes this is the kind of monster movie where the soundtrack is disco. I know in other countries like Italy and Germany the goofy disco soundtrack is replaced scary music of their own. While the special effects are typical Japanese kaiju stuff you see I would have to say that these monsters could be OK if there was a bit more money put into it. It looks like Manda from ATRAGON let himself go and fights Rodan's cousin. The film is a mixture between EARTHQUAKE JAWS LAND THAT TIME FORGOT THE GODFATHER and RODAN. EARTHQUAKE because there is one. JAWS because there are various scenes that copy it. LAND THAT TIME FORGOT well the monsters come from a lost world. THE GODFATHER because there was a horse with no head. RODAN well isn't it obvious? A pterodactyl that came out of an egg in a cave. I mean these dinosaurs look realistic that they should be in a KING KONGtype movie. I bet this movie was a response to the Dino De Laurentiis version of KING KONG. Originally Toei wanted to make a movie in coproduction with British horror film company Amicus to cashin with the 1976 remake of KING KONG with a movie called KONGORILLA. With a script written by Tudor Gates this was going to be good but it never got made. Then in 1979 Toei in coproduction with American film production Punch Productions called MORTAL. This was about a giant ape that comes out of a Mount Fuji to attack Tokyo in search of food. That never got made unfortunately. Plesiosaur and the Rhamaphryncus akin to the TRex and Triceratops in THE LAST DINOSAUR look realistic and would good for the 1976 remake of KING KONG if Dino would put in some dinosaurs. I think this movie was made as a response to the 1976 KING KONG because this movie THE LEGEND OF THE DINOSAURS a.k.a. THE LEGEND OF THE DINOSAURS AND MONSTER BIRDS along with THE LAST DINOSAUR PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT PLANET OF DINOSAURS and WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS are saying that everything is better with dinosaurs. This is something that dinosaurs can do. Dinosaurs have potential. Would I recommend it? Yes. If you like dinosaurs watch it. If you like Japanese monster movies watch it. If you like disco watch it. So give it a watch. Not rated but due to the gore in it it should be rated PG or PG13. Bottom line Good for bad movie night.".

	schema:headline " This Japanese film really amps up the blood but it is still rather dull in places.";
	schema:reviewBody "This one had potential unfortunately it moves so slowly that it kind of shoots itself right in the explosive tank. The film is about mysterious killings in a lake and does follow a basic 'Jaws' formula for the first bit of the movie. They wait awhile to reveal the beast then it is finally shown killing a couple of guys who played a very bad prank. The film follows a man who wants to get to this area near Mount Fuji where there has been mention of a petrified egg. He thinks that perhaps there is money to be made from this discovery. Strange though that they mention this discovery as no scientist actually sees this but rather a woman who falls into a cave and then runs from the forest in a panic and falls into a coma shortly thereafter. Why this makes the news is beyond me. Still he gets there and there start to be strange incidents happening such as a horse with its head bitten off. After a bit the dinosaur comes in chomps a few people and then near the end the bird of the title swoops in and makes an impressive first appearance. Of course the two duel in a very unimpressive battle that made me lower my initial score of six to five. This one had potential they just needed to have more bloody kills and less banter. Sure they were copying Jaws but this film was not going to be in that film's league as far as acting and atmosphere so you have to go the bloody route. They did but not quite enough. They even managed to show the naked rear end of a lady so for the most part this one was quite different from most Japanese monster films of its day. Just needed more monster action. Though one thing I notice a lot of people saying about this is that the people in the film seem to say that the appearance of the dinosaurs causes the volcano to erupt but in actuality the scientist is saying that if there was a dinosaur present than the conditions are such to release it from its slumber and one of the conditions is that there is going to be an imminent eruption of Mount Fuji. However for the most part the film has way to many plot holes and such and suffers from not enough monster action.".

	schema:reviewBody "Between 1936 and 1956 during his tenure in America the German director Fritz Lang made some of the most psychologically astute movies ever to come out of the studio system often working with the flimsiest of material pulpish fiction indeed. Most of these films were thrillers though perhaps only in the most nebulous sense of the term dealing instead with the psychosis of the killer or as here with the iniquitous motives of those on the periphery of the case. 'Plot' in the strictest sense of the term never really interested Lang 'the story' as such being secondary to the observational detail and the characterizations. In While the City Sleeps the serial killer whom we expect to be at the centre is sidelined to such an extent that catching him is never the focus of attention. He's the 'McGuffin' if you like for an entirely different movie one in which the thriller element is dispatched in favour of a study of greed and the relationships not always savory between men and women.The film is set in the world of newspapers and news agencies so you expect an aura of venality from the outset. Vincent Price is the vain selfcentered scion of a recently deceased magnate who has taken over his father's business and wants someone else to do all the work. So he creates a new executive position then sets three of his top men against each other vying for the job. The one who 'catches' or names the serial killer terrorizing women in New York gets it.Like many of Lang's films While the City Sleeps had the tawdry feel of a Bmovie. There is a kind of rough urgency to it that a more mainstreamed movie might have lacked. You could say Lang's genius was for making silk purses out of sow's ears. He didn't work with 'stars' but character players. About the biggest name in the movie and the 'star' of the picture is Dana Andrews superb he was a very underrated actor as the Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who like many of Lang's characters is less noble than he first appears. As for the rest despite there being two Oscar winners in the cast George Sanders one of his poorer performances and Thomas Mitchell excellent they were mainly the stable diet of the Bmovie though that said there is a terrific performance from the underrated Sally Forrest as Andrews' girl who he is not above using as bait to catch the killer and a typically flamboyant one from Ida Lupino.After this Lang was to make only one more film in America before returning to his native Germany the equally cynical Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. Indeed it's Lang's cynicism and his critique of American values and mores that set him apart that put him like those other European migrs Otto Preminger and Douglas Sirk at a critical remove from his American counterparts. In this respect perhaps the only American who can be compared to him is Samuel Fuller.".

	schema:headline " One of the Best Newspaper Films a Taut Drama of Ideas and Actions";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my favorite film of all time on the absorbing subject of how to and how not to run a newspaper after The Fountainhead. The very clever main plot concerns what happens at the Kyne News Service when its founderboss dies suddenly his corrupt heir soon decides to stage a contest among the heads of the Service's three divisionsto keep them under his thumb while he pretends to be bosswhile Ed Mobley the boss's former heirapparent refuses to ask to participate. The machinations of the three aspirants are then played out against Mobley's pursuit of a rapist known as 'The Lipstick Killer and Mobley's pursuit of his skittish fiance who has her own doubts about him and the situation. The authors of the piece in the first half of the film seem to my standards do have done better than anyone else ever has in presenting the point of view of those who define cover and are affected by 'the news'news of the day or more lasting sorts. This classy but never glossy BW film was very well directed by veteran Fritz Lang with screenplay credited to Charles Einstein and Casey Robinson. The sets by Joel Mills are very good lighting is excellent and the costumes by Norma and music by Herschel BurkeGilbertare seamlessly good. But the fascinating element in the film for me is the very good acting Lang gets from a mixed cast of young and veteran performers.

As the three division heads the viewer has the fun of watching George Sanders Thomas Mitchell and James Craig with the ladies who complicate their lives being hardboiled Ida Lupino Rhonda Fleming at her best in every sense and lovely young Sally Forrest. Everyone is very good indeed. Mobley is played very well by Dana Andrews. John Drew Barrymore is the killer in his first major role and his longsuffering mother is played by Mae Marsh. The climax of the film comes when the killer stalks Mobley's fiance and he has to wonder even if he succeeds in setting her up in a successful trap  rigged for the man who's already stalking her thanks to his having taunted him on the airwaves whether she will still want him or not. The climax is active and satisfying and the denouement and ending even better. This is a firstrate and wellremembered film that just missed being even greater. I never miss it and my advice to anyone is to adopt the same attitude.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is my favorite film of all time on the absorbing subject of how to and how not to run a newspaper after The Fountainhead. The very clever main plot concerns what happens at the Kyne News Service when its founderboss dies suddenly his corrupt heir soon decides to stage a contest among the heads of the Service's three divisionsto keep them under his thumb while he pretends to be bosswhile Ed Mobley the boss's former heirapparent refuses to ask to participate. The machinations of the three aspirants are then played out against Mobley's pursuit of a rapist known as 'The Lipstick Killer and Mobley's pursuit of his skittish fiance who has her own doubts about him and the situation. The authors of the piece in the first half of the film seem to my standards do have done better than anyone else ever has in presenting the point of view of those who define cover and are affected by 'the news'news of the day or more lasting sorts. This classy but never glossy BW film was very well directed by veteran Fritz Lang with screenplay credited to Charles Einstein and Casey Robinson. The sets by Joel Mills are very good lighting is excellent and the costumes by Norma and music by Herschel BurkeGilbertare seamlessly good. But the fascinating element in the film for me is the very good acting Lang gets from a mixed cast of young and veteran performers.

Admittedly this is pretty typical of movies of the kind but that doesn't make it any less stupid.

Meanwhile a serial killer is stalking the city strangling young women in their homes. With this story becoming big news Kyne Jr decides how he will appoint his new Ex Director  it will be the first of the potential employees to bring him the scoop on the Lipstick Killer as he is known.With an intriguing plot and an impressive ensemble approach with the casting this film offered much and although it could have been darker in tone it still offered a lot of potential to be a slick urban mystery. The story is basically a mystery where a group of mercenary journalists compete for a top job by trying to catch a serial killer. Typical for this sort of thing the journalists are all hardtalking and harddrinking while still being likable rogues to a man the driven edge they have offers much but the film doesn't follow through  for example I was shocked by the idea of Mobley offering his own fianc up as bait but disliked the way she treated it as a bit of a laugh and didn't respond convincingly. Likewise the story contains adultery and betrayal between the characters and while it hints at much it doesn't throw up as many ethical shadows as I felt it should be doing. Regardless of this the story is still good the mystery aspect is not that interesting and despite the fact people were being killed I didn't ever feel like it was a race against time or anything. What the story does better is to develop the various characters and draw the drama from their relationships and tensions.For this reason the ensemble cast does pretty well and features a host of big names. Andrews is the lead of the group and he has a good presence although I would have liked him to be a little bit less likable and be as ethically questionable as his methods suggest he was. Sanders is not that great mainly because his material is not as strong conversely Craig is better because his material is more interesting. Price is good in his role and Mitchell provides good support and fits the newspaper editor stereotype. Fleming and Lupino are much better than Forrest who is a bit weak when viewed alongside such actors. Barrymore Warwick and others do well in smaller roles but the guy who played the Lipstick Killer was a bit of a pain as he seemed to relentlessly ham it up and skulk around all to obviously.Overall though the film stands up and is an enjoyable ensemble drama with a bit of mystery tension. The actual race to find the killer is less of a draw than the tensions between the journalists and their partners and it never got as exciting as it should have done but it is still interesting. Viewers who like their noirs to be a bit murkier and darker may be disappointed to find that the script hints at darkness but also keeps everyone likable  a failing I must admit bothered me because I could see the potential but other than this it is still worth watching.".

He dangles a carrot in the form of the so called Lipstick Killer who is terrorising the city which ever of the men helps to snare the villain so shall they be the one who nabs the coveted position.Fritz Lang's second to last American feature is one of his most cynical pieces of work. Film consists of two plot threads deftly coiled together to create an ironic whole. As the brutal Lipstick Killer goes about his dastardly business the men of the media stoop to amoral lengths chasing the prize offered up by Walter Kyne. There's barely a decent person to be found even the women who form part of the guys lives are dubious one is having an affair another is only too happy to seduce one of the men to feather her own nest. While the only innocent member of the group Sally Forrest's Nancy Liggett her reward for being a loving innocent is to be offered up as bait for the Lipstick Killer and this by the guy we were thinking was our hero of the piece! Lang is clearly enjoying putting the killers lust on the same playing field as the media employees greed. It's not for nothing that the director correlates for two separate scenes that of the killer's mode of entry with that also used by Andrews' Edward Mobley as he boozily plays up to his girlfriend.Oh you men you're all polygamists.Casey Robinson's screenplay thrives on adult speak as it sets about unwrapping the characters keeping the story complex enough to make us take in every detail. There's always something telling going on and with a rather impressive group of actors assembled for the film it never sags in pace or become dull as a story. There's also plenty of suggestion thrown in as the narrative pings with themes of power politics and sex played out either intriguingly in all glass walled office space or in the confines of the bar down on the street. Although it's mostly talky stuff Lang manages to wring out plenty of tension from a number of dialogue exchanges while the murders themselves carry with them the requisite nasty bite. What is disappointing is that the big chase finale thru the train subway system is rather tepid which without Laszlo's photography would be instantly forgettable. And the absence of a telling score is also felt which is annoying since the booming intro music over the credits promised so much.The stand out performance in the cast is from Lupino who revels in playing Mildred Donner as a vamp who knows what she wants and plans to get it. Oozing wily sex appeal as she gently gnaws her glass after getting the go ahead for seducing duties or raising temperatures as she suggestively takes an offered cigarette with her mouth. Andrews is fine though he struggles to play drunk with any conviction and Sanders is on oily autopilot. Price has foppish down comfortably while Mitchell is his usual watchable self. Fleming looks great and gets the bikini moment to show off her curves although her role could have done with some expansion and Forrest eases into a virginal role all in white she be the white rose in a bed of thorns. Interesting is Barrymore Junior as the killer no spoiler since Lang shows us it's him from the off he does a nice line in twitchy and sweaty for the Mama's Boy Killer putting some memorable insanity pathos into a scene as he is taunted on the television by Mobley.Far from perfect but always of high interest While the City Sleeps great title in terms of characterisations is a Lang essential. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "While this is the sort of film that will not appeal to everyone particularly teens and action film fans this is a very well made drama from famed director Fritz Lang. Unfortunately for Lang his success directing American films was very limited and he eventually moved back to Europe soon after completing WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS. It's a shame really because many of his films such as SCARLET STREET and this one were darned good films but weren't blockbusters and weren't received too well by the public.This film stars one of my favorite actors Dana Andrews though he is certainly NOT the entire showas he has many fine supporting actors to make this movie about the future of a media empire quite interesting. Towards the very beginning of the film the owner of a news wire service newspaper and TV news empire diesleaving the future to his ne'er dowell son Vincent Price. Instead of picking a man to head this organization he deliberately pushes these men to try to undermine and outdo each other to garner his favor! At the same time there is a plot involving a serial killer which soon takes up most of the film's focusparticularly Dana Andrews'. How all this is worked out is pretty interesting and seemed pretty realistic. While not a great film it was very good and is worth your time if you'd like a more cerebral type film as opposed to an action or suspense film though there is quite a bit of both towards the very end.".

Well he won the bet.This is basically the story of interoffice politics in a large newspaper empire as the main protagonists vie for the job of Executive Director I thought that the head honcho at a newspaper was the Editor. The catalyst is the infamous Lipstick Killer murders and all concerned are trying to beat the others to the punch by solving the case and thereby securing the sought after position. Not a bad premise but it just 'aint working here.Dana Andrews plays a star reporter who drinks way too much art imitating life and plays around on his girlfriend. Vincent Price is the spoiled owner of the newspaper who is married to the twotiming Rhonda Fleming. George Sanders is his usual suave self.....and Thomas Mitchell is.....well just Thomas Mitchell. Ida Lupino is a catty and notsonice columnist and her real life husband Howard Duff shows up as the police officer. And then there is John Drew Barrymore famous son and father as the killer. What a strange dude! It all sounds good right? Wrong!! It drags it gets a little bit silly and you really don't care who gets the stupid job anyway. And Lang said that this was one of his favorite films. He must have been in his dotage. There is no comparison here with his master works of earlier times.It's not a complete waste of time since there are fine actors here doing their best. Some might like it but it is sadly lacking in excitement and the Fritz Lang magic.".

Hitchcock of course treated the subject of a motherfixated psychopath just a bit better a few years later and I would doubt he learned much from his great contemporary's earlier take on the subject.Mixed in with this is a weird background story of three prominent newspaper staff members set against each other for the top job on the paper by a miscast Vincent Price as the heir to the paper's owner who conveniently dies barely minutes into the film. The late mogul's preferred choice to take over the reins is crusading Pulitzer Prize winning author and now occasional reporter and TV broadcaster Dana Andrews whose character appears more often drunk than sober and who has an unattractively offhand way with his adoring girlfriend at one point offering her as bait for the killer without even asking her. To be fair this race to the top amongst the three contenders holds almost no viewer interest and only detracts from the main plot. Throw in Ida Lupino as an onthemake female reporter content to seduce Andrews at the behest of her equally miscast editor boss George Sanders Rhonda Fleming as Price's philandering wife and Sally Forrest with a trendy boyish hair cut as Andrews' too young nowsheloveshim nowshedoesn't girlfriend and there really are too many cooks spoiling this particular potboiler.There are also several scenes which are just plain odd like when Lupino's character attempts to beguile Andrews by using an oldfashioned supposedly salacious spectrograph which turns out to contains an image of a swaddling baby or when Price in a natty pair of shorts practises his putting while in conversation with his statuesque wife who is striking poses in her beachwear. The film really had no attractive characters and the female characters in particular are poorly written. There is a noticeably adult approach to the filming of the looselytermed love scenes one especially where an adulterous conversation is played out with a bed prominently in the background and the final attack on Price's wife is noticeably realistic but this film lacks the imaginative flair of director Lang's best work and ranks as one of his few failures in my book.".

Amos's megacorp domain is comprised of a major newspaper a television station and a wire news service. It's bequeathed to his singular beneficiary his pariah son Vincent Price who hits the ground running to establish that he's not his father's imbecile offspring by devising a new top executive position to act as his man Friday and run the whole enterprise and grants the candidacy to be among the city editor played with Thomas Mitchell's infectious presence the head of the wire service played with George Sanders' Transatlantic adaptation of his unabashedly British persona and the photo editor played with James Craig's oldfashioned American masculinity. The plotting Sanders and the factotum Mitchell egotistically vie for the job and struggle to crack the headline murder case feeling that the one who solves that case will get the job. At the same time Craig is having an affair with Walter's eyepopping wife Rhonda Fleming and hopes to get the job through her seductive wiles. Pulitzerwinning reporter and the station's commentator played by the always appealing laidback Dana Andrews is unwilling to get involved but after all does and signs on to help his close friend Mitchell.Fritz Lang's 22nd Englishlanguage film which itself interestingly is a conglomeration of film noir psychological thriller and sociopolitical drama is a complete observation of the modern media. It applies to a media empire which merges newspapers wire services photography and television. All of these come under acute and generally cynical analysis in this film. The utter notion that so many different media are all amalgamated in one company scares this film's forever socially concerned director Fritz Lang who sees the makings of fascistic tyranny here something of which his own firsthand experience surely made him particularly wary.The K symbol that is everywhere in While the City Sleeps as the insignia of a media empire. One recalls that in real life the CBS eye was part of the first successful corporate logo and corporate identity crusade of any modern corporation. It is intriguing that Lang with his eye consistently scanning for the cutting edge of communications would give the media empire in his film such a syndicated characteristic. Real corporate media offices look significantly flashier than the dishwater headquarters of the media in Lang's film.The media show up in other more esoteric ways as well. The bar is rife with photographs ostensibly of celebrities who've stopped off at it. The photoviewer maneuvered by Ida Lupino who plays Sanders' star journalist with detached intensity evinces Lang's strong interest in new media. Even the car chase at the end of the film involves a car knocking over a mailbox part of the broadcasting framework of contemporary civilization.Somehow the killer who is psychologically troubled and cannot help himself is treated in a more sensitive depiction than any of the cutthroat newspaper people. He is played by John Drew Barrymore in a vivacious and edgy performance. He is sporadically seen but with intrigue as we almost always see him alone and even once at his home with his mother a wrenchingly sad scene. Even the story's apparently most upright character Dana Andrews utilizes his girlfriend to get what he wants which is not necessarily worlds apart from what Craig's character does. The essence of the story is seen through the glasswalled newspaper offices and all the deceitful daytoday goingson there are disclosed as Lang secures his most severe reckoning on the indiscriminately aggressive newspaper people who could so easily forfeit their dignity for control fanfare and affluence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang is widely regarded as one of the leading directors of his time so a look at 'While the City Sleeps' one of his last films should provide an interesting insight into where the art of cinema was in the mid1950s. By far the weakest part of this film is its ludicrous central story about a weird psychokiller who likes to leave clues for the police whilst murdering without rational motive but who is ultimately outwitted by a cleverer opponent. This is not a good plot but it is one that continues to be reused to the present day. Much stronger and equally modern is the irreverent subplot about a group of cynical journalists in a Murdochstyle media conglomerate jockeying for position and hoping to ride to success on the back of their coverage of the slayings. The film cuts between the different story lines with speed and humour and the dialogue is quite sharp. However the general level of realism is much poorer than in in today's films the action scenes are especially weak and there's a stagey feel even when the script is at it's most sparkling. And while not a criticism of the film it's also dated by the titanic quantities of drinking and smoking engaged in by all the characters did anyone ever live past 50? Still overall there's a lot to enjoy here pleasures offset principally by the regretful discovery that Hollywood's misguided fascination with mindless massmurderers is anything but a new phenomenon.".

The overabundance of subplots just adds to the plodding nature of the story.".

Nancy is set up with her permission as a target for the Lipstick Killer who uses his delivery job to unlock apartment doors by pushing in the button and then returns and kills his single female victim.Though a little slow at times While the City Sleeps is more of a newspaper story than a mystery so there isn't a lot of suspense or excitement to be had.

It looks good with the cinematography excellent even in the final chase and the score has some hauntingly atmospheric themes. The dialogue is arch and sharp with a cynical yet involving tone and the story even in the more talky moments and there are many of those is compelling with some tension. Lang's direction is accomplished as are the cast. Dana Andrews is solid in the lead while Ida Lupino oozes sex appeal and Vincent Price is wonderfully snide and unprincipled. George Sanders brings an oily if not exactly subtle nature to his role Thomas Mitchell is again memorable and there is also a menacing performance from John Barrymore. Overall a solid and interesting film though not the best work that everybody here has done. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "A few years earlier RKO would have shaved the subplots and made the kind of tight little noir the studio was so good at. A decade earlier cult director Lang would have shaved the subplots and made the kind of nifty study in perverse psychology he was so good at. But this is 1956 and TV is replacing the Bmovie. So a budget studio like RKO is especially scrambling for a new formula. Unfortunately what they come up with here is a sprawling story with a bunch of hardtofollow subplots and a cast of aging stars for marquee appeal. The result is a turgid 100plus minutes and except for Andrews and Mitchell a waste of some very fine actors.Maybe you can follow the power plays going on among the eight or so cast principals. After a while I gave up. Folks interested in newspaper stories might find the movie worthwhile. To me however the various machinations come across as little more than glorified soap opera in dull shades of gray. The movie does come to life when Lipstick Killer Barrymore Jr. comes on screen and the palaver pauses for a refreshing few minutes. Too bad the screenplay didn't allow Lang to focus more on one of his specialties the killer's interesting mental state. But then the script had to multiply the subplots and the superfluous scenes so as to accommodate the various star cameos they were paying for. There may be a good story buried somewhere in the pottage and there are some snappy lines but the overall result lumbers along Lang or no Lang. Speaking of censorship the curvaceous Fleming's various poses and sexy calisthenics along with the script's smirking innuendo typifies how the industry was reacting to the challenge of TV despite Production Code constraints and definitely dates the production to that era. In passingis it my imagination or does the circleK logo of Kyne enterprises duplicate the logo for Kane's publishing empire in the much superior Citizen Kane 1940 and if so what would be the point? Also kine is an archaic term for cows just as swine is for pigs. Was that intentional and if so what would be the point of that? Anyway the movie shows clearly RKO's floundering efforts during a period of general studio decline.".

But then the script had to multiply the subplots and the superfluous scenes so as to accommodate the various star cameos they were paying for. There may be a good story buried somewhere in the pottage and there are some snappy lines but the overall result lumbers along Lang or no Lang. Speaking of censorship the curvaceous Fleming's various poses and sexy calisthenics along with the script's smirking innuendo typifies how the industry was reacting to the challenge of TV despite Production Code constraints and definitely dates the production to that era. In passingis it my imagination or does the circleK logo of Kyne enterprises duplicate the logo for Kane's publishing empire in the much superior Citizen Kane 1940 and if so what would be the point? Also kine is an archaic term for cows just as swine is for pigs. Was that intentional and if so what would be the point of that? Anyway the movie shows clearly RKO's floundering efforts during a period of general studio decline.";

Barrymore overplays as usual. The only surprise and only performance to make any impression is Vincent Price as a callow newspaper heir.Amazingly after Moonfleet which is superlatively composed Lang handles the wide screen very flaccidly the loose framing matching the lack of tautness in the plot. Most of the lighting is flat too though an occasional shot of rich contrast shows what the film might have been had Lang been at the top of his form. Production values are also no more than average with the same unattractive sets being used again and again. Music and other technical credits are equally undistinguished.".

The trailer showed very little so I looked up the film on IMDb and found an average review of 5.1. Nonetheless I watched it anyway and I must say I was not disappointed.Perhaps my expectations were low given the reviews but I also think that with the type of 'Martial Art' films coming out nowadays it seems a fight scene that has been adulterated with showoff moves is coming hard to find. Scorpion does not do this. It shows not just the sport but the powers behind it as brutal and unforgiving in and outside the ring.The film opens up a well for the main protagonist to deal with his personal flaws which we see head on in an early scene. It really allows us to see a flawed fighter lacking discipline due to inexplicable rage despite his love dedication and respect for the sport.Fight scenes are not as extravagant as something cooked up in a current Jet Li film. They are raw and closer to something seen on UFC. If anything I respected the film for this. The scenes made more sense and they weren't about declaring a winner or making our protagonist look like a superhero. What was there was pure and a lot more believable that what is seen in movies today.By the end of the film the was a real sense of accomplishment for the major characters. Loyalties shifted to where they were of genuine importance and there was a learnt understanding for the key characters of why those of us need strength through violence to survive through difficult circumstances whereas others find that violence itself is no substitute for things in life that are more important.I would urge those who prefer classic fighting movies to watch this but that wanting another over the top severely choreographed Jackie Chan showoff ride should look the other way.".

And he is getting better appreciating life again...The music is giving the right atmosphere.

	schema:reviewBody "Remarkable. Touching. Riveting. Leaving Las Vegas is all of these and then some. I have not seen a film of this magnitude about loneliness and acceptance in such a while that I was in tears for much of the run time.Nicholas Cage is Ben a man who has lost his wife and child throws his job away and takes all of his remaining money to buy as much liquor as possible and drink himself to death in the city of Las Vegas. He has given up all hope with no wish to live but for one reason or another wants a companion to share in his misery but not try to save him. He finds this companion in a hooker Sera played by Elizabeth Shue. They immediately form a strong relationship based on one night of talking about their lives. Sera in particular quickly grows attached to Ben for no other reason than she has been alone her whole life and wants nothing more than to feel that want and need by someone.Cage won his first Oscar for his role as Ben and how deserved it was. He was astounding perfection down to every single tick the volume of his voice the pain and tragedy buried in his eyes. I could not believe the extent of his role the dedication and time he invested in bringing this character to life. Same goes for Elizabeth Shue who with a simple glance at a person she reveals her entire self and no one even dares to notice except for Ben. This neediness is apparent she wants to hold onto this relationship so badly yet what makes their relationship work is total and complete acceptance of their respective decisions. He will not tell her to stop being a hooker and she in return can never ask him to stop drinking. And it is in that factor that makes this film worth watching. To be totally accepted by those around them to open themselves up to such an extreme.Leaving Las Vegas is a sobering film about connections loneliness acceptance and a small little island of hope that is Ben and Sera. They are two good people depicted in a world full of sorrows and misdeeds who latch onto each other and never let go. They were nothing but ghosts till that chance encounter and became each others worlds. Cage and Shue bring these good people to life in such an extraordinary way making Leaving Las Vegas a film to be treasured and remembered for years to come. I highly recommend this film.".

Both actors are superb and bring the excellent screenplay to life with the help of some masterful dramatic cinematography.Cage plays a suicidal alcoholic who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death and Shue plays the unexpected problem  a prostitute who falls in love with him. The only reason this film did not receive a ten from me is the voiceover technique which was tastefully minimal but in my opinion the only mistake the director made. It does help to provide closure but I felt that closure was an unnecessary compromise here.This is not an entertaining film and in truth I am surprised by its popularity among typical audiences. It is a serious film and a work of art but fun is not to be found here. DO NOT see this film if you dislike feeling emotionally drained and ethically challenged and DO NOT see it if you are very prone to boredom or easily offended by sexual violence substance abuse and the horror of daily life on the street. This is an intensely sad film about love shared by people who are caught in the gravity of their lives and can not escape. It is also a story of redemption and respect found in improbable places. It is NOT a funfilled frolicking romantic comedy but rather the opposite and it achieves a beauty dignity and power almost unique among films treating such starkly real and disturbing subjects.".

	schema:headline " The chemistry between Cage and Shue is sizzling...";
	schema:reviewBody "Mike Figgis directed beautifully 'Leaving Las Vegas'... His film resulted audacious fiercely realistic... Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism The Lost Weekend which won four Academy Awards including Best Actor for Ray Milland and Days of Wine and Roses depicting Jack Lemmon as a charming drunk who loses his job because of this and brings his wife Lee Remick down with him...In 'Leaving Las Vegas' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic divorce... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships... He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one extremely difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark filthy motel room rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in film and surely it will leave you terribly moved... Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes moral pronouncements and to his credit the film remains honest to the end never sinking into sentimentality...His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri's greatest international success 'La Grande Bouffe' BlowOut a black and highly flatulent comedy that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973 about four middleaged men who gather in a wellappointed villa to eat themselves to death...'Leaving Las Vegas' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken writer and a selfassured 500anight young hooker with whom he crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible and moves for Vegas to literally drink himself to death... Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson the alcoholic who is resolute and actually thoughtful about his selfdestruction..Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom of a swimming pool... He drinks and drinks 'til there's no more... And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary's that he asks he explodes overturning the table of Blackjack where he was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a little orange juice... Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite beautiful and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a highclass call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very puzzling for her terrible lifestyle and her strange desperate attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love... Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never happen... After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs she takes Ben under her wing and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of coldness... She complies to Ben's own terms and vows to never dissuade him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love she even buys him a silver flask for a present while inside she is desperate to find some way to change his course as well as her own...

	onyx:emotionText "Mike Figgis directed beautifully 'Leaving Las Vegas'... His film resulted audacious fiercely realistic... Hollywood had great success with movies about alcoholism The Lost Weekend which won four Academy Awards including Best Actor for Ray Milland and Days of Wine and Roses depicting Jack Lemmon as a charming drunk who loses his job because of this and brings his wife Lee Remick down with him...In 'Leaving Las Vegas' Figgis captures the chaos inside an alcoholic divorce... He shows the complexity of life and human relationships... He invites us to use our imaginations about a suicidal alcoholic... He never really explained how his character is bent on killing himself nevertheless his powerful message remains a very sad one extremely difficult to embrace... The final scene in a dark filthy motel room rank as some of the most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen in film and surely it will leave you terribly moved... Figgis treats his two leading characters tenderly... He never makes moral pronouncements and to his credit the film remains honest to the end never sinking into sentimentality...His style as his story remembers me Marco Ferreri's greatest international success 'La Grande Bouffe' BlowOut a black and highly flatulent comedy that won the Grand Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973 about four middleaged men who gather in a wellappointed villa to eat themselves to death...'Leaving Las Vegas' is the depressing love story of a failed drunken writer and a selfassured 500anight young hooker with whom he crosses paths... It is an appeasing tale of a dedicated drunk who downs entire bottles of hard liquor in several gulps... He is on the way down and he recognizes it... He is an ecumenical drinker who wants to destroy everything that remains of his old life... He fills his supermarket jumbo cart with as much booze as possible and moves for Vegas to literally drink himself to death... Nicolas Cage is remarkable as Ben Sanderson the alcoholic who is resolute and actually thoughtful about his selfdestruction..Ben admits he has nothing to live for and he wants to die... He swills vodka from the bottle in the shower... He drinks greedily at the bottom of a swimming pool... He drinks and drinks 'til there's no more... And when he discovers that the Casino does not offer the Bloody Mary's that he asks he explodes overturning the table of Blackjack where he was gambling... He wakes up at night shaking so much he can merely crawl to the refrigerator and intensely swallows Vodka mixed with a little orange juice... Elisabeth Shue proves to be a revelation as Sera.. A polite beautiful and sensitive blonde woman who prides herself on being just a highclass call girl... Nevertheless her vulnerable character is very puzzling for her terrible lifestyle and her strange desperate attachment to a sadistic pimp Yuri Butso... Sera meets Ben and inexplicably finds herself attracted to him... She soon develop a rich closeness that can nearly be described as love... Ben continues to tell her that true love between them could never happen... After Yuri is soon out of the way by Russian thugs she takes Ben under her wing and attempts to fill a need in her life much like Ben fills his needs with liquor... Both share a common bond of misery and loneliness... Sera cares for Ben enough to handle his drunken bouts of coldness... She complies to Ben's own terms and vows to never dissuade him from his suicidal goal... Out of sheer love she even buys him a silver flask for a present while inside she is desperate to find some way to change his course as well as her own... In one of the most revealing scenes at a desert resort she drowns herself in sunlight and liquor to seduce Ben... She tries to love him and in his infrequent getaways of semisobriety he attempts to love her back... The opportunity is shattered as Ben without an ability or desire to change becomes for her a tragic portrait of life without hope... How foolish of her to push him to select...Shue keeps all the way an intriguing character extremely human... She is good and tender... Never tough or cynical...

	schema:reviewBody "To me this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on. If you are interested in seeing a pure love one that is not focused purely on sex but instead emotional and mental connectiveness then this is the film for you. While others will argue that this is not the best date film I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer. It is a gripping story of realistic love and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone. It is about dreams companionship and the hurdles of everyday romance. This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love. Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the classic lovestory moments while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly money isn't everything characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.Let me explain this further. When you think of a love story what are the elements that you consider? You have a guy and a girl normally they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma there is a factor of insecurity and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location normally an airport. Does that sound familiar in any way? These are all elements that you can find in LLV. I have seen this film at least a dozen times and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me. This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone. While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute I saw it as the classic story of love. All the elements are present. Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex they immediately form this bond that will never be broken. Through Ben's drunkenness he remembers her and continually wants to see her. They both have internal factors that hold them back Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking. Even through there are these factors they still find themselves together. That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else. It all seems to fit. Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe. These two are in love and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been finetuned were those involving Julian Sans. I just couldn't capture his character. I needed a bit more backstory or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera. Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared. Outside of this one element the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal. For example when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own she chooses to forgo her independence and be with Ben. Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is. It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship and probably has never had it all her life when suddenly Ben struts into the picture. This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn't have to. She is used to the job she thrives for the intensity and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben. Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment. Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves Love Liza and All the Real Girls. This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film. While it isn't the lightest film of the ages it does prove that Love is a very splendid thing.I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood. I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets. Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart. It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again thanks to summer blockbusters it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre. The same goes for Shue. While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time outside of Adventures in Babysitting it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.Overall this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.Grade  out of ".

Based around the semiautobiographical novel by John O'Brien an alcoholic who committed suicide before the film made it to the screen this is a sad dark and deeply upsetting picture. Sanderson and his plight has no motive we are not fed reasons for his nihilistic behaviour. We find him at the beginning of the film joyously hurtling thru a liquor market isle promptly filling his shopping cart with bottles of liquor.

Nicholas Cage as Sanderson is terrific very compelling realistic and segueing from zany wired comedy to the desolation of Sanderson's death wish descent within a heart beat. Elisabeth Shue as Sera is also incredibly potent if perhaps guilty of looking too pristine and prompting questions of why she would be drawn to Ben's world anyway? Shue none the less works her socks off to make Sera sensitive and believable.

	schema:reviewBody "I am not quite sure why Leaving Las Vegas was held in such high regard upon it's release in '95. This film was an abysmal failure in just about every respect. I guess if you enjoy seeing beautiful women bare their breasts frequently the film will succeed for you on some level. But Nicholas Cage's character is pulling more trim than James Bond. He can pound a 5th quicker than Blutarsky while operating a motor vehicle with such precision that he can outsmart a cop on a motorcycle who actually happens to witness him chugging vodka while driving down the Vegas strip. I guess the moral of this movie is any slim middle aged guy with a receding hairline could wallow through life acting like a pitiful drunken buffoon with a tolerance that would probably have eclipsed Farley's and have gorgeous women constantly throwing themselves at them.The problem here is with the casting. Perhaps I would have been able to take this material more seriously if Brad Pitt Johnny Depp or Zac Efron were cast instead of Cage. But even then you're still faced with the dilemma of asking yourself why a would a person want to kill themselves when they have all these beautiful women aggressively forcing themselves on them 247. Elisabeth Shue channels Jennifer Jason Leigh as the hooker with a heart of gold. Her relationship with Cage does not amount to much more than mutual self pity for one another. Cage and Shue's chemistry seems forced. The film's frank and explicit sexuality appear to be the main selling point. Leaving Las Vegas may be memorable in terms of shock value and pushing Rrating boundaries but that is pretty much it. Literally every scene will leave the viewer scratching their heads. At the beginning of the movie Cage is in a liquor store filling his cart to maximum capacity with top shelf liquor and then in the very next scene they show him in a seedy bar begging the bartender to pour him another shot. The scene where Cage crawls to his refrigerator and fumbles for a beverage is supposed to be a serious moment depicting the hell of going through DT's as a result of severe alcoholism. But Cage's idea of method acting in this scene is apeing Jim Carrey from Ace Ventura Pet Detective . Cage convulses violently as if he just grabbed a live electrical wire after getting out of swimming pool every time he takes a swig. There is another scene at a casino where Cage wants a drink real bad and he loses it flipping over a blackjack table in the process. Cops politely gently escort him away with genuine sympathy. Even the dealer looks like she has fallen under Cage's spell. Whether it's a cop or a hooker everyone Cage encounters in Vegas seem like they are extremely concerned  care for him deeply. Even a friendly bartender working in a dive bar which gets little business refuses to serve Cage and begs him to seek help. Nobody ever seems the slightest bit annoyed by his buffoonish drunken antics  save for woman who runs a hotel and kicks them out after Cage shatters a glass table outdoors. Shue's character seems flabbergasted that the hotel manager isn't ready to take a bullet for the two of them.Don't let Cage's Oscar win fool you. Leaving Las Vegas is a pedestrian effort in every respect. Upon it's release Mike Figgis was hailed by critics as the next Scorsese. 14 years later he is unheard of. Perhaps one could conclude LLV was a bit overrated upon it's release and did not hold up over time. That person would be correct.Top it all off with a terrible original score by Sting. Leaving Las Vegas is an thoroughly unimpressive unintentionally laughable film that smacks the viewer in the face with it's implausibility at every turn. A movie you will not forget anytime soon.".

Quite simply I found it so horrible to watch it made me realize that I generally go to movies primarily to be entertained.  Sure sometimes I might be in the mood for something thought provoking rather than outright entertaining but Leaving Las Vegas was neither as far as I'm concerned.The story essentially is about a man Nicholas Cage who despite success in his career has seemingly lost his family due to his drinking and he has made a decision to go to Las Vegas and spend the rest of his money as he intends to kill himself drinking.  In Las Vegas he meets an unlikely kindred spirit in a hooker Elisabeth Shue and they embark on a rather untraditional relationship with nothing positive to be gained as a result of it.The initial problem for me was I didn't like either the characters or the premise.  I found Cage to be without any value whatsoever and the movie would have been much better and shorter albeit entirely unnecessary if he had just killed himself immediately and spared the audience from having to watch it.  I had no empathy for him and the sad situation he had gotten himself into.  Shue was slightly less pathetic I suppose but I still didn't find myself caring what happened to her.  I'm not sure what about Cage's performance made it worthy of an Oscar he just acted like himself but a little bit dopier.. big stretch!  Overall I found it an extremely unpleasant film to watch to put it mildly and I resented having wasted 10 on tickets and over two hours of my life suffering through it.  I have never hated a movie with a passion as much as this one.  Not recommended for anybody as I fail to see what one could derive from such a movie.  Rating 110".

It takes a special kind of writer that can take the time to develop such complex character traits that he laid down for this tragic tale.In this movie Cage's character falls into the almost unheard of category of someone who has convinced himself that his life is over and selects suicide by alcoholic consumption. I know a lot of drunks but none that I can honestly say ever really could be defined as trying to drink themselves to death although quite often their friends and family would tell them this if only to try to shock them into sobriety. Usually they were just a party person that somehow lost control. Just before they realize they are at death's door they say help me! or some inane thing like that but it's too late by then.Cage's character's burning of his possessions among them pics of his family? his feeble bleat of I'm sorry to his boss upon being fired his almost apologetic proposition of Shue's character all of these defined someone looking desperately for pity but really defined a person who could care less about whatever the future held for him as long as it didn't allow him to suffer too much.Shue's character on the other hand is the classic co dependent sufferer. She personifies a kind of long term Stockholm syndrome by accepting all this abuse from her pimp in nearly unconditional submission and then blaming herself for his eventual destruction that she really had quite a bit to do with but absolutely no control over. These flaws are not all that uncommon. Society would like you to believe they are uncommon but our overcrowded prisons and unfortunately sometimes morgues belie that assumption. In real life there is usually an underlying belief or condition that justifies this situation in the mind of the principle and sometimes these beliefs and conditions are just about as weird as you can get but usually the principles have no trouble accepting them. The usual exception is that in the movies these people are all beautiful as they are in this one but in real life they all look like they belong on the Jerry Springer show or perhaps Jerry Springer rejects which is just about unimaginable. Am I making sense? Anyhow the characters in this movie react to each other in situations so unlike what 99.9 of us ever experience that it fascinates us that is why we watch these movies. We tell ourselves So this is what some people's lives are like? Wow this is fantastic but it could never be me! And then we watch the film credits and turn off the TV and go off to bed. Sometimes we have nightmares. I didn't. Didn't even consider it. Just too far fetched to ever relate to my life. Thank god!".

	schema:headline " Incredibly realistic very credible an excellent movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In today's society we have many diseases.  AIDS cancer tuberculosis... However a very underrated and in my opinion deadly disease we seem to forget is alcoholism.  Being an alcoholic is like being drugaddicted.  You may think it is easy to quit drinking but it is as hard as dropping drugs and once you've stopped taking alcohol you can't ever have any again or you'll simply go back to alcoholism.  This issue is the principle theme of Leaving Las Vegas.  However in the movie we see as well how alcohol can grab a person and this person will never want to quit and even less hear people asking him or her to see a doctor to quit drinking.   Prostitution may be considered by many to be something of very low class but for some women it is the only possibility they have to make some money. Some prostitutes are independent and others have a pimp.  In Leaving Las Vegas Elisabeth Shue works for a pimp with whom she has a relationship.   Finally the last issue in this movie is love.  Love with a prostitute more specifically.  In 1990's Pretty Woman Julia Roberts refuses to kiss her clients on the lips to avoid making a connection with them.  In this movie Elisabeth Shue does not even talk about this for she believes to be strong enough to avoid any relationship that a client may be trying to trigger between him and her because of her love affair with her pimp Julian Sands.  These three issues alcoholism prostitution and love with a prostitute are the center themes of Leaving Las Vegas.   The story is simple.  Ben Sanderson Nicolas Cage is a scriptwriter who has hit rock bottom and upon being released from his job decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.  There he meets a beautiful young prostitute named Sera Elisabeth Shue with whom he spends the night only sleeping.  He turns out to be Sera's only client that night and gives her five hundred dollars for her services.  Her pimp Yuri Julian Sands is very mad but finally gets over it.  Later on in the movie Ben invites Sera to dinner but she refuses knowing that she must work to bring some money back to Yuri.  However when she goes back to Yuri he tells her to leave and never come back.  As she exits the hotel room where Yuri was staying she crosses three men going to Yuri's room.  She goes back to Ben's motelroom and they go off to dinner.  After dinner she invites him to live in her house and when he moves in Ben explains that if Sera is to accept him into her life she can never ask him to quit drinking.  And so begins the love story between Ben and Sera.  Nicolas Cage walked home with that year's best actor Oscar and he deserved it.  I believe that any alcoholic could associate himself to Ben.  Elisabeth Shue is equally good as Sera the sensitive but tough prostitute who accepts Ben as he is without judgment or prejudice.  Mike Figgis's direction is exceptional.  The fastforwarding of the camera when Ben arrives to Las Vegas add to his drunk state of mind.  But it is definitely Cage's movie all the way.  The movie also tries to send a message which I believe is no matter what people look like allow them to be themselves and do not judge them and that is all that Ben asks from Sera throughout the movie.  There is a scene in a hotel in the desert where Ben and Sera are kissing and Ben is very drunk and as Ben gets up next to the pool he knocks down a glass table and breaks it.  A little while after the owner of the hotel comes to help Sera pick up the mess and she tells Sera she wants Ben and her gone by the next morning.  This scene is exactly the representation of what Ben doesn't want from Sera.    This movie may end a bit in the same way a tearjerker but it has nothing to do with that type of movie.  On the contrary it is a realistic moral on alcoholism with great performances and direction.".

	onyx:emotionText "In today's society we have many diseases.  AIDS cancer tuberculosis... However a very underrated and in my opinion deadly disease we seem to forget is alcoholism.  Being an alcoholic is like being drugaddicted.  You may think it is easy to quit drinking but it is as hard as dropping drugs and once you've stopped taking alcohol you can't ever have any again or you'll simply go back to alcoholism.  This issue is the principle theme of Leaving Las Vegas.  However in the movie we see as well how alcohol can grab a person and this person will never want to quit and even less hear people asking him or her to see a doctor to quit drinking.   Prostitution may be considered by many to be something of very low class but for some women it is the only possibility they have to make some money. Some prostitutes are independent and others have a pimp.  In Leaving Las Vegas Elisabeth Shue works for a pimp with whom she has a relationship.   Finally the last issue in this movie is love.  Love with a prostitute more specifically.  In 1990's Pretty Woman Julia Roberts refuses to kiss her clients on the lips to avoid making a connection with them.  In this movie Elisabeth Shue does not even talk about this for she believes to be strong enough to avoid any relationship that a client may be trying to trigger between him and her because of her love affair with her pimp Julian Sands.  These three issues alcoholism prostitution and love with a prostitute are the center themes of Leaving Las Vegas.   The story is simple.  Ben Sanderson Nicolas Cage is a scriptwriter who has hit rock bottom and upon being released from his job decides to go to Las Vegas to drink himself to death.  There he meets a beautiful young prostitute named Sera Elisabeth Shue with whom he spends the night only sleeping.  He turns out to be Sera's only client that night and gives her five hundred dollars for her services.  Her pimp Yuri Julian Sands is very mad but finally gets over it.  Later on in the movie Ben invites Sera to dinner but she refuses knowing that she must work to bring some money back to Yuri.  However when she goes back to Yuri he tells her to leave and never come back.  As she exits the hotel room where Yuri was staying she crosses three men going to Yuri's room.  She goes back to Ben's motelroom and they go off to dinner.  After dinner she invites him to live in her house and when he moves in Ben explains that if Sera is to accept him into her life she can never ask him to quit drinking.  And so begins the love story between Ben and Sera.  Nicolas Cage walked home with that year's best actor Oscar and he deserved it.  I believe that any alcoholic could associate himself to Ben.  Elisabeth Shue is equally good as Sera the sensitive but tough prostitute who accepts Ben as he is without judgment or prejudice.  Mike Figgis's direction is exceptional.  The fastforwarding of the camera when Ben arrives to Las Vegas add to his drunk state of mind.  But it is definitely Cage's movie all the way.  The movie also tries to send a message which I believe is no matter what people look like allow them to be themselves and do not judge them and that is all that Ben asks from Sera throughout the movie.  There is a scene in a hotel in the desert where Ben and Sera are kissing and Ben is very drunk and as Ben gets up next to the pool he knocks down a glass table and breaks it.  A little while after the owner of the hotel comes to help Sera pick up the mess and she tells Sera she wants Ben and her gone by the next morning.  This scene is exactly the representation of what Ben doesn't want from Sera.    This movie may end a bit in the same way a tearjerker but it has nothing to do with that type of movie.  On the contrary it is a realistic moral on alcoholism with great performances and direction.";

I'm still not sure whether we should have just gone to see Superman not because it was a bad movie quite the opposite. I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and that is quite a claim I know but I don't think that I could ever see it again.That said I would definitely recommend this to you all. It is a brilliant piece frighteningly realistic intense and very powerful. I never wanted to try Heroin ever and this film certainly hit that home. If I ever hear someone say they want to try it normally I would just call them an idiot and leave it alone but now I think I would absolutely go off at them. This movie certainly cannot be accused of glorifying drugs.Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish totally made this movie their own. Their chemistry is at times absolutely beautiful and wonderful and at other times frightening and unnerving. The number one feeling this movie left me with was quite uncomfortable and also somewhat disturbed. And that I believe is exactly what this movie was attempting to do realism at it's best. Berthold Brecht himself couldn't have done better himself.I've never seen Abbie Cornish in anything else before this but if her other work is as brilliant as her performance as Candy in this film point me in it's direction. Abbie was absolutely brilliant especially in the wide range of emotions and personalities she had to portray.My one criticism for this film if you could call it a criticism is that it may be too realistic it is almost as if someone had just filmed this couple's life and put it in the cinema and some scenes could be somewhat disturbing for some people but I believe that is the point of the film. Call it a warning.I know this isn't exactly the most well written review and I hope it makes sense but this is one film I have actually been motivated to write a review about and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone.".

Movies about junkies in love taken from searing autobiographical first novels are usually not what I would call entertaining though there have been worthy earlier Australian efforts such as Winter of Our Dreams with Judy Davis and Bryan Brown and Monkey Grip which starred Noni Hazelhurst and Colin Friels. As Trainspotting showed it is possible to be light hearted about drugs and addiction but the storyline here is far from cheering and there is no Hollywoodstyle happy ending. However it did not turn out as gruesome as I feared it might.This was partly because of two stunning performances by Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish as the not very happy couple Dan and Candy. Somehow Heath got it just right as the shambling disorganized wouldbe poet who is nonetheless capable of pulling off an effective scam when required. Abbie gave us a beautiful headstrong and dangerous Candy. Their scenes together are as intense and as convincing as you will get in the movies. They were both well supported by Tony Martin and Nonie Hazlehurst as Candy's parents and Geoffrey Rush as their supplier and friend Casper. Geoffrey Rush is a dangerous actor to use in a supporting role because of his ability to steal scenes but he produces a wonderfully ambiguous character as a counterpoint to the intensity of the leads.Caspar makes an interesting remark about drug usage When you're on it you don't want to stop when you want to stop you can't. Artists have particular trouble since they see drugs as feeding creativity. Even so some people break the habit. I hate to use the term selfdiscipline but that and the support of those close to you seem to be crucial factors. Being in love with another addict does not seem to be a great help for obvious reasons. The Thought Police will be pleased that drugtaking is not glamourised and Dan and Candy's experiences are a mite painful but the movie does not take a judgmental stance. If we had to have another movie about junkies in love this is the one.".

Another user suggested ''Trainspotting'' meets ''Romeo  Juliet'' which I believe is an apt summary of Neil Armfield's Aussie gem Candy  the kind of film that takes you and shakes you with harrowing bleak portrayals juxtaposed with the euphoric state of romance. Although it is not devoid of faults the film trumps most other films I've seen this year at the Stockholm Film Festival because of sheer emotional impact.But Candy opens on a hypnotic note of false security lovable slacker Dan Heath Ledger and bohemian art student Candy Abbie Cornish indulge in druginduced games smiling laughing kissing even playing with children. In the next scene Candy almost ODs in the bathtub and the film bravely swoops down and offers us a look at something infinitely more unpleasant drug addiction. Indeed 'Candy' was largely being advertised as a romance for reasons I cannot pretend to understand other than perhaps the shock factor in abandoning gushy romance for a bruised reality. The truth of the matter is that it offers one of the most unflinching looks into seedy junkie lives since Reqiuem For a Dream.The cast give fine and sometimes even excellent performances. Geoffrey Rush lends his dutiful Aussie charm to the supporting role of an 'accidental mentor' of sorts to Dan and Candy  the father I always wanted the one who buys you fizzy drinks and candy remarks Dan in the introduction and we thereby know early on that his character is perhaps not a flawless or ethical one. Ledger is constantly pending between likable and loser in the film and it is thanks to his apt narrative of events that he remains so well centred in the heart of 'Candy' which should rightfully be titled 'Dan'. As a clever technique by firsttime director Armfield Ledger's softspoken narrative becomes punctured mercilessly abandoning us in a time when we need it the most  when the seedy circumstances become too dire.But the big surprise is Abbie Cornish who is now regrettably stirring up more buzz with the PhillippeWitherspoon split than with her remarkably bruised performance as the tragic heroine Candy. She captures the escalating despair desperation and nihilism of her character effortlessly and translates it with great emotional transparency. Soon she has resorted to fulltime prostitution to get money for hits and it is just heartrending. In particular there is a poignant and emotional scene with Candy and her father embracing after a shocking bit of news that cements the chaos Dan and Candy have gotten themselves in.Interestingly enough 'Candy' is explicitly divided into three titled segments that pop up on the screen heaven earth and hell and it does a great job at portraying all three uninhibitedly navigating the contrasts that form at their transitions. The softspoken words lovemaking druginduced romantic euphoria and intimate caressing of the 'heaven' segment render 'hell' all the more harrowing although I must remark that I found 'earth' to be by far the most graphic and difficult to watch. This can best be attributed to the scenes in which Dan and Candy try to lose their heroin addictions and lay suffering for days on a mattress Trainspottingstyle.In the end 'Candy' remains  much like its peers a cautionary tale of the horrors of drug life and how addiction can mess you up and mess with relationships. Although there are few discernible flaws that jump out and grab you the attempted humour simply isn't intune and it is needed as a tensioneaser at times. Owing to this Candy sadly offers little light at the end of the tunnel and it is far too easy to lose yourself in the gloom hopelessness. Yet most of this is compensated for by great performances of intrinsically good people that you cannot help rooting for as Dan says Everything we ever did we did with the best of intentions. 8 out of 10".

They act much as you would expect parents to act or at least hope they would act.The ending dropped the ball a little but maybe they ran out of budget. In any case I would watch it again. It's realistic gritty romantic and a good case study of how drugs can ruin the most intense love.".

The love story between Ledger and Cornish is a constant throughout with a great line on how their addiction affects not only their own relationship but their relationships with others parents friends acquaintances.Abby Cornish is especially good as the art girl turned junkie prostitute her fall into addiction and the changes it makes in her life are much more effective than Ledger's portrayal of a junkie in love.The parents in the movie are excellent from subtle facial expressions to dragout fights with their dope fiend daughter. They act much as you would expect parents to act or at least hope they would act.The ending dropped the ball a little but maybe they ran out of budget. In any case I would watch it again. It's realistic gritty romantic and a good case study of how drugs can ruin the most intense love.";

There were about 10 of us and only 3 of us loved it..But to put it in perspective the others were more keen on seeing Click and The Fast And The Furious Tokyo DriftI thought it was a good movie but lacked some character depth in places. Heath Ledger was good but it was really Abbie Cornish so exceptional in Somersault as well and Geoffrey Rush who were outstanding. Abbie Cornish is amazing as Candy she truly lives and breathes the role except in the last scene where I thought her character didn't really match the emotion shown by Heath Ledger's character. That was Heath's finest scene for me the way he was able to portray so much emotion without saying anything at all. Tony Martin and Noni Hazelhurst were good in their small time on screen but again the relationship breakdown between Candy and her Mum wasn't really explored which didn't really help when she goes off at her Mum and starts screaming at her for ruining her life..Great direction by Neil Armfield and this was really a movie about Heath and Abbie's characters dependence on drugs and on each other through their ordeal. Some of the things they do to obtain drugs and the money to buy drugs is shocking but to them just a necessity to obtain ways and means of getting a fix. As good as this movie was if you liked Candy please take time to see an earlier Australian movie from a few years ago called Head On by Anna Kikkonos I think that's her name. It stars Alex Dimitraides and is a much better exploration of the drug scene. Overall Candy is a worthy addition to the local Australian cinema and I'm glad I was able to enjoy this movie. Definitely worth a look for the performances by Abbie Cornish Geoffrey Rush and Heath Ledger".

	schema:reviewBody "'Candy' will probably garner several AFI awards later this year. Ledger is Dan a troubled and likable juvenilecomepoet who is in love with Cornish's Candy a sometimespracticing artist who falls head first in love with Dan and heroin. Ledger's understated performance gives Dan a boyish vulnerability that would otherwise leave him less sympathetic. And his ability to use his face and especially his eyes to communicate Dan's uncanny reluctance is both staggering and understandable. There are many moments where silence is used to express emotions in this film and Armfield deserves to be commended for his restraint and trust in his actors and the narrative. The script by cowriter and author Davies is decidedly different from the novel but nonetheless strong and taut. It's rarely melodramatic and has been manipulated more for it's performers and their execution on screen rather than resigning itself as merely an adaptation of a great novel. The result here provides superb cinematic balance. Cornish too is brilliant often abrasive as the troubled artist. Rush is also amazing and understated as Casper Dan's older homosexual friend. Hazelhurst reprises her role in 'Little Fish' but to less effect. She is great but those who have seen 'Little Fish' will find her casting a little too convenient. Martin too is good with the little he is dealt. The only thing that stops 'Candy' from being superb is the material. It is too familiar and the characters are too stereotypical. Had this film been made before countless others in the 'drugfilm' genre this would have been more refreshing although the denouement is a much welcomed change. But sadly it isn't. This in turn is nobody's fault. It's just been exploited too many times. The only thing that isn't stereotypical is Dan who is the backbone of the narrative. Ledger has made it his own and could have mimicked any drugstricken angsty protagonist the 'genre' has spat out. Instead he has made him a hero.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amazing but harsh Candy is 'Trainspotting' meets 'Romeo and Juliet'. Opening with a haunting melody and the two lovers on a fairground ride it feels very picturesque and idealistic but that doesn't last very long I'm afraid. Mixing poetic voiceovers and montages of the pair involved in each other as the world orbits around them they are so in love and oblivious and addicted. Told in a triptych the first third of the film is called 'heaven' and deals with the honeymoon period of the relationship the second third is called 'earth' and deals with the start of the end and it doesn't take a genius to work out that the third is called 'hell' and is just that. Candy and Dan are addicted to each other and addicted to heroin. They steal lie cheat and wheel and deal whatever it takes to get the cash they need for the next fix but when the fixes are few and far between there becomes no limit to how far they will go. Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish are brilliant as the arm spiked lovers who both brood with an intensity that shines out when they are acting being on drugs or the brutal scenes when they are trying to come off them. They are mesmerising to watch and at all times you either hate them for how much they are destroying each other or empathise with them for what they are going through. You can't help but go through the experience with them because it is so graphic and not unlike the needles gets right under your skin. Geoffrey Rush who plays a strange semigay drugged up Uncle Monty type character who not only supplies but manufactures some of the drugs for the pair and even shoots up with them is very unnerving as the father figure Dan always wanted but never had. Even the later part of the last third despite its nature still holds elements of beauty and I would be surprised if there was a dry eye in the house as the film reaches its climax. If you ever wanted a way to show children the evils of drugs then show them this film it never glorifies the use of substances and if anything it is garishly honest all the way through although not an easy watch it is an amazing portrayal of the power that addictions good or bad can hold and just how far humans are capable of going for love. This really is a journey into the heart of darkness.".

Requiem for a Dream and Trainspotting were two films that really showed the drug culture in an interesting light and were very entertaining. But with Candy I couldn't help but feel like it'd all been done before just better.We have the plot that is reasonably standard to these melancholy drug films boy meets girl they do drugs they fight they get back together they descend and a possible happy ending. As far as it goes the structure of these movies is not really the point. They all follow the same structure and there's nothing wrong with that. However it does mean that as a genre you really need to be able to hammer home your points well. Those points have to do with what you're saying about the drug culture and more importantly in my opinion what you say about relationships.Before I get started I'd like to say how absolutely brilliant the actors were. Heath Ledger has really shaken off the critics and proved himself to be a great dramatic actor capable of picking good roles and pulling them off to a tee. His performance was one par with any great modern actor. Geoffery Rush was his usual amazing self adding a bit of humour to the movie but in a way that never ruined the film. Of course earning the biggest mention is Abbie Cornish who is beautiful and wonderful as always in this film. Her performance is just mezmorising and I couldn't keep my eyes off her. She is so perfect for these innocentyet knowing vulnerable melancholy roles. She is amazingly professional in everything she does and she bucks the trend of young actors in nude scenes she retains her respectability and she actually adds gravitas to the movie through these most welcome if I may scenes.What does let it down is the somewhat tired direction and cinematography. To be rude the cinematographer looks like he came straight from NIDA. This is what you do to be dramatic this is what you do to be romantic etc. The story was told in a very linear way and the title of the movie divisions was simplistic to the point of being insulting. Though I am never a big fan of comparing films one must wonder what this contributes to the genre. The similarities between this and Requiem for a Dream were plentiful in terms of structure and story but Requiem did it with so much style. If Candy lacked anything it was a creative oomph. All in all it is a film that is quite average though I do not mean that in a derogatory way as it has come to be associated. Every feature is very competent but that is all. The thing that does make it a cut above the rest is the incredible acting. Hopefully with actors like these Australian filmmakers will be more daring in the future.".

Beautifully shot etc. One thing did strike me as being strange  the casting of Noni Hazlehurst as the Mum who harangues her daughter and fails to comprehend her choices. This actress is wellknown in Oz anyway for her brilliant portrayal twenty years ago as a junkie in Monkey Grip. So casting her in this diametrically opposed role did not serve the movie well at all I found it so distracting and completely at odds with the purpose of the casting that it did my head in! Another quibble  a truly hilarious scene from the novel where Dan tries to rob a bank was not in the movie. Too bad. Armfield also changed what happened to Geoffrey Rush's character which was interesting to observe. In the movie he gives him a much more poetic trajectory.Otherwise Candy is an excellent druggy pic and love story and definitely worth seeing if you don't remember Christiane F etc".

But one 15 minute scene does not a movie make. The performances were admirable Abbie Cornish is a very talented actress and Heath Ledger is quite decent as well. Geoffrey Rush was completely wasted in this film though. His talent far exceeded the role thereby making his few on screen moments seem campy and overdone.If you want to see the true grit of a bleak storyline such as heroin addiction I recommend Christiane F. or Panic in Needle Park. For subject matter they are much better and more three dimensional than this piece of fluff.".

	schema:headline " Incredibly accurate dramatically compelling story of heroin addicts in love";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's the all around best film about drug addicts since Gus Van Sant's 1989 cult hit Drugstore Cowboy. Specifically with reference to heroin addiction the characters in Cowboy were polysubstance prescription drug addicts Candy offers a far more representative and fully developed picture of that particular addiction than many of its predecessors like Man With the Golden Arm High Art Requiem for a Dream or the recent film Clean and it holds its own when compared with Trainspotting and Pure two of the all time best junkie films.Though it's a love story Candy's narrative arc is in fact the arc of addiction itself. Dan Heath Ledger an addicted slacker meets and falls in love with Candy Abbie Cornish a beautiful artist truly a vision of womanly perfection candy for the eye and the heart among other organs. I suppose Candy sees in Dan what some vulnerable women all too often find attractive somebody to dote upon and look after possibly rehabilitate change into the man of her dreams. We then follow the couple through the bliss of early love then marriage then down the rabbit hole into ever more serious mutual addiction for Candy almost begs to be initiated into heroin use early on.Don't get me wrong though. This is no cut and dried clinical saga. It may resemble many heartbreaking case histories but this story is well written and well acted it's got sturdy dramatic legs to stand on. Apart from being drop dead gorgeous Ms. Cornish gives a highly skilled turn. She goes through so many poignant changes ranging from naf to drug addled vixen.Mr. Ledger fresh off his astonishing performance in Brokeback Mountain here gives us another troubled morose character not unlike Brokeback's Ennis or his earlier smaller role as the suicidal Sonny in Monster's Ball. Ledger needs to watch out lest he become typecast as an actor for depressive characters. But he is so good at them! Aiding the proceedings is a splendid supporting turn by Geoffrey Rush as Casper the friendly dope maker a chemistry professor who has turned his skills to perfecting designer opioids.The ending is so similar to that in Drugstore Cowboy that I suspect a homage was planned. But that takes nothing away from the dramatic appropriateness of Candy's wrap up. Mark this one down as one of the best psychflix ever made about addictions. My grades 8.510 ASeen on 120906".

	schema:reviewBody "How on earth did this film garner such inexplicably praiseful plaudits on the festival circuit last year? You can colour me entirely baffled. The studio's plot synopsis remains genuinely intriguing but the film proper appears to have excised all of this potentially interesting material namely the dynamic it claims to examine between the titular character stitched up by her attraction to the bohemian lifestyle apparently and Ledger's dozy poet.That at the very least sounds like something worth exploring. But instead we are given film that is so painfully familiar and uninventive that I can genuinely tell you with all sincerity that there is absolutely no reason to watch it. The two central performances shine brilliantly for the first half hour or so after that we're treated to the rather nauseating display of two talented actors trying feverishly to outtwitch each other.The main problem though is that the movie has no narrative drive. We start in hell and despite the film's attempt to shoehorn in periodic 'Heaven' 'Hell' and 'Earth' titlecards that have absolutely no bearing on the content of the story and are as an idea clearly cribbed from Aronofsky's Requiem adaptation we don't once move out of the pits. After barely 15 minutes of running time and a surfeit of characterisation andor plot Candy is already driven to prostituting herself to fund her habit. Where can the film possibly go after that? I'd tell you but you already know surely?As the film plummets ever deeper into misery and predictable squalor fewer and fewer surprises are encountered and the mind can't help but wander to the superior movies that this one can't help but reference.Annoyingly there is the odd excellent scene for example the frenzied buzzy sequence in the bank brilliantly evokes the nervy excitement and brazen amorality of life on the fringes but it is always quickly followed by a plot point so brainfryingly soapy that any positive momentum is quashed immediately. SPOILER After the guilty euphoria of the bank episode Ledger's character returns home to find out that Candy is pregnant with his child. Strewth! Where is THAT story going to end up? I'd tell you but you already know surely? END SPOILERAnd to add insult to injury it looks like utter hell with its bland studiolit sets and washed out cinematography it looks like a gently bleached version of Home and Away. The screenplay is no great shakes either strictly jointhedots plot wise it also employs drab repetitive naturalistic dialogue that does evoke a certain realism but serves to make all of the characters bar none completely uninteresting and unlikeable. Go and rent Drugstore Cowboy or Christiane F instead of this well intentioned but totally empty hackjob of lazy codsoapery.".

Cormish was also superb her deterioration was captured perfectly. Both characters created a fantastic aura on screen they had to really to carry the film i was entertained throughout by their accurate acting.The cinematography was also masterful the widely unorthodox camera shots were fitting and subtle.However while this film is a sublime piece of cinematographic art the underlying story here lacks depth and there's not much to it here.

He captures the monotony as well as the sordidness and the sheer horror of a junkie's lifestyle and the performances are superb.Ledger is phenomenally good as an addict who would sell his soul though is more squeamish about selling his body for his next fix it's a totally unexpected performance and it is easily his best. He is matched by Abbie Cornish in the title role the girl he drags to hell with him. As their seemingly benign homosexual and ostensibly respectable dealer Geoffrey Rush gives a beautifully understated performance and there are two splendid cameo's from Tony Martin and Noni Hazelhurst as Candy's parents.It is certainly not an easy film to watch there isn't an ounce of sentimentality in it but it is very powerful and ultimately very moving. You come away from it with a real sense of loss at Ledger's early and tragic demise ironically from an accidental drugs overdose.".

But the approach is layered with a humanistic view believing that we can be responsible for our own lives if we can admit to ourselves that we have weaknesses and sometimes need help. It's also about the dream of freeliving as opposed to being part of the modern system. How do you live freely when you have to make money and follow all laws of society? There is no one answer. This film though will stimulate some new thoughts and reflections. How deep will you go?Highly recommended for enthusiasts of character pieces.".

But the approach is layered with a humanistic view believing that we can be responsible for our own lives if we can admit to ourselves that we have weaknesses and sometimes need help. It's also about the dream of freeliving as opposed to being part of the modern system. How do you live freely when you have to make money and follow all laws of society? There is no one answer. This film though will stimulate some new thoughts and reflections. How deep will you go?Highly recommended for enthusiasts of character pieces.";

	schema:reviewBody "An original realistic drugrelated film that never goes too far over the top and never feels like an afterschool special? I thought it couldn't be done but boy was I wrong. Though to call Candy a drug film would be missing the point completely. It's a film about addiction. Addiction to heroine yes but on a much larger level addiction that one couple has to each other. Dan Heath Ledger and Candy Abbie Cornish are in love. They are also addicts and unemployed. The film tackles their relationship as it moves from something adorable to something tragic. They start off completely in love with one another and slowly drift apart as the madness of addiction becomes deeper and deeper. Pretty early on Candy has to sell her body in order for them to get money while Dan gets the drugs. The news that Candy is pregnant leads to them trying to get rid of their habit and start living a better life. They suffer through withdrawal and right when they start to see the light at the end she suffers from an inevitable miscarriage. This sends them further into tragedy than they've ever been before and leads to the final act of the film being some of the most devastating work I've ever had to endure watching. My stomach was in knots through a large portion of the film and I could barely stand watching what was happening on screen. A lot of this is due to the sensational performances from Ledger and Cornish. They work so well together Cornish the emotionally intense and hysterical Ledger the subtle and internally anguished. Both of them brought tears to my eyes several times throughout. It's without a doubt one of the most devastating wrenching films I've ever seen. It's also one of the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film in itself was one that I watched purely out of curiosity. And I am one many levels glad to have seen the film yet am rattled by the almost unimaginable depth and brutality that is showcased here. The film is disturbing and heartwrenching in the way that it depicts a strong state of realism and highlights topical and often satirized themes.The reasons I was so consumed by the film are for several reasons. The film instantly captures you with its themed sections of deescalation starting with a absolutely beautiful and nostalgic scene that contrasts beauty with brutality in Cornish's first of many insightful and clenching scenes. This leads me to the acting all I can say is Wow. The inexplicable feeling the actors create make me both uncomfortable and shaken particularly Cornish's extremely talented and dare I say fourdimensional character which has a very balanced unbalance of vulgarity and raw beauty. Her incredible looks do nothing to harbor her electrifying Candy. Ledger as always was not a let down and portrayed the misguided poet trapped in a selfdestructive bubble of blindness down to the T. The end scene in particular captures the millions of dimensions his character contains and the utter believability and emotion Ledger could create within a matter of seconds with one word. Rush as well was incredible his almost delusional peace balanced well with helplessness. And last but not least the absolutely incredible imagery of this film and the poetic and eye opening dialog interweaves to create a simply amazing and heart stopping tragic drama studying loneliness love and entrapment on levels which I personally have never seen so masterfully created. The nudity and language of the film was used not in a way to depict lustful and dirty intentions but further emphasize the complex mesh of beautiful and disturbing story telling and further increase the downward fall of the film while all the time clenched and enveloped in the films uncontrollable draw. Disturbing and insanely deep its sad that such a film is overlooked or shadowed by Hollywood blubber. This is real film making and this is the definition of a masterpiece. Cornish is the rising vibrancy to the film industry and for Heath the film is a testament of his unearthly talent and brutal honesty which the world of films and the world over all will miss with mournful hearts for all time. I feel privileged and changed for seeing this work of art.".

Yes effects are kind of trashy and look like they are from the 60's but somehow it gave movie special vibe. Story is also nice and very imaginative the biggest plus for me in the movie is humour Yugoslavian humour is something unique it is twisted and dark but it is what i really like.

One of the most successful and best written of the B western series it was to run from 1935 to 1948.As written by Clarence E. Mulford Cassidy was a crude crusty ranch hand and definitely not intended as a Saturday Matinee hero. In fact character actor James Gleason who looked nothing like a hero was apparently first offered the part.Boyd who had been around Hollywood since the early 20s and had fallen from grace ultimately was cast in the part. It was decided between himself and producer Harry Pop Sherman that Boyd would not play the character as written.In this first entry in the series Boyd plays the character with a few rough edges all of which would disappear in future films. He starts out as Bill Cassidy but acquires his nickname Hopalong when is wounded in the leg and is forced to hop along with the aid of a cane.The story involves two competing ranchers Buck Peters of the Bar20 Charles Middleton and Meeker Robert Warwick arguing over the open range land for their cattle. Meeker's foreman known as Pecos Jack Kenneth Thompson is behind a plot to set the two ranches against each other while stealing their cattle changing their brands and selling them off for himself.In this first entry in the series the traditional trio comprises Hoppy Johnny Nelson James Ellison and Red Connors Frank McGlynn Jr.. George Hayes by this time had evolved into the character he would play for the rest of his career. In this picture he plays a ranch hand named Uncle Ben. Although still not using the name Gabby he would appear later in the series as the grizzled sidekick Windy Halliday.Also in the cast are Paula Stone as Mary Meeker Ellison's love interest Willie Fung as the Meeker's Chinese cook who provides most of the comic relief and veterans John Merton and Franlyn Farnum in other roles.Charles Middleton would achieve some measure of fame as Ming the Merciless in the Flash Gordon serials. The character of Red Connors would be resurrected in the Hopalong Cassidy TV series of the 50s with Edgar Buchanan playing the part.".

It's up to Hoppy Red Uncle Ben and Johnny Nelson who is a target for Meeker's hands since Johnny is sweet on Meeker's daughter Mary to clear the Bar 20's name and round up the outlaws. The film is a very good entry in the opening film of the Hopalong series but far from the best since the action doesn't really begin past the halfway point of the film. Then on it's gets better building up to a great climax. Good performances by the cast especially by Hayes as Uncle Ben in a pre Windy Halliday role but Thomson is miscast and ineffective as Anthony.

Anyway at the final third part when the spaceship reaches the planet the film gets to its high point! I had a great time watching this film it's funny in a twisted way there's blood and sickness. It's high time of entertainment. It reminded me of BRAINDEAD  BAD TASTE of Peter Jackson as well as BODY MELT of Philip Brophy and maybe a bit Mad Max by the way ALL Australian films.

It started off superbly as a exciting violent and witty black comedy about a gang of mostly deformed mutant terrorists intent on destroying the beautiful people and their mediocre hypocritical society. They kidnap the daughter of a bourgeois business and hold her for ransom. Fantastic! All was going great the balance between satire action and silliness was handled imaginatively but half way through the movie changes direction and becomes increasingly less interesting. The planet where Mutant Action land to make their exchange is populated by a family of grotesques similar to one's in Philip Brophy's equally bizarre 'Body Melt' or like some of the stranger characters seen in the comics of Garth Ennis. Unfortunately for me the movie loses focus at this point all the earlier potential for surreal social criticism is abandoned and it becomes a standard bgrade sci fi action flick with only a few good bits.It's a shame to me that the movie didn't continue in the approach of its first half because I think if it did it would be a classic piece of science fiction. As it is with all its flaws it's still better than 90 of American SF movies made in the last 15 years and recommended viewing. Please track down 'The Day Of The Beast' though it's sensational!".

	schema:reviewBody "Devilishly funny SciFiterrorblack comedy about some mutants become involved into incredible and frightening adventures . They're a band formed by hunchbacks  cripples  a twoheaded man  mentally handicapped people and other mutants  all of them are likeness to Francisco Ibaez's comic books roles. This is a fullon surreal Science Fiction movie that blends thrills  a lot of fun  suspense  tension as well as an intriguing script full of underlying lack seriousness . This Spanish SciFiFantasycomedy is Alex De la Iglesia's first foray into absolute and total lunacy  being titled Mutant action or Accin Mutante . The flick centers on a band of attackers  a terrorist group of mutants led by Ramon Yarritu Resines abduct at a wedding party the daughter of a wealthy owner  Patricia Orujo Frdrique Feder to claim for the rights of the ugly people . But the rich man  the powerful businessman Orujo Fernando Guillen Cuervo trying to flee her at whatever cost . As the gang escaping from the police in their spacecraft  Ramon tries to doublcross his band in order to get all the ransom . The journey ends abruptly when they crash in Axturiax shot in Almeria  the planet which bears remarkable resemblance to Tatooine of Star Wars of the crazy miners where no woman live . There Ramn gets trapped by strange bands  weird people  a boastful saloon  as he falls into the clutches of a rare family and many other things . Meanwhile  Ramon and Patricia have been pursued by Rednecks  polices and the wealthy man along with his heavily armed hoodlums . Alex De la Iglesia's SciFi  horror comedy blends creepy elements with humor  tongueincheek and thrills  so the tone of the film is lighthearted . It's a veritable buffet of the cream of the Spanish nineties  full of action  laughs  scares and attacks . Packed with scenes of fantastic nature  robust comedy  this story is exciting as well as frightening  as we follow the strange situations of some peculiar kidnappers whose destination is dictated by terrible events . The narration is so filled with quirk characters  crazy violence mixed with eerie elements and an underlying sense of surprise  and it is so excessive and plenty of fantastic elements  one can't help but keep watching  much as it is over the top in many an occasion . There are a lot of comic books references  such as Lorna and his robot Judge Dredd by John Wagner and Frank Miller's Dark night. And the night city is similarly recreated to Total recall1990  Paul Verhoven and some scenes pay tribute to The hills have eyes1977 Wes Craven . De La Iglesia reigns in his style this time around and gives an utterly watchable takedown of Science Fictioncomedy that certainly delivers a few madly inspired moments . Once again De la Iglesia exemplifies why he's one of the most amusing Spanish filmmakers currently churning out foreign cinema  adopting frenetic storytelling much like Quentin Tarantino  Brian Singer  or Matthew Vaughn might dream up . Enjoyable main cast and agreeable support actors deliver one of the most engaging  hysterical action packed and wonderfully shot SciFi movie in years . Ensemble cast boasts some of Spain's biggest film and TV stars  such as Antonio ResinesRamn whose character mingles aspects from Terminator James Cameron  1984 and Pinhead Hellraiser  and the twoheaded role by recently deceased Alex Angulo is lookalike monster Basket Case1982  Frank Henenlotter . Further cast members are first class Spanish star system such as Karra Elejalde  Jaime Blanch Ramn Barea  Bibiana Fernndez  Rossi De Palma  and Santiago Segura  most of them Alex De Iglesia's ordinaries .It has a nice production design by Arri and Biaffra  plenty of creativity . Catching musical score including popular Spanish songs  furthermore  Mission impossible classic score by Lalo Schifrin. Colorful as well as atmospheric cinematography by Carles Gusi . De La Iglesia  is well known as the Spanish king of black comedy . He's a cool director has got several successes  Dying of laughter  Baby's room  Oxford murders  and Perdita Durango is probably the weirdest Javier Bardem film ever made . And  of course  Day of the beast and La Comunidad obtained the unanimous praise of both the critics and the public and result to be a lot of fun especially for those who enjoy surrealist humor  they won several Goya prizes and and resulted to be a turning point in his meteoric career  from then on he became his own producer beginning with '800 bullets' 2002 through the Pnico Films company . In addition  he produced a TV Series  Pluton BRB Nero 2009 with similar characters and atmospheres to Mutant action . Winner of several Goyas Spanish Oscars however his movies have not yet reached box office in USA but he has strong followers  as his films have a kind of comic edge to them . Nonsense ridicule  laughters  absurdity  disturbing scenes and many other issues  you can find everything in this flick . Accin Mutante captures the essence of the best Alex De La Iglesia a filmmaker who at this point in his own story is respected and admired worldwide and has the most committed fans in the film universe . This Spanish SciFicomedy was much praised by critics as well as public during its European festival run . Being a big winner with various statues Goyas was this Alex De la Iglesia's comedy which dominated the technical categories . This is without a doubt a thrilling and enjoyable movie to be enjoyed for SciFicomedy aficionados and Alex De Iglesia fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "Accion Mutante is the debut feature from cult director lex de la Iglesia. It incorporates the absurd comedy with violence template that he seems to have followed throughout the rest of his career. Also like others in his filmography such as The Last Circus and Witching and Bitching this one starts out really well but loses a bit of steam in the final third. It's set in the future where a terrorist group called Accion Mutante take violent action against rich hipsters and the superficially beautiful their latest scheme sees them kidnap a society girl resulting in them being pursued to another planet by her mogul father who is bent on serious revenge.This one has a pretty modest budget so it has to be cut some slack. Nevertheless it makes good use of its resources at times. In particular an early high society party scene was nicely done it was colourful and garish in a way that showed the definite influence of Pedro Almodovar who actually was a producer here. This scene along with the earlier more directly satirical ones that showed news reports on the terrorists activities were the most successful and focused parts of the film. After this opening things become more runofthemill and the black comedy becomes less pointed. Ultimately Accion Mutante is one of those movies which probably isn't as good as you think it's going to be given the potential of the central idea. It's still fun though. Of additional note is an amusing raprock theme song that plays in the credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing El Dia De La Bestia I was very much hyped up about Accion Mutante. From the likable characters and intelligent writing to the quick pace the film held throughout. But unfortunately Accion Mutante didn't deliver for me in the slightest.Accion Mutante starts off like it may be a crazy team based action flick with characters all over the place. But instead they get rid of that idea for a simple kidnap and revenge type film. And honestly I think they made the wrong choice. I was enjoying all the different types of mutants even though they're really just handicapped people which was also disappointing. But instead of keeping the Mutants they get rid of them and your left with only a couple. And only one of the characters is even slightly likable. The main character known as Ramon is unlikable unfunny and wasn't suited for the role very well. He's got the most screen time out of anyone in the film and he bored the hell out of me. You do end up meeting more and more characters as the film goes on but none are very entertaining. More like annoying. The film has a very dirty feel that I also didn't enjoy it reminded me of a early Bruce Campbell film called Mindwarp. Though I do have to admit the sets were nice the ship interior reminded me of another film called City of Lost Children. The only thing about Accion Mutante I liked was the violence. There was lots of shooting and a nice razor blade scene. But besides that it was average at best in almost all other departments.I'm actually very surprised that every comment on here is so into this film. One review even implied if you enjoy the movie Freaked you'll enjoy this. Freaked is my favorite movie. And I disagree with that statement 100. I'd agree if the original Mutante team stayed together since Freaked is based around a large cast but nope they got rid of that very early on. Accion Mutante definitely has a look and feel to it that a lot of people will enjoy but it'll never reach the cult status that El Dia De La Bestia will reach. That's for sh!t sure. A generous 6 outta 10.".

All the way to the end it is made up from moments of madness not unlike the thief the cook and the lover it reigns way up there in the realms of monty python to some and as bad as the attack of the killer tomatoes it could have easily been a cult movie given the air time. I especially enjoyed the closing scene  no not because the movie was over but because all the corpses sat up and sang the bad bad ending song...............a slap to the conventional nah just good light hearted fun.";

Also being Spanish can be helpful  I'm not. Anyway if you dig this one try also Torrente and Airbag  I hated those as much as I hated Accion Mutante but plenty of my Spanish mates were recommending all of those three films. I guess it's just a question of gustos. Back to the review acting is bad so and storytelling directing and work of camera.

The kidnapping is the culmination of a campaign of antibeautiful people terrorism and leaves half of the terrorists dead after a violent battle at the reception.After this stage of the film the film takes a turn to a SCIFI crime black comedy where Ramon takes Patricia to a rendezvous on a distant planet in a pure moneygrabbing ransom attempt none of the antibeauty ideals of Mutante Accion remain. On board the ship Ramon starts to spread dissent among the remaining gang members resulting in the death of all of them bar one who happens to be half of a siamese twin leading to some pretty disturbing scenes later in the film. The socialite eventually falls for her kidnapper even though he treats her particularly roughly and is only after the money. There ends up being a race to the ransom rendezvous between the half siamese and Ramon with Ramon and Patricia meeting up with a family reminiscent of the inbreeds in Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the siamese being strung up with his dead brother eventually causing their separation. The showdown at the end between Ramon Patricia's father and the twin leaves nearly everyone dead.If this doesn't interest you in this gem of a film let me add that it was not really cheesily done. The story was done in an exuberant style not in content but in the rapid pace and settings of the film.

If it isn't an issue you have ever personally thought about this scene in the movie will make you an advocate against such brutal activity. The movie shows the devotion a dog has for a girl that saves its life after losing a battle against a pit bull. I had never heard of this movie but decided to watch it since John Travolta was in it.

Usually if he's not the hero he's a ridiculous melodramatic villain.   He's usually too smug for my taste but in this Probably a reflection on the state of his career at the time his character is pathetic for most of the movie.  The villains are not original but I really liked the little girl.  For the most part it is surprisingly good. Until you get to the end.  The end of this movie is so completely lame you will kick yourself for sitting through the whole thing.  They really really dropped the ball with that stupid illogical unrealistic ending.  Ucccch!!!  I would recommend just turning it off right before the dogfight at the end.  Imagine something cooler happened instead.  Trust me whatever you can come up with in 30 seconds will be better than the crap these people thought up.  I would really be interested in knowing who came up with that ending.  Test audiences?  Studio people?  Travolta?  The director?  If that was what the writer originally wrote I will eat my shoe.".

I'm not usually a fan of dog stories but this one isn't just about a dog. It's an adventure film with great acting catchy soundtrack and is supposedly based on true events. There's no crude humor which most dog movies have so it was great to find a decent tasteful movie where its humor depends more on the situation. And the dog was really cool sort of like one of the animals out of that 'The Incredible Journey' book but with a much more interesting backstory.

	schema:reviewBody "It took over 35 years and the collapse of the big studio system before anyone in Hollywood in this case Paramount brought Nathanael West's novel The Day Of The Locust to the big screen. That climax at a Hollywood premiere is certainly not something the studios would want to show the public as a typical event.The book is based on West's experiences while writing B pictures in Hollywood during the Thirties and some of the characters he knew. His main protagonist is William Atherton an aspiring artist who is making a living doing set designs. That's one competitive business and he's got to go over his immediate supervisor John Hillerman's head to get his work noticed by producer Richard Dysart. Like the rest of West's characters he's sacrificed pride a long time ago. It's his eyes that we see the other characters through.But he's a paragon of virtue compared to starlet Karen Black who will do anything and anybody to advance her career. Atherton would love to get something going with her but he's mindful of how amoral she's become. Her only real attachment is to her father an exvaudevillian and now door to door salesman Burgess Meredith. Even trying to do his shtick with sales doesn't gain him clients.But the saddest one in the lot and the fellow with the best performance is Donald Sutherland who is an outsider to the film people a businessman named Homer Simpson who Black uses and abuses. Sutherland's performance is not too different from the hapless cartoon character. Imagine the cartoon Homer Simpson dealing with real life heartbreak and you've got Sutherland's character. The line between tragedy and comedy can be a very thin one.Geraldine Page has a brief role as an Aimee Semple McPherson like evangelist shamelessly bilking the Depression's downtrodden. She's great in the part as is Jackie Earle Haley a really rotten child star of whom I'd love to know who West's model was.The Day Of The Locust was directed by John Schlesinger who got an Oscar for The Midnight Cowboy. Like that film The Day Of The Locust deals with some fringe people just trying to get by. Burgess Meredith got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and the film also got a nomination for Costume Design.Before Newton Minow referred to television as a vast wasteland. I think that's what Nathanael West had in mind in writing about his experiences in the movie capital. I'd recommend seeing the film to see how well Schlesinger put West's vision across.".

	onyx:emotionText "It took over 35 years and the collapse of the big studio system before anyone in Hollywood in this case Paramount brought Nathanael West's novel The Day Of The Locust to the big screen. That climax at a Hollywood premiere is certainly not something the studios would want to show the public as a typical event.The book is based on West's experiences while writing B pictures in Hollywood during the Thirties and some of the characters he knew. His main protagonist is William Atherton an aspiring artist who is making a living doing set designs. That's one competitive business and he's got to go over his immediate supervisor John Hillerman's head to get his work noticed by producer Richard Dysart. Like the rest of West's characters he's sacrificed pride a long time ago. It's his eyes that we see the other characters through.But he's a paragon of virtue compared to starlet Karen Black who will do anything and anybody to advance her career. Atherton would love to get something going with her but he's mindful of how amoral she's become. Her only real attachment is to her father an exvaudevillian and now door to door salesman Burgess Meredith. Even trying to do his shtick with sales doesn't gain him clients.But the saddest one in the lot and the fellow with the best performance is Donald Sutherland who is an outsider to the film people a businessman named Homer Simpson who Black uses and abuses.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't quite understand the comments from the viewers who found this film boring. I've been lucky enough to see it on the big screen several times at revival houses and each time I was blown away. Day of the Locust is a dark compelling amusing bitter epic that's really more about America itself as filtered through the lens of Hollywood at its first creative height in the 1930s.What makes the movie beyond the writing and direction is its cast and many of the supporting actors here create indelible characters. Why Karen Black didn't remain a superstar after this decade is a mystery especially after this film  in which she proves that she could act the hell out of a role. And how can you not like a film in which Billy Barty plays a foulmouthed alcoholic the first character we meet in the book Burgess Meredith is a hapless doortodoor salesman Natalie Lovey Shafer is the madam of a highclass whorehouse in San Bernardino and Donald Sutherland is the repressed Homer No Relation Simpson an accountant who's so alienated from his own feelings that he's reduced to howling in despair in his own garden. And in fact Sutherland's character is involved in one of the film's most harrowing moments which features a young Jackie Earle Haley as a promising child star of indeterminate gender but infinite obnoxiousness.Anyway if you have a chance to catch this film on the big screen by all means do so and be sure to add the DVD to your collection  although since we're coming up on the 30th anniversary it's just possible that Paramount Home Video might decide to give it the deluxe treatment it deserves. Frankenheimer et al manage to take a brilliant novella by Nathaniel West and turn it into an amazing piece of cinema that will stick with you long after the lights go up. And as an added bonus you can just enjoy it as a great story or delve deeply into the symbolism. This is the kind of film that works both ways and one that you cannot miss if you consider yourself any kind of film fan at all at all.".

What's with the faceless people Sutherland's hands and the angry dwarf?  Sounds like David Lynch to me especially in light of Mulholland Drive and its scathing unsympathetic view of Hollywood it even has a cowboy!I finally got around to reading the Nathanael West novel  which is absolutely brilliant  and decided to watch the film again.  And I need to say that as much as I still appreciate and enjoy the movie it really missed the boat trying to cram bits and pieces of ideas from the novel the strange artificial relationship between Faye and her father the barelyrestrained violence of those who come to Hollywood to die the anachronistic and cold facade of Hollywood and the people in charge of it meanwhile stuffing in some 70's ideas reflecting back on the beginnings of WWII which wasn't an issue in the book at all and  strangely enough  adding warmth and humanity to characters whose sole characteristic in the novel was that they had NO warmth or humanity whatsoever.And that's the weird thing about this movie.  I remember when I first saw it I was amazed at how unlikeable all the characters were.  After reading the book however I can say that the characters in the movie are FAR TOO likeable to support any of the book's themes.  This is most notable when it comes to Faye's little breakdowns letting the viewer know that she's really a good person who wants to be loved turning her into a VICTIM of the star system.  But the point of the book  as I gathered anyway  was that these people aren't victims at all.  They're greedy people who victimize eachother and usually in sloppy stupid ways Jeepers Creepers!  Faye isn't capable of an unaffected tender moment all she can do is pretend. The same goes for her father even his moments of genuine sickness and pain are filtered through his neverending vaudeville routine.Homer Simpson as well is portrayed in the film as a sort of unfortunate lump and a biblethumper to boot taken advantage of by Faye.  But that destroys one of the great levels of nastiness in the novel Homer is just as much as an opportunist as Faye and he deserves everything he gets.  Why is he being so generous letting her stay with him and hold cockfights in his garage?  Because he's a pathetic incapable human being who barely has a human feature to him he's just a collection of nervous ticks.  He lusts after her and he seems to delight in his thwarted lust.  He's got less going for him than that lizard on the cactus eating flies.The film suffers from an attempt to make the characters likeable almost without exception.  The only person who escapes this Hollywoodization of the book is Adore the horrible child star whose fate nobody who has seen the movie or read the book will ever forget.  Jeez!If you find yourself watching this movie and just not getting it do yourself a favour and read the book.  It won't make the movie any clearer but you can at least view the movie as a clearcut example of the sort of thing the book was pointing out and railing against way back in 1939 when this idea was still a novel one Hollywood films are manipulative and full of fakery and so are humans in general and people in general are also ghoulish and horrible and no amount of eyelashfluttering or smooth tangodancing will disguise that.  You might be the owner of a big studio and have an inflatable dead horse in your pool but you still can't relate to your wife and the only thing left in your life is pathetic thrillseeking cockfights cheesy stag flicks.Incidentally I'm amazed at how many quirky things ended up in the screenplay that WEREN'T part of the book!  Kudos to the scriptwriter for that at least!".

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then a true gem pops out of the past... that is if you are a keen cinemagoer or movieviewer...as nowadays only kids go to the movies. The day of The Locust is what John Schlesinger had up his sleeve after the huge success of 'Midnight Cowboy'. It was his 'pot shot' at Hollywood. It was his Guy Fawkes beneath Parliament. It was his warning that the Twin Towers story COULD just be a sordid masquerade...although of course he didn't know it yet. They say that Hawthorne's book is far more engrossing. Sure... books take up ten times more time to unravel. His characters are meanspirited calculating 'cold fish'...and what they get is what they deserve. But I feel Schlesinger and his scriptwriters made a worthwhile effort to imbue even these squirming serpents and coldblooded insects with a breath of pathos and humanity. And rightly so... the story GAINS points. 'Locust' sometimes feels more like Bergman Fassbinder or even Fellini than like an American film. It reminds us of Grosz. Of German decadence between world wars. We are often subconsciously led down grim corridors of analogy.... Nazi hysteria... Hollywood Boulevard madness. We are voyeurs... we watch a giant Dream Machine which spawns future mutants... frustrated maniacs. And literally DEVOURS its pathetic 'extras' and hopefuls. That is why the overtones of the film seem somehow biblical. David Lynch's sourcematerial is suddenly openly revealed. THIS MOVIE! We have Twin Peaks themes and characters... Mulholand Drive even more so... Blue Velvet...and so on... But hey! Let's be fair.... anyone who has ever REALLY known Hollywood can only nod and say...Yes...It's all true.... And if I'm still here in the industry.... I'm either a hypocrite a victim or a pervert of sorts. ALL the characters are crazed atoms of the American Dream Factory. And Schlesinger opts for a finale worthy of another British but surprisingly hotbloodedly so director... Ken Russell. Madness on the rampage. But is he only a fine line away from exaggeration? Is he not symbolically 'spot on'? That's for you to decide. Meanwhile the film has done the job it came to do. Maybe even better than 'Chinatown'. And believe me the HEY DAY of Hollywood may seem far away and long ago... but the manic drive and sexual blackmail we observe in this reptilian display is all too contemporary to our time. Bon Apetit! If your digestive system is up to it.".

Sunset Boulevard and The Bad and the Beautiful do a much better job of that.  Performances from Burgess Meridith William Atherton and Billy Barty are very good.

The film charts each of the characters' aspirations that come crashing into one of the most apocalyptic and ghastly endings in film history.I had read West's novel years ago before finally seeing this film and it's evident that director John Schlesinger took heavy cues from the source material. This adaptation stays true to the novel only making minor alterations where it has to cut its losses. It's dark wacky grotesque and at times flatout disturbing and there is a strange dreaminess to the film that recalls the novel's borderlineabsurdist approach to the material. There is a phenomenal attention to detail here and sophisticated cinematography capturing the hazy underworld of Hollywood that houses its rejects and wannabes. The film's greatest asset is inarguably its stellar cast. William Atherton plays the leery painter with conviction while Donald Sutherland captures the eccentricity and quirks of Homer. In the novel West draws all the characters to the tipping point of caricatures and Karen Black perhaps best embodies this as Faye the starryeyed and artless aspiring actress Black evokes the childlike sensibility of the character with a purposeful sexuality that is what makes her character in particular so disturbed. Burgess Meredith also Black's costar in Burnt Offerings is appropriately hammy as her gimmicky showman of a father. Geraldine Page makes a brief but grandiose appearance.The oftdiscussed ending is worthy of the talk it is the subject of it is one of the most wellshot and harrowing conclusions in film history edging on the apocalyptic and the orgiastic much like the source material. While typically discussed as a drama I consider The Day of the Locust to be a horror film just as I consider the novel to be a horror novel unconventional albeit but the film captures something wildly grotesque that challenges its audience and some may find it a difficult a film to find merit in. There is a terrifying nucleus to this story that trumps its lesshorrific finishings. All in all The Day of the Locust is a classic and important film like its source novel it serves us with a grim portrait of society that is not exclusive to Hollywood but is perhaps best exemplified in the city of stolen water and stolen dreams. Barring Mulholland Drive which came over two decades later and was undoubtedly influenced by Schlesinger's film The Day of the Locust remains the greatest fictional representation of Hollywood ever and perhaps the most horrifying film to lay claim to Los Angeles. 1010.".

While typically discussed as a drama I consider The Day of the Locust to be a horror film just as I consider the novel to be a horror novel unconventional albeit but the film captures something wildly grotesque that challenges its audience and some may find it a difficult a film to find merit in. There is a terrifying nucleus to this story that trumps its lesshorrific finishings. All in all The Day of the Locust is a classic and important film like its source novel it serves us with a grim portrait of society that is not exclusive to Hollywood but is perhaps best exemplified in the city of stolen water and stolen dreams. Barring Mulholland Drive which came over two decades later and was undoubtedly influenced by Schlesinger's film The Day of the Locust remains the greatest fictional representation of Hollywood ever and perhaps the most horrifying film to lay claim to Los Angeles. 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Schlesinger's film of Nathanial West's iconic novel Day of the Locust has been hanging in there with film buffs for so long I think it is about time it was acknowledged as the minor masterpiece that it is. Maybe not so minor in fact. When I watch it which I've been doing since the day it was released I find myself wishing Hitchcock or Welles had directed an adaptation of it something that would have insured its arrival into the pantheon of masterpieces. This isn't to degrade Schlesinger's work at all but I think the Hitchock or Wellesian touch might have made it into a film as much talked about as Sunset Boulevard. Day of the Locust is not simply another Hollywood expos along the lines of Sunset Boulevard A Star is Born and The Bad and the Beautiful but it is every bit as fascinating and gut wrenching perhaps more so than those classics. Nathanial West's tale is a full blown horror story. Hollywood itself is the inanimate monster that evokes the beast in the bedazzled humans that inhabit the landscape. ALL are victims of the mind numbing soul evaporating environment. The ironic and disheartening thing about this story is that West has used Love as the vehicle that speeds its passengers towards their melancholy doom. The most sympathetic character is Homer Simpson yes Homer Simpson played with a quiet and tortured passion by Donald Sutherland. Homer is a meek virginal certified public account who fate has thrown in the path of Faye Greener Karen Black and her downatheel father Harry Burgess Meredith in a terrifying performance of pathos and madness an ex vaudevillian who has ended up in Hollywood after arriving their years before for a small part in a B movie. Tod William Atherton is a bright young man newly arrived from Yale. He is a gifted artist and spends his time recording in drawings the people and events he witnesses. He is rapidly sucked into the vortex of despair and barely escapes with his life in the end. Homer on the other hand is not so lucky. The final scenes are harrowing. The most shocking effect it had on me is that I found myself rooting for the crazed Homer who does something I can't bring myself to reveal because the shock of it is worth discovering for oneself. It involves the comeuppance of a horrid child actor named Adore its sex is ambiguous played with infuriating moxie by the young Jackie Haley.The cast is splendid. Geraldine Page makes an atomic blast of an appearance as the charlatan evangelist Aimee Sempel McPherson in a single scene of insane religious hysteria.Day of the Locust is about our atavistic need for gods and the subsequent need to destroy them for not living up to our delusions of ourselves. It is a truly disturbing and fascinating film and should be seen by all lovers of great film adaptations of great booksThe 1970s and early 1980s were a Golden Age in Hollywood that is just now being acknowledged as such. The Day of the Locust is one film from that era that rests comfortably near the top of the pyramid. Don't miss it.Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING is based on a French play by Victorien Sardou. He was the leading French dramatist for most of the 19th Century but his specialty of the well made play was lampooned into oblivion by later writers most notably George Bernard Shaw who labeled such carefully plotted works as Sardoodledum. Actually like such good 20th Century dramatists as Terrance Rattigan a really good drama can survive it's structural mechanics if the characterizations stand out to be true. Sardou's serious plays like his historical plays are too stiff to work today. But his lighter fare might still be able to work if updated.Lubitsch reset the story into modern New York. Melvin Douglas is married to Merle Oberon and is a successful attorney. But their seemingly happy marriage has hit a dull spot. He is not aware of this but she is noticing his idiosyncrasies and finding some too annoying for words His habit of sticking his finger into her middle playfully of course and saying Keex drives her up a wall. She tries a popular psychiatrist Alan Mowbray in a kind of reprise of a similar role from Lubitsch's DESIRE. Then she goes to an art gallery and meets eccentric pianist Burgess Meredith. He is a man who seems more full of sour but honest opinions about everything than he has musical talent. He goes from picture to picture telling Oberon what is wrong with each. That painting won't live. he declares of one work. Oberon who can barely keep looking at it says Thank God for that!.Meredith with his sour view of most things is soon ruining one of Douglas's business dinners for a bunch of Hungarian businessmen led by Sig Ruman. Douglas has a first rate Hungarian meal complete with goulash for his guests and even teaches  or tries to teach Oberon  to say a Hungarian toast for their guests. But Meredith dominates the evening by insisting on playing a classical piece of piano music and then 19 variations he has composed on it.Gradually Douglas tries to restore his marriage but finds Oberon in a deep commitment to Meredith. This leads to one of the best scenes when Douglas and his partner Harry Davenport try to stage an act of cruelty against Oberon for divorce purposes. To do this they have to have Eve Arden as an unsuspecting witness to an escalating argument leading to a slap in the face. But each time Douglas can't bring himself to do it until he basically downs two or three drinks. In the meantime Arden keeps noticing that Davenport supposedly giving her dictation is actually doing everything over and over again including snapping his fingers at the moment that Douglas and Oberon are supposed to start their argument. The film ends with Oberon considering the good and bad points of Douglas and Meredith to reach her conclusion about who to stay with. It is an obvious choice perhaps and it may seem to take her too long to decide but the three leads give bright performances supported by Davenport and Arden and the others. Not on the level of THE MERRY WIDOW or NINOTCHKA but worth watching for some satisfactory chuckles.".

This being said I certainly did not love THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING and his fans would hardly recognize this as a film of the great romanticcomedy director. Most of the problem lies in the script as the characters are generally unlikable their motivation seems confusing and almost nonexistent and the film often tries too hard to be kooky. The usual Lubitsch touch which is very subtle just isn't there.Merle Oberon plays a petulant and annoying lady. She's rich and has every reason to be happy. However being too rich too bored and too selfinvolved she decides she needs to spice up her dull marriage by bringing another man into her life. This man is a pianist overplayed by Burgess Meredith. He is a misanthropic pianista person so conceited and cynical that it's hard to imagine anyone putting up with him. Unlike Mischa Auer's charming loafer from MY MAN GODFREY Meredith played a man who was thoroughly unlikable. Oberon seemed to find the demanding and nasty Meredith fun though everyone else felt he was just a jerkand he certainly was.Now at first you really feel sorry for Oberon's husband played by Melvin Douglas. Later however you wonder if he's an idiot because he still wants Oberon back when their marriage naturally begins to fizzle. After all she deliberately flaunted her new friend in front of her husband because she felt bored and petulant. I enjoyed seeing Douglas punch Meredith on two occasions but also felt that perhaps he owed Oberon's character a couple as well! Heck had it been me I'd have thrown her out possibly through a window and not looked back. So what we have is a film is about infidelity and you can't like the charactershardly a topic for a Lubitsch comedy. While it seems that Oberon never actually gets around to sleeping with Meredith her lack of regard for her husband made me hate the film. Selfish Oberon and unimaginably rude Meredithtwo characters that kill a comedy or romance.".

Heck had it been me I'd have thrown her out possibly through a window and not looked back. So what we have is a film is about infidelity and you can't like the charactershardly a topic for a Lubitsch comedy. While it seems that Oberon never actually gets around to sleeping with Meredith her lack of regard for her husband made me hate the film. Selfish Oberon and unimaginably rude Meredithtwo characters that kill a comedy or romance.";

When I first began watching I almost turned it off because that's what I thought was coming. But I stuck with it and I found that this is a rather pleasant comedy about a somewhat boring man who is boring his wife in their everyday life to the point where she has an affair and the husband and wife decide to divorce...well almost.Melvyn Douglas doesn't have much to do for the first third of the film...but after all he is supposed to be boring. No that part of the film belongs to the lovely Merle Oberon. But Douglas' part strengthens for the remainder of the film and he does nicely as does Oberon as a rather spoiled wife. Who is the third side of the triangle? Burgess Meredith as a rather insufferable pianist. It's interesting to watch Meredith here. He seems strong in the scenes where he is speaking but a little awkward in the scenes where he is silent. And I always enjoy watching character actor Harry Davenport who never disappoints. Eve Arden is here also as a secretary but her part is crucial though rather small.This probably isn't going to end up on your DVD shelf but if you like romantic comedies from the 30s...yes I know this came out in 1941 but it seems older...then you'll probably like this enough to watch...once.".

Women taken care of in high style with no worries and nothing to think about but how unhappy they think that they are.I wish I could make this review more inspiring but the film itself is pleasant but uninspiring. No new ground is covered here and the parts of it are greater than the whole. I can give kudos to Melvyn Douglas as the husband who thinks he is more clever at getting his wife back than he is and to Burgess Meredith as somebody who thinks a great deal of himself as a musical genius but seems to have no visible means of support. Merle Oberon is lovely here and seems to have that uncertain feeling every step of the way. Events more than her own will seem to be propelling her forward in every instance. A few great memorable lines what could be heavy melodrama turned into a very light romantic comedy Lubitsch style and probably worth your time if you run across it but nothing to deliberately seek out.".

The results are more sophistication than setups more occasional chuckles than laughs. Larry Douglas is a married insurance executive. Trouble is he's neglecting wife Jill Oberon who's having hiccup bouts probably because his main communication is poking her playfully in the stomach. So she takes up with squirrelly Sebastian Meredith who's an egotistical man of the arts. Now Larry's unhappy with the results but what's he to do.Oberon and Douglas both lowkey their parts. Add that to a talky script and we get some good lines and situations but mild results overall. Looks like Meredith's sour artiste was intended to supply needed verve. However his character is too obnoxious to generate much comedy. Too bad as other reviewers point out that Eve Arden's comedic potential goes untapped. Some caustic exchanges between her and Meredith would have livened things up. However two comedic setups do stand out the office scene where divorce plans keep misfiring plus the climax where Larry pretends to have a girl in his bedroom to make Jill jealous. In fact that last scene has the vivacious earmarks of a better total comedy than what we have otherwise.Anyway it's New York sophistication done Lubitsch style even if second rank.".

What separates this from a GOOD avant garde is the notorious lack of any meaningful plot or idea that the director wishes to convey. And if there's something I can't stand it's an oldasthehills story cosily cloaked in a directors' slightly demented vision. susceptive foreigner falls in love with a man from foreign culture and learns to love and understand this foreign culture after initial struggles. That's it. Not more and not less. This movie may be slightly less kitchy than other movies with the same theme but the price for this is high  many endless and dragging scenes portraying things previously shown enough times. That just makes you want to grab your remote and fastforward a little bit. However this movie does have some rather original twists to the plot and it's good enough to keep you watching throughout. It's also straightforward enough to appeal to people who usually avoid avant garde and the artsy. No prior knowledge of the theme is needed before watching this movie which is a bliss.".

	schema:reviewBody "Diane is a young promiscuous trainee stockbroker who leads a life that is not unhappy but is rather empty of meaningful human connection. This is shown in her flippancy towards her friend's upcoming wedding and her lack of a relationship with her mother. She receives a sunflower with a blank card but soon forgets about it. She discovers another blank card in her bag which she left in the church during her friend's wedding ceremony. After missing the ferry to the reception she is offered a lift by a friendly seaman in his tug boat. He gives her drugged tea however and she wakes up in a strange harem surrounded by Arabic women and children. What follows is a brief mental breakdown after wandering in the desert and being found by the sheikh's falcon. She eventually accepts her fate and when she does finally meet the sheikh Salim she realises he has been watching her for some time and that she has no real qualms about sleeping with him. He does not share her cavalier attitude towards sex however. He is a man who is trying to reconcile his Arabic roots with his need to embrace the Western World. This is a complex desire and his relationship with Diane is equally complex for it is based upon obsessive love on his side and conflicting emotions of love and loneliness on hers.This film has beautiful cinematography and a hauntingly lovely Middle Eastern themed score. The two go hand in hand to create a film which is atmospheric and lasting in ones memory. The performances of Ben Kingsley as Salim and Nastassja Kinski as Diane are both very powerful and subtle. Some have said that Ben Kingsley comes off as dull but I can not disagree more. He conveys every emotion with his usual subtle brilliance. It is not necessary for him to try and convey his emotions with excessive energy. This is a man who is silently torn by his loyalty to his culture and responsibilities and his desire for what he knows is unobtainable for a man in his position. Nastassja Kinski gives one of her best performances and shows Diane's slow emotional maturity and gradual acceptance and understanding of both herself and Salim. Their chemistry is excellent because it is genuine and natural. It is sensual and languid much like the film itself which is why most people would not enjoy it. This film requires a large amount of patience in order to truly appreciate its development. It is also not for those who wish to have conclusive answers at the end of the film. The film requires an audience or viewer who is content to interpret its ending as they will. The film's ending while tragic and open is the only one that it could realistically have. Harem is very much in the same vein as 9 12 Weeks and Wild Orchard with its distinctive mood and nonlinear plot. It does not have the hectic sex scenes of these films but it has the same sort of message the examination of loneliness the realisation of a quiet kind of melancholy which can rule ones life without one realising it and finally the discovery of another person who is also lonely and unaware of their melancholic existence. Whether or not the connection with this other person is lasting positive or destructive remains to be seen.".

The movie was somewhat dry maybe the second location in the Arabian desert had something to do with it otherwise only the personal memories would make me have the slightest interest in it.";

In the opening scene a mafia boss is killed by a hitman along with a bunch of his bodyguards. His family puts a bounty on the hitmans head 100 million dollars to be exact... That's alot! and they call upon all the assassins of Hong Kong to find this hitman and kill him.Jet Li's character Fu is a rookie hitman who's low on cash. He's thrown out by his roommates for not paying the bill and is wandering the streets when he hears of the 100 million dollar award for the one who finds the killer of the mafia boss. He also finds a new friend who finds a few hits for him. However it seems that Fu isn't really that great of a hitman. Sure he is fast strong and well trained in the martial arts but he's to sensitive. They end up getting in trouble because everyone thinks Fu's friend is the one who killed the mafia boss and they have to run from some of Eiji's the badguy in the movie... But is he really bad? What did he do that's so bad? Well its obvious that he is meant to be the badguy anyway assassins. The end is pretty predictable but the identity of the killer who killed the mafia boss is probably supposed to come as a surprise. It didn't. but all in all its a good movie. Entertaining and much much better than most Hollywood action movies. I give it a 8 interesting characters plot fights and pretty much everything. But I suppose it could have been better on some minor points. It just doesn't feel like a 10 heh.".

As the film goes on all the comedy moments are forgotten and we begin to move into a serious action flick involving a bit more gun play than the usual Jet Li film in fact it comes across at times as a cross between a Jet Li film and a John Woo heroic bloodshed type affair.The action sequences are all to the high standard expected of Jet with a few added gun play sequences. Li is very likable in the lead role and Tsang is very good in his sidekick role showing a different persona to his performance in Infernal affairs.Overall a fairly good hong kong action flick but the differing styles clash at times 610".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the cover for this I wondered if it was some weird Chinese comedy with Jet Li.  All of the stars are holding guns except for Eric Tsang who is holding a banana.  Why is Gigi Leung giving us a wink?  And how come Simon Yam has one gun to his head?  If anything I knew I was in for something and this is one film where you can say don't judge a DVD by its cover.The acting is great especially Jet Li who is normally known as a kung fu master or shoot 'em up guy.  He combines both of these elements but also shows he can be a romantic guy when it comes to Miss Gigi Leung.  No wonder the girls love him.But Eric Tsang outshines everyone as the moneyhungry guy who will do anything to make a buck and is successful in every transaction except when it comes to having a relationship with his daughter Leung.The movie centers around the assassination of a Japanese businessman.  Jet Li's character Fu comes to Hong Kong from the mainland and finds that he is unlike his money hungry friend but knows he has to do something to survive.  Somehow the former military soldier meets up with a man named Ngok Lo Tsang who encourages Fu to join him in finding the killer for the reward money that's being offered.  The action picks up from that point on and the great thing about it is that it has enough kung fu and gunplay to keep you on your toes but it doesn't go overboard either way.  Inbetween this Fu bumps into a lady Leung and eventually finds out she is related to his new boss.  Combine that with the police investigating the murder case and some hilarious moments from Tsang Hong Kong's Joe Pesci? and you have one of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong in some time.  Well written nice cinematography and the acting is on the money.  Just when you think they couldn't add any more elements to this film they do.".

Jet Li is Fu a mild mannered and highly skilled ex Chinese army soldier who lives in the cheap end of town in HK that is.  He hangs around with a bunch of blowhard hoods who get hit jobs from coded requests in the personal ads presumably Fu wants to be one of them for the money and prestige but I thought this aspect was a little thin.  Something lost in the subtitles no doubt.  A high level Japanese businessmancrook was assassinated activating his revenge fund of 100 million and attracting bounty hunters from across the globe.  Fu gets wind of the job via his little network and tries to get in on it.  It is here that he meets Eric Tsang's character a fairly seasoned lowlife who sees Fu's potential and latches on to him becoming his sponsor or agent.  Well they make quite a pair one an achingly polite meek ass kicker ! the other a sharply dressed professional liar with a fake resume from hell.Surrounding these two and their odd relationship is loads of wheeling and dealing as global hit squads the police the dead guy's grandson and those who control the estate vie for whatever they can get out of the deal.  All the while rumours circulate that the job was done by the mysterious ubervigilante know as the Angel of Death or The King of Killers.  It's a multilingual multicultural affair that really reflects our contemporary world in a way that isn't seen often enough on screen.  And by the end it's clear the film has bitten off more than it can chew not getting the most out of the power games and some characters.  But that doesn't stop it being generally well acted exciting funny and filled with character  a lot more than most that share the Jet Li shelf at my video store anywayDo check it out.".

The thing is that the movie was released on Chinatown video with this name so this is that name that I am using.As I said before this movie could be called The King of Killers namely because it is about an assassin called the King of Killers. He kills for free and only kills people who deserve it. As such he kills a high profile Japanese business man and upon his death a fund is activated to go to those who are the first to bring down the killer. Unfortunately and this is the twist somebody else was paid some money upon the businessman's death and upon discovery they think he killed him.The movie is basically an action packed adventure where at first it looks like a bumbling idiot and a naive mainlander are trying to hunt a professional killer but it turns out that the idiot is trying to make sure that nobody thinks that he is the killer which is true since he is a real idiot. What makes the movie cool is not the indepth plot or strong themes but rather the cool action sequences. This movie has one of the best elevator shootouts that I have ever seen and the final battle is one worth waiting for. What this movie is is a HongKong action flick and as one it delivers.".

I found out that there is a better version known as Hitman that is also six minutes longer. Anyway the little fat guy even sounds like Belushi and is the comic relief as a con man. Jet Li is a wannabe hitman and doesn't know the first thing about it although he kicks ass like crazy. A Japanese mobster is killed by the King of Killers and his family ponies up a reward of one hundred million dollars. Jet's character Fu and Norman the fat guy con their way into the competition and mayhem ensues. The so called comedy is pretty lame but there are a few good jokes. The action as I said is terrific and intense. The Japanese employ a tall white guy as a body guardkiller and he is wicked bad. He has a neat gimmick with tiny high intensity flashlights lasers? disguised as rings and in the toes of his shoes which he uses to temporarily blind his opponents so he can beat the bejesus out of them. There is a weird scene where the grandson of the slain Mr.Big eats some of grand pa's ashes. I think it was to gain his strength or something like that. Anyway it was bizarre and different which is a good thing. I don't know who does the English voice overs on these movies but they should list those people on the credits because it is their hard work which you hear on the soundtrack. So for good martial art ass kickery this movie delivers. You will need to fast forward through the stupid stuff".

The plot is very well done and i feel this is one of Jet's most underrated films! plus i thought Jet's acting was fantastic!.You get to see a lot of Jet's natural ability here and i think this movie should at least be around the 6.9 7.0 range! on this site plus The ending was great.

	schema:reviewBody "Out of all of Jet Li's films... this one shows off his acting talent than his martial arts.  This film focuses way to much on the bland plot which is why your left only to deal with his acting which isn't that bad for someone that went from wushu champion to the acting gig.Out of all the movies in my Jet Li collection... I don't suggest this one to anyone thats looking for a hardcore fighting film.  Granted the last fight scene is very intense but it's only the last 1015 mins of the film and it's full of patented Jet Li trademarked moves like his belt as a weapon and his hilarious 'bitch slaps' to the face.  Most of the film is plot and slapstick humor.".

	onyx:emotionText "Out of all of Jet Li's films... this one shows off his acting talent than his martial arts.  This film focuses way to much on the bland plot which is why your left only to deal with his acting which isn't that bad for someone that went from wushu champion to the acting gig.Out of all the movies in my Jet Li collection... I don't suggest this one to anyone thats looking for a hardcore fighting film.  Granted the last fight scene is very intense but it's only the last 1015 mins of the film and it's full of patented Jet Li trademarked moves like his belt as a weapon and his hilarious 'bitch slaps' to the face.  Most of the film is plot and slapstick humor.";

The cast is good with Eric Tsang standing out particularly and Heiji Sato making a decent debut as the nasty Japanese guy there seem to be a lot of these in Hong Kong movies. Action scenes are relatively thin on the ground but what's there is of a good standard  although you might expect better from Hong Kong's greatest action export.What's most refreshing about this film is its understatement. The plot isn't anything special but it's pretty watertight and the action is all pretty believable if unspectacular.One thing I particularly liked about Hitman was the way that different languages were used throughout the film without using dubbing as in The Black Sheep Affair. This contributes to the overall realistic feel of the film and is something I would like to see more on screen. This aside there is nothing particularly innovative here but nothing worth criticising either  a film I could recommend to people who don't usually enjoy foreign martial arts movies.".

His latest victim is an elderly Japanese businessman who had committed atrocities during the war. His grandson takes over the business and offers 50000000 for the killer and an identical sum for the person who contracted him. This attracts contract killers from around the world. These include Fu a would be hitman from Mainland China who's previous contracts suggest he is in the wrong line of work. When he turns up be finds himself supported by Ngok Lo who tells people he is Fu's manager. He sets about making Fu look the part. As the story progresses the various assassins chase down leads before finally those surviving face off in one final fight to get the money. Away from the hunt for the killer Fu gets close to Ngok Lo's beautiful daughter Kiki.This film was a lot of fun it combines humour impressive action and even a little romance. The central story is well told and provides a few good twists before the assassin's identity is finally revealed. The action is hardly nonstop but when the action scenes occur they are impressive. Jet Li does an impressive job as Fu and Eric Tsang is a lot of fun as Ngok Lo. There are also notable performances from Simon Yam as Officer Chan Kwan the policeman looking for the killer and Gigi Leung as Kiki the rest of the cast are solid too. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of Hong Kong cinema looking for a nice blend of comedy and action.These comments are based on watching the film in Cantonese with English subtitles. In the version I watched the characters and been renamed with similar western names but in my review I stuck with the names listed on the IMDb.".

It's a film which throws in a police story a murder mystery loads of assassins and bad guys a romance plenty of excellent comedy and of course some very fine martial arts battles. In fact the fights here are fewer but better than ever perhaps because they are so few. Highlights include the predictable but engaging end battlemassacre and the Russian fighter who uses his light ring to blind his opponents you'll understand if you see it.The characters are fully developed and the script is chock full of intense situation personality building and tons of comedy. Eric Tsang plays Li's mentor Norman Lo and is extremely good in the part having moved on wonderfully from his turns in such '80s fare as MY LUCKY STARS. Jet Li himself is very good in the leading role being both wonderful in the action stakes and also more than adequate when it comes to acting as well. The movie is well paced and remains interesting throughout is beautifully filmed and is just about as good as you can get for a fight flick. Highly recommended.".

Simon Yam provides the serious acting Eric Tsang provides the comical relief and Jet Li is of course doing the action.But they were being brutally butchered by a pathetic English dubbed audio track.Storywise then Contract Killer is very typical for the action movies that were coming out of Hong Kong cinema during the late 1990's. That being said it is of course up to the individual viewer whether that is good or bad. I did find it entertaining enough for what it was I just struggled to swallow that dubbing pill.Aside from the dubbing horror then the music in the movie was mostly very poorly selected and here I'm thinking of the title track the music played during the rather impressive elevator shaft fight scene and during the last fight scene.Contract Killer appeals to anyone with a lifelong love romance with Hong Kong cinema.

A whole panoply of moneygrabbers come out of the woodwork to try and claim the loot by catching the wily killer including the murdered tycoon's son Eiji Sato.

Who will find  or become  the King of the Killers? Find out today...We've always been big Jet Li fans and Contract Killer is a solid showcase for his talents. It was fun watching him go from a thrifty ragamuffin to a dapper killer but while still continuing to be a good guy at heart of course. He even helps a group of children win stuffed animals at a carnival including one lucky kid who gets a Big Bird and a Cookie Monster. Pretty sweet. Much of the transformation of Fu's character was done using a classic shopping montage which we always love to see.Director Wei Tung who is primarily known for being an actor and stuntman turns in a wellshot professionallooking product and the U.S. DVD is in widescreen which reinforces that. Unfortunately it's Englishdubbed only with no option for the original spoken language. Another frustrating thing about the DVD presentation is that a lot of annoying rap music is shoehorned in all over the place. In many scenes funkyfresh beats just randomly start playing and of course it's all over the opening and closing credits. The lyrics even appear if you turn on the closedcaptioning. Here's a prime example and we quote contract killer yo. Our question is WHY? Is there someone out there who would enjoy the movie exactly as it is but the fact that there isn't rap on the soundtrack every two minutes cause him to lose faith and interest in the film? Would that really be a dealbreaker for someone? Of course the main reason to watch Contract Killer is for the Martial Arts fights and there are some absolute killers on display. It really is a pleasure to watch Jet Li work his magic. We definitely felt these highquality and extremely wellexecuted fights should have lasted longer and there should have been more of them. But what we do get is topnotch stuff. Not to belabor the point but watching these beautifully choreographed battles with some pipedin hiphop is like spray painting over fine art. But honestly it's not really reason enough to avoid seeing this movie especially considering it's available dirt cheap and is widely accessible.While not without its flaws Contract Killer boasts some impressive fights and is one of the last pagerera Martial Arts extravaganzas.".

In the movie Stallone is a convict just trying to ride his time out but the warden makes it very hard on him. John Amos also depicts the caring but hard as nails Prison guard Micon very well.

During the night he is whisked away to a maximum security prison on the orders of a sadistic warden out for revenge because Leone was the only man to have ever escaped from his prison thus setting in motion the wheels of revenge.We then follow Leone as he is pushed to the limits by crazy warden Drumgoole Donald Sutherland and all the sadistic guards under his command. He also enlists the help of resident inmate beefcake Chink Weber Sonny Landham and they all in turn try to break Leone at all costs to ensure that he never leaves prison again. There certainly is nothing here that hasn't been done before in the prison film genre and only an idiot would expect anything other than the ending we get but this is a Stallone movie and it's full of guts testo macho action and it should be noted that Sly here puts some depth to the character of Leone. He garners our sympathy quite quickly and considering the bloke is built like the proverbial brick outhouse it's quite an achievement.The supporting players are a mixed bunch this is Tom Sizemore's first motion picture and he does really well with the character of Dallas Sonny Landham is his usual scary menacing self whilst Frank McRae as Eclipse does just enough right to make his mark. So it's something of a surprise to me that the best actor on show is actually the film's weak link. Donald Sutherland does overplay it to the point that he goes beyond pantomime villain it's a real teeth itching performance that he would only outdo with the dreadful Jamie Lee Curtis starrer Virus 10 years later but in a film with such primal funaction intentions it doesn't ruin the film and leaves it all told as a fine genre piece.No awards here for sure but when I watch a film about a man played by Sly Stallone in prison then I think I know what to expect and it delivers all that I hoped for so hooray for the beefcake I say. 710".

The story is flawed and shallow and the viewer shall not think how a prisoner is transferred the way Frank Leone is and his lawyer simply does not exist in the story. The characters are not well developed and there is no explanation for the sadistic behavior of the prison guards. However this type of movie is not to think and entertains.

It's a lesson. You'll love to hate him as Sutherland is pictureperfect in his delivery. The cast are outstanding as the performances of all simply engage. Also making the cut is Darlanne Fluegal William Allen Young Jordan Lund and Danny Trejo makes a brief appearance here or there. The story follows that of Frank Leone having only 6 months of his sentence to serve but then one night he's whisked away and he finds himself in a high security penitentiary with a warden Drumgoole who he shares a past with that tends to break his spirit within that time by using brutality intimidation and humiliation. However despite Drumgoole's grudge to see Leone's spirit smothered he'll find out it won't come too easy. Habitual structure but quite a tense grim and barbaric prisonyard story with director Flynn's durably taut handling rising above the predictability. It does seem to move from one sadistic act to another as the warden tries about anything to break his man but the plot installs some genuine companionship's between the characters and provides a mindset of how these inmates truly get through the days so to keep from sinking in to insanity. Unpleasant but also affecting. Bill Conti strings together an effective music score.You won't break me.".

Habitual structure but quite a tense grim and barbaric prisonyard story with director Flynn's durably taut handling rising above the predictability. It does seem to move from one sadistic act to another as the warden tries about anything to break his man but the plot installs some genuine companionship's between the characters and provides a mindset of how these inmates truly get through the days so to keep from sinking in to insanity. Unpleasant but also affecting. Bill Conti strings together an effective music score.You won't break me.";

I would rank it among the best action films of Stallone's resume and also among the best action films of the 80s.The supporting performances are quite good all around. Donald Sutherland is solid as always and you get easily the best performance of Sonny Landham's career and Tom Sizemore showing why he became a bigger star about 5 years down the road.This is the only big movie where Larry Romano got more than a few lines and he does a good job as First Base. I was a little surprised he didn't go much further and generally only appeared in the future when the casting director needed someone to look and sound Italian. I recommend this one even if you aren't a big Stallone fan. If any lesser known film will change your mind about him it's probably either Copland or this one.".

If you've ever seen any other prison movies then you'll know what to expect here the gang of thugs Stallone's loyal pals the hero's stay in solitary confinement beatings by the guards and the guard who turns out to be an ally of the hero. Thankfully this is a fastpaced movie which packs a lot of cheesy malebonding doublecrosses and action into the running time and at least turns out to be consistently entertaining for a mainstream movie.Stallone as per usual plays a squeakyclean character who has to face up against the bad guys. Stallone's acting skills are perfectly suited for a lowbrow movie such as this and he fits in nicely. Sonny Landham previously an adult star is also very good and hissably evil as a cruel inmate who is determined to make his life miserable. The supporting cast is unusually good for a film like this a fact which makes Stallone's movie more enjoyable than Van Damme's prison offering DEATH WARRANT. John Amos is a hardasnails guard with compassion in his heart a young and thin Tom Sizemore is a wacky fellow inmate who becomes Stallone's pal and the familiar Frank McRae is a huge but cuddly carlover. To top it all off a previously big name actor stars as the chief bad guy...it's none other than Donald Sutherland who has had a nice thirtyfive year career playing in horror and cult movies. Sutherland has a ball as the sadistic ruthless and slightly demented warden.Basically the various scenarios throughout this film are just different ways to make Stallone suffer. He has to suffer holding his breath for over a minute in a poisoned cell getting locked up in solitary getting stabbed and beaten plus lots more. Of course you just know that Stallone and his pals are going to turn the tables at the end in what is a pretty good tense conclusion. LOCK UP is a film for Stallone fans prison movie fans or just casual viewers who want to switch their brains off after a hard day at work.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the same year he escaped from prison with Kurt Russell in Tango  Cash Stallone was lockedup again in this gritty grim thriller. Frank Leone is an ordinary man forced into avenging thugs who beatup his kindly old mentor. He's put in prison for the crime but escapes just before his sentence is up so he can be with the old man at his deathbed. His escape and subsequent publicity shames Warden Drumgoole a very evil Donald Sutherland who is blacklisted with in the Penal system. Leone serves out his remaining six months in a cozy minimum security facility and dreams of returning home to his girlfriend. In the middle of the night he is dragged from his bed and taken to Drumgoole's new domain Gateway the worst prison in America. Drumgoole intends to make Leone serve very very hard time pushing him to his limits in hope that he might lash out and thus extend his sentence.It goes through a lot of prison movie clichs and I guess it doesn't really stand out against the better or more exciting movies in the genre. It entertains and is occasionally engaging but is by no means a classic. The animosity between Leone and Drumgoole is interesting and the casting of crazy Sonny Landham as the yard boss is quite scary but again these are all clichs. Stallone brought back Bill Conti his old pal from the Rocky movies to score the movie but he effort is totally inappropriate and the light touch to the music spoils the intensity of many scenes. A different composer might have resulted in a more memorable movie. You'll never really feel the need to revisit Lock Up after a single viewing.".

	schema:headline " Cool little Stallone flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Lock Up is a pretty good movie for Stallone fans although it could easily have been much better had he not been basically a saint behind bars. Stallone plays Frank Leone who faces multiple prison terms total beginning with an 18month sentence he was given for avenging the vicious beating of an old man who took him off the streets when he was a teenager. So back then he wasn't allowed to leave the prison to see his dying father when we meet him he is on a weekend leave from a minimum security prison a weekend that he spends playing ball with his kids while his charming wife looks on approvingly so he breaks out to go to the funeral. So his minor prison sentence turns into a big one although one that he spends at a comfortable minimum security joint with all kinds of perks including weekends and conjugals and even friendships with the guards. His release is approaching when suddenly he is awakened in the middle of the night and taken to a brutal maximumsecurity prison where he is to spend the rest of his sentence. It's called a routine transfer although he has done nothing to deserve such an upgrade in security status and even his wife is not informed of what happened to him.Ultimately he learns that he is being transferred to the prison of Warden Drumgoole Donald Sutherland at his creepy best who was in charge of the prison that Leone escaped from which in turn made it into the papers and ruined Drumgoole's career. Now he has his chance for revenge and he plans to arrange for Leone to spend the rest of his life in this prison.The movie carelessly glosses over the ease with which Drumgoole plucks Leone out of his own prison with no explanation to those in charge there and the conflict immediately switches to Leone trying to survive in this violent prison and stay out of trouble so he doesn't screw up his chances of getting released on time so he can go back to his family. Drumgoole pulls out all the stops in violating the law that his institution is designed to uphold so that he can keep this one guy down and Leone faces all manner of challenges ranging from shankladen inmates to one of his inmate buddies who steals the Mustang they've all restored together and tears all over the prison yard doing doughnuts.The movie is definitely entertaining although there are times when the cheese factor is through the roof such as the spray paint fight and the downright schoolgirlish friendship that Leone forms with a small group of other inmates. On the other hand it also has a much wider target audience than your average prison movie and it manages to generally avoid most of the gaping pitfalls that prison movies are in danger of falling into when they shoot for a wide audience. There's nothing realistic about it but for good Stallone entertainment this is not a bad way to follow up the massive success of the Rambo and Rocky films. Also keep your eye out for a young Tom Sizemore but be advised that the movie features violence unnecessary cheesiness and may leave you with an overwhelming desire to go out and get some doughnuts".

If you are a Mustang fan the Mustang restoration part of the movie probably really tugs at your heart every time as it does mine. The movie also really makes one realize what it would be like to be behind bars for real  how it would feel to try to maintain a relationship with a loved one on the outside. Donald Sutherland also plays a great mean warden. So good in fact that you just feel like punching him yourself for Stallone all thru the movie you might even catch yourself clenching your fist unknowingly. The end of the movie is obviously touching when Stallone finally finishes his time  walks out as the hard nosed guard that you hated during the movie all the sudden seems to like Stallone. All in all it's a great film in my opinion  I recommend it I think it is one of those movies that you should add to your collection.".

It would had taken place after First Blood.Lock up is an ambitious movie that tries hard to tell something  but ends as a cheesy  clichd and pointless movie. It's Shawshank Redemption for dummies. It has some good elements in it  but it's still a bombastic  over the top fare that it's hard to take seriously.The whole conflict in Lock up is ridiculous . It's basically a story of Devil prison warden trying to break down Jesus the prisoner . Everything is black and white here  there's no moral ambiguity . Furthermore  I fail to see what's the point of this movie is. That the justice system is flawed ? That the prison wardens and guards are sociopaths who enjoy torturing innocent prisoners ? That the prisoners are mostly good people who deserve respect ? Honestly  I don't know what the movie is trying to say here .The other serious problem of the movie is the acting of Sylvester Stallone and Donald Sutherland. Not only their characters are terribly one dimensional  one is 100  good  the other is 100  bad  but both of them give hammy performances. Stallone lacks expression  while Sutherland tries too hard to show how evil he is.The final nail to the coffin is the predictable  cheesy and clich screenplay. It does seem to move from one sadistic act to another. The villains are never subtle. The dialogues are often laughable Rape my fist . The friendship that Leone forms with a small group of other inmates is downright schoolgirlish the spray fight !. There's nothing realistic about the whole story and that's why it's hard to be emotionally involved with what is happening on the screen.There are good elements. Lock up is nicely directed by John Flynn Rolling thunder  Bestseller .The score by Bill Conti Rocky is good. The movie looks great  the prison used here was the East Jersey State Prison in Rahway New Jersey. The cast includes real inmates of Rahway State Prison. Chuck Wepner the reallife inspiration for Rocky Balboa was an inmate at the prison where the film was shot.The supporting cast is pretty strong with Tom Sizemore Passenger 57  Frank McRae 48 ours  Sonny Landham Predator  Darlanne Fluegal To live and die in LA and Danny Trejo Desperado.Lock up is a bad movie  but somewhat entertaining  especially if you don't take it seriously. It won't be until the 1997 when Stallone will make a good drama with the good and underrated Copland . I give Lock up 210.".

He's not Stallone's only problem as corruption seems to run high through the not so through nice prison officers some of the most merciless you'll see as their treatment of Stallone almost got to be too much. There are some tender and thankfully gentler moments as in Stallone's girlfriend Fluegel perfect who really becomes a beacon of shining light near the end in that intimate visit among the hell Stallonehas endured. The uncompromising officer make the ones in Chained Heat look tame. The other nicer moments ones I really liked were Stallone and score of buddies hanging out in the auto repair shed really bonding where convict Sizemore's admittance becomes quite a twist or a bad aftertaste. Sutherland's intention of course is to break Stallone and keep him there for an indefinite period. I really liked John Good Times Amos as one of the better more humane yet still stout headed guards and his presence in this film is a much welcomed grace. This is not your typical shoot em' up Stallone film and there are some Rocky moments int his but it does make a change of pace with an interesting structured story and really good performances from really capable actors Sutherland's you won't forget easy. Great cover poster and end credit song make for great night near two hour viewing. Go Sly.".

	schema:headline " Engrossing thriller with brutal action";
	schema:reviewBody "The first collaboration between Sunil Shetty and Ashok Honda resulted in a barbarous action film Anth. Rakshak was their second outing which could not match the stupendous success of Anth. However this picture is better since it is supported with superior direction as compared to Anth. In addition Rakshak also has a plot which is more engrossing than Anth. If the film falters it is because of some of the acting instead of the direction.Rakshak's storyline consists of a coma patient who is being targeted by some criminals. After he is rescued and revived we come to know that Raj Sinha was once an Assistant Superintendent of Police. He was leading a positive life with his family members. He visited his village after giving his police course exams. During his stay he is notified of his success in those courses. Basically he becomes an ASP of the Indian Police Force. Unfortunately all this happiness is short lived. Sadly wicked situations and vicious circumstances were against Sinha and his family members. It can be predicted that the antagonists of Rakshak are responsible for all the toil and trouble in Raj's colorful life. However the entire chain of events demonstrating this are well shot in the first half. The audience's attention is hooked for the most part. After watching a great deal of cruel injustice the audiences especially Sunil Shetty fans will be interested to witness Sunil's character ferociously ravage the antagonists of this film. In other words the audiences will rarely find a boring moment in this film.Ashok Honda's direction is good but it somehow falters towards the climax. The entire climatic battle is overdone and there is an overdose of violence. The first half is mostly coherent with occasional snags like a few crude comedy scenes. For instance the Kuchi Kuchi game between Sunil and Karishma is a little crude after the first couple times. The second half is much more serious with a lot of bloodshed which will entertain action lovers.Action sequences are mostly well choreographed by Ravi Dewan. Dewan is more creative this time without shying away from the brutality. However the preclimax action scene is preposterous. This is because Sunil is able to dodge numerous bullets while driving a jeep which never gets damaged until the end. I understand that 1990s action sequences are not meant to be very realistic. However such an action scene with an increasingly unrealistic invincibility factor is just too hard to digest.Anand Milind's music is very refreshing having some of the biggest hits of the 1990s. Shehar Ki Ladki is a catchy song with hilarious lyrics. The song went on to become a chartbuster in the mid 1990s. Kuchi Kuchi was added eventually and it also quickly climbed the charts. It's lyrics are fun and it has also been well shot like Shehar Ki Ladki. Sundara Sundara was the second biggest hit in the film it is a decent song. The sensuous song Uee Yaa is forgettable. However Zaalim Jahan Berang Hai has superior lyrics. It manages to successfully show Sunil's transformation from a weakened person to a brawny individual. The song contains some training montages which are a delight to watch.Sunil Shetty shines in the action sequences but is far from outstanding in other aspects of acting. In the 1990s he was never great at emoting. However he was surprisingly better at emoting in some of his previous films like Takkar. In Rakshak he overacts terribly in some important scenes. For example when he has to weep inconsolably for the demise of his loved ones he hams it up. In addition when he has to shout at the villains he hams it up. In some of his other flicks he would not overdo such scenes. In short he was much better in films like Mohra Takkar and Gopi Kishan. Karishma Kapoor is hilarious in some scenes but it was depressing to watch her innocent character meet such a tragic demise. She looks ravishing and does her role with ease. Sonali Bendre has a shorter role but she is excellent here. Instead of simply being a bimbette she gets a role and she is convincing as the lady doctor. Aruna Irani is successfully convincing as Sunil's mother in the film. Raghuvaran appears menacing but he overdoes his villainy. Mushtaq Khan is good in a few hilarious sequences during the first half of the film. He is also decent as the caring friend of Sunil after Sunil's family is wiped out. Alok Nath is convincing as the police commissioner who encourages Sunil to join the police force. Deepak Shirke is alright as the corrupt cop. The rest provide decent support.On the whole Rakshak is engrossing but it could have been better. It's action and music stand out the most. However Sunil's underperformance and some inconsistencies largely affect the film. Despite this Rakshak is still worth a watch because it keeps you hooked mostly.".

	schema:headline " A full on Masala Entertainer";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie was released on November 29 1996 and had a mixed response . The critics rubbished it as another Sunil Shetty Movie while the common public who flocked the single screens loved it. Each movie has a genre. Rakshak is neither a proper action movie nor is it a family entertainer . It is somewhere offset in the Masala genre where you can find the current day Bhojpuri movies . If you look at it that way  you will definitely be entertained . The lead actor Sunil Shetty has done some amazing action scenes showing off the 'Shetty Swagger '. He looks at ease through most of the movie barring the emotional scenes. The movie revolves around him and he carries it off very nicely . His overacting in few scenes can be certainly overlooked as he improved it by leaps and bounds in the coming years .Karisma Kapoor became gorgeous in Raja Hindustani  which released a fortnight earlier  and it clearly reflects in her screen presence. She plays the role of Sunil Shetty's friend and wife in this movie. She looks very beautiful and charming in the movie . Her dancing skills in 'Kuchi Kuchi' and 'Sundara Sundara ' show us that a diva has arrived. However her end was brutal and should have been pictured subtly .Aruna Irani Mushtaq Khan and Raghuvaran do their job effectively. Especially Raghuvaran's fall to dark side is so 'Vader' . His remorseless acts make you hate him and that's the mark of a great villain . Raveena and Sonali are like garnish on the movie and make it look good .The movie has lot of gory scenes with full violence. There are some sexually implicit scenes with Karisma and Sunil with a song dedicated to Bedroom Romance. Don't show the movie to your kids unless they are 13 . Seriously .".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie was released on November 29 1996 and had a mixed response . The critics rubbished it as another Sunil Shetty Movie while the common public who flocked the single screens loved it. Each movie has a genre. Rakshak is neither a proper action movie nor is it a family entertainer . It is somewhere offset in the Masala genre where you can find the current day Bhojpuri movies . If you look at it that way  you will definitely be entertained . The lead actor Sunil Shetty has done some amazing action scenes showing off the 'Shetty Swagger '. He looks at ease through most of the movie barring the emotional scenes. The movie revolves around him and he carries it off very nicely . His overacting in few scenes can be certainly overlooked as he improved it by leaps and bounds in the coming years .Karisma Kapoor became gorgeous in Raja Hindustani  which released a fortnight earlier  and it clearly reflects in her screen presence. She plays the role of Sunil Shetty's friend and wife in this movie. She looks very beautiful and charming in the movie . Her dancing skills in 'Kuchi Kuchi' and 'Sundara Sundara ' show us that a diva has arrived. However her end was brutal and should have been pictured subtly .Aruna Irani Mushtaq Khan and Raghuvaran do their job effectively. Especially Raghuvaran's fall to dark side is so 'Vader' . His remorseless acts make you hate him and that's the mark of a great villain .

	schema:reviewBody "After finally seeing this film almost 20 years later it's release date I must say it most definitely did not disappoint! The negative reviews written here do not do the film justice.As a serious Sunil Shetty fan Rakshak is on par with some of his previous hard hitting action films the likes of Krishna Mohra Takkar  Vinashak. A great cast with a decent plot  excellent action sequences especially at it's climax.Although Raveena Tandon only appears in the smash hit song 'Shahar Ki Ladki'  is not cast in the film enjoyed seeing 3 Bollywood beauties in one film especially Sonali Bendre who plays a doctor something other than her usual roles of a romantic interest. Karishma Kapoor  Aruna Irani Alok Nath  Mushtaq Khan are familiar faces which alongside Sunil Shetty's gives the film a good variety in terms of casting. My first film seeing actor 'Raghuvaran'. Quite refreshing seeing an honest man turned villain being played by an actor other than Gulshan Grover  Amrish Puri. There are many gruesome criminal acts shown in the film which were difficult to watch. A mature audience is recommended. Superb soundtrack by AnandMilind. All hit songs 'Shahar Ki Ladki' 'Kuchi Kuchi'  'Sundara Sundara' were well shot  choreographed in the film which continues to remain iconically memorable till today.My first film under the 'Ashok Honda' banner other than the editing done in one of my favorite films of 1994 'Amaanat'. Decent direction that could have been better in some parts but not too bad as I have seen worst.My only complaint is the poor quality of the DVD releases of this film which needs to be remastered with better video quality  proper English Subtitles.".

It may not matter that his South African accent is faulty at best fades in and out that he seems too distant and affected to be any kind of literature teacher let alone one currently teaching Wordsworth a devotee of Byron. The same thing happened with his performance as Valmont in Frears' Dangerous Liaisons. His Midwestern drawl grated he lacked suavity lacked charm. None of it mattered because he had such evil such confidence such panache such an edge he held the screen and transformed himself into a new compelling kind of 18thcentury French Iago of love. Besides here as his daughter Lucy the South African newcomer Jessica Haines is equally important and very good less flawed by casting incongruities than Malkovich. And as Coetzee's comment has acknowledged the most important thing to the adaptation is how the film can convey the beauty of the South African landscape better than his book did.What's most disturbing to people about the novel is this it conveys ideas through the protagonist David Lurie Malkovich's role about how South Africa has been trashed how the blacks hate the whites how the country is a place of anarchy and violence that are clearly Coetzee's own views. How dare he do that and make no bones about it? But since he's ruthlessly honest how dare he not? The novel was the first I read by Coetzee and didn't make me run out to read more. But the book became the first time a writer won a Booker Prize twice and four years later Coetzee was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Maybe he was doing something right.And so were the Australian Steve Jacobs who directed this adaptation of the book and his Moroccanborn wife Anna Maria Monticelli who wrote the screenplay and produced it. Outsiders that they are they have nonetheless produced an adaptation that makes a complex book clearer without mangling or oversimplifying it. This kind of international production may grate upon the spirits of South Africans but they wouldn't be likely to enjoy an alllocal production either. All one can say is that this is a book that works well as a film and that adapts successfully without a lot of changes.David Lurie has had several wives but he wasn't made for marriage. A womanizer a sensualist at 52 he's losing his physical attraction he's looking old. Even his Malay prostitute lets him go. He forces himself upon Melanie Isaacs Antoinette Engel a mixedrace student in his romantic poetry class. When they have sex she turns away as if repelled but she submits. He's found out and threatened by Melanie's boyfriend yelled at by her father boycotted by the students and at an administrative hearing he's so unrepentent he ends by being forced to leave the college. He goes to the Eastern Cape where his lesbian daughter Lucy has recently been abandoned by her lover. She grows flowers and vegetables she sells in the local market and she arranges for David to help Bev Fiona Press a middleaged lady whose animal shelter work consists primarily of euthanizing unwanted dogs. In and out of the property he now shares with Lucy is Petrus Eriq Ebouaney an almost mythically neutral philosophical black man who owns land there and is gradually taking over but who also made Lucy's garden land arable.Then enters the outside horror. Three young black men appear when Lucy and David are returning from a walk and ask to use her phone. They invade the house rape Lucy nearly kill David and shoot all Lucy's dogs wrecking the interior of the house and stealing David's car. One pours a bottle of methyl spirits over David and sets fire to him locking him in the bathroom.This sequence is more powerful than the book. After his arrogance to see Malkovich cowering beside a toilet bowl with his face burned is unforgettable. Eventually he returns to Cape Town and cowers before Melanie's family asking forgiveness. It's not quite believed but it's as much of a transformation as such a man is capable of. But it's Lucy's response that's more important she refuses to report the crime and refuses to leave. She cooperates with Petrus who defends the youngest perpetrator. He turns out to be family the son of his new wife's sister. He says it's over. Reconciliation. In fact the attack may not have been so random.David says it'll never be over and will be passed on to those who come long after them. This may be an endgame. But they were born here and they remain. The important thing is that Lucy stays and so does David after returning to Cape Town to apologize  and be serviced by a prostitute. The film like the book but perhaps in clearer outline is about humiliation suffering enduring. It's about sexuality and about living with other beings other animals. Viewers who don't find Disgrace real astonish me though people and events are symbolic as well as specific always richly both and always simple and complex. David sleeps with Bev to please her because she's lonely and she wants it. Of course it's the sort of good deed that pleases him but there is humility in it as is his help however unenthusiastic with the animals. Malkovich's arrogance becomes complex because the most vivid images in the film are the ones of him cowering and afraid. In order to maintain his Byronic arrogance as a genteel rapist of coloured young women he has given up his pride and his status. Disgrace is a film for smart people. It's as tightly coiled and thoughtprovoking as the book and nearly as good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Steve Jacobs who has considerable experience as an actor has directed only one previous film the rather episodic La Spagnola but here he has managed to do justice to a very fine literary work by J M Coetzee. The fairly short book 220 pages fits neatly into the 2 hours of screen time and writer Anna Maria Montecelli has followed the book fairly closely  little is left out. The last two scenes in the book are reversed in the film which makes the ending a little less bleak but otherwise it is a fairly faithful adaptationperhaps too faithful as others have said but I'm not sure what other approach could have been taken. Coetzee's themes come through loud and clear. Although the production team is Australian filming was mainly on location on a shoestring 6 million in South Africa.The story of a professor's illjudged affair with a student and his fall from grace is a pretty common one a recent example being Philip Roth's novel Elegy filmed with Ben Kingsley as the professor. For some reason these errant academics always seem to be in the field of literature  surely professors of botany and physics have similar tendencies. Exposure brings about a variety of reactions. The parents and other students are apoplectic but the panel of fellow academics inquiring into Professor Lurie's affair is all set to thrash him with a feather as long as he apologises in public. However Lurie is tired of teaching and just wants to confess and leave perhaps to continue his work on Lord Byron a suitable literary hero for a fornicator. He goes off to visit his daughter Lucy on her smallholding in the Eastern Cape countryside but this turns out to be less than idyllic. In the new South Africa power has moved into the hands of the black majority and white people are there on sufferance only as Lucy has realised. Exprofessor Lurie becomes involved with an animal refuge and its operator a blowsy middle aged woman whom he would not have given a second look in his previous life. Yet somehow he comes to accept his humiliation.John Malkovich's performance as Lurie is what you would expect  an arrogant hissing snake of a man. I couldn't help wondering how differently Ben Kingsley would have done it. Malkovich is a very mannered actor at his best on the stage and his Lurie is well a bit lurid. Nevertheless he holds our attention if he does not capture our sympathy. Jessica Haines as his daughter Lucy does  a wonderfully judged and utterly realistic piece of acting.What the film does give us which the book cannot is the magnificence of the setting and the film makers have done very well in this regard though they have used locations in the Western Cape rather than the East. I was struck by the similarities with parts of Australia and wondered what it would be like living as a member of a white minority. As Coetzee and the film makers attest it is not a comfortable position to be in.".

	schema:reviewBody "All of us have to suffer the indignities of life even our ultimate fate of death. What we can do is choose how we deal with the cards we are dealt. This movie examines people's reactions to injustices and to life itself.David is an English Lit professor who has long since accepted his sexual desires as being part of his nature being comfortable to make use of prostitutes accepting that he was not made for marriage. On a whim he strikes up a sexual relationship with one of his students. For this indiscretion and for falsifying some records for her benefit he is faced with disciplinary action from his Goliath  the university board.Knowing that there is nothing much he can do he completely submits to their charges accepting guilt without bothering to even examine the charges no matter the consequences leaving prudence to the wind. In this he is quite defiant and dignified. An admirable reaction.Ironically Melanie the object of his desires a limp participant who seems to just let things happen to her suffers no long term effects and ends up as a successful actress.Her father's reaction is one of refined indignation. He and David's dignified interaction and David's ultimate plea for forgiveness lends some honor to the story. Prostrating himself before Melanie's mother was excessive but admirable.David's relationship with and support of his daughter Lucy also makes for an interesting story. Lucy quietly yet forcefully accepts her fate. Both the departure of her lesbian lover and the rape at the hands of 3 young men she takes ownership of quietly accepting yet drawing boundaries where she can making pragmatic choices. Often disheveled and fragile she makes for riveting viewing and empathy. Like the flowergrowerseller she is she brings a fragile and ephemeral beauty to the world. Interesting line after her rape she finds David partially burned and the first thing she says is What on Earth have they done to you?! David's support of her choices even ones that bring him to tears is heartwarming.David's relationship with Rosalind shows him capable of deeper gentle love more than the superficial sex he has with others.Rosalind herself is the caring executioner. By watching her we have to face our own ultimate fate. Will we also die like dogs and will we be disposed of with the same care she gives her charges? Manas the man who shares Lucy's life in an unusually superficial pragmatic fashion is a study in doing the right thing for the sake of the community. He is the builder building physical shelters for his wife and metaphorical shelter for Lucy. Doggedly insisting that things must move on that everything will be all right that the time will come.This movie asks you how do you handle the injustices of life? Uncaring like Melanie gently like Rosalind with pragmatical simplicity like Manas with desperate acceptance like Lucy with defiant dignity like David? There is a lot more you can find in this movie. It is worth seeing more than once.The title is an enigma. Where is the Disgrace? In life itself? In our inability to shape our futures with much effect?".

	schema:reviewBody "John Malkovich portrays an esteemed Capetown professor who lives somewhat in his own ivory tower has an affair with a young student and finds his idyllic life in academia and egogratification shattered.He decides somewhat on a whim to visit his daughter Lucy who runs a farm on the South African coast. She cares for several dogs and has a native worker who helps her on the farm. It is a small cohesive village and she is on the outside looking in a veritable intruder in more ways than one.The story develops and foreshadows the violence which is beset upon Lucy and her father by a local disturbed boy who rapes her along with a gang of two other young men. Her father sustains burns but does not see what actually happens to Lucy in the other room although the audience can infer she is being raped repeatedly. Malkovich at first approaches her gingerly thinking she is damaged and distraught needing to move away from the farm and her assailants. However the opposite proves to be true. In a rather dismal scene Lucy tells her father she must remain that rapes like this have occurred before and she is owing this to the people of the land that she must remain to take on a sort of punishment.There are psychological nuances here. People inducing sadomasochism or enduring it for their real or presumed character flaws. It makes for a compelling story and I'd imagine the novel by J.M. Coetzee is a great read. The film at times does not translate this subtlety and we are left feeling annoyed with Lucy and her victimized state.Malkovich is good here as usual with an affected but acceptable accent a restrained but marked need for sexuality in his later years. He has an affair with a local veterinarian where he brings some of Lucy's unfortunate dogs to be etherized. The scene where Malkovich plays music for a dog the dog responds to him wanting his love and he brings it to the vet to be destroyed is sad and stark. Put it out of its misery he tells her...and we almost imagine he is speaking of his own life instead of the dogs.Overall a worthy film although the book is probably much clearer in intent and I am now intrigued to read the authors works regarding animals and the fragility of life. Recommended. 810. Addendum Have finished the novel and it is a must read".

Put it out of its misery he tells her...and we almost imagine he is speaking of his own life instead of the dogs.Overall a worthy film although the book is probably much clearer in intent and I am now intrigued to read the authors works regarding animals and the fragility of life. Recommended. 810. Addendum Have finished the novel and it is a must read";

Perhaps if the movie can be faulted it is because the film adaptation is too faithful. We can clearly hear the author's voice in the movie but not the director's. It just does not resonate as it should have done considering the source material. This by no means to say Disgrace is not a good film in fact it is a very good film finely acted especially by Malkovich and well directed. But it is not a great film and one feels that if Steve Jacobs the director had perhaps not remained so faithful to the novel the film would have risen from the level of a very competent and faithful adaptation to a great and perhaps even a classic film.".

The director was impressively helped by his cast and in the first place by John Malkovich whose physical! and mental interpretation of the very uninviting character of a sexually driven university professor is certainly one of his most memorable.

In other words he has finally realized how disgraceful his past conduct used to be.So it is an allegory of the nation of South Africa itself father is the old ApartheidSouth Africa abusing humiliating and taking advantage of black people daughter is the whites in the 'new' South Africa with blacks in power abusing humiliating and taking advantage of the cowered whites in their turn. Just as the old whites robbed the blacks of their land made them beg for their mercy the daughter is now being robbed of her land by Petrus and depends on him to keep the black boys away from her. Now the table has turned. Just as Lucy has voluntarily become Petrus' tenant on her own land South African whites by handing the power over to the blacks become blacks' tenants in their own land. Simbolically across Lucy's house Petrus has built a brand new house as if telling Lucy that this land is now my land.The thing is the movie is improbable and rather farfetched in one crucial aspect why the victims are going to so many lengths to submit to the abusers in both father's and daughter's cases to such extreme degree. Did the college girl not have the option of reporting the professor's conduct to the disciplinary board? Did she not have the free will to refuse the invitations and wining and dining? Did the professor force himself upon her? Now let's turn to the daughter She knows that Petrus had masterminded the robbing and rape in order to drive her out of the farm Yet she still makes a deal with him on such humiliating terms for his protection The victim of rape is seeking protection from further rape by making a humiliating deal with the rapist. Is she an incurable masochist? Or is there some compelling reason that she will not or cannot leave the farm? The movie never tells. Perhaps the movie is attempting to allegorize and translate into personal dimension the change that has happened in the relationship between the whites and blacks in South Africa in general. But the story as told in the format of movie simply fails to convey the subtle nuances in the novel and would only look improbable and farfetched to whoever sees the movie without first reading the novel.".

It's based on the Booker Prizewinning novel by J M Coetzee and ably directed by Steve Jacobs of which this is his second only feature.After the suicide of the young female mixedrace student who had had a sexual relationship with white university lecturer David Lurie Malkovich the English professor is sacked. Finding he has no option he goes to live with his lesbian daughter on a remote farm in the bush. Both willing to fit in and help to protect his own interests Lurie tries to accept both his fate and the setup he has to tolerate while the ever presence of black oddjob worker Petrus Eriq Ebouaney both irritates and underscores the whole blackwhite power struggle that resonates throughout the film.Just as the film settles some very nasty things happen and these are frankly unpleasant and difficult to sit through with no restraints on graphic details. He's set on fire pet dogs slaughtered and a rape. All done by black youths seemingly on a whim.Get past these though and the you will be rewarded not in a film of great triumph and people changed and redeemed riding off into the sunset but a slow realisation that life is just that and one has to admit personal shortfalls and to live with that. Disgrace is a fairly memorable film maybe some of the parts more than the whole but isn't one I particularly wish to see again so the DVD won't be on my Christmas wishlist. For those who like and appreciate a challenging well acted and modern human drama it has a lot going for it.".

All done by black youths seemingly on a whim.Get past these though and the you will be rewarded not in a film of great triumph and people changed and redeemed riding off into the sunset but a slow realisation that life is just that and one has to admit personal shortfalls and to live with that. Disgrace is a fairly memorable film maybe some of the parts more than the whole but isn't one I particularly wish to see again so the DVD won't be on my Christmas wishlist. For those who like and appreciate a challenging well acted and modern human drama it has a lot going for it.";

	schema:reviewBody "John Malkovich. He's one of those actors you can hate one day and love the next. In Luc Besson's Joan of Arc Malkovich was terrific as the spoiled underhanded Dauphin but in Ripley's Game I found him just annoying.At first I thought that his mannerisms would do the same to me in this film just annoy the hell out of me. How could a person this unattractive be a serial womanizer? But then you realize how perfect he is for the role. Driven by desire limited in his accomplishments he can't keep a wife his regular prostitute rejects him when he starts to get too close and his student submits to his advances only passively. Although why she does that doesn't get explained in either the book or the movie. For good marks perhaps? No I think that would conflict with her other statements regarding the professor's course and her attendance at it. J.M.Coetzee doesn't appeal to me much either. The acclaimed Elizabeth Costello was plotless characterless and its monologues were of only limited interest. Disgrace was a much better book I think wellplotted well thought out and with welldrawn characters. In fact I thought it was better than the film. It's a while since I read the book but I seem to recall the professor's affair consuming perhaps the first third of the book his arrival at the Cape and immersion into his daughter's life perhaps another third then comes the attack and its consequences. The movie seems to skip as quickly as possible to the attack then follows a somewhat boring set of postattack psychological musings with very little activity of any interest. Lucy spends a lot of time lying down and staring off into space while David does some wandering about some work at the clinic passes the odd cryptic remark to Petrus and makes some very sexless love to Bev.The book and the film make some cogent and brave comments upon the state of South Africa and the film to be fair tries to convey those points. But where the book could get away with being bland and boring in parts the movie needed to excise those bits and keep its momentum. I think that it failed in that regard.".

	schema:reviewBody "JM Coetzee's writing isn't to everyone's taste. Some of it might seem pointlessly dense and selfindulgent. But Disgrace is a widelyhailed masterpiece and in this reviewer's opinion rightly so. The problem in adapting it for the screen is that it's largely an allegory of postapartheid South Africa and of white responses to it. It presents two very different such responses represented by the two main characters. On the one hand there's David a professor who is caught having an affair with a mixedrace student confesses everything without even being asked and willingly accepts his punishment and the end of his career. On the other there's his daughter Lucy who is gangraped by a group of black men but who refuses to do anything about it other than bear the child which she conceives and indeed marry a relative of the rapist. Of course this is not how we'd expect real people or indeed convincing film characters to behave. But in the novel at least that isn't the point. David represents a point of view which sees formal justice as everything. Guilty people himself included should accept their punishment and move on. By extension the abolition of formal apartheid is all that is needed to remove any sense of racebased disadvantage or special pleading. Whites have given up power and nonwhites on this view need to accept that and expect no more than formal equal treatment. Lucy on the other hand represents the exact opposite position. Formal justice has no meaning  there is no such thing as crime and victims herself included take no comfort from the punishment of criminals. Again the analogy is that abolishing the formal features of apartheid solves nothing  racial injustice and its consequences will always remain. Accordingly whites need to accept that and the desire for revenge that comes with.Neither character is attractive in the novel and neither point of view is optimistic. I suspect that's exactly what Coetzee intended challenging the reader to come up with some alternative between two bleak and diametricallyopposed alternatives. The trouble is that allegory doesn't work well on screen. In the film  indeed in any film  there's less left to your imagination than in a novel. Many who've seen the film but not read the book are seemingly left bemused about why a rape victim passively accepts her situation or why a tenured professor doesn't try to save his career. The symbolism and allegory of a novel particularly a complex and challenging novel like Disgrace just doesn't register. The film's strict adherence to the book including much dialogue which is used verbatim doesn't help this. In other words both the main characters are caricatures intended to represent opposing wider beliefs or viewpoints. That's fine in a novel but when a filmmaker gives them an immediacy  faces voices and surroundings  it becomes harder to see them as anything other than 'real'. What was meant to be absurd but illuminating risks becoming simply unbelievable. Nonetheless it has its moments. Both leads do well to give their characters at least some credibility especially Jessica Haines as the selfwilled but ultimately passive Lucy. The affair between John Malkovich and his student is given a strongly and appropriately sordid flavour. Eriq Ebouaney brings just the right balance of awkward bonhomie and hidden menace to Petrus. And the attack on the farm has a power which no novel can capture. Overall a decent effort at filming what is probably and ultimately unfilmable. Read the book first and you might like it more.".

I saw two important themes the main character Lurie's dispassionate selfabsorbed and arrogant existence and an eventual partial thawamid the chaos and turmoil as South Africa reverts to a lawless culture as the structure accorded by apartheid unravels. The core of the plot is not Lurie but he and his daughter's relationship with their world around them as they lose their favored white status and grow fearful of raciallymotivated violence. Malkovich shines as his character's aloof persona moves about unhurriedly and only the most disturbing event imaginable gets him riled to the point of some level of action. I believe the greatest disgrace among several is Petrus' reaction to the rape and violence perpetrated upon his white neighbors. His matteroffact behavior deceit and rationalization is absolutely astounding. The inference I drew is that as whites they had it coming to them. Also a disgrace is the decision by Lucy to remain even though she knows she was a target for the jackroll and may be again. It's clear that as a white woman she is a favored target. That Lucy and David lower their guards to perhaps prevent the assaults is almost beyond belief and shows the naivet and vulnerability of these whites who fall from power. The movie reveals the deep racism and hatred in South Africa.".

Lurie a man that enjoys sex is seen at the beginning of this story in bed with a black prostitute. David who is divorced has a keen eye for beauty. He has his eyes set on Melanie one of his students. When the opportunity he forces himself on the young woman who clearly is turned off by the mere fact of which she was forced by this hateful individual.Because of an inquiry at the university David is asked to resign. The next thing we see him do is packing his belongings and taking a trip to see his daughter Lucy a lesbian living on a farm where she is trying to make a living selling vegetables and flowers. Lucy has a man Petrus helping in the farm. She allowed him to live with his wife in what used to be a barn. David is both proud and horrified by the way her daughter lives. One day three intruders arrive in the farm asking permission to use the telephone. These three men turn out to be bandits that come with the intention of stealing whatever they can from Lucy. Two of them attack David with such violence and hate that it is a miracle he survives when one of them sprays him with a flammable liquid throwing a match at him. The intention is clearly to do bodily harm to this man that probably represented in the thugs' eyes a despised era of not too long ago. The result is traumatic for both David and Lucy. This incident will alter their lives forever.The magnificent J.M. Coetzee novel comes to the screen thanks to the excellent adaptation by Anna Maria Monticelli that translates the essence of the book into cinematic terms. The direction by Steve Jacobs shows an understanding for the original material. The faithful adaptation is perhaps one of the best assets in our enjoyment of the movie. These are basically people that have been deeply wounded trying to adapt to new circumstances something that parallels the situation in the country that had been ruled with an iron fist by a minority.John Malkovich outdoes himself in his portrayal of this man who suddenly realizes he is living in a strange land he knows nothing about. It is one of the best appearances the actor has done recently. Same could be said about Jessica Haines work. This young actress deserves to be seen more often she can hold herself against a man of the caliber of Mr. Malkovich with ease and charm. The mostly South African supporting players are good under Mr. Jacobs' direction. Disgrace is worth a look by discerning fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't read the awardwinning book on which it is based but Steve Jacob's film 'Disgrace' is a thoughtful and intelligent story about wrongdoing and reconciliation that quite explicitly functions as a microcosm of postApartheid South Africa and its relationship with its own past. In it John Malkovich's disgraced womanising and cynical exUniversity professor comes to understand the value of offering contrition when reparation is not obviously a feasible outcome after his daughter is attacked and there is nothing corresponding to justice available for her. Indeed she lives in the remote highlands where the very basis of power which is ultimately needed to support justice is undergoing a practical though ugly renegotiation and the attack itself is seen by her though not by her father in this context. The fact that both the professor and his daughter are in their own ways prickly and proud characters makes the story more interesting and the temptation for melodrama is resisted at every turn indeed while the most obviously dramatic scenes are being played out the bigger event is occurring offcamera. It takes a lot of discipline to make a film this way but there's a pay off  it feels real throughout and makes you think by avoiding all the easy clichs.".

	schema:headline " Epitaph To A Dog.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a rather laminous story of a selfindulgent professor in South Africa who learns that there's more to life than the hedonic treadmill. At least I think that's what it's about.Malkovich teaches poetry and finds nothing wrong with Lucifer's dark heart. It's even admirable in a way. He has a bit of it himself. He seduces a beautiful young student Antoinette Engel who is clearly uncomfortable with his fevered pursuit and with his love making. She stops coming to class and he fakes a passing grade on her mid term exam. Her father learns about the affair and Malkovich is asked to resign. He freely admits his guilt but shows no remorse. Better murder an infant in its cradle than nurse an unacted desire he quotes from William Blake who was quite a nut himself.At leisure he leaves the city and moves in with his daughter Jessica Haines who has a rambling cottage in the remote countryside. Haines makes a living growing flowers and selling them at the market. She shares the land with an older African man Ebouaney who lives down the road. She also takes care of the stray dogs who overflow the local shelter.While Ebouaney is gone off to seek a wife Malkovich and Haines are viciously attacked by a trio of young black kids. The kids gang bang Haines set fire to Malkovich steal everything of value including the car and shoot all the dogs in their cages  laughing all the while. It's a brutal scene but the barbarity is no more explicit than it needs to be.So far so good. Quite good in fact. But after this I began to wonder where the screenplay was headed.Haines is unwilling to call the police in on the matter because one of the youthful miscreants may be a relative of Ebouaney's wife. She doesn't change her mind even when it develops that she's pregnant and even after Malkovich has begged her.Haines decides to settle the matter by becoming Ebouaney's wife which will be a strictly socioeconomic arrangement. Ebouaney gets the land but Haines will keep her house.This Ebouaney is a key figure and he's inscrutable. It's said that he made Haines' flower garden possible but he's an allaround queer fellow. It's a finely measured performance. Malkovich is snoozing on the couch in the cottage and Ebouaney simply walks in without knocking seats himself next to Malkovich and turns the TV on to a loud soccer game.When Ebouaney returns following the attack he doesn't visit the Haines cottage but busies himself with building an irrigation system on his land. Malkovich strolls over and asks if Ebouaney has heard of the attack. Yes. Very bad he replies phlegmatically but you're all right now. Well Malkovich is hardly all right. His head and face have been burned and he's swathed in bandages. I'm all right if you mean I'm still alive. Ebouaney is still smiling but turns back to his work without an answer.But as time passes Malkovich thinks things over. And he who has thought of no one but himself decides to apologize ritually to the family of the student he seduced. They don't exactly forgive him profusely. Mostly they stare at him in silence as he cow tows to the family and walks out the door.Back at the cottage Haines has decided to have the child and marry Ebouaney which will provide her with protection from further attacks. Malkovich is aghast but again on thinking things over he returns to her and she leads him into the house preceded by her big belly for a cup of tea. He follows with a resigned smile.The end.I kept trying to figure out what the messages were supposed to be. I mean unless the plot is aiming at something then it's simply pointless isn't it? One unrelated events following another unrelated event? Could it be that Malkovich is finally able to recognize the immoral quality of his dark heart that there is a parallel between his seduction of the innocent student and the gang bang of his daughter? That's not only banal but it's a big stretch to equate the student affair with the pillaging of a peaceful cottage a violent multiple rape and the attempted murder of Malkovich by setting him afire. Morally what the three vandals did to Haines is the same as what Malkovich did to the reluctant student? Huh?Yet that seems to be it. There's more to life than self indulgence Alfie. Some desires are best left unacted. And the ending suggested some sort of redemption  not that Malkovich didn't need some  but the meeting between Haines and Malkovich his friendly smile that cup of tea left me more puzzled than satisfied. Malkovich parked his car a mile away and walked down to the house for this climactic meeting with Haines. Why? I mean why didn't he drive down to the house? Some applause is due to the writers for not bringing up racial or political conflicts. Race isn't mentioned once and the few references to political problems are oblique. The two chief conflicts are between cultures and between individual values. Unless and this is almost too horrible to think this is meant as a story of justifiable payback against whites for so many years of Apartheid. In any case the photography could hardly be improved upon. This part of South Africa looks a little like the American Southwest a kind of scenic semidesert.".

And here comes the apparent incoherence because the film is a parade of these images a product of the same technological violence it is reflecting and criticizing. That's not hypocrisy the contradiction is part of the film itself.Although I do not completely support Reggio's point of view I admire the way he expresses it through his films without impositions of any kind so that the viewer can find his own perspective. While watching Naqoyqatsi I was asking for the original pictures that were below those distortions and filters but soon I realized the real world wasn't there. It was like OK so that's all... Well let's see it.A few words about the inevitable comparison with it's predecessors if you are looking for something like Koyaanisqatsi go see Koyaanisqatsi again. Naqoyqatsi is a different film.

They just don't have the beauty of a 'real' image.To add insult to injury the film has been stretched out from a 43 aspect ratio to 169 so all of the people appear distorted. This is because the stock footage used was 43 and they couldn't be bothered editing it to fit into a widescreen presentation. They just stretched the lot and when you watch the DVD it is very noticeable.

	schema:headline " a cinematic tone poem";
	schema:reviewBody "In the hustle and bustle of a chaotic world we often don't take the time to stop and really look at all the beautiful things that tend to pass us by unnoticed.  It is Godfrey Reggio's aim in Naqoyqatsi'  as it was in his previous Koyaanisqatsi' and Powaqqatsi'  to focus our attention on all the artistry inherent in the shapes forms and patterns that make up our universe.  His film is a succession of images some of them derived from nature clouds ocean waves others from Man buildings and bridges and others from computergenerated fantasy.  These he filters through his observant camera eye stateoftheart processing and ingenious editing to create a cinematic tone poem.  The element that most separates Naqoyqatsi' from Reggio's earlier works is the much heavier reliance on camera trickery and CGI effects here.  For the most part Reggio has moved away from nature as his subject and towards the cyber realities of the current age.  Thus the altered emphasis in form seems not merely appropriate but thematically valid as well as Reggio examines a world in which nature has been largely eclipsed by computer technology.At the end of the film we are told that Naqoyqatsi' is a Hopi word meaning essentially war' and violence.'  I'm not sure though that Reggio has really earned that title with his film.  True he does include a few shots of mushroom clouds of street riots of violent video games but they hardly account for the majority of the images we see.   Perhaps it is the clash between nature and technology that he is referring to here but the title  at least as defined at the end  still seems to fall a bit short of the mark.Still Reggio is often able to find poetry in even the most disturbing of images.  For instance there's an amazing shot of a trio of crash test dummies performing a macabre yet strangely beautiful slow motion dance' in a simulated airplane crash.  It is but one of the many unforgettable images in the film.Enhanced by the haunting music of Philip Glass Naqoyqatsi' offers a dazzling kaleidoscopic view of the world a visual tour de force for the aesthetically inclined.".

It is Godfrey Reggio's aim in Naqoyqatsi'  as it was in his previous Koyaanisqatsi' and Powaqqatsi'  to focus our attention on all the artistry inherent in the shapes forms and patterns that make up our universe.  His film is a succession of images some of them derived from nature clouds ocean waves others from Man buildings and bridges and others from computergenerated fantasy.  These he filters through his observant camera eye stateoftheart processing and ingenious editing to create a cinematic tone poem.  The element that most separates Naqoyqatsi' from Reggio's earlier works is the much heavier reliance on camera trickery and CGI effects here.

Maybe my expectations were too high but I felt let down.The score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two  not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. It was good enough though that I'll still probably check out the soundtrack.But just keep this in mind if you see this film if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it go ahead and split  you won't miss a thing because it won't get any better.I'll even give the executive summary here warning! spoilers! lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a Nike commercial shots of smiling people inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax dummies WTF were they thinking here?!? some giggling babies cuuuuute some bitchin' Photoshop effects some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water information money and people I think... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence... and then a bunch of stock space footage.I could remake this movie in 10 seconds. Here's my pitch2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string 5 seconds of that scene in Network where the guy talks about messing with the elemental forces of nature and how money flows in money flows out 1 second of Reginald Denny getting brained with a brick and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean bouncing around on the moon. There you go  that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life I just saved. Of course I'd get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is. If Steven Soderbergh's reading this hey I won't even need much money for this project...If you insist upon watching a movie about Life as War I suggest Bowling for Columbine instead. It may not have the pseudointellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd but at least it's funny.".

Rarely has a film so spectacularly failed to live up to its predecessors and lost its way. Although it tries to represent civilised warfare in the form of sport science trade and other forms of competition it lacks the global scope and even the coherently developed themes of its predecessors. War is chaos but even wars have an aim in mind and this film had little structure and unclear goals.Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that does little to develop its theme. On the plus side it wisely avoided using some of the iconic images of last century's wars.Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that several times I had to remind myself that I was not watching an advertisement promoting the American way of life. Perhaps this insularity reflects the ongoing War on Terror. When representing sport as war the prominent team logos ensured that the USA was depicted as the winner. Hence it missed the opportunity to depict some of the many sports around the world and showing that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilised warfare.Apart from newsreel the footage seemed to have been shot on a budget in the confines of New York and there was little recognition of life as war in the rest of the world. The gallery of faces waxworks gave only a nod to the existence of important personages outside of the USA. The makers missed the point that globalisation does not mean Americanisation.The Philip Glass soundtrack sounded much like every other Philip Glass score I've heard with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi and at best can be described as inoffensive neither adding to nor detracting from the chaotic imagery.".

The task now at hand is not to document the continuation of these negative historical trends but to show those of us interested how we can begin to live our lives differently to alter the course of history.After walking out of the movie I felt I had just left an extended 90 minute MTV Yo Yo Ma music video.  And not a good MTV video but one of those Ican'tconcentrateformorethan2seconds music videos.  Disjointed depressing confusing and incoherent are the words I would use to best describe this movie.  Skip it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Naqoyqatsi is an experience different of what many viewers might seen it in the past 20 years. Remember the 30 last minutes of 2001 A Space Odyssey when there was only visual effects images and the frightening music in the background and no words no quotes were heard? Now imagine almost 90 minutes of only that the only exercise you have to do is sit watch and think about why those images appeared and their meaning. This is Naqoyqatsi. In this documentary director Godfrey Reggio music composer Philip Glass from The Hours and animated director Jon Kane created a enormous montage about many aspects of life on Earth. But his approach is to show how our society become violent and that progress is a important part of that cause. The first image that appears is the Babel Tower and after that technology appears in its several forms in buildings computers science medicine our human body capable of doing miraculous things the relation between the man and the sports and the decadence of the mankind in violent acts. All this achievement was possible because of technology.One important thing showed here is the difference between what humans can do and what technology can imitate too. For instance the adoration that we have with famous people. In a take celebrities generated by computer walks by and the people are crazy about them waving to them taking photos. In the next scene we seen real artists walking in the red carpet Marlon Brando Julia LouisDreyfus and Elton John and we seen the difference between them and the digital celebrities. It might seem the same thing but it's not. We are really interested in the real people and not in some CGI creation.Here comes the difficult part of this film the discussion and what do we learn with Naqoyqatsi. There's criticism and there isn't it seems plausible in one moment and totally useless and pointless in the other. In the whole film there's no critic but after the credits roll in the end and the meaning of the word Naqoyqatsi is shown there's a critic there's the point of view of the director and by that I mean that it might be too late for people get the idea of what this movie is about. Naqoyqatsi is a word of a tribe that means societies that lives by killing each other people living of war. This is a statement towards our society that gave 10 steps forward and walked backwards in 30 steps. Our material evolution led to our physical destruction and led to our possible extinction. Atomic bombs protests dictatorships dictators and their ideologies weapons of mass destruction all the math used by Einstein and Oppenheimer for good reasons used in the bad and dangerous ones. Since there's no quotes captions and that sort of things many people will walk out of this documentary without understand what the director meant to say with it.This is a patient wordless and mind blowing experience where only the visual and the real images are important. Many of the images are shown in slowmotion giving the viewer time to think formulate a thought about what he's seeing at the moment. And of course Philip Glass's music in it's quiet and slow language. Very mental and hypnotic. I recommend you to watch if possible a similar documentary called Ns Que Aqui Estamos Por Vs Esperamos translated by Here We Are Waiting for You a Brazilian documentary that follows almost the same path of Naqoyqatsi but it has more messages more substantial meaning and captions that explain things. In this documentary director Marcelo Masago collected several images of the 20th Century and created a fictional story for this images stating the different aspects of the human mortality. It's terrific. 1010 for both projects!".

	schema:reviewBody "The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this dreadfully botched project to have seen the light of day. Reggio's message so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films is hopelessly jumbled here.  Athletes equations oceans keypads laughing heads etc mingle without purpose. The parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from Getty Images et al and the heavyhanded digital manipulations are amateurish in the worst way imaginable.  Surely someone involved Steven Soderbergh executive producer? could have pointed out that applying a solarizing filter to nearly every frame was a VERY BAD idea?  The crude looping layering and distorting of images recalls a freshman Photoshop class.  And to make matters worse the computer animation sequences are more artless than a 1980's Wall Street piechart. This is not to say that improved aesthetics alone would have salvaged this film but some meager effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual fodder for the accompanying music.  I feel compelled to point out that the score by Philip Glass will certainly satisfy his fans.  Not a radical departure but rather a refinement of what Glass does best with lovely violin contributions by Yo Yo Ma. If you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence.  While you may already be familiar with Detroit's once majestic but long abandoned Michigan Central Railroad Station 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of 20th century decay as the critical point when you should have headed for the EXIT signhit the STOP button etc.  You've been warned.".

Some of the music especially the first and last pieces is stunning and sounds amazing in Dolby Digital.  Reggio's images with some notable exceptions such as some famous works of art morphing into one another with a technique far more interesting than the typical morphing are nothing new and the usual topics of the hazards of technology and corporate greed feel all too wellworn.  Whereas the first film may have inspired a style of tv commercials Naqoyqatsi just feels like one.".

I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10.  I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10.  They were thought provoking and beautifully done.  I gave this movie a rating of 1.  If a 0 or negative number was available I would have given it that rating instead.  What a total waste of time it was watching this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes that I should turn it off but then I figured that it was just a very slow starting movie.  I thought the same thing after 45 minutes then 1 hour etc.  Then I realized that it wasn't going to get any better.It's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities.  Don't take my word for it watch it yourself.  Be sure to see the first two movies before this one.  If you see this one first I can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two but they are definitely much much better than this piece of work.The best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end.  That's when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory for the suffering that you've endured watching this film.

I feel honored to have been able to experience them. My emotions ranged far and wide from longing for the simple beautiful life to grudging pride for man's achievements and finally to the fear that we have really screwed things up.

Alas if only THEY that's you not me Pilgrim had heeded the chants WE would have a serene beautiful life. Hmmm. If man had not developed technologies while some animals have would that be life in balance?POWAQQAE bad sorcerers that they are have seduced the backwards some say stupid people of the southern hemisphere with false promises of prosperity and easier lives. Jared Diamond persuasively posits that the intelligence of Third World people is not greatly different from that of us their northern neighbors.

WE might be pleased if THEY chose the simpler idyllic subsistence life but this is the worst kind of sophistry. Do WE really know what's best for others? Are WE preternaturally wiser and smarter than others in the world? Time will tell.

There are certainly moments of beauty it is in essence a ballet of motion put to screen viewed through the eyepiece of various manipulated patterns which we are reminded pervade our existence as we see with the stunning Mandelbrot sequence. Yet this ballet at times does get old. For instance we could have seen less of the tunnel motion effect and the flashing of ones and zeros.The images were everinterchanging and evolving into each other or into something different. I don't believe the editing was amateurish at all. As for the remark about the film appearing lowtech as if filmed from a TV screen those were intentional effects!Where I seem to differ from others on this movie is with the musical score. I simply felt on the whole structuring Naqoyqatsi with the Phillip Glass compositions and Yo Yo Ma Cello work  beautiful though they were  as the only sound dimension left the film somewhat flat.What was lacking here was more artistic communication. This I believe could have been achieved with a more lucid sound content as one possibility in contrast to the long singular unfolding set of somber strings. It could also have benefited from a minimal narrative treatment perhaps separating the film into sections with more meaning or with some dialogue.The theme elements treated in the movie were mostly evident if not a little underdeveloped and foggy. The primary causes of misery and war today being consumerism conformism overcompetitiveness and modern technology on overflow. These we see through flashes of violence slow motion imagery manipulation and various negative aspects of society mixed with various displays of innocent emotions. The found images are sometimes commonplace ones. But usually they are reintroduced with a unique enough flavor. However often I wished Reggio would have done more with his image sequences. Perhaps the film was too careful in attempting to be visually appealing yet startling while it would have done better to lend itself a little more to some chance events.Naqoyqatsi achieves some great visual feats.

After being presented to Baraka in film class I soon discovered the Qatsi trilogy Ron Fricke being the director of Baraka and editor of Koyaanisqatsi.Many people who have watched Naqoyqatsi are disappointed because the film doesn't deliver what they expectwant. What people seem to want is another Koyaanisqatsi and I believe that is the driving factor behind these negative reviews.This film is different. It's images are fast they are not slow like its previous counterparts. The meaning behind some images are even more vague and hard to decipher than the other two but are easier to tie meaning to.The film seems to have a strong pull on the concept that we are drowning within a sea of information Beginning sequence with the numbers and the fade to the ocean and that we are more attached to 'order' as is technology Olympic ribbon dancer juxtaposed within a Grid. The film is more obvious but that's because it can't be helped. Technology is just recent an can't be represented through natural landscapes as the other two did. Therefore people feel like their being spoon fed what they already know but that's because their not digging deeper. The film is visually abstract and looks great. The editing is insanely complex and it's a shame it's not getting the credit it deserves".

	schema:headline " Beauty without depth";
	schema:reviewBody "Following the masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi and the disappointing sequel Powaqqatsi here we have Naqoyqatsi Life as War. Godfrey Reggio concludes his groundbreaking trilogy with a bang but its a bang that leaves no echo. The film reaches levels of aesthetic perfection never dreamed of in the previous ones but looking beyond the surface one finds only a weak remnant of the poetry that tied together the first film and made it the masterpiece that it is. The problem is simple both Powaqqatsi Life in Transformation and Naqoyqatsi Life as War are simply elaborations upon the theme of Koyaanisqatsi Life out of Balance. Having squeezed this lemon for so long there is little left and one finds mostly pulp here. Yet the film is a masterpiece in its own right albeit a shallow one. The Qatsi films have essentially been audiovisual feasts and this one is so intricately polished that it soars above the previous two. While the previous two films relied on brilliant cinematography to weave there unreal realities this one relies on digital effects and editing. Much is computer animated and most real shots are altered with inverted negatives and colour saturation. Less credit belongs to the cinematographers than to the editors and the digital mixers. The effect of this however is a rollercoaster ride of earth shattering visuals interwoven with Philip Glass' masterful score. Glass' music has always been elemental to the Qatsi trilogy and here we have in my opinion being a huge Glass fan his best work yet not only in film but in any medium. Working with cellist YoYo Ma Glass creates what one critic accurately defined as the first great cello concerto of the twentyfirst century. With is organvocal minimalism the score of Koyaanisqatsi was an esoteric Glass masterpiece and as with all his music an experiment of harmony that some may have found alienating. In Naqoyqatsi he achieves the perfect blend of mainstreamminimalist and creates a audio experience that while unmistakably Glass is receptive of larger audiences. To put it simply like the film this is Glass' most polished score refined and tuned to perfection and while less experimental than his earlier work is more satisfying. As with the previous films the music and the visuals are interdependent. They respond to each other and are built upon one another. Thus this is a fantastic aesthetic experience. After finishing Naqoyqatsi one feels as if they have just taken an acid trip around the world. The film's major flaw is that after the dazzling effect wears off one finds little of value concealed behind the texture. Whereas Koyaanisqatsi achieved an unbelievable poetic flow Naqoyqatsi is disjointed. Koyaanisqatsi evolved along a single thread from the perfection of natural processes through the human world through the Grid of human patterns and back to the natural processes that eventually balance all excesses. Here there are several fragmented segments each one with a theme and pattern but bearing little relation to one another and with almost no sense of flow. In Primacy of Number we have a dazzling display of a world as a binary code almost like a real version of the Matrix showing how all things are reduced to ones and zeros. In Massman there is a close look at the human form unlike anything in the Qatsi trilogy and a shattering look at our desire to go faster stronger higher concluding with the details of human emotions that appear through body language. The chapter New World is self explanatory and is one of two cello intervals that occur in the film the other being Old World. Religion is the artistic highlight of the film accompanied by one of Glass' great works showing the religion of the modern world with devotion to country sports teams celebrities money and the new world order. Media Weather is a dull collection of images of world figures. The climax of the film comes in the Intensive Time and Point Blank segments. The former accompanied by a brilliant soprano vocalist and cello shows the accelerating pace of the modern world moving toward a dim perfection yet unheeding of the toll it may take. Point Blank is the one chapter in Life as War that actually deals with conflict. It is the most brutal and unsettling item in the Qatsi trilogy a frenetic display of hatred and violence that exists in the modern world. Finally the Vivid Unknown the best cello work of the film shows us heading towards an unseen but trusted barrier. It is primarily a poetically rich display of images of space exploration accompanied by aerial footage of skydivers falling towards earth.".

I am still moved by the images and music which show the contrast between the alwaysperfect creations of Mother Nature and the alwaystroublesome workings of human beings. The three films rely on images of natural wonders cityscapes newsreels stock television footage and now digital code to show the beauty and horror man can create.In this installment of 450 images Reggio depicts numerical code sports and popular culture images with too heavy a reliance on stock footage from training films for instance. If you look carefully you'll see the name of Enron flash across the screen. If you think too much you'll wonder why Reggio shows wax dummies of famous people in a curious take on Madame Tussaud. Film is a visual medium after all.  Reggio continues to delight me with his eclectic accumulation of spectacular photography real and digital and his integration of Philip Glass's Eastern music. Narrative structure is not needed here just a scenario that suggests we will never beat Nature at the creation game but in destruction we rule.".

With films such as Andrei Rublev Solaris Mirror Stalker and Nostalghia Tarkovsky enriched the world with powerful works for art. Sacrifice was his final film made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. The story concerns an elderly academic who lives with his family in a rural part of Sweden. When he learns that about an imminent nuclear war he makes a desperate pact with God. The film is astonishingly beautiful like all Tarkovsky's films. Images of nature water and fire feature prominently as does the shifting from colour images to black and white.It is important to remember that Tarkovsky is not a very accessible filmmaker and his films make great demands on viewer's patience and attention but if you are willing to make the effort you will be rewarded by an unforgettable experience.".

Every person who enters the house he starts seeing under a deeper if not more expressionistic light... And when he meets with magic while making love with the witch he creates the bridge that will take him from reality into mystery. The whole film is as breathtaking and selfsufficient as a painting or even more so a Russian icon. It is ageless. I suppose it will remain with me for my entire life.

That Tarkovsky moves with such subtly between psychological study religious allegory and science fiction tropes should'nt be too much of a surprise considering his early philosophical SF films like Solaris and Stalkerwhich I may rewatch cus of this film though I hated it before. Like Philip K.

The lead character seems like a stand in for Tarkovsky himself his views on nature art God progress and humanity seem to match pretty closely with some he gives in the interview section of the DVD. It's still slow as all hell but the intensity of the story helps balance out the visual pace. It's not as instantly impressive as some of Tarkovsky's other films but I think this maybe his strongest movie all around. It's the story of a man who saved the world without anyone ever knowing it and the trade off man must make with God in order to survive. A prayer on film.".

	schema:headline " Too Much Sense";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Tarkovsky is one of the five inventors of cinema and the one most disconnected from the constraints of reality. He is highly intuitive visually rooted of course and deliberately eschews the necessity of making narrative sense.' The magic of his earlier masterpieces Rublyev' Mirror' is precisely in how he sustained a reality with highly folded irrational causality.But as he grew older he became celebrated and ineluctably developed theories' of his approach. He began speaking and writing about his work and slowly slipped into the safe harbor of making sense. This film  his last as it turns out  is the result.Along the way he allied himself with Bergman someone who always was rooted precisely in the simple narrative. Bergman's heritage is the theater. He begins with real' life abstracting and staging elements of it. Bergman's whole point is to make the sense of the situation easy to read so that he can intensify and embellish it. Life is real and because we can enter the reality of a Bergman film we can emotionally relate to it. Bergman's world is allegorical  real and causally connected where Tarkovsky's is metaphorical ultrareal with causal folding.So it is a strange voyage for Tarkovsky to convince himself of the logic of his theories and to journey to Bergman's doorstep.This film has a strongly Tarkovskyite beginning until the map and end the last 47 minutes beginning with the visit of the actor to the witch or  depending on your tolerance  perhaps a few minutes before with the vision of the small house. In between there is a muddle of emotional angst that is clumsily inserted. Also it may be my imagination but all the cinematography seems different than his earlier work. His early eye was languorously curious lingering and floating. Here it is Bergmenesque deliberately fated smooth with premeditated and goals with foreknowledge of the fate.To see what I mean look at the documentary included on the Kino DVD. That documentary is flatly stupid in plumbing the mysteries of Tarkovsky it elucidates his theories' but it does include the remarkable original shot of the transition from the witch's visit to the postholocaust peace. The original is pure Tarkovsky a shot of the actor then panning to a scene with the same actor surrounded then a continuous movement through visitors reflections players in the magic the world and a remarkable image of the nude daughter corralling chickens. Only that last image remains in the final version which is reduced to Bergmanlike clarity. It is dramatically economical but Andrei's poetry is lost.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers herein.Tarkovsky is one of the five inventors of cinema and the one most disconnected from the constraints of reality. He is highly intuitive visually rooted of course and deliberately eschews the necessity of making narrative sense.' The magic of his earlier masterpieces Rublyev' Mirror' is precisely in how he sustained a reality with highly folded irrational causality.But as he grew older he became celebrated and ineluctably developed theories' of his approach. He began speaking and writing about his work and slowly slipped into the safe harbor of making sense. This film  his last as it turns out  is the result.Along the way he allied himself with Bergman someone who always was rooted precisely in the simple narrative. Bergman's heritage is the theater. He begins with real' life abstracting and staging elements of it. Bergman's whole point is to make the sense of the situation easy to read so that he can intensify and embellish it. Life is real and because we can enter the reality of a Bergman film we can emotionally relate to it. Bergman's world is allegorical  real and causally connected where Tarkovsky's is metaphorical ultrareal with causal folding.So it is a strange voyage for Tarkovsky to convince himself of the logic of his theories and to journey to Bergman's doorstep.This film has a strongly Tarkovskyite beginning until the map and end the last 47 minutes beginning with the visit of the actor to the witch or  depending on your tolerance  perhaps a few minutes before with the vision of the small house. In between there is a muddle of emotional angst that is clumsily inserted. Also it may be my imagination but all the cinematography seems different than his earlier work. His early eye was languorously curious lingering and floating. Here it is Bergmenesque deliberately fated smooth with premeditated and goals with foreknowledge of the fate.To see what I mean look at the documentary included on the Kino DVD. That documentary is flatly stupid in plumbing the mysteries of Tarkovsky it elucidates his theories' but it does include the remarkable original shot of the transition from the witch's visit to the postholocaust peace. The original is pure Tarkovsky a shot of the actor then panning to a scene with the same actor surrounded then a continuous movement through visitors reflections players in the magic the world and a remarkable image of the nude daughter corralling chickens. Only that last image remains in the final version which is reduced to Bergmanlike clarity. It is dramatically economical but Andrei's poetry is lost. It is a dead tree planted with high hopes.This package the film the documentary on the film and the book are proof that artists are often not the best source of insight into their art. This film alas is not The Tempest a selfreferential perspective on an artist who understands his own magic. It is instead an echo of that artist's misunderstanding of himself.Must be seen for that alone preferably after Prospero's Books.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.";

This is my second Tarkovsky film...and now I am hooked.  I am not going to be very successful in explaining this movie to anyone  even to myself so forgive the sketchiness of these reflections.  THE SACRIFICE is a revelation to me.  The level of pathos I feel right now is overwhelming  something that has occurred too infrequently in my life. This film regards the human soul as the most precious commodity possible and life as it's most ample celebration.  Time cannot vanish without trace.. Tarkovsky has said.  And so the time that Tarkovsky spent on this Earth has been well spent and he has left more than a trace for future generations to wonder and ponder at.I adore Tarkovsky's images so lovingly photographed here by SVEN NIKVIST. Most remarkable of these images are the final settings where everything comes to a point...even THEY have dialogue made up of great silences packed with intensely significant emotions which have come from the protagonist's culmination.The choice of music here is also deeply personal and wildly original in its contrasts and penetrating meaning.  In the final strains we hear first the modern and timeless Asian sensibilities of Watazumido Shuso.  After which a great silence of visual narrative we are offered a spiritual selection from some of the most beautiful music ever written  Johann Sebastian Bach's St. Matthew Passion.All of these combine in one's mind's eye and heart to provide the thoughtful viewer with one of the most spiritually satisfying endings of any movie I have ever witnessed.The movie seems long but it really isn't as long as you might imagine.  I suppose it is because so much of the narrative is not splashed into our senses  ready for regurgitation.  There is much we must work for.  There is much for which we must contribute our own viewpoints and form our own conclusions.But then life isn't filled with dialogue in the conventional sense...it is more packed with our own thoughts and our own decisions  as so is this film.  It allows you to conclude many things on your own. Isn't it kind of Tarkovsky to have been so benevolent to us and our panoply of thoughtpatterns?  We come to this movie all with our different characters and personalities...Tarkovsky thought of this.And he offered us a masterpiece  where we were the mental protagonist who made the endings for each us  our own  and yet all different  but the same after all.".

Tarkovsky is a fan of long takes slow character development and awkward silences. Even though this is one of my favourite films it was a struggle to get through the whole thing...which is in fact an effective medium to describe a man who is finding it a struggle to progress with his everyday life. The settings are fittingly dreary and dismal indeed his son seems to be the only spark of life in the film.There is no plot to speak of the film is an indepth character study. Tarkovsky has given the main character so many dimensions that one cannot help but wonder if it is semiautobiographical. Elements of magic realism serve to enhance the character's despair and isolation but there are finelycrafted human details  such as a shaking hand that must try twice to light a match properly  that give the film a very realistic sense. The world Tarkovsky has created is like a vivid dream.The images in this movie are incredible watch for his use of fire wood earth and water for all four elements are heavily drawn upon in his shots. There is a documentary floating around out there that has Tarkovsky discuss this film in depth it shows the processes he invented to create some of the takes and the stubbornness he exhibits to get everything to match his vision perfectly. I saw the documentary before the film and I think it only added to my appreciation. His book Sculpting in Time also offers insights and bits of philosophy that add dimensions to this movie.Though I regret that Tarkovsky passed before he could produce more works like this The Sacrifice is a fitting epilogue to his collection of films and perhaps the best eulogy a person could ever hope for.".

The director Andrei Tarkovsky viewed film as art and his films make few if any concessions to commercialization and marketing. If you are looking strictly for entertainment you may find this film to be slow boring and depressing. However if you are looking for art then you should not ignore this film.The artistic merits of the film are considerable. The theme is an individual's relationship to God politics and mankind in general. How can a sensitive and intelligent person come to grips with these huge and sometimes overwhelming parts of life and still keep his own integrity in tact. Just attempting a subject like this is courageous and laudable but in doing so the director walks dangerous ground. It is so broad that no film can truly encompass it and wisely Tarkovsky doesn't try. Instead he shows one man's attempt to deal with it  flawed and inadequate as it may be. This is a clever way to approach it because it stimulates you to start thinking of what your own approach might be.It begins in color with Alexander a very self involved and disconnected man in his later years who is forced by circumstances and a very odd mailman to confront his relationship to God and society. This causes Alexander to go through different mental states which are filmed in black and white or muted color. As the day moves forward Alexander eventually sifts from a passive observer of life to someone who is committed to playing a dramatic but positive and active role in the spiritual and temporal life. With this new reality the film returns to color. The composition of the sets the framing and the editing of the film all are carefully done to support and emphasize the theme and development of the film. The film takes place on one day Alexander's birthday yes this does have a double meaning. Throughout the film death is the looming and persistent presence. Near the beginning Alexander rightly observes that fear of death will drive people to do many foolish things. We see some of these foolish things as the characters of the film become unfaithful hysterical and even cruel and destructive when threatened by death. Tarkovsky himself was facing death by cancer when he made this film and this was his final film. In the end however the film is life affirming leaving us with a view of hope and even joy.This is a film I respect but it is not very entertaining. I am glad I watched it but I wasn't really ready for it when I started. If you are not ready to see a film this serious and deep then it would be easy to dismiss it as difficult and even painful to watch. But to do so would be a reaction to that same fear of death that seems to be the root of so much evil in the world. Understanding that this is a film about serious topics that effect us all and not a casual bit of entertainment can make the difference between appreciating and valuing this film or not. But even though the film had some difficult and soul searching moments you will enjoy the end and its message of hope. The final image of the film is a young boy bringing life to a dead tree. It is a truly beautiful image and one that think will stay with me for a long time.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful Powerful Philosophical Art at its greatest form";
	schema:reviewBody "Andrei Tarkovsky's swan song Offret The Sacrifice is composed of 112 long takes and sequences almost without any cuts planned scenes just like a stage play with enormous acts whose dialogs are rich powerful and filled with insights on life death philosophy sacrifices. It sounds like a film directed by Ingmar Bergman and there's no secret that this was Tarkovksy paying a tribute to one of his favorite directors filming in Bergman's famous island used as scenery in many of his films some actors who worked with him and the habitual cinematographer Sven Nykvist are present in Offret.In one the finest performances ever captured on film Erland Josephson lives the journalist Alexander a worried man about mankind's destiny who tells to his little and mute son called 'Little Man' about how doomed we are but also tells him good things too teaches him to plant a tree and all. On the day of Alexander's birthday the Third World War breaks in and this time we and the characters have the feeling that now the world really is gonna end. As last wish Alexander pray to God wishing to have more time to live and in exchange he'll give up his family his belongings and his house. I don't wanna keep wavering about where the plot goes and show the thoughts I have about the film I'll leave that to you reader. Instead I'll keep my focus on some of the beautiful things presented here some of my favorite moments and the physical aspect that I found interesting about Offret. As I said earlier this film looks like more a work from Bergman than a work from Tarkovsky and for the die hard fans of the Russian director might not be so appealing since he uses the visual to tell his stories in most of his classics but here he depends on dialogs and more dialogs which is quite rare in his filmography. Tarkovsky composes along with Nykvist two worlds in one a beautiful and colorful island with green trees a sunny place and the devastated place with dark tons shapes very dreadful creating an apocalyptical world without any kind of expensive scenarios. He uses the cinematography and a subtle and powerful special effects to destroy the world.Here are the things I won't forget about this masterpiece 1 Alfred's prayer one of the most emotional and heartbreaking moments ever made filmed in one long shot 2 the house on fire burning down to the ground beautifully filmed 3 The jar of milk smashing on the floor when the planes appear showing us that the war begun 4 The story described by the postman about his 'collection' of events 5 Alfred's monologues about art death life fear. Tarkovsky's idea flying in its fullness. 6 Alfred visiting the only one who can help him Maria the maid of his house. 7 The desperation of Alfred's family when the world's end. 8 The first scene with Little Man and his dad planting the lonely tree which also ends the film with Little Man's first quote meaning the creation of life a hint of hope. 9 the ending absolutely perfect.It is art and philosophy at its highest point. And it's sad that this Tarkovsky last film in the way that I really loved his change of style here I was looking forward for more films like this but it simply didn't happened. Life was taken away from him very early but we're left with interesting and great masterpieces like this Stalker and more. One of the most beautiful pictures ever made and must be included on a list of films that you can't get out of your head. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Andrei Tarkovsky's swan song Offret The Sacrifice is composed of 112 long takes and sequences almost without any cuts planned scenes just like a stage play with enormous acts whose dialogs are rich powerful and filled with insights on life death philosophy sacrifices. It sounds like a film directed by Ingmar Bergman and there's no secret that this was Tarkovksy paying a tribute to one of his favorite directors filming in Bergman's famous island used as scenery in many of his films some actors who worked with him and the habitual cinematographer Sven Nykvist are present in Offret.In one the finest performances ever captured on film Erland Josephson lives the journalist Alexander a worried man about mankind's destiny who tells to his little and mute son called 'Little Man' about how doomed we are but also tells him good things too teaches him to plant a tree and all. On the day of Alexander's birthday the Third World War breaks in and this time we and the characters have the feeling that now the world really is gonna end. As last wish Alexander pray to God wishing to have more time to live and in exchange he'll give up his family his belongings and his house. I don't wanna keep wavering about where the plot goes and show the thoughts I have about the film I'll leave that to you reader. Instead I'll keep my focus on some of the beautiful things presented here some of my favorite moments and the physical aspect that I found interesting about Offret.

	schema:headline " Disappointing end to an astonishing career.";
	schema:reviewBody "This last film by the great Tarkovsky and seen as an article of pure faith by many suffered from production problems the largest being a camera jamming which resulted in the cast and crew pulling together to rebuild a set so that the film could be completed. Tarkovsky had suffered worse not least the loss of an entire film due to a lab fault back in Russia. His chief problem was adjusting to the more formal structure of crewing in the west as opposed to the freedom afforded him back in the Soviet Union. I think the main problem affecting this film is it seems unduly influenced by Bergman and has the same cameraman. The hysterical women on the floor especially reminds me of 'Cries And Whispers'. Mimicking another's style even one as great as Bergman's diminished him somehow. Also I can't pretend to understood the plot which at times seemed eccentric to the point of obtuseness and silliness not least the rather too sudden appearance of an ambulance and the puzzling business involving a witch. Why anyone should suspose such an involvement would prevent a nuclear war is perplexing. Also the tired use of yet another levitation motif suggested Tarkovsky may have been running out of artistic steam. On the plus side there is an enigmatic soundtrack of what sounds like sheet metal work suggesting spiritual discord perhaps?Whether one engages with a Tarkovsky film depends on whether you identify with whatever spiritual problem his character is wrestling with. Some people are more concerned with nuclear issues than others. Some may see the sacrifice made by Otto as an inspiring spiritual one against his own interests. Certainly Tarkovsky seemed enamoured of the concept of the holy fool weak and perhaps misguided and foolish individuals who are disenfranchised but in their lowliness somehow admirable and insightful on some matters. Others of a more secular persuasion may see Otto's sacrifice as selfish his family being affected and merely the pointless actions of the benighted. I'm sitting on the fence. The final sequence which for the reasons above had to be reshot is sadly not one of Tarkovsky's best. He has this need not to edit for the audience and prefers scenes to run to their own inner dynamic. It didn't work for me.Tarkovsky was dying of cancer during the making of this film and the watering of the withered tree is actually an older myth ruminated upon in his extraordinary book 'Sculpting In Time'. It is about 'the truth' as he sees it and is a Christian one. Unfortunately I don't think this film was all it could have been but I see why it means so much to many. In my opinion he was perhaps the greatest film maker of all time and we are unlikely to see his like again. He believed that the gift of friendship was the most natural and important one to give as it is the one most open to us all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pauline Kael once said that movies took their impetus not from the desiccated imitation European high culture but from the peep show the Wild West show the music hall the comic strip  from what was coarse and common. Andrei Tarkovsky in his relatively short career dismissed cinema's original intent it's coarse nature that Pauline Kael referred to and used cinema as a way to move the viewer to meditate on his or her spirituality. THE SACRIFICE Andrei Tarkovsky's final film is yet another film of Tarkovsky's brilliant catalogue which emphasizes the importance of faith and spiritual reflection. THE SACRIFICE is a hard film for some to figure out. Personally there is not one film playing in the nearest theater from which I write this review that approaches the relevance that this film conveys. The movie is about a man with a lucrative career that takes some time off with some family and friends to an isolated location. He appears to be pretty well off until he gets message that war is imminent. He prays to God in one of the most intense moments in film and promises that if God ends the war then he will disown his family burn his house down and stay silent for the rest of his life. The war ends.... That's as far as I'm going to go because I want you to have the opportunity to see a film that rises above cinema. The film however does not reveal if God responds to the prayer. Whether he does or not is not what THE SACRIFICE is about. It's about the actions that we perform in order to be closer to God and some people respond more intensely than others.Great movies about spirituality are all but gone from today's cinema. Most come off as either to corny preachy etc ... Unlike those ridiculous exercises THE SACRIFICE is a smart film. It's beautifully crafted the acting is terrific and the direction is top notch. It is a film that has moved me to reflect on my own spirituality as well and I can truly tell you that few movies have done that to me. I really appreciate THE SACRIFICE it is a film that has produced an important effect in my life. Now how many movies can do that?".

It's so pleasantly different from the rapid jumpcut editing of today's blockbusters here in the United States and I was glad to look at a tree or a picture longer than most modern movies would allow.SPOILER ALERT My main fault with this movie is the screenplay. It's a contrived mess. The hero Alexander just happens to be taking stock in his life and where his life has led him when nuclear war breaks out and the postman who's read more books and has more whimsy than your local hippie librarian just so happens to know a lonely witch who can undo all that has been done in return for a favor? It strains credibility to an absolute fault and the plot line sounds like the work of a child just beginning to write in cursive.Then there are the situations and characters that take you absolutely nowhere. Alexander's wife  what purpose did she serve other than being the obligatory hysteric in a crisis film? And her rambling about loving one man and marrying another? Where does this train of thought go? Nowhere!!!! Do we see her analyze her marriage and seek to do anything about her plight? NO!!! It's a line that makes no sense in the film and has no resolution at all and yet ENTIRE FILMS have been made about that very feeling! There are so many lines that don't make sense in light of everything going on and it just feels contrived and meandering.I understand there might be a cultural difference in storytelling that's at work here.

But sorry I can only explain the misplaced reverence for this film as credit for his earlier work and respect as his career and life was ending. However this film is the kind of thing that has made intellectual a dirty word in the US. Just what we need  more artful glorification of the clich that being an intellectual means being a spoiled rotten selfabsorbed selfpitying terminally miserable humorless neurotic who has it all but does nothing but desperately search for reasons to feel sorry for himself. This film asks deep questions? Sorry but I was only 12 when my intellect questioned and rejected the ridiculous idea of a loving all powerful god getting sadistic kicks from demanding sacrifices. This film limply accepts that lamebrained darkages scam of religious oppression with a whimper. But why not when the sacrifice involves every old rich white guy's fantasy of banging his hot young maid! Some sacrifice! Of course he manages to turn even that into a downer  sheesh! Can't be an art movie without a topless maid! Class oppression  even making the maids wear uniforms in the 20th Century  is another sickening idea that is accepted without comment or critique. The idea of there being some ecoidealistic message in burning a house is also silly as hell. He obviously had no problem owning a house that would take the energy use of a small country to heat. Guess it doesn't matter if it impresses the neighbors. And people say this is about teaching the next generation to do better? Are you kidding? It's sad that there's an arthouse audience for such pap when Greenaway can't even get a release in the US these days. So... this is the film for you if you're no longer satisfied with depressive navel gazing and you're so desperate for miserable selfabsorption that you'll bend over and stare at your own anus so then you can complain that something smells bad and you have a backache too.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story takes place in an isolated location on the isle of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Although the island has a long semiindependent history it has been an official part of Sweden for more than three centuries.Many of my reactions to this film are the common ones this film is Bergmanesque a little different from yet not discontinuous with Tarkovsky's others the images are striking and almost overwhelmingly powerful the film is long and slow stately to say it positively so much so some won't have the patience to even finish watching it.I think though the story is more complex and subtle than is often stated. Supposedly the topic is a slightly offkilter person giving up what he loves in exchange for the salvation of others as a reaction to the specter of nuclear war. After all his life circumstances look pretty attractive to us viewers wealthy respected private and comfortable. The ominousness of the opening dialog doesn't seem warranted.But I think it's more than that or at least more ambiguous than that. The main character isn't just slightly offkilter but close to collapsing completely. His life has become unbearable. And his motives are as much about punishment or even revenge as sacrifice.Why do I think that? For starters how is it that the only people that will come to Alexander's birthday party are his doctor and his postman? That guest list sounds to me like an act of desperation an admission that he's hit rock bottom. Alexander's wife is so neurotic even her daughter and her lover chide her. His daughter can't grow up in such an isolated place she never sees anyone else anywhere near her age. And as far as her obvious ageappropriate interest in boys there's nothing more than a bad joke about the postman being her beau. She flips between acting like she's ten and acting like she's thirty with nothing in between. Alexander sleeps on the couch in his office rather than in the marital bed  and everyone acts as though that happens all the time. When he bicycles to his servant's house or at least dreams he does along the way he sees the doctor's empty car with his wife's shawl clearly he's aware that his wife is having an affair with his best friend. His servant's immediate reaction is something terrible must have happened at home and it's apparent this isn't the first time she's seen Alexander's home situation become intolerable. And the doctor's plan to move to Australia is a truly momentous oneinamillion attempt to escape forever. The doctor's calm detached slightly ironic bearing belies the awfulness of the words he speaks about just how dysfunctional Alexander's household is.".

Although the island has a long semiindependent history it has been an official part of Sweden for more than three centuries.Many of my reactions to this film are the common ones this film is Bergmanesque a little different from yet not discontinuous with Tarkovsky's others the images are striking and almost overwhelmingly powerful the film is long and slow stately to say it positively so much so some won't have the patience to even finish watching it.I think though the story is more complex and subtle than is often stated.

When people talk about pretentious and boring films that sophisticated people fawn over this is the best example I can think of apart from a few films by JeanLuc Godard! While some unfairly look at Ingmar Bergman's films as being pretentious they've been made fun of repeatedly on TV and in short like De Dva I have seen a huge number of them and they are not pretentious. While they aren't always as great as some claim and this is true of any film maker but it is clear he is a great writer and director. However this horrible film that is a joint SwedishRussian production IS pretentious boring and just about as much fun as eating broken glass. No...wait...I think I'd rather eat broken glass than watch this film again. Now I am NOT saying movies need to be fun to be watched and appreciatedit's just that if they are depressing and bizarre there should be some reason for subjecting the viewer to this.The movie delights in long and emotionally disconnected camera work. Some may see this as artistic but I just see it as dull and lifeless. Then when it is combined with interminably long and selfexploratory monologues it is a recipe for total boredom. The characters rarely interactthey talk at each other or just talk into space. And the surrealistic elements of the film may seem sophisticated to some but to me they are a giant headache. For a similar effect read several books by Albert Camus a couple existential philosophers and then rap yourself in the head with a mallet.If you like this filmgreat. I am very happy for you. But you also should realize for the average viewer and in fact MOST viewers this film will be a tedious experience. In other words this movie definitely is for a very very selective audience.FYIThis is the third film I have seen directed by the widely acclaimed Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. While many love his films I have found all three overly long overly introspective and overly artsy. He just isn't my taste though if you have a very high tolerance for these sort of films you may love them.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is perhaps too blunt a notion that Andrei Tarkovsky's the Sacrifice bears some comparison with Ingmar Bergman's films. More than a notion it's right up there on the screen Erland Josephsson one of Bergman's great collaborators as well as Sven Nykvist probably the best as well as certain allusions in some of the shots i.e. the kid in the bed in black and white seems right out of Persona. But it's also the themes being dealt with the tone in the monologues from the characters albeit from Josephsson and usually dealing with his faith and memories and the sense of grief and bewilderment ala Shame. At the same time with these allusions as well as others to the likes of Nietzche and Dostoyevsky it's through and through the work of a filmmaker so in touch with his soul as an artist with so much to pour into a work that has relatively little plot not that it doesn't have a story that it floors one.And in a sense it's close to being despite its darker intonations and its ambiguous staggering ending of madness and hope the director's quintessential work. While Stalker will probably stay as the artistic pinnacle of his career the Sacrifice brings to a head many of the director's chief concerns while not possibly making them too patched together to make sense i.e. The Mirror which is nevertheless also great as well as in a style that is meditative calm harsh surreal and always with the heart and mind of what leans toward the poetic. Once we get into the premise of the picture which takes a little while itself to set up an old man Alexander Josephsson and his family are at his home to celebrate his birthday when elsewhere a catastrophic war is going on with the family left to their own devices out in the middle of the countryside Tarkovsky explores the spaces that are there to see in the consciousness of men and to a degree women in a crisis of faith.In reality there isn't a whole lot that happens in the usual plotdriven sense of the Sacrifice but within the realm of the scenes depicted and acted there's a lot more than any other filmmaker would meet at. A visit to Maria a witch in a church nearby takes up a fairly significant chunk out of the picture but in it is a story told by Alexander about a garden and his mother and around this and in this scene are the details that Tarkovsky builds with. It goes without saying his genius also lies with whom he works with and Nykvist creates such a mood for each particular scene sometimes the light or look of a scene will fade just a little and everything will change however subtly for an instant and such a delicate brooding nature with the camera as it tracks along in Tarkovsky's carefully lined long takes that it ranks up there with his very best pieces with Bergman.But at the same time as the director mixes in black and white footage slowmotion of a character running down a hall a tilt up some mud and nature a sense of time and place and horror is depicted honestly without the problems with usually pretentious visionaries. And as it was that Tarkovsky knew that he was dying unlike other filmmakers who fade out after their last picture or die unexpectedly there's a sense of selfreflection as it comes out with Alexander and in those around him that is sad but ultimately poignant to the highest order. Questions are raised that can hardly be answered but one of the chief ones has the ring of naivet until it's known that it's this particular instance it's raised is there no hope for the spirit? What about the boy however might also be another sort of question as we see the final shot starting on the boy and raising up ever so gently up the tree with the music playing on.All these and more can be raised from the Sacrifice not to mention of course what does it mean to really sacrifice oneself but it's besides all of that just a truly rich cinematic experience one that's so rich that it's hard to take it all in all at once. It has the sustainability of its artistic force to not have the danger of growing 'dated' to make a more leap with some grandeur perhaps as with a poem or some renaissance painting not far off from the Leonardo featured in the film the Sacrifice asks to be revisited to have the experience of the thoughts and ideas poised and for the amazing performances and technical work. It's one of the true masterpieces of the 1980s.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILER A Western viewer needs to know a few things about Russians to fully understand the meaning and significance of this film. One item of particular significance is the magnitude and nature of war. The film states that a nuclear conflict of some sort limited or unlimited is not clear is imminent or has already started. Certainly the noise and vibrations due to the noise of the jets flying overhead indicates that war is about to break out. Now war damage is actually something of an abstract meaning to Americans all of the battles fought by our military in the wars of the 20th century were in far off places. Though there were exceptions with Pearl Harbor the torpedoing of merchant ships of the coast of the United States during the early days of WWII and of course the events of Sept. 11 2001 the truly great battles were elsewhere and people who lived in the center of our country in the countryside such as shown in this movie were not directly affected or attacked. Now nuclear war would probably bring about death and destruction even to the Heartland of the United States but that is hard to grasp for most Americans as this sort of war has never happened.However the Russians or Soviets at the time of the making of this film did suffer tremendous destruction throughout their country in WWII. And this destruction did affect most of these people. In fact wars in the past before WWI and WWII such as during the Napoleonic era have also caused terrible destruction in Russia. So to the Russian viewing this movie the terror shown by the actors is very well understood. War to the Russian is not generally sending troops across oceans to fight but rather fighting the enemy in one's front yard.The other matter that a Western viewer needs to know to understand this movie is the very superstitious nature of the Russian people. I had long thought that the most superstitious country in the world was probably somewhere in Africa or the Caribbean. It may be but the most superstitious country with any sort of development is undoubtedly Russia. Those people are very sincere in their belief in Astrology and any other superstition that they have ever heard of. The movie is not being factitious when a woman is cited as being a witch. They still believe in such people in Russia though the nature of witchcraft there is somewhat different than the traditional depiction of a witch in the West. And quite a few employers in the former Soviet Union probably believes that one of their servant women could be a witch.And most people in Russia could believe for the sake of the film that a witch MIGHT actually be able to do something to stop a war. Who the witch is and what if anything she can do in this case is something you have to see the movie to find out. Sufficient to say though that belief in the supernatural is still quite common in Russia and must be taken into account when seeing this film.".

In 'Almost Famous' it was when everyone on the Stillwater tour bus was singing along to Tiny Dancer. In 'Say Anything...' it was when Lloyd was driving around and proclaimed how his heart was exchanged for Diane's pen. Crowe also creates many memorable little moments in 'Singles' which may not be the most famous movie he's made but it's one of the best.Even though 'Singles' is about twentysomethings in Seattle everything rang true to me as I am now a teenager. The film is honest and real in how couples become couples and how relationships can fall apart. 'Singles' isn't at all meanspirited or depressing in its portrayal of relationships or the dating game so it might turn some people off who want to see the extremely ugly confrontations a la 'Closer'. But the moments in 'Singles' that make it worth watching are when Linda Kyra Sedgewick gets to know Steve Campbell Scott while going through his record collection in his apartment. Or when Janet Bridget Fonda sneezes and gets a bless you from someone she and the audience would least expect.Everything about 'Singles' is great.

An oftheard criticism of this film is that it's not an authentic portrayal of the GenX culture of the early 90's but I've yet to see that done well in any film.More importantly the film never claims to be a GenX film.  It's set in Seattle during the height of Seattle Sound but the cast is made up of driven professionals and slackers alike.  It's more of a crosssection of 20somethings not a focus on GenX or Grunge.  The characters settings and themes are all to a certain degree idealized which is a staple of Crowe's style.  Where this film's charm really lies is in capturing the spirit of the early90's and the anticlassist sentiment embraced by teens and young professionals in opposition to the status is everything 1980s.  It's nice to remember a time when being socially and environmentally conscious was actually fashionable for a time.  Sadly we all got sucked into the dotcom thing and realized we can be just as bad as our parents.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love. Sex. Friendship. Companionship. These are the themes obviously explored in Cameron Crowe's early movie Singles which revolve around the love lives of singles naturally living in a common apartment. We follow each of the protagonist Steve Campbell Scott Janet Bridget Fonda Cliff Matt Dillon and Linda Kyra Sedgwick through their ups and downs in dealing with the weird little emotion called Love.Well not quite. As we know early in the film each have problems and their own peculiar viewpoints on the dating scene. We see Linda meeting and breaking up with a Spanish student she was so into after seeing through his lies and sweet talk. It hurts and she doesn't want to be hurt again. Steve too have had a bad experience and I can identify with this swears off relationships for the next few years deciding instead to focus on career. As Fate would have had it these two will meet at the unlikeliest places and get into a relationship.Cliff an aspiring rocker seemed to have taken his girlfriend Janet for granted. And I think this is something that most people can identify with. When efforts go unappreciated or when things go mundane the question is do you want to bail out? And when you do what next? Would you give the ex another chance? If you do how would you approach it? It's fun watching a movie that was made 13 years ago and you wonder about how the initiating and sustaining of a relationship back then happened without technology which we are so used to these days. Back then a mobile phone was a cordless one and there is no such thing as an instant message but an answering machine. Where Speed Dating was unheard of but Video Dating was the rage check out the funny Tim Burton cameo.You wonder too about the career of the leads. Campbell Scott was noticed by many after his pairing with Julia Roberts in the movie Dying Young but after this seemed to have vanished into obscurity. And so has Kyra Sedgwick. Only Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda are still around somewhere.Oh the music. Peppered throughout the movie is the wonderful musical tracks that always seem to punctuate a particular moment succinctly. I like Tarantino and Crowe movies because music plays an integral part of the entire experience and Singles too had excellent ballads blended with grunge rock say Pearl Jam before they made it huge which also made an appearance.It's a beautiful quirky little movie with excellent identifiable dialogue music humour and a younger cast of stars whom we know today thrown into situations that everyone in love would have experienced.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cameron Crowe delivers a charming little piece of romantic comedy with Singles. Set amidst the backdrop of early '90s Seattle the film itself often takes a backseat to its excellent soundtrack including some of grunge rock's best. However Crowe's signature charm highlighting the little things of personal relationships amid big cities and big music earns this one a place alongside gems like Say Anything and Almost Famous.The film's title speaks over a range of topics within the film. The core characters find themselves single living in single apartments or even cutting singles in bands. Yet single relationship status above all helps to form the meat of the film carrying us through the parallel paths of friends bound together by their apartments and the music they enjoy. The wrestling match between commitment and escape love and friendship underpins every moment of every conversation.Music lover Crowe's early days as a journalist for Rolling Stone magazine have rubbed off in many memorable ways over the span of his career. Often the sounds of his movies speak more potently than the actors or augment their performance we all remember John Cusack's Peter Gabriel moment in Say Anything. Peppered throughout Singles are fantastic songs chronicling the swell of Seattle grunge and alternative rock including club performances by Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Three members of Pearl Jam make delicious cameos as Matt Dillon's band mates and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden even makes an appearance. Perhaps the best scene in the film occurs when Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick sit silently over the pieces of a broken plate both utterly entranced with May this Be Love by Jimi Hendrix.Admittedly the film has its flaws owing mostly to the clunky nature of incorporating several different parallel plot lines into a film of this length. Some characters are squeezed in with marginal and ultimately forgettable results. However Crowe's ability to forge the very fabric of what people love about each other and their lives keeps Singles afloat above other romantic comedies. Simply put he nudges our own memory bank with a combination of music and storytelling that allows us to connect with his characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 80s three directors perfectly captured the comedy of young American growing pains. These directors are John Hughes Sixteen Candles Breakfast Club Ferris Buehler Savage Steve Holland Better Off Dead and Cameron Crowe Say Anything. All of these films are characterized by witty tongueincheek dialogue satirical but not sarcastic and surreal musicvideolike gags such as I dunno a pigburger patty grabbing a guitar and rocking out to Van Halen's Everybody Wants Some.When the 80s ended apparently so did their unique and idiosyncratic brand of humour. John Hughes stopped directing in 91 and Savage Steve's last feature film was also in 91. Cameron Crowe evolved into a different style with his hugely successful 30something comedy Jerry Maguire. Here folks in 1992 I believe we have the last and possibly best of the great 80s growingup films. If you've seen the others I mentioned don't consider your life complete until you see Singles.Even with Crowe's 1989 Say Anything focusing on high school graduation Crowe was the most mature of the bunch yet every bit as quirky and hilarious. Singles covers the next age 23to27 establishing careers and facing grown up problems but still as wild and emotionally reckless as high school kids. I suppose some of us carry that same crazy recklessness late into life which is what makes this movie great for oddballs of all ages.The movie is perfectly cast with Cambell Scott in the lead think John Cusack but a sharper dresser Kyra Sedgwick as a slightly flakey control freak maybe an early version of Tina Fey in 30 Rock and a host of awesome supporting characters Bridget Fonda as the slightly neurotic groupie who refuses to admit that she's a groupie Sheila Kelley remember the hot paralegal in LA Law? who plays a goofy insecure maneater Eric Stoltz Caprica Pulp Fiction The Prophecy in the oddest role he's ever played an obnoxious mime who won't shut up and of course the showstealer Matt Dillon as the notsobright artistrockstar whose magnum opus is a song called Touch Me I'm Dick.Speaking of rock music cameo appearances as well as performances include... are you paying attention folks...?Eddie Vedder Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard from Pearl JamChris Cornell and the gang from SoundgardenThomas Doyle singer for TAD You got the wrong number lady but I'll be right overPat Nizzio singer for The SmithereensEveryone from Alice in ChainsJeremy Piven Ari Gold in Entourage as the funniest checkout clerk you've ever seenBill Pullman as a nerdy breast implant surgeonPaul Giamatti in one of his first speaking roles ever What?!!Cameron Crowe's motherand none other than director TIM BURTON as Bryan the next Martin Scorcese pronounced Scoreseeez hahaAnd if that's not enough to make you want to rush out and rent this movie don't forget the killer soundtrack with tunes by the aforementioned bands plus Jane's Addiction Smashing Pumpkins Paul Westerberg The Replacements and others I'm probably forgetting.The story itself is fantastic not only hilarious but probably the most insightful peek into romance disorder since When Harry Met Sally.

All the characters are extremely likeable Campbell Scott's especially and you get emotionally invested in them very soon.This is the kind of film you can just kick back with on a rainy Saturday afternoon you don't need to exert much mental energy to follow the rambling plot just prepare to watch representations of very real relationships that you probably will be able to relate to on some level.";

But funnily enough this flick was in production BEFORE that scene took off. As a result what seemed like cashing in was actually foresight.The relationships unfolding in the apartment complex were done realistically and the scenes involving the band will be enjoyed by anyone into that era's music. And Campbell Scott almost steals this film. His idea for the city was actually a good one.And yes that is 3 members of Pearl Jam as Matt Dillons backup band. And see if you can spot Chris Soundgarden Cornell coming out to watch Matt show off his new car speakers.So 90's. But very enjoyable.".

Maybe I also liked it because of it was made in the early 90's a time period that I really liked. Im sure this movie bores the hell out of some people but I know there are many who love it and im one of them.  A great cast helps a lot as well I liked seeing Bill Pullman in his role he did a very good job.  Overall a great unusual movie far above most.  9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I have caught up with all of Cameron Crowe's films. Like his directorial debut Say Anything Singles brings us great music a cast of unknowns we all know now and a story with heart and laughs. Maybe it just goes to where I am in my life at the moment but this movie really resonated with me. The fact that life relies so much on luck whether good or bad to shape our personal relationships our career and our loves is quite prevalent. Sometimes it takes an accident an event that you were never looking for to bring two people together or rekindle something that was thought to be lost forever. If only I lived in Seattle right now and it was the early90s I wouldn't mind going through it all as much as in Buffalo. At least I could go to a club show and see acts like Pearl Jam Alice in Chains Soundgarden and Citizen Dick. Now that was a music scene.Singles is about just that a group of twentysomethings going through that transition after college beginning careers and looking for meaningful relationships. Most of the characters live in a small apartment complex and are very close friends I guess you can look past the fact that the entire five person building consists of that one age group. There is the rocker working four jobs and not able to see the perfect girl standing right in front of him Matt Dillon the girl who is working off her loans to go back to school and make something of her life Bridget Fonda the guy who has found success in work but not in life finally running into the girl of his dreams in the one place he never thought he'd find her Campbell Scott and that girl tired of the games and heartbreak trying to open herself up to him someone she cares for but is too afraid to risk losing everything again Kyra Sedgwick. Each of these actors is fantastic and adds just the right amount of quirk and individuality to the film. We all know people like these and I know I started to superimpose myself with my friends into the story because it has or could happen to us. Sure it is a different decade and yes the film is dated in that way garage openers as the new varsity letter jacket? but at its core this could be any year.I also really like the direction by Crowe. He is a writer and rock music fanatic by trade and attempts to infuse a lot of his own sensibilities to the work. There is a novice quality still at play and it just makes everything that much more believable and tenuous. Without the gloss and polish you feel as though it all is transpiring right before your eyes. Even his use of breaking the fourth wall for no apparent reason whatsoever worked for me. Splitting the film into vignettes is a nice touch too but it is the narration straight to the camera that intrigues. I would love to say a show like Saved By the Bell owes much to this film but sadly it predates it. So maybe Crowe appropriated the gimmick himself either way it works as a way of seeing inside the leads and flesh them out a bit more. The payoff of Scott yelling out the window for Dillon to be quiet as he was talking is great. He's talking to us as an aside fictionally but I guess the guy needs his concentration. I even liked the spotting blatant material objects for each character especially books. One is by Lester Bangs a future role infused in Crowe's Almost Famous Sedgwick of course has Franny  Zooey a superior novel in my opinion to Catcher in the Rye as she is looking for her Holden Caufield and Fonda has Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead as should every aspiring architect.And the cameoshow can I not mention the plethora of bit parts all priceless in their own way? We have the soundtrack's performers sprinkled throughout from Dillon's band Citizen Dick consisting of Pearl Jam's Vedder Ament and Gossard to Chris Cornell enjoying Fonda's car get the bass kicked out of it on the street corner. The great Bill Pullman as the lost plastic surgeon overwhelmed by career success yet unable to have fun Eric Stoltz as the philosophical mime that doesn't mind talking and Jeremy Piven as the loudmouth fan of Scott during his DJing days who else can mix Elvis Costello with Public Enemy? are each a joy. The real kneeslapper though is mister Oscarnominated actor Paul Giammati with his one lined prolonged makeout session in the diner. I was on the floor laughing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the late 80's and early 90's 'Les Nuls' and 'Les Inconnus' literally the nobodies and the unknowns were the 'Rolling Stones' and 'Beatles' of French comedy.'Les Nuls' were a product of the Canal  generation  mostly relying on absurd and Pythonesque humor while 'Les Inconnus' were more satirical depicting French society with a humor easily labeled today as politically incorrect like a parody of The Invaders where the aliens were Arabs. The popularity of the two trios culminated with the release of their respective movies in 1994 The City of Fear by 'Les Nuls' a parody of crime thrillers with the Cannes Festival as a backdrop and in 1995 The Three Brothers a more mature comedy about three men in a crisisstricken France.The Three Brothers was faithful to the usual tone of the group and rather than a succession of gags it relied on a solid script and heartwarming story that ensured the film's success it was the highestgrossing French film of the year. The film isn't a laughriot and has its slower moments but there is a heart inside an evolution of characters and some powerful messages about values like family and brotherhood. Didier Bourdon Bernard Campan and Pascal Lgitimus play characters of the same name who couldn't have been more different and it's precisely their different backgrounds that make their interactions so hilarious while the heart of the film relies on their common denominator a mother.Didier is a security guard in a clothes store and a womanizer living with a traditionalist family because he has no other alternative he endures both their bigotry and pressure to marry their prude and dull daughter. Bernard is a halftime detergentdemonstrator and 'arts film' actor the closest to the definition of a loser. Finally Pascal is the most successful one he's your typical yuppie who works in a Marketing agency where everyone wears ponytails to imitate the boss the confident and towering Mr Steven Berndard Farcy although he likes to be called Steven since he doesn't believe in bossing which doesn't prevent him for firing when necessary using convincing metaphors to justify it.The diversity of their background is not just used in the setup but establishes their personalities with a real depth. Bernard is the gentle bum displaying the same kindness he probably used to depend on. Didier is unconsciously affected by the racism of his host. Pascal the selfmade man treats people with an arrogance proportional to his bootlicking at work. The three men often express xenophobic or racist remarks but this is only a facade to hide their own insecurities. Today one of the three men would have been gay and another a struggling artist Bernard Didier and Pascal are respectively worker unemployed salaried like only Les Inconnus could have portrayed average men expressing average ideas a credit to the realism of the screenplay.The trio first meets in an attorney office where they learn that their mother passed away two years ago and left a significant fortune of three million francs for each one million translated into the film's catchphrase cent patates 10 racks. The money doesn't unite them anyway each one decides to take a different path Bernard buys himself a 1957 Chrysler Didier who met an old girlfriend decides to take her to a trip and Pascal brags on having won money through speculation. The story really picks up in one of the film's funniest scenes when the poor attorney must explain that the heritage can't transpire because of a technical problem regarding the delay. The film echoes one of the group's most famous sketches about professional jargon hermetical languages but the comedy works because the three men still think of the money and their evolution from disbelief to sheer anger is simply brilliant.The incident leads to a chain of events that would cause their downfall Didier drinks so heavily he's immediately chased away from his family Bernard helps him to recover after an acid trip. And Pascal who earlier took pride of being the only one who remained stoic pays the highest price of his cockiness during a friendly dinner at home with Steven his wife and a subordinate a dinner that must conclude with Pascal's acceptance to invest his money on the company. The film reaches its pinnacle when two drunk Bernard and Didier go to Pascal's home and ruin the pleasant evening. The film never gets funnier after that but the peak of hilarity is so high we forgive them. Didier returns to his ex' home and find her son alone in the stairs the son is sixyears old coincidentally the same span of time since their breakup and then the film turns into a Three Men with a baby remake but with many funny situations to come despite some syrupy moments.The film is one of the most quotable of French cinema although many gags would be lost in translation nonetheless no one can't resist to some props that became part of French popculture from the misunderstood modern sculpture everyone takes for a coat rack or the famous Whiteman's monochrome a white painting that has no price. The Three Brothers is French popular cinema at its best and even the most serious and intellectual magazines praised the relative solidity of the story probably satisfied that the film didn't fall in an abundance of grimaces or noisy jokes that became too common in French comedy.The film won a Csar for Best First Work while the screenplay and Didier Bourdon's acting also deserved some nods.

	onyx:emotionText "In the late 80's and early 90's 'Les Nuls' and 'Les Inconnus' literally the nobodies and the unknowns were the 'Rolling Stones' and 'Beatles' of French comedy.'Les Nuls' were a product of the Canal  generation  mostly relying on absurd and Pythonesque humor while 'Les Inconnus' were more satirical depicting French society with a humor easily labeled today as politically incorrect like a parody of The Invaders where the aliens were Arabs. The popularity of the two trios culminated with the release of their respective movies in 1994 The City of Fear by 'Les Nuls' a parody of crime thrillers with the Cannes Festival as a backdrop and in 1995 The Three Brothers a more mature comedy about three men in a crisisstricken France.The Three Brothers was faithful to the usual tone of the group and rather than a succession of gags it relied on a solid script and heartwarming story that ensured the film's success it was the highestgrossing French film of the year. The film isn't a laughriot and has its slower moments but there is a heart inside an evolution of characters and some powerful messages about values like family and brotherhood. Didier Bourdon Bernard Campan and Pascal Lgitimus play characters of the same name who couldn't have been more different and it's precisely their different backgrounds that make their interactions so hilarious while the heart of the film relies on their common denominator a mother.Didier is a security guard in a clothes store and a womanizer living with a traditionalist family because he has no other alternative he endures both their bigotry and pressure to marry their prude and dull daughter. Bernard is a halftime detergentdemonstrator and 'arts film' actor the closest to the definition of a loser. Finally Pascal is the most successful one he's your typical yuppie who works in a Marketing agency where everyone wears ponytails to imitate the boss the confident and towering Mr Steven Berndard Farcy although he likes to be called Steven since he doesn't believe in bossing which doesn't prevent him for firing when necessary using convincing metaphors to justify it.The diversity of their background is not just used in the setup but establishes their personalities with a real depth. Bernard is the gentle bum displaying the same kindness he probably used to depend on. Didier is unconsciously affected by the racism of his host. Pascal the selfmade man treats people with an arrogance proportional to his bootlicking at work. The three men often express xenophobic or racist remarks but this is only a facade to hide their own insecurities. Today one of the three men would have been gay and another a struggling artist Bernard Didier and Pascal are respectively worker unemployed salaried like only Les Inconnus could have portrayed average men expressing average ideas a credit to the realism of the screenplay.The trio first meets in an attorney office where they learn that their mother passed away two years ago and left a significant fortune of three million francs for each one million translated into the film's catchphrase cent patates 10 racks. The money doesn't unite them anyway each one decides to take a different path Bernard buys himself a 1957 Chrysler Didier who met an old girlfriend decides to take her to a trip and Pascal brags on having won money through speculation. The story really picks up in one of the film's funniest scenes when the poor attorney must explain that the heritage can't transpire because of a technical problem regarding the delay. The film echoes one of the group's most famous sketches about professional jargon hermetical languages but the comedy works because the three men still think of the money and their evolution from disbelief to sheer anger is simply brilliant.The incident leads to a chain of events that would cause their downfall Didier drinks so heavily he's immediately chased away from his family Bernard helps him to recover after an acid trip. And Pascal who earlier took pride of being the only one who remained stoic pays the highest price of his cockiness during a friendly dinner at home with Steven his wife and a subordinate a dinner that must conclude with Pascal's acceptance to invest his money on the company. The film reaches its pinnacle when two drunk Bernard and Didier go to Pascal's home and ruin the pleasant evening. The film never gets funnier after that but the peak of hilarity is so high we forgive them. Didier returns to his ex' home and find her son alone in the stairs the son is sixyears old coincidentally the same span of time since their breakup and then the film turns into a Three Men with a baby remake but with many funny situations to come despite some syrupy moments.The film is one of the most quotable of French cinema although many gags would be lost in translation nonetheless no one can't resist to some props that became part of French popculture from the misunderstood modern sculpture everyone takes for a coat rack or the famous Whiteman's monochrome a white painting that has no price. The Three Brothers is French popular cinema at its best and even the most serious and intellectual magazines praised the relative solidity of the story probably satisfied that the film didn't fall in an abundance of grimaces or noisy jokes that became too common in French comedy.The film won a Csar for Best First Work while the screenplay and Didier Bourdon's acting also deserved some nods. It's a great comedy the kid is so cute and believable he almost steals the show and if the script gets a bit preachy near the end it's immediately redeemed by some hilarious gags.On a last note I'm sure the same film made today would have benefited from the same buzz and Internet campaign that ensured weaker comedies to break new records";

It's a pity that they often ham it up. The screenplay is a bit of a mess and I am under the impression that it's a pretext for a succession of sketches where they are talking about leading subjects nowadays unemployement immigration etc.... Due to a big number of these sketches the film never seem to end. Moreover the secondary and minors actors are bad used. On one hand they are left to themselves like the notary on the other hand they're falling into the caricature like Rougemont who is the man who puts Didier Latour up or the racist bailiff. I also noticed that most of the actors were talking very fastly and so it was difficult to understand them. Nevertheless the film is often funny thanks to the dialogues and the comical situations but they aren't deprived of vulgarity.

	schema:reviewBody "I went into A Perfect Murder expecting to enjoy it but I recognised the fact that I wouldn't be in for a great film. To be honest I love thrillers like this as they offer a solid two hours or so of nontoo taxing entertainment and what's not to like about that? A Perfect Murder is an update of the Hitchcock classic 'Dial M For Murder' and while the film doesn't touch Hitchcock's in terms of how thrilling it is this update has been well handled and despite losing things such as the claustrophobia and the tight plot A Perfect Murder still does what you'd expect it to do. The plot has become more expansive for this update but the filmmakers have still managed to keep it tight so that the plot is focused mainly on the characters as opposed to the actual crime. The plot follows a rich man Michael Douglas who discovers that his trophy wife Gweneth Paltrow is having an affair with an artist Viggo Mortensen. When his business affairs start to go awry he decides to commit the perfect murder so that he can inherit his wife's trust fund. However as all of us Hitchcock fans know there's no such thing as the perfect murder.Michael Douglas was the absolute perfect choice for this role. He may get typecast as the slimy businessman often but he does it so well! You can really believe that he wants to kill his wife. Gweneth Paltrow who is often solid but never outstanding and Viggo Mortensen who is actually a good actor join him and make up the threepiece central cast. Mortensen's performance here isn't awesome but it's good and hints at the sort of stuff that would be to come  such as a great turn in David Cronenberg's A History of Violence. Like most nineties thrillers this one is very stylishly shot and there's a focus on the more steamy elements of the story. The locations used aptly convey the groups within society that the characters belong to and the film does a good job of setting its scenes. The central set piece is well executed and the build up to it is well done also but it has to be said that the film starts to fall apart a little after that. Still A Perfect Murder never becomes boring and even during it's down time the film still manages to be thrilling. As mentioned this isn't as great as Hitchcock's version  but as modern remakes go  this certainly isn't a bad one and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.".

	schema:headline " Starts promisingly...falls apart in the final third";
	schema:reviewBody "It may be more credible to cite Psycho or Vertigo as your favourite Hitchcock but my particular preference has always been Dial M for Murder. Sure it's dated far more than a lot of Hitch's films but it's still a tightly written and intelligent movie Ray Milland playing a gentlemanly yet murderous businessman who plots to have his wife killed when he discovers she's having an affair and plans to leave him.A Perfect Murder the 1998 remake is a very different beast with different motivations and some major changes to how the plot plays out. This time it's Michael Douglas whose wife Gwyneth Paltrow is playing away from home but in a move from the source material it's her excon lover who is hired to do the murder.Despite this deviation the machinations of the murder plot from the original film are nearidentical. A phone call home a missing key the supposed disturbed robbery the wouldbe killer killed in selfdefence...that's all Dial M. And because of this the first third of the film bounces along at a great pace.Into Act 2 and things are still promising with the introduction of David Suchet as the investigating detective. Suchet is a wonderful actor and his first scene holds much potential and evokes memories of John Williams's memorable turn as Detective Hubbard in Dial M. Suchet's Detective Karaman seems smart as a tack and asks awkward questions of our protagonists.

While it's fun to watch Douglas worm his way out of things by repeatedly changing his story it all leads to a frankly barmy climax where the bodies start to pile up.I guess A Perfect Murder is more interested in its characters than the tightly woven plot of Dial M but the original film had charm that this sorely lacks. While Dial M may not seem realistic in its characters' motivations or the generally breezy tone it's by far the better movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "It may be more credible to cite Psycho or Vertigo as your favourite Hitchcock but my particular preference has always been Dial M for Murder. Sure it's dated far more than a lot of Hitch's films but it's still a tightly written and intelligent movie Ray Milland playing a gentlemanly yet murderous businessman who plots to have his wife killed when he discovers she's having an affair and plans to leave him.A Perfect Murder the 1998 remake is a very different beast with different motivations and some major changes to how the plot plays out. This time it's Michael Douglas whose wife Gwyneth Paltrow is playing away from home but in a move from the source material it's her excon lover who is hired to do the murder.Despite this deviation the machinations of the murder plot from the original film are nearidentical. A phone call home a missing key the supposed disturbed robbery the wouldbe killer killed in selfdefence...that's all Dial M. And because of this the first third of the film bounces along at a great pace.Into Act 2 and things are still promising with the introduction of David Suchet as the investigating detective. Suchet is a wonderful actor and his first scene holds much potential and evokes memories of John Williams's memorable turn as Detective Hubbard in Dial M. Suchet's Detective Karaman seems smart as a tack and asks awkward questions of our protagonists. And then inexplicably the character all but vanishes from the movie without doing any further detecting. In fact the big reveal of the murder is actually just down to the wife simply snooping through her husband's clumsilyhidden evidence rather than anyone actually pursuing a line of enquiry.As a result the final third is really just our three main characters lying and and cheating.

Given a fairly involved script and an action film never mind the dialogue just cut quickly to the next scene shooting scheme Davis has concocted a mainstream thriller that works quite well. A Perfect Murder is based on a middle rated Hitchcock film which was in turn based on a hit Broadway play called Dial M For Murder. Steven Taylor Michael Douglas in part revisiting Wall Street's Gordon Gecko is in financial strife and decides to knock Emily his wife off to grab her money. She's played by the hapless Gwyneth Paltrow. Hubby blackmails his wife's lover Viggo Mortensen to do the dirty deed. This film is ferociously mainstream. The music chimes in just so. The bathrobe disappears just so. Michael Douglas plays Michael Douglas to perfection Paltrow is protected from any line more than fifteen words long but still A Perfect Murder is never boring. The original Hitchcock version starred Ray Miland and Grace Kelly. There weren't any mobile phones and the wife wasn't screwing the killer. And then there was Grace Kelly rather than Gwyneth Paltrow in that old  film. I know who I'd prefer.".

I'll list just a few as examples. I would encourage you read on so you may save your money and go rent Hitchcock's original instead. SPOILERS AHEAD1. David was just a con artist so what made Steven think he could be turned into a hired killer?. Sure enough it didn't work did it?2. In fact David as a con artist was much more likely to try blackmail. Sure enough David tapped the incriminating conversation. Now that he had the tape he could easily get 400K or even more from Steven. So why bother to kill or contract out some thug to kill Emily at all?? This is totally ABSURD. David just wanted to con some money and get out of town as he always did with no incentive to kill his lover at this stage.3. When detective Karaman mentioned the missing key Emily said nothing and went into Latino slum and tried to play detective herself. It just does not make any sense. Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance. Moreover she and Karaman clearly developed a sense of mutual trust so she logically would show Karaman the missing key and let him do the investigation after all he's a police.4. The explanation Steven tried to spin on Emily about the missing key did not make sense at all. He claimed he took the key put it on Emily's key chain and jammed the door lock because he thought the thug was David getting in with Emily's key and he tried to protect Emily's reputation. Then he claimed the thug turned out to be just a burglar. Well if that thug did not use Emily's key and did not pick the lock how on earth he got in??5...I did find one quote to be ironically hilarious. When they met at the ferry Steven told David that they should wait and carry on business as usual. When Steven started to walk away David asked with a deadpan face Should I continue screw your wife?".

	schema:reviewBody "Definite Spoilers Ahead. Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet and want to be surprised.My biggest question  why do directorsproducers think viewers are stupid? Maybe most people just sit back and enjoy the ride...but why spend so much time and money to make a beautifullooking movie like this populated with some fairly good actors and based on a good classic story if you don't care enough about the story to employ a thoughtful writer or two? Anyway...this movie has too many plot holes to count but here are the most glaring in my opinion.Why would Emily leave a comfortable hot bath to answer the phone? In such a lushly appointed apartment it's hard to believe it doesn't have an answering system or builtin voice mail. And even if it doen't there's been no sign that it's going to ring an annoyingly long time when Emily starts moving to answer it.Why was Steven so easily dismissed as a suspect  just because he was on the phone during the attack? Of course he didn't commit the attack  the attacker is DEAD. His having an alibi for the time of the attack does not clear him of arranging it. If he was even considered for a moment he wasn't a suspect for committing the attack but for planning it...and his alibi doesn't clear him of that.Steven was so careful about so many parts of his perfect murder plan  why would he so sloppily toss the cell phone out of his car on his way from the poker game? If it were found which it never was apparently the fact that it was on his return route would be pretty incriminating. There are plenty of places like the East River to toss something.It's obvious the dead man lived in a very scary neighborhood Emily visits and it's pretty dangerous looking  so we're supposed to believe the killer only used one key and had one lock on his door? I live in a nice part of New York and there are four locks between the apartment and the outside world  but Emily was able to get into that apartment with just one key. Doubtful.When Steven confronts Emily it becomes a complication that there's something at the artist's loft connecting him to them her wedding ring. Steven says he'll go get it. WHY does it matter if that connection exists? There are obviously many others they can't do anything about  like the negatives to the photos he's just shown her money that he's confessed to paying the artist at least one of her friends who knows about the affair. And he's supposedly a blackmailer so wouldn't one assume he has some hidden proof? Why does it matter that the ring is in the loft? Surely no matter what Steven and Emily don't think they're going to be able to pretend Emily never had an affair with David!?When Steve hands over money in Washington Square Park David tells him the tape is a commemerative copy  there's been no guarantee that we've heard at least that there's no other copy of the tape. Who would assume that was the only copy??? And of course we soon learn it wasn't.If your husband tried to have you killed and you had the proof the tape would you confront him even with a gun in your pocket or get the heck out and go to the police? Of course David was recording the murder plot when Steven laid it out at his own apartment. Why wouldn't he? If Steven was such a good planner why would he not shake down David to make sure he didn't have a tape recorder? It would be in character not to trust him.Argh! I want back the time I wasted watching this thing....".

If he was even considered for a moment he wasn't a suspect for committing the attack but for planning it...and his alibi doesn't clear him of that.Steven was so careful about so many parts of his perfect murder plan  why would he so sloppily toss the cell phone out of his car on his way from the poker game? If it were found which it never was apparently the fact that it was on his return route would be pretty incriminating. There are plenty of places like the East River to toss something.It's obvious the dead man lived in a very scary neighborhood Emily visits and it's pretty dangerous looking  so we're supposed to believe the killer only used one key and had one lock on his door? I live in a nice part of New York and there are four locks between the apartment and the outside world  but Emily was able to get into that apartment with just one key. Doubtful.When Steven confronts Emily it becomes a complication that there's something at the artist's loft connecting him to them her wedding ring. Steven says he'll go get it. WHY does it matter if that connection exists? There are obviously many others they can't do anything about  like the negatives to the photos he's just shown her money that he's confessed to paying the artist at least one of her friends who knows about the affair. And he's supposedly a blackmailer so wouldn't one assume he has some hidden proof? Why does it matter that the ring is in the loft? Surely no matter what Steven and Emily don't think they're going to be able to pretend Emily never had an affair with David!?When Steve hands over money in Washington Square Park David tells him the tape is a commemerative copy  there's been no guarantee that we've heard at least that there's no other copy of the tape. Who would assume that was the only copy??? And of course we soon learn it wasn't.If your husband tried to have you killed and you had the proof the tape would you confront him even with a gun in your pocket or get the heck out and go to the police? Of course David was recording the murder plot when Steven laid it out at his own apartment. Why wouldn't he? If Steven was such a good planner why would he not shake down David to make sure he didn't have a tape recorder? It would be in character not to trust him.Argh! I want back the time I wasted watching this thing....";

They look magnificent mainly the apartment of the the two leads. I was constantly awed by how good this film looks.I also prefer the sequel because it has more twists and is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy every 34 years. Also fun are the short speeches each character gives on occasion usually when they smugly think they have the upper hand. Each time that happens their antagonist winds up going one up on them! There isn't much action in here but when it occurs it's very intense.I've viewed this movie four times and the only thing that annoys me  unfortunately it's a big one  is the ending in which I don't believe justice totally prevailed. I can't wrote much more without spoiling it for those who have not seen this. One of the parties comes out looking like a 'an innocent victim and that person was hardly a saint. If all the parties had received just due it would have been more satisfying and I would have rated this a 10 for how entertaining it is to watch.".

Emily has been having an affair with small time conman  artist David Shaw Viggo Mortensen Steven has found out about the affair  being in severe financial trouble decides to take advantage of the situation  blackmails David into murdering Emily together they devise a perfect murder but the plan goes awry  Emily survives the attempted murder. The police become involved  one lie after another gets Steven deeper into trouble  Emily starts to suspect that he may have had something to do with her attempted murder...Directed by Andrew Davis  based on Frederick Knotts stage play Dial M for Murder this was intended as a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder 1954 which itself was based on the play as a decent murder mystery suspense thriller A Perfect Murder isn't perfect but it's still a worthwhile film if you have the patience. The film follows the basic story of the Hitchcock original quite closely with a few changes the man Emily is having an affair with  the man Steven hires to kill here are morphed into one character now rather than being separate the police involvement is far less in A Perfect Murder  the most significant difference comes at the climax where there's no police sting  there's more of a dramatic ending involving guns. Othewise the two films are very similar with Emily killing her potential killer Steven trying to cover things up the police suspecting him  switched flat keys becoming a major clue  the basic motivation remains good old fashioned money. The character's are good here Steven played by Michael Douglas is a cunning cool  calm man who comes across as ruthless  clever Emily doesn't feel like she has a hundred million dollars to be honest but even though she's meant to be the victim she started the whole thing off by having an affair  David the small time conman appears to be in it for the money even though the script never really makes it clear if he loved Emily or not. At almost an hour  fifty minutes I wasn't bored by it as it's fairly gripping  tense with some nice twists  turns although I could see why many might find it a bit slow  uneventful but I personally didn't have any problem getting into it as I like a good murder mystery.Another major change between the Hitchcock version  this is that it switches the location from a posh London in the 50's to a wealthy contemporary New York the change doesn't affect things much though. The Hitchcock original was filmed at a more innocent time so expectedly A Perfect Murder increases the profanity the violence the blood the body count  there's even a tastefully done love scene. The title A Perfect Murder is actually a quote from the original Dial M for Murder. Nowhere near as staged enclosed or limited as the original there's more backstory to the character's  more happens even though the two are basically more or less the same film.Filmed in New York the production values are lavish  it's well made the only thing that dates it is that old style mobile phone noone would be seen dead using these days. The acting is excellent from a great cast Michael Douglas is great as the scheming cold blooded husband Gwyneth Paltrow show's just enough vulnerability to be believable  sympathetic Viggo Mortensen plays it broadly  you never quite know whether he would prefer the money or the girl while David Suchet is wasted in a very small role.A Perfect Murder is a really good suspense thriller with great performances  a good plot I wouldn't say it's better than than the original Dial M for Murder but I wouldn't say it's worse either.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Perfect Murder is an admirable attempt to remake Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder an excellent but often overlooked work. Michael Douglas Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen all produce solid performances this film is limited by its plot. The screenwriters were faced with the unenviable task of attempting to improve an immensely clever and complex script. Dial M deserves credit as a great thriller because of the layers in the plot which require the viewer to think. These layers in the Hitchcock version are absent in Andrew Davis' version. Davis adds a new twist of his own but it is not enough to make up for the missing elements of the original story. Finally John Williams steals the show in Dial M with his outstanding performance as the inspector. David Suchet whose portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the Agatha Christie film series models Williams' inspector is given no such opportunity to shine in this film. All in all A Perfect Murder is a decent film but does not fall anywhere near the original.".

Immediately there is a certain tense in it when Michael Douglas pops up a few times and you're wondering if he knows his wife has a new lover. After that the movie goes in a faster pace and reaches very high levels. At that time I was amazed about the script. It was really magnificent. Every time I got really surprised with totally unexpected things happening. Nothing wrong until now.Then finally the film makes a crucial mistake regarding the end. The end of every movie is one of the most important things A part that can make or break a movie. Well in this case the end totally breaks  ruins the movie.WARNING SPOILERI thought the movie ended when Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow the married couple planned a dinner Douglas went to the shower and they would live happily ever after without Paltrow finding out that her husband Douglas did plan to murder her and with him being relieved that nobody knows what the hell he did and the fact that his wife Paltrow is devoted to him again.But then it was a shock for me that the movie continued for several minutes in which Paltrow finds the tape with the evidence that Douglas planned the whole murder attempt. Then she kills him after some stupid fight between them.The end degrades the movie. Without the end I would have rated it 9 out of 10 but sadly it has this end so I rate it a 7 out of 10 and it suddenly isnt one of my alltime favorites.What an end can do ......".

	schema:reviewBody "This stylish 90's thriller about a love triangle that turns murderous was based on Frederick Knott's play Dial M For Murder which was also the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's movie of the same name. Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay updates the action relocates it from London to New York and features enough plot twists to keep most viewers fully engaged throughout. The interactions between the characters at the centre of the story involve a toxic mixture of jealousy lust deception and blackmail which inevitably adds to the tensions which exist between them right from the very start.Steven Taylor Michael Douglas is a wealthy Wall Street trader with an unfaithful wife and an investment portfolio which is losing its value so fast that financial ruin seems to be a certainty. In order to deal with these problems he meticulously devises a complex and seemingly perfect plan to murder his wife so that he can solve his financial problems when he inherits his share of her 100 million fortune.Steven's wife Emily Gwyneth Paltrow has for some time been having an affair with a struggling artist called David Shaw Viggo Mortensen who Steven visits at his loft studio. Having already researched David's background and discovered that he's actually an exconvict with a track record of being involved in scams in which rich women were his victims Steven blackmails him into carrying out the planned murder for 500000 in cash.When things don't work out as planned Steven moves quickly to cover up what's happened David tries to blackmail Steven because he has some incriminating evidence of his involvement in the murder plot and Emily gradually starts to realise what her husband's been attempting to do.One of the strengths of this movie is the brilliant casting as Michael Douglas is perfect as the cold and ruthless Steven Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Emily's natural elegance refinement and vulnerability convincingly and Viggo Mortensen looks suitably bohemian and at various times shows the mild amusement that David derives from what he does. These three characters all have their secrets as Emily doesn't tell Steven about her affair he doesn't tell her about his financial problems and David doesn't mention his multiple identities his criminal record or his background as a con artist.A Perfect Murder isn't as stagy or as claustrophobic as Hitchcock's movie and the new elements which have been added really work well and make the plot more interesting. A wonderfully moody atmosphere is created and maintained throughout the film and some of the remarks made by the characters make a great impact. Examples of this are when Steven and Emily both say at different times what if there were no tomorrow? and that's not happiness to see me is it?.It's easy to see why A Perfect Murder was such a commercial success because it's actually a great deal more than just a simple remake of a well known movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps but i can think this for sure this is the funniest comedy ever made not only in Italy. I can tell this having seen dozens of comedies from all over the world and Vieni avanti cretino ranks far better than such hits as Clerks or Dumb  Dumber which i've really appreciated. The story itself is quite simple but the characters especially Pasquale Baudaffi  i.e. Lino Banfi make this an unmissable film. The scenes it is composed of have been replayed in various situations and often they are a significant part of every comicactor baggage. As i said the best characterization is the one by Lino Banfi but Gigi Reder the famous Rag. Filini from the Fantozzi saga is almost as astonishing as Banfi. There is also a small role played by the unforgettable Moana Pozzi the best female pornstar of all times plus the addition of various Italian sexystars of the 80's Michela Miti above all. Explaining this films with few words would be as difficult as summarizing the entire Divine Comedy Vieni avanti cretino! could be considered the Divine Comedy of the comedy films indeed  in two lines. Perhaps an English translation of the incredible dialogues could turn in a loss of efficacy but that should be overwhelmed by the strong pathos which any actor casts in hisher role. Strongly recommended with particular regards for the dentist scene and also for the Coliseum scene not to mention the breathtaking scene of the famous Dr. Thomas!!!".

With a traitor in their midst and the systematic depletion of transport equipment and rations the camels fitted with poisoned needles are being killed off! the prince is forced to capitulate and subsequently held captive in an Arab fortress. However the resourceful Strogoff organizes a wild rescue attempt  hes to infiltrate the prison armed with explosives and at his signal the Russian forces deployed outside the city walls will charge needless to say the ruse pays off  signaling Strogoffs triumph and supplying the requisite action climax to the film.By the end of it the prince is humbledwhile Capucine discovers that her love for Jurgens is stronger than her loathing of the Russians the viewpoint is a romanticized one then but one hardly expected otherwise from a product designed for mass consumption as this clearly was!

They leave it and discover the world of sumo where fat people like them are honored and appreciated. Through sumo they are connecting to themselves and to their fat body each one in his own way. Herzl an obese guy starts to work as a dish washer in a Japanese restaurant in Israel. Herzl is exposed to the world of Sumo through Kitano the restaurant manager who was a Sumo coach in Japan and escaped to Israel after he got involved with the Yakuza. Herzl falls in love with the Sumo world and wants Kitano to be the Sumo coach of his obese friends that gave up their diet. My Own Private Sumo is a movie about the coming out of the closet of fat people and about their ability to accept their fatness and relate to their body through the world of sumo.";

	schema:reviewBody "For some of us it's at times an uphill battle with the bulge. Some blame it on lifestyle others on physiology while some become resigned to genetics. I suppose it's not only a concern with females going into a fluster when additional weight is gained but males as well as we wake up one fine day and discover that our six packs have merged into one singular blob. The choice is clear  do something about it  hitting the gym at least  or continue to indulge in our current lifestyle of choice. For me the latter is quite evident.It's easy to label Israeli movie A Matter of Size as just another fat movie where comedy comes naturally from the meanness in poking fun at another's huge waistline. A lot of comedies are guilty of this to the point that they become grossly offensive. This film thankfully shyed away from offending though it still came with plenty of pot calling the kettle black at times the characters themselves mirroring some of us where we utter insensitive comments without a clue on the damage and hurt they will cause.Written and directed by Sharon Maymon and Erez Tadmor the duo had crafted an endearing tale about selfidentity and the challenge to always be comfortable with oneself in mind and body. It's easy to cheer someone on in doing what seems to be natural for us but one heck of a mountain to climb for the other. For Herzl Itzik Cohen being part of a fitness club is sheer torture for his lack of results and constant ridicule from the trainer who thinks that it is in her arsenal to insult Herzl into becoming thin again.Facing discrimination everywhere from home and to the workplace he chances upon Sumo wrestling when he got a job washing dishes at a Japanese restaurant and realizes that one can still gain respect and admiration despite being fat. He gathers a few close but skeptical friends who share his similarities in girth and thus begin their journey into sumo training but what they're about to gain is not just techniques in wrestling but some important lessons about life itself where it is always convenient to put the blame when things don't go right onto their physical exteriors or someone else yet always failing to look at what's lacking inside and coming to terms with it.There's a little bit of everything in the film from comedy to romance friendship relationship and the likes that will keep you engaged throughout. Itzik Cohen is extremely charismatic as he chews up the screen with his presence and I'm not referring to physical size here. The cast did an admirable job in bringing some realism into their sumo moves their 3 months training paid off and carried off their individual arcs convincingly especially Itzik's counterpart Aharon Dvir Benedek who can shuffle between having the meanest mouth amongst the group and arguably their greatest critic with his mean streak and prepping the way of being the roadblock to Herzl's chance for success at a tournament.Maymon and Tadmor steered clear of having the group's reluctant instructor Mr Kitano Togo Igawa as a caricature or a homage to Mr Miyagi with his waxonwaxoff nonsense. Kitano doesn't spout fortune cookie words of wisdom or has some trickery move up his sleeve to impart and despite that tough man demeanour and violent back story is also capable of an encouraging funny line or two.What I had enjoyed about the film is how it subtly reminds us to be who we are and not look down upon ourselves just because we are different from the expected norm. In fact it is this uniqueness that we can harness to becoming something special and so long as we are true to ourselves success in some way will come measured by a personal yardstick and not that which is imposed by society. I like this film and it's highly recommended.It's currently sold out for the festival given its great word of mouth from festivals and being nominated for every award in the Israeli equivalent of their Oscars but fret not as this should soon be coming to a theatre near you as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Only now I got to see 'A Matter of Size' or 'Big Story' Sipur Gadol as the original title in Hebrew goes a film that surprised both the international and Israeli audiences a couple of years ago. International audiences were surprised as they seem to be any time a film from Israel deals with subjects that are not related to the IsraeliArab conflict to war or terrorism or their consequences. There was also however a surprise in this film for the Israeli audiences as well. Those who came to see the routine comedy that this film promised to be taken into account the background where it happens and the actors were surprised to watch more delicate subjects of personal identity and courage of assuming it being dealt with in a light and spirited manner. The result is not bad and the mild success that the film enjoyed was in my opinion deserved.The heroes of the film all come from the lower class environment of a city which can be described as central in location and peripheral as social status in today's Israel. Herzl acted by bigeyed Itzik Cohen his girlfriend Zehava Irit Kaplan and his friends all fight an oversize problem which places them into the class of pariahs in a world obsessed by diets as their weight places them out of the criteria of aesthetics and social acceptance. To some extent overweight is in the film directed by Sharon Maymon and Erez Tadmor a symbol for all the other inequities of gender origin or social nature that make people different which is a normal thing but can also lead to discrimination which must be fought. The fight is however not so much with the outer world but merely with the inner personality of the heroes. The physical disadvantage is turned into an opportunity when Herzl and his friends discover that the traditional Japanese sport of sumo can earn them respectability but as they soon learn sumo is not only about being fat it is also about proving strength of character and endurance in face of adversity. The tools of personal success or even survival are the same in any context.The film does not take itself too much in serious and this is both a quality  as it stays pleasant to watch and can be enjoyed by practically any audience  but also a weak point as it cannot avoid some of the expected clichs of the feelgood movies.Taking upon the sport of sumo in a country that is the opposite of Japan from so many points of view is a comedy subject by itself and there are a few spectacular moments of comedy with the big fat men running in their red sumo panties in the city or on the roads but the authors were so proud of them that they repeated them three times. Besides the lead roles Dvir Benedek gives a good performance and so does Togo Igawa as sumo master Kitano a homage name? who comes to Israel  for Zionist reasons. It's overall a movie that is nice to watch for everybody and with enough substance to make even the more sophisticated viewer unable to be sorry for the time spent watching it.".

Most importantly it puts Israel and Isarelis into a normal perspective and does the same for the problem of obesity. It puts a new spin on it that will stay with the viewer and will positively affect hisher attitude towards nonmainstream people. The incorporation of Japanese nonJewish characters into the film is interesting. It creates further food for thought about all kinds of relationships not only between Jews and Gentiles but also between men and women gays and heterosexuals parents and grown children prisoners and wardens and all this of course through the main thinfat dichotomy that dominates the thinking of the main characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bound By Honor BBH is not meant to legitimize or glorify gang life or ennoble Latino culture. It simply tells a story that faithfully paraphrases harsh reality. If you don't get the story then it's easy to lambaste the acting and directing. If you do get the story then the acting and directing are good enough.Many of the film's characters are people we know Cruz full of verve and potential a victim of the needle his father a working class Chicano who wanted better for his sons Miklo the freshfaced wellintentioned misfit driven inexorably to a life of brutality Paco the handsome athlete rescued from ruin by the Marine Corp Juanito the mocoso of the family whom everybody wanted to protect from the perils of the barrio tragically cut down nonetheless Miklo's mom a party girl illprepared to be a mother Miklo's aunt  strong and responsible  called on to be a mother to her sister's son.The prison scenes and subplot are quite visceral. Some people find them laughable or unbelievable but I find them to be neither. Some liberties were taken but for the most part I thought prison gangs corruption killings rape parole boards and trade were depicted quite well.There are also universal themes The meanings of home and family hard but honest work versus a life of crime the fickle consequences of youthful foolishness striking down some while letting others pass unfulfilled hopes and other hopes fulfilled in unexpected ways a family torn apart by tragedy with only time to heal the wound the struggle to right one's ship generational gaps bridged only by maturity that comes in the wake of mistakes the constant questioning of oneself.It would have been nice to see more character development of women in the family and some of the actors should have worked on their accents and delivery a little more. Still I highly recommend this film to anybody in search of a story like the one it tells. To those who don't feel particularly strongly about the material covered I'd say BBH is no worse than almost any recent big budget film. But to those inclined to greet the underlying story with folded arms and a dismissive grin or snort I'd say spend your three hours watching something else. My verdict 9 of 10 stars.Now I'll address some points raised by those who say the film is garbage.1 It was too long. It was long yes but there's very little I'd have left on the editing room floor. I think if one finds the subject material interesting then the film moves along nicely despite its length. Also I think it's hilarious that so many people who despise the film actually watched the whole darn thing! Any flick that keeps you watching for 3 hours can't be too bad.2 Damian Chapa is too white to play a Latino. First people who say this misunderstand what it means to be Latino and second they miss an important subplot. Chapa is a Spanish surname and if Damian Chapa is Latino then by definition he's not too white to play one. Latinos of mixed ethnicity are not some Hollywood phantasm and the treatment of mixed ethnicity and Americanization is a recurring theme in Latino culture in the USA. In the film Chapa's character is of mixed ethnicity and as such constantly has to prove he is Raza in a way that his peers never do. This constant challenge to his identity makes him fearless and quick to the draw lest those whose approval he seeks question the make of his blood. For example that's why he is the one to first confront Tres Puntos not his fellow Vatos Locos. In a culture where fair hair skin and eyes are at times a liability he proved his worth by the only measure his peers valued.3 The acting was over the top. Some of the acting that seems over the top is actually not. Gang members quickly learn to communicate by force of will. Also they are not generally educated or refined and in their own parlance one word can mean many things. So the frequent displays of machismo are not necessarily bad acting and hearing ese and carnal repeated over and over is not necessarily bad directing and the convicts' corny oneliners are not meant to be the witty banter of NPR... but yeah the film could have been toned down a little in some places.4 It wasn't true to the time period. Critics said the same thing about Doctor Zhivago but a good film transcends that and I believe BBH does. The film covered from 1970 to 1985 and I had no problem with the settings. Whatever time period mistakes were made weren't bad enough to distract me from the film.5 BBH is a cheap ripoff of American Me AM. I saw BBH before I saw AM so I wasn't predisposed to dismiss BBH as a knockoff. I think AM is depressing and clinical whereas BBH is uplifting and colorful. Both films cover the same reality and so of course will overlap at points. The same can be said of films about the Vietnam War or the Old West except that because there are relatively few films about Latinos the comparison of these two is inevitable. AM is more polished but BBH is more riveting probably because BBH makes you care about its characters more. If AM is a sad docudrama with all the loose ends tied up then BBH is an emotional roller coaster with many questions unanswerable and others simply left unanswered.".

What a travesty for a start that it had not made a bigger mark at the box office and had been consigned to a cheap basket! I'm sure if released with more fanfare this time it would reach the audience it deserves! It is a story of rival gangs family love betrayal loyalty acceptance  every film clich you could think of.It thoroughly explores the destiny of its 3 young stars as they struggle to make their way with the life path they have taken. I won't give away the plot as I believe anyway who truly loves films should see this film in its full glory with no knowledge of the plot or how the film eventually plays out.I have been reading the postings and many negative comments have been made about this film but I believe this film stands up to much of its unfair criticism.I will admit though that I did squirm at some of Miklo's earlier expressions in the film but a 34 of the way through he really picks up the baton and completely takes over. In fact he is a revelation.There are some cheesy bits of dialogue but I don't think this takes away from the piece in any way.It is a long film but it needed to be. I don't think there are ANY scenes they could have done without  it is very effective just the way it is.Anybody who has seen it and didn't like it first time round I employ you to rent itbuy it again and give it another try.I purchased another copy of it again just a few days ago. I watched it yesterday and was still moved  as if it was the first time I saw it.Its definitely TOP TEN best film material! MUST SEE!".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the real life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca Bound By Honor covers two decades in the latter half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of half brothers Benjamin Bratt and Jesse Borrego and their cousin Damian Chapa. Growing up more or less together all three start out as gang bangers but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.Bratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt's first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.Bound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it's a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn't flag for a minute.Hackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads. You get to care about what is to become of them what destiny has in store.There are certain similarities between Bound By Honor and the Edward James Olmos film American Me. Personally I give a slight edge to this one don't miss it if it is broadcast.".

However it also addresses something I haven't seen before in a movie of this type and something that was perfectly illustrated unintentionally by some of the unfavorable reviews posted here.  I'm referring to the character of Miklos and how stereotypes within his own community about what is Latin contribute to the person he becomes.  There have been a few reviewers here who feel that the character of Miklos was not believable as Latino as he was too white looking.  As I understand that was exactly the point.  He was always having to prove himself as 'more latin than thou' because of his fair skin.  Somehow being 'more latin than thou' became akin to being a hardest of the hard gang member. I think that was the most compelling idea out of the movie because that sort of thing happens quite often.  Many Latinos subscribe to the stereotype that all latinos are a sort of medium brown.  Forgetting that Latino is not a race.  It refers to ethnicity.  You can be of any race and still be Latino. Those who don't fit into the stereotype of appearance sometimes try to find another way to 'be more Latin' and become susceptible to other more insidious stereotypes. I've known my fair share of blue eyed blond Miklos who felt compelled to prove their Latinness by being a thug. So despite what has to be a record usage of the word ese I found this movie a worthy viewing due to the addressing of this topic.".

Therefore it has adopted the familiar course of amateurs and that is to add everything in the story without giving it a balance and counter balance. There is no editorial overview of how to shape material within a reasonable time period. It is also very very long ...Anna Karenina is long but that was by Tolstoy and he has some claim to be one of the greatest writers of all time.Fourthly the actors oh well and the report card is depressing. Basically two modes of action. The leads are all generally terrible especially Mr Chapa whose performance might be compared to a guard dog with distemper. Such monotony should not be viewed in a feature film.As with anything that that exemplifies all that is detritus in film making there are so many other things to mention but space precludes a fuller list of its faults. The music for instance with its deliberate sentimental Spanish guitar style in the few quiet moments showed all the artistic intelligence of a fast food restaurant franchise.Almost anything on earth is better than wasting the time that is this dreadful waste of one's own too short life.".

There is great diversity in the quality of acting and dialog and it could have been at least a half hour shorter. But the bottom line is I sat and watched a 3hour movie on a Saturday morning  very unusual for me  and it kept me involved the entire time.";

I find that the real depth of the story is far beyond just that. This is a movie about acceptance the need to fit in the struggles of belonging to a minority prison gangs pride family and the way different people get shaped with time and circumstance. When you start this movie you can not imagine how far it will go and how the different characters evolve and the acting is great all the actors picked fit perfectly their roles.There is so much in this movie that I wont go into details but to briefly explain the story revolves around three cousins who are all completely different but bound by blood. They all seem to be going on a certain path which becomes radically changed early in the movie when their paths diverge dramatically. Its along these paths that you get a glimpse of society at those times of hardships of unfair circumstances and of survival.This is really a great movie one of my all time favourites. I have watched it probably more than 10 times and will continue to watch it again and again. Enjoy! 910".

In my opinion this adds to the 'real feel' of the movie and is one of it's strong points the casting that is. Even Damian Chapa isn't bad in this movie he usually is think Street Fighter... Or U.S. Seals 2 S and I must praise him for his work. Both stars and supporting actors performed magnificently.But in my opinion the real credit should go to the writer and the director who made such interesting and real topics in to an engaging 3hour long drama that manages to captivate it's audience.

	schema:reviewBody "Dracula's Daughter is a trailblazer in many respects. It's the earliest film I can think of that features a truly sympathetic vampire protagonist. It's also the earliest mainstream film that I'm aware of with such a strong lesbian subtext. Actually it's not even a sub text it's plain as day! As you might expect these rather surprising elements make it a highly memorable viewing experience  perhaps even more memorable than its predecessor Lugosi's Dracula which is basically just a truncated version of Bram Stoker's novel.Unfortunately Dracula's Daughter misses the mark of greatness that it probably deserves. The film is only about an hour and ten minutes long so there isn't sufficient time to fully develop Countess Zaleska the title character. And it's extremely frustrating that the first fifteen minutes or so are basically squandered on a lot of painfully unfunny business involving two comedy constables. The humor has aged really really badly unless you somehow find it convulsively hilarious when one of the constables reacts to every strange and dramatic happening around him by saying oooh... I tend to complain that modernday horror features too much dumb comedy that hurts its credibility but Dracula's Daughter is living proof that studios were injecting silly rubbish into otherwise good horror material as long as seventy years ago! The serious parts of the film work well however. Countess Zaleska and her faithful servant Sandor have some interesting exchanges about the loneliness of immortality and the darkness of the vampire's universe. The scene when Zaleska burns her father's body is also very moody and dramatic. How does one get a job like Sandor's anyway? Don't you think it would be fun to play personal servant to a glamorous female vampire? No? Maybe it's just me then. If the film has another flaw aside from the comedy it's the human protagonist Dr. Garth. Otto Kruger plays the character as stubborn and really rather abrupt. He'll spew a few lines of psychobabble at the countess then charge out of the room and leave his job with her halfdone at best. A more attentive psychiatrist might perhaps have made for a more sympathetic and proactive hero. As it is he's basically just an irritating presence who distracts us from the villains who are infinitely more interesting and more worthy of our time.".

If the film has another flaw aside from the comedy it's the human protagonist Dr. Garth. Otto Kruger plays the character as stubborn and really rather abrupt. He'll spew a few lines of psychobabble at the countess then charge out of the room and leave his job with her halfdone at best. A more attentive psychiatrist might perhaps have made for a more sympathetic and proactive hero. As it is he's basically just an irritating presence who distracts us from the villains who are infinitely more interesting and more worthy of our time.";

	schema:reviewBody "After years and years of being a Universal horror fan I finally see Dracula's Daughter. What an interesting and haunting film it istoo. It's way ahead of the curve in portraying a vampire that wants to escape its cursed existence. The daughter of the title longs to live as a real woman but must answer the call of her blood. Is she really a blood relation to Count Dracula or merely a past victim who was especially close to him? Beginning exactly where Todd Browning's Dracula left off years earlier we see Prof. van Helsing arrested for murder when he is found in the vicinity of Dracula's stakedout body. The dullwitted police commissioner believes van Helsing is either a lunatic or a liar but respects his scientific credentials enough to keep him out of jail. Van Helsing seeks the aid of his old student psychiatrist Jeffrey Garth to prove his innocence.Meanwhile in a truly unusual scene the body of Count Dracula is stolen from a pair of bumbling policemen by Countess Marya Zaleska and her pale sinister servant Sandor. The undead Countess merely wants to give Dracula a dignified cremation by fire. His torment is over but Marya's lingers. She is struggling mightily to resist the call to vampirism but Sandor seems to encourage his mistress to enjoy her bloody deeds.Through a tangled web of fate Prof. Garth and Countess Zaleska become entwined. The Countess begs the psychiatrist to give her the willpower to escape her obsession...meanwhile Garth is becoming uneasily aware of Marya's link to several vampirelike murders that have occurred in town. Most tellingly he notes that her apartment does not have a single mirror...a sure sign of a vampire according to Van Helsing.It all ends in Transylvania as the forces of good and evil collide once more.Gloria Holden is striking as Dracula's Daughter. Her exotic Slavic looks and wide hypnotic eyes make it easy to believe she is more than merely human. She has a tragic aura to her but when she seduces a young girl to become a victim she also seems repellent.The real monster of the movie is Sandor who seems to be manipulating Marya for his own evil ends. Irving Pichel later became a director of some repute but here he is a scary foreboding presence with his ominous bass voice deathly pale skin and Russian garb. Sandor's relationship with Marya is truly unique as he talks to her as an equal not a servant.Otto Kruger is great as Jeffrey Garth a man of reason and wit who is thrust into the twilight world of the undead. Kruger was a very underrated actor who should have been more wellknown. His sarcastic romantic sniping with his sexy and uppity secretary comes across just as well as his more serious dialogs with van Helsing and Marya. He's a refreshing change from the usual David Manners type hero in the old Universals.It's a real treat to see Edward van Sloan return in the role of Dr. van Helsing. Calm rational and collected in his thoughts he is a contrast to the unholy creatures he duels with. ONe wonders if van Helsing would be sympathetic to Countess Zaleska...or if he would be hellbent on her destruction. Never do we hear van Sloan's van Helsing voice any understanding or sympathy for the vampires he stalks.There's some odd comic moments...the two nitwit bobbies at the beginning in particular stick out like a sore thumb...and director Lambert Hillyer's vision of Transylvania seems more like a clichd Germany but Dracula's Daughter dares to be different from its more famous predecessor and in so doing emerges as a bit of a classic itself.".

The supporting cast is filled with stalwarts of the genre first and foremost naturally is Edward Van Sloan who reprises his seminal Van Helsing characterization as if he had never been away Billy Bevan Halliwell Hobbes and E.E.

Nan Grey later female lead of THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS 1940 appears briefly as one of Dracula's victims in what remains perhaps the film's most discussed scene due to its lesbian overtones.

	schema:reviewBody "Being intimately familiar with modern day horror sequels I expected this granddaddy Grandmomma? of horror sequels to follow the same routine complete and total retread of the original's material with a significant drop in quality a la Chainsaw Massacre. But to my surprise these early horror sequels while not as good as the originals had admirable ambition and originality especially compared to today's horror sequels. While Dracula was the tale of a man cursed to immortality fueled by a bloodlust and ultimately ignoring any moral convictions in his continued survival Dracula's Daughter follows a more tragic tale of his vampyric offspring afraid of both ending her existence and of continuing that existence. Bela Lugosi's Dracula while the villain had a high level of sympathy due to his otherwordly charisma and the charm of that film was the duality of wanting him to be stopped . . . and wanting to see him succeed. Immortality proved a curse. He's not necessarily evil he's not exactly on the hero's path either but you can't help but like the count. Dracula's Daughter admirably draws a sharp contrast to that film giving the title character a genuine desire to overcome her cursed heritage. She's not evil. She's not the protagonist . . . but she wants to be and is trying to be. This sets up an interesting game as the fates play for Marya's future. On one hand a servant seeking the infamous curse constantly pushes towards giving up these pure pursuits and taking the path of her father while another character does genuinely try helping her with sadly an insufficient understanding of her real problem. It does provoke a number of questions worth exploring. I wondered if Von Helsing would try to destroy Marya before learning her intentions if the characters would try to help her and if they couldn't help her find a way to tolerate her blood lust?I guess it's appropriate that Dracula's Daughter can never escape the shadow of her father. Lugosi and Browning will forever come first in the minds of audiences before Holden and Hillyer. Even with that said I still like Dracula's Daughter for finding its own identity and not retreading the film that came before it.Modern horror sequels have neither a thought nor a question. Modern horror sequels are nothing more than empty shadows of their predecessors. I find it interesting that this was not always the case.".

In spite of the five year span between films minus all the principle players from the earlier film only Edward Van Sloan reprises his role as Professor Van Helsing the role he originated from the 1927 stage production that featured Bela Lugosi. The leading romantic characters of Mina Seward and John Harker are gone and not seen nor mentioned again. The story opens in a gloomy mansion in England where police officials arrive to find a dead body of a Mr. Renfield and the body of Count Dracula in a coffin with a stake pressed through his heart as committed by Professor Van Helsing.

Since there wasn't much of a market for female movie monsters Holden's career in this genre was thus short lived. She appeared in other movies but this is possibly the one film that showcases her best leaving some lasting appeal to her character.

Gloria Holden is a very captivating presence as the illfated Countess Zaleska wanting release from her vampirism but ultimately after a few murders realizing there is no breaking free from her eternal blood lust.Getting back to one of the murders what a sight it was to see Countess Zaleska's attack on the girl Lili. Considering how stringent censorship was when the film was made I'm a bit surprised that a scene with such a homoerotic undercurrent was left in the movie. And with Joseph Breen to contend with it makes me wonder what the filmmakers might've originally had in mind if the mighty Breen consented to this girlongirl attack being left in the film.".

This film is famous for the supposed lesbian seduction by Countess ZaleskaGloria Holdentoward LilyNan Grey. Obviously this was a big deal in 1936 when the movie was made. I really liked the part of SandorIrving Pichel. He's every bit as sinister as Bela Lugosi in Dracula. The film does move slowly in some parts but otherwise moves along nicely. The castle scenes were good and I really enjoyed the part where Countess Zaleska burns Dracula's body in a ritual to remove her curse of vampirism. Of course Sandor wouldn't allow it and sabotages her efforts to break free of her curse. Otto Kruger as Dr.Garth was well acted. Edward Van Sloan returns as Dr.Van Helsing who is arrested for killing Dracula at the start of the film. I would suggest this movie for all vampire movie fans. This one is a keeper for your horror collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "Right after the success of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein sequel to Frankenstein also directed by Whale Universal Studios decided to make a sequel to their other horror classic film Tod Browning's Dracula. Story says that the studio chose Whale again for the project but his script proved to be too outrageous and subversive that was immediately rejected. It would be Garret Fort writer of the first Dracula who would give flesh to the sequel's screenplay and the experienced director Lambert Hillyer was set to direct it. Like Bride this sequel would be focused on a feminine version of the previous monster it's name Dracula's Daughter.The film starts right after the original ends with Count Dracula killed by Professor Van Helsing Edward Van Sloan however to his misfortune he is arrested for the murder of the Transylvanian nobleman and sent to prison as nobody believes he killed an ancient vampire. Realizing that nobody will believe him Van Helsing asks the help of his dear friend Dr. Jeffrey Garth Otto Kruger a former student of his who has become a prominent psychiatrist. While this events happen a mysterious woman steals Dracula's body and a new series of murders start complicating Van Helsing's defense and Garth's investigation. To make things worse Countess Marya Zaleska Gloria Holden arrives and her seductive charms will prove too strong for Garth to resist them.Unlike Frankenstein where there was still material in the source novel to build up a sequel in Dracula's case things get complicated as the monster is effectively killed at the end. However Garret Fort builds up an original story of mystery horror and even nods to screwball comedy. Dracula's Daughter's themes of betrayal deception and the quest for redemption are dark indeed but Fort manages to add some lighthearted moments that break the suspense in an appropriate manner. Another highlight is that the vampire's sex appeal is enhanced and explored even further than posterior sequels of the nowfranchise.Director Lambert Hillyer had a big experience directing many lowbudget films ranging from westerns to crime dramas so he was used to work with similar budget constrains. The movie's strength is in its story and Hillyer knew it so he keeps a simple yet very effective style that while nothing too impressive manages to create the perfect atmosphere for the plot. With nothing more than his well assembled cast and Fort's excellent screenplay he conceives a film that maybe won't be remembered as influential but will surely tell its story properly and deliver what it promises.The cast is vital in this film as their job is what sets apart the film from other Universal sequels. Otto Kruger is a very good lead actor with nice looks and an ease for this kind of characters. He has great chemistry with both Gloria Holden and Marguerite Churchill and his performance is one of the film's highlights. Holden portrays the seductive Countess with power and grace in a complicated role as her character is at the same time dominated by a strong sex appeal and a sad and tragic fate. Churchill is superb in her comedy role and more than mere comic relief she adds the touch of screwball comedy to the film giving her energy and charm. And finally Edward Van Sloan returns as the experienced Van Helsing and while his role here is more as a spiritual guide to Kruger he gives another fine performance.The film's main weakness is without a doubt its lowbudget that not only forced the choice of Hillyer as a director but it also made it have less production values than other sequels. In a way this may had been of help as Hillyer's style bends together perfectly with lowbudget projects and also gave the film a look closer to crime melodrama which was rising in popularity at the time. Sure Bela Lugosi is definitely missed but Dracula's Daughter makes up for his absence with a witty and bold for its time screenplay and a wellassembled cast.Time has left this film unappreciated but there is a lot in there to praise and while nowhere near the best of the Classic Universal Horror films Dracula's Daughter is better than many of the films of its time and an essential viewing for any fan of Gothic horror. 710".

Now Countess Zeleska believes that Jeffrey can heal her and release her from her blood thirsty and she wants to bring him to her castle to spend the eternal life with her in Transylvania.Dracula's Daughter is a great vampire movie with the dramatic story of a vampire woman that wishes to be free from the curse of her father Dracula.

	schema:reviewBody "Dracula's Daughter begins right where Tod Browning's Dracula left off and ironically sees vampire slayer Van Helsing in trouble with the law for the murder of Count Dracula. This follow up doesn't have the same quality feel about it that the original had and it seems clear that this was always meant to be very much a 'B' movie picture. But at the same time its lots of fun to watch and the fact that it begins straight after the ending of the Bela Lugosi film ensures that it's credible as far as Universal's series is concerned and that fact will also give many fans of the original film a good reason to see it. The plot starts properly when a young woman turns up at the police station wanting to know if Count Dracula really is dead. We then follow her as she tries to undo her family curse aided by psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Garth. However around the same time that this is going on corpses begin appearing around London and jailed Van Helsing is convinced that vampires are roaming the streets of London again.Unfortunately this follow up doesn't feature the bloodsucking demon of the first film and as the title suggests follows his daughter instead. Gloria Holden excels in the title role as the daughter of Dracula. She's seductively sexy and has a definite air of understated evil about her at the same time. The rest of the support cast back her up excellently and while nobody other than the title character is a real standout the ensemble comes together nicely. Atmosphere is obviously a big thing here and director Lambert Hillyer does a great job of photographing the locations and ensures that the film benefits from a malevolent aura at all times. The story is obviously nowhere near as great as the original which was based on the novel by Bram Stoker but it's good enough. Writing a followup to Dracula can't be easy and while the plot isn't too engaging it's always at least interesting. There's an underscore of black humour hanging around just behind the central plot and overall I would say this is a worthy sequel although it's not a patch on the original film.".

In fact the only direct link to it is the character of Van Helsing played once more by Edward Van Sloan.The film starts off exactly where the earlier one finished with Van Helsing just having driven a stake through the count's heart. But here the confusion starts  for some reason the police are on the scene immediately yet none of the other characters from the earlier film Harker Mina Dr Seward etc are anywhere to be seen. Van Helsing finds himself on a murder charge but at no point are these other characters mentioned as potential witnesses who could back up his story nor is there any investigation by the police as to who Dracula was I'd have thought a 500yearold Transylvanian would take a lot of effort to identify. The police don't seem the slightest bit suspicious as to what the count was doing lying in a coffin in the basement of an old abbey!Enter Dracula's daughter! Yes we never quite get to find out any more about her origins only that she too is a vampire. But here's the twist  she doesn't like her vampire lifestyle. She steals Dracula's body and burns it hoping it will cure her but it doesn't. So then she turns to a psychiatrist who by sheer coincidence is Van Helsing's best friend and his one defence witness even though he had nothing to do with the events of the first film. Ms Dracula or Countess Zaleska as she calls herself hopes the psychiatrist played by Otto Kruger can cure her. Initially he's sympathetic but when he finds out she's the one responsible for the recent deaths he is determined to put a stop to things. Unfortunately the countess has kidnapped his girlfriend and taken her to back to Transylvania in the hope of luring him there so she can make him a vampire and live with him eternally.Despite some promising ideas it's all a bit of a mishmash really. The policemen are comic bumblers with cockney accents even though they're supposed to be from Whitby  which is nowhere near London a mistake the original film made. What IS that thing they see moving under the soil in the room where they keep Dracula's body? We never find out for sure. Why is Van Helsing's trial just forgotten about? Even if the body has gone missing the police knew there was one there and Van Helsing had already confessed. Where was the Countess before Dracula died and why aren't we told more about her origins? I'd like to have known more about her relationship with her servant Sandor the film's only creepy character played by Irving Pichel. It is said in passing that she has promised him eternal life as though that explains everything but it raises many more questions. Why is he more use to her as a mortal?The ending is also confused. We see Sandor shoot the countess with an arrow  did he shoot her deliberately in an act of jealousy or was he aiming for Otto Kruger and missed? Its not made clear.The film's worst crimes are making light of the characters' feelings. If the countess played by Gloria Holdenhates being a vampire so much we should see a lot more of her internal struggle we should see her crave blood a lot more and then be more emotionally distraught after her cravings have been satisfied. And the sexual chemistry between Holden and Kruger is just about nonexistent when this is another important part of the plot that should have been emphasised more.All in all though the film deserves much credit for offering something different to the original film not many sequels manage that. This is far more of a character play than a monster movie. I mean how many vampire movies omit such things as crucifixes wolfsbane bats wolves and fangs?".

Marvelous sets of foggy streets and dreary old buildings contrast with luxurious modern apartments and trimotor aeroplanes as Dracula's daughter adapts well to the modern world of 1930's London.The story keeps getting more complicated and fascinating as the Countess falls in love with Garth much to the displeasure of her sinister servant Sandor Irving Pichel and Janet. A great scene has Garth by now almost certain that Countess Zaleska is the vampire responsible for the recent deaths warning her to stay in London. When he leaves the room for a moment she looks after him and says in a soft but emotional voice I'll leave...and you're coming with me! There are so many great scenes and wonderful moments in this movie crammed into a short running time that those viewers who haven't seen it owe it to themselves to seek it out. One priceless bit has Garth refusing to ask for help tying his bow tie and Janet deliberately tying it crooked. Then when visiting the Countess in her apartment he fiddles with the tie and looks around and remarks that it's the first woman's flat he's ever seen that didn't have at least a dozen mirrors. The Countess looks nervous for a moment but then jokes that she's glad he's not Van Helsing who would attach an occult significance to the lack of mirrors in her place. It's the kind of in joke that characterizes this movie. This is truly a gem of Thirties movie making and an intriguing addition to Dracula lore.".

The two strands finally meet and intertwine.  The movie has some rather obvious shortcomings.  One is Otto Kruger whom is irritating as one reviewer earlier stated.  He is lacklustre and pompous in a very hollow way. The film also lacks a credible story line and is given in to the temptation of assuming a great deal from the viewer.  However Dracula's Daughter still is a very enjoyable film. It has wonderful atmosphere grand setsparticularly when in Translyvania and a good performance from Holden as the lead and Van Sloan in a reprise of his role as the good doctor Van Helsing.  Above all it has a wonderfully eerie disturbing and macabre performance from Irving Pinchel as the servant of the female vampire.

Countess Zeleska yearns to be free of her bloodlust so she can lead a normal life.  As she roams the fog shrouded streets of London in search of victims it becomes increasingly apparent just what a lonely woman she is.Irving Pichel is superb as the vampire's servant Sandor.  Sandor is an evil and calculating man who knows long before the Countess realizes it herself that there is no release from a vampire's desire to take the blood of the living.  He taunts her without mercy when her piano playing culminates with a melody which reflects her unearthly existence.Otto Kruger gives an irritating performance as the distinquished psychiatrist Dr. Jeffrey Garth.  Garth is smug and egotistical and fails miserably both as a doctor and a man in scene after scene.  At one point he encourages Countess Zaleska to put herself to a test then walks out on her at the pivotal moment when she is prepared to take the test.  His visit to her was in a professional capacity so he should not have left to see another patient upon receiving a phone call.  It could also be argued that Garth caused the death of a beautiful young girl who is bitten by the Countess by subjecting her to a demanding psychological procedure. Garth's arrogance is apparent in Transylvania when he persuades a coach driver to take him to Borgo Pass for five pounds and assures the man he'll be safe because he's going to sit with him.  This is a serious flaw in the film's plot because the script allows Garth to brush off the dangers of vampires in Transylvania and makes complete fools out of the peasants at the inn who have feared the Draculas for many years.  However the complex triangle involving the Countess Sandor and Garth is the strength of the film and make it well worth watching.".

Obviously Dracula could not return without some interesting explanation but you cannot have a sequel without at least one returning character. Well I guess you could. It has been done. But you should not! Mike Mayo says the film is at best half successful and Howard Maxford says it is half hearted while praising the lesbian overtones. Indeed it has not had the success of Dracula or even other horror sequels such as Bride of Frankenstein. The casual horror fan probably does not know the film exists and will likely never see it. It is largely forgettable with some good acting from Nan Grey and Marguerite Churchill two actresses who disappeared in the 1940s.Do I recommend you see it? In short it is not necessary but completists should be sure to catch it. It is an instant play on Netflix so set aside a free hour and check this one off your list.".

It is largely forgettable with some good acting from Nan Grey and Marguerite Churchill two actresses who disappeared in the 1940s.Do I recommend you see it? In short it is not necessary but completists should be sure to catch it. It is an instant play on Netflix so set aside a free hour and check this one off your list.";

To be honest if it weren't for the environment in this movie I wouldn't care that much for the plot because it's very simple and dated for today's standards even though Bram Stoker's novel is excellent and has served for many spinoffs.

Clint Eastwood is a by the book and honest city detective not an easy thing to be in Kansas City of that era. Burt Reynolds is a former cop who's now a roguish private eye.

For his troubles Roundtree winds up dead and in the same tradition of Sam Spade when your partner's killed you do something about it.But it's also Eastwood's homicide case and like it or not the two are forced into an alliance of inconvenience kicking and screaming right up to the end of the picture. The plot also calls for rescuing Alexander who Eastwood fancies Madeline Kahn who's Burt's girlfriend and chanteuse Irene Cara.City Heat is not at the top of the list of films by Eastwood and Reynolds. But they've got nothing to be ashamed of here. The film glides effortlessly from comedy to drama and both guys get their innings to show why they're the superstars they are.

	schema:reviewBody "Like the old saying goes bigger is not always better. Apparently sticking two actors with the highest star power was not the best idea for City Heat. It's not a bad idea but it's not a great one. There are SOME good moments in this movie but there is a lot missing. Because of this the bad outweighs the good by far which can make this a frustrating film to watch. We know this much Mike Murphy Burt Reynolds and Lieutenant Speer Clint Eastwood are acquaintances on some level. In what way  we're never really told. That's already one step in the wrong direction. If you're making a buddy cop movie you have to give some kind of background of the main characters. Otherwise the viewer will have no clue why the two characters are at odds half the time. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what Reynold's character was up to. Every time the screen shifted to Eastwood I finally caught up with what was happening. I'm not really sure how but that was one of the frustrating parts about this movie. It was like Reynold's was there only for fluff and laughs. I'll admit Reynold's did make me laugh at times but it was just for that specific moment. Clint Eastwood also has funny parts. Just like any Eastwood movie he has his own way of doing things and he does that in this movie too. But these occurrences didn't really change my opinion of this movie although I wish it had.To make things even more awkward was that this film barely had a soundtrack. I mean even the silliest of soundtracks sound better than nothing. There were times where I was watching action sequences in this movie where I only heard a biff or baff and an occasional gunshot. Music can change the whole feeling of a certain scene and without it I felt like I was watching anything very exciting. I was bored with it. Even when it comes to the most stupid action scenes in a movie there was at least music to back it up. There was almost nothing here. I felt that there was nothing to be excited about. I was just watching a film with no emotion. That is really nerve racking for me. I need to feel something while watching a movie. City Heat just never took off for me and it is truly unfortunate. I was expecting a lot more.City Heat is just another buddy cop movie with no real life in its characters. The action scenes can be boring with no music in the background and its characters are short of laughs due to the sloppy screenplay.".

I mean even the silliest of soundtracks sound better than nothing. There were times where I was watching action sequences in this movie where I only heard a biff or baff and an occasional gunshot. Music can change the whole feeling of a certain scene and without it I felt like I was watching anything very exciting. I was bored with it. Even when it comes to the most stupid action scenes in a movie there was at least music to back it up. There was almost nothing here. I felt that there was nothing to be excited about. I was just watching a film with no emotion. That is really nerve racking for me. I need to feel something while watching a movie. City Heat just never took off for me and it is truly unfortunate. I was expecting a lot more.City Heat is just another buddy cop movie with no real life in its characters. The action scenes can be boring with no music in the background and its characters are short of laughs due to the sloppy screenplay.";

Unfortunately it's no masterpiece or close to being in the upper echelon's of each actor's respective works. But that doesn't make it a bad film.A change of director saw Blake Edwards replaced by Richard Benjamin after Eastwood and Edwards ahem couldn't see eye to eye so that immediately put the film on the back foot in many critic's eyes. Ironically Benjamin does OK  working from Edwards' script there's a whole bunch of back stories and tittletattle assigned to this film if you care to search for it. Lots of fun here though as Clint and Burt one a cop the other an excop turned PI reluctantly team up to cut a swathe through the gangsters ruling the roost in prohibition era Kansas City.Eastwood does his straight backed machismo act throwing awesome punches along the way while Reynolds is wonderfully cheerful as a tough guy who all things considered would rather not get hurt! The script is full of zingers delivered with customary sardonic self parody by the stars while the roll call of supporting actors is not to be sniffed at. Period detail is high end with Nick McLean's photography carrying the requisite neonoir impact while the music tracking is pleasingly nostalgic.It's over the top of course and needlessly convoluted as per its yearning to be noirish yet if you can cut back your expectation levels? And you can simply enjoy the sight of Eastwood and Reynolds having fun romping in this period? Then you just might enjoy this more than you dared to believe. 710".

While this is going on Lieutenant Speer also investigates but when the two collide there are some fireworks as they have a work history together. But they have to put their differences aside if they are going to get the job done.Should I call this a disappointment because the effortlessly shallow material just doesn't go handtohand with the talent that was involved. This parody  drama on noir and toughguy images is no more than a vehicle for the two stars who just seem to be slumming it out here. It's not a bad film because it's well made but the story doesn't entirely hit any strides it changes direction between spoof and drama with mixed results and it can be quite tedious in spots. All the accolades though would have to go to the delightfully smooth Burt Reynolds in the role as the charismatic smartguy detective Murphy. His presence definitely overshadows Eastwood. But the colourful banter and always at odds attitude between the two makes it a fun pairing up to watch as they work off each rather nicely. Clint Eastwood plays the straightfaced nobull Lieutenant Speer with his usual approach and sly humour. They both get some highly witty topnotch lines. The supporting cast are satisfactory with the likes of Rip Torn Jane Alexander Irene Cara Richard Roundtree and Robert Davi dusting in with a skew of personalities. While they're worth better material they all do the best with what they're given to work with. The feel of the 1930's has an artificial air about it here as clearly you can't escape the backlot sets. But still it's professionally catered for with a pleasant blues score and a dour colour scheme crafted in to get that glum wet atmospheric night buildup of Kansas City. The direction of Richard Benjamin is quite standard but it has some neat photography techniques of the period and a few flashy impulses like one fine and exciting latenight shootout in a deserted street.Nothing much out of the ordinary and very forgettable but only the fans of two stars should really bother with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "City Heat is a movie that should have been something special. When made back in 1984 it seemed like a great idea of having two of Hollywood's biggest moneymaking actors back then Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds starring together in an actioncomedy that takes place during the 1930s. But something went wrong early on during the production. Blake Edwards wrote the script and was slated to direct. But Edwards walked off this movie to direct Dudley Moore in Micki  Maude and former actor Richard Benjamin came on to take over the directing duties. BIG MISTAKE!!! Even though Edwards still got screenplay credit under the pseudonym Sam O. Brown changes were made in the script and City Heat ended up a mess. What a shame! I can still remember Chicago film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert blasting this movie when it came out. Ebert gave it 12 and Siskel gave it no stars. The movie opened back in early December 1984 and two other big movies opened that same week Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop and the 2001 sequel 2010. Back then when Siskel and Ebert were doing their movie review show At the Movies this was before their show went nationwide as Siskel  Ebert they would have a skunk on the show to talk about the stinker of the week honoring the worst movie that they reviewed that week. City Heat won the honor over Beverly Hills Cop and 2010 as the stinker of the week. That's major criticism considering the presence of two big superstars. Now I didn't think City Heat was that bad but it's bad. To me this was a big disappointment. Eastwood plays a cop Reynolds a private eye. Former partners who now don't get along they're forced to team up to erase crime from the streets of 1930s Kansas City. Eastwood and Reynolds come off O.K. as this odd couple of crimebusters but they should have been better. At least they come off better than they're supporting cast. The supporting actors from Jane Alexander to Madeline Kahn to Irene Cara to Rip Torn are all wasted not making much of an impression. Another thing that bothered me about City Heat is that it has a phony feeling throughout. It feels like this movie was shot on a movie set instead of real outdoor scenery. That makes the movie unrealistic. Plus the fight scenes and all the glass breakage is totally laughable. I laughed every time I heard glass breaking during the fight scenes. City Heat is an asinine crime comedy that I think would have worked if Edwards had directed it. Roger Ebert made a memorable take on City Heat saying quote Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds are stuck in one of the biggest bombs of the year an incomprehensible mess disguised as a period gangster picture. It's a mess alright. Though my rating is a little higher than Ebert's because I felt that some of the action scenes have punch. But that's not saying much. City Heat was so bad to most people that this was the first and last time Eastwood and Reynolds starred in a movie together. Blake Edwards had a good movie on his hands but Richard Benjamin came on to mess it up.12 out of four".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember a lot of people not just me being disappointed in this film. With Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood in the starring roles we all excepted a really entertaining good movie. All the publicity made us even more anxious to see it. Well it never lived up to the hype. I don't know anyone who left the theater satisfied when this was over.This points out an important fact screen writing is more important than the cast. You can have two charismatic actors as we have here who are big boxoffice draws but if the script stinks the movie is going to be a flop. I don't blame Reynolds or Eastwood. They didn't write this story which is dismal makes no sense in a few parts disjointed and simply is not entertaining. It's pretty hard to have two stars a good premise the 1930s as a backdrop and still have a unlikeable movie! To be fair part of the problem was the expectation. It obviously was too high for this film which didn't deliver to meet everyone's high expectations. Maybe if you've never seen and keep your expectations low you'll enjoy it. And  if for no other reason  it's still interesting to see those guys star in the same film.".

	schema:headline " A Complete Disaster";
	schema:reviewBody "City Heat 1984 12 out of 4 Horrendous film about a cop Clint Eastwood and private eye Burt Reynolds who are investigating the same case. Turns out a man Richard Roundtree was trying to blackmail some mob boys but soon he's dead and it's up to our two superstars to crack the case. If you ever need proof that superstars aren't as important as a good screenplay then here it is. Apparently Blake Edwards was set to direct this movie but got fired sometime during the filming as he couldn't agree with the two stars on what this film should be. Perhaps this is the reason the movie is such a mess but whatever the reason it's doubtful you'll see a worst movie with Eastwood. Sometimes when you go into a movie with low expectations you find yourself enjoying it on a few levels but that wasn't the case here. Everything in this movie is horrid but the biggest problem I had is that I could never figure out what the hell I was watching. At times the tone is so serious that you think you're watching an actual thriller. At other times the material is so over the top that you feel as if you're watching some type of spoof. With Eastwood and Reynolds you appear to be getting a buddy picture yet they're hardly on screen together and when they are it isn't for too long. This is a really confusing movie in terms of its tone but perhaps Edwards was going for the spoof got fired and the replacement director went for something more serious. Whatever happened the final result is a complete disaster and without question a major embarrassment. There's no denying that Reynolds was making some poor selections here and this is yet another. He seems really out of place here and gives a rather awkward performance that never gets the laughs he's going for. You somewhat would expect him to pick out a bad screenplay but for the life of me I can't understand how Eastwood would get involved in something like this. This material is without question the worst I've seen from him and it's hard to believe he'd sign on for something like this. He sleepwalks through the entire film and can't give it a bit of energy. Jane Alexander Madeline Kahn and Rip Torn are all bland as well and Roundtree doesn't get to do much before getting knocked off. The film takes place in the 30s so we get all the old fashioned cars and outfits and while this is pretty on the eyes there wasn't a single frame where I actually felt like we were in the 30s. It's hard to find any direction here as each scene is just off the wall and comes off looking extremely tired and there's no energy to be found anywhere. As horrid as this movie is at the same time it's almost easy to recommend just so people can see how badly a movie can be even with strong talent. This is the type of film that makes you scratch your head and wonder what they were thinking but I'd love to hear Eastwood try to put a spin on this.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title is a little bit strange considering that most of the scenes were filmed at night and there's not enough scenes involving fire or explosions. But it is a very underrated actioncomedy film where two opposites policeman have to join forces to combat killers and gangsters. Sounds like Rush Hour and Lethal Weapon and it is quite similar in its humor but City Heat story happens in the 1930's. Detectives Speer Clint Eastwood and Mike Murphy Burt Reynolds were very good friends but the lack of discipline and a certain involvement with bad companies from the part of Murphy made these two guys not get along very well. Relax this is not a so serious movie their fights are quite funny. If Mike is getting beat up by tough guys and he asks for help Speer won't help except if one of these guys spill his drink. But they need each other again when one of Mike's business partner Richard Roundtree is killed after doing a risky business betraying his former associate. In the middle of all this there's plenty of mob godfathers played by Tony LoBianco and Rip Torn looking for something that Mike's partner hide.The whole plot is confusing and there's not enough space for incredible action scenes but at least writer Blake Edwards made a very funny movie. Not only the fights between Eastwood and Reynolds are good but it was included funny female characters too. Jane Alexander plays Addy the smart and lovable Mike's secretary and Speer's love interest and Madeline Kahn plays Mike's love interest a very rich woman. The problem with the villains is that they're not scary or funny they just know how to disturb the peace of the main characters. Some of the shooting scenes and fight scenes are very absurd. A long shooting on the street with no one hitting no one these guys needed a good training before being contracted by the mafia. Clint appears and shoot everybody. There's a fight scene in the beginning with Burt and two other guys many punches in the face and no one is hurt no blood appears nothing. That was kind of lousy to see. Nothing original to see but it worths to see anyway. Reynolds and Eastwood were good partners in this film and a sequel could be good but unfortunately this wasn't a hit back in the 1980's. It's not as bad as critics and some people say it has many funny moments Eastwood is so serious that it's actually funny he has great punchlines here and the art direction is very careful and well made. 910".

There's supposed to be a contrast between them but not one so strong that they both think they're in different genres.

What attracted me to this movie though is the 1920's gangster plot line this is something that I quite like though they never seem to turn out how I expected. In these movies one expects to see gun fight with tommy guns cement shoes speakeasies and gangs at war with each other. This movie has it but the action as seems to be in a lot of Clint Eastwood movies is a bit slow.Clint Eastwood's character is not the main character rather it is an excop come gumshoe private detective named Murphy. Eastwood plays Murphy's expartner and there seems to be quite a bit of animosity between them. This is the typical personality test that puts together people with opposing personalities and these two character's personalities are definitely opposed right to the point where they will start shooting at each other. Murphy is quite extroverted and loud while Eastwood is his usual quiet and calm self.The movie was alright but not really all that gripping especially how I decided to stop it and go to sleep. The action was slow and the plot was also quite slow. They kept the flavour of the era and it was reasonably easy to see what was going on. Unfortunuately this means that there is little intrigue and when there is little intrigue then something else is needed to fill the space. There wasn't much in this movie that did this. There were gunfights but even these were slow and tedious to watch. To me City Heat is a movie to see once and forget.".

And when it comes from a writer  director who has the good name of Blake Edwards then you have to expect a sweet comedy a delicious cartoon feel and some wicked parody too. But this script never saw the light fully because the man quitted the project quickly and after a while he changed his name on the credits to Sam O. Brown ??!! It is Edwards's only time to do such a thing during a great career of more than 40 movies and TV shows he wrote ! Clint Eastwood was a big star at the moment. And he was chosen to costar the movie with the era's other star and maybe his competitor Burt Reynols. Though Eastwood who achieved some success since 1971 as a director wanted to make this movie a something of his own as if a Dirty Harry in the 1930s with artsy melancholic sense. You read matters like how he forced the director to put his eyes always in shadows like it's a remake of The Third Man or something! Let alone that he insisted on the typical serious Eastwood's image in a movie that maybe was designed to mock at this very image as a cold blooded super violent good guy. To understand the original spoofdriven nature of the movie just look at the massive street fight where Eastwood's character attacked the entire gang singlehandedly to destroy all of them it's the usual Eastwood's action however designed as a hurlyburly livecartoon sketch. I bet that was Edwards' idea as one of his gifted extravaganzas or what remained of it here anyway !Therefore when you observe the name of Joseph Stinson who wrote Sudden Impact  1983 the previous hit of Eastwood next to the name of the departed Edwards along with your feeling sometimes that Eastwood's scenes seem so Eastwood's you'll easily understand that it's not quite a coincidence ! By the way back then this Eastwood's slight narcissism was hardly noticed but within no time it would be more than tangible especially when he wouldn't act unless in movies directed by him or  at least  directed by his friends like Buddy Van Horn who directed The Dead Pool  1988 and Pink Cadillac  1989 for him. So that kind of Eastwood by Eastwood condition which would have him completely later left its early bad effects on this poor movie !Burt Reynolds broke his jaw while he was shooting his first scene the first scene of the movie also then he got too many medicines along with painkillers hence the lively star lost 20 KG in no time and maybe they changed some parts in the script to handle that carefully. So if you doubted that the one who was moving in a wolf disguise was no Reynolds then you were probably right !Now we have 3 scripts or 3 ways to make one movie or 3 unfinished movies that must be all in one by director Richard Benjamin. But actually        ?!! WAW!! this could be unexpectedly the right formula of success the secret code of a box office hit or another classic. However it turned out to be a petty concurrent mishmash !The final result was at best one of the violent buddycop movies of the 1980s yet running in the 1930s and being less enjoyable than its likes. Despite some action comedy and little funny lines the script looked so disassembled Eastwood's comedy looked fabricated and tasteless the time that the 2 stars shared on screen was less than 15 minutes and then there was that scene where Reynolds was talking about the greatness and the difficulty of being a cop like we're in a serious movie or wannabe one! Basically we didn't even know the reason why Reynolds's character left the force and turned into detective !!I think that the movie's last line is the fairest review it can get  You'll always be shorty to me as it failed in fulfilling its main promise concerning 2 great icons in one hot action comedy or making anything perfect anyway. It's simply a case of a movie with too short of everything !".

	schema:reviewBody "January 2002. Alaa el Aswani's first novel Omaret Yacoubian is published. Within a few months it has taken the Egyptian book world by Storm. And it's easy to know why. The book is almost exclusively about the 3 taboos in the Arab literature Politics Sex Hetero and Homo and Religion.Fast forward to June 2006. Unless you've been living on another planet for the past 2 years or so you must've heard of the movie adaptation of the book. Seriously it was nearly impossible to escape the following headlines Yacoubian is the biggest Egyptian film of alltime De Niro says the film is a masterpiece Yacoubian gets huge raves at Cannes etc... In my opinion that was one of the film's biggest problems the filmmakers set the bar too high for themselves. So I walked in expecting to see a breakthrough in filmmaking. What I got was a great although flawed film. So I was somewhat disappointed.I didn't like Wahid Hamed's adaptation of the book. The spirit of the novel is there and the film is much more humorous but unfortunately that was it. Maybe because Hamed had to fit the script so that the bigger stars get the bigger parts all the secondary characters Soaad Dawlat Malaak etc... ended up with almost no screen time. Therefore these characters came off as 2 dimensional and their actions didn't make a lot of sense. For example in the book Soaad is almost a beggar. She constantly asks her friends and relatives for money. In the film she's a middle class secretary. That's why I never understood why she would agree to be separated from her own son and marry an older man just for some cash. Another example would be how someone came out of nowhere to kill off one of the main characters.Director Marawan Hamed did a great job. Yacoubian is his first fulllength feature but he helmed it like a veteran. His camera moved smoothly his cuts were all in the right places and he shined in the largescale protest training and shootout scenes. I'm really looking forward to his next picture.Adel Emam Zaki el Dessouky was amazing. His turn his best in ages was funny yet heartfelt. Khaled Saleh Kamal el Fouli and Khaled el Sawy Hatem Rashid were also great. In fact I think Mohamed Emam Taha el Shazly was the only cast member who gave a soso performance. Anyway he's still a newbie this is his first film so he'll probably give better performances in the future. Yacoubian is one of the most expensive Egyptian films of alltime and fortunately the money is on the screen. The costumes makeup and sets are all topnotch. Khaled Hammad's score was good but I felt it was overly dramatic in some places a full Orchsetra playing while 2 people are merely talking?So I'd definitely recommend watching The Yacoubian Building. It's the best Egyptian film in quite some time and with a better adaptation it could have been a masterpiece.".

Director Hamid was 28 when he made it and is the son of the screenwriter who did the adaptation. The film is an ambitious and promising if underedited piece. Perhaps it ought to have been in parts like Marco Tullio Giordana's The Best of YouthLa meglio giovent to which it has been compared. But instead it's a somewhat sprawling 172 minutes and feels at times like a smashedtogether telenovela.Hollywood Reporter says the film may offer a revealing window into the secular world of a modern Islamic country  its indulgence in alcohol sexual promiscuity political corruption and personal betrayals. From such 'deformities the movie argues Islamic fundamentalism gains its most passionate adherents. But we can do better than this crude analysis. Moroccanborn western educated novelist Laila Lalani points out the book and consequently the movie is full of prejudices against gays resembles the old largescale melodramas produced by Egypt's huge film industry with their young idealists desirable ingnues old predators and so on and is crudely moralistic  with almost every character forced to make choices that ultimately result in either their downfall or redemption. It's also full of heavyhanded emotional manipulation cliffhangers and so on. Alaa Al Aswany is no Naguib Mahfouz. Aside from the prejudice against gays we're told that mixed marriages produce confused children that all women love sex enormously and so on. It's important to realize that however engaging the film is and notable the actors are in the Egyptian film world it's made out of dross not gold.The titular Armenianowned Twenties Yacoubian Building in the once elegant restricted central zone of the city became home to Cairo's rich and powerful when it opened Lalani writes. After the revolution however storage sheds on the rooftop were rented out to poor familiesa sort of skyhigh slum. This allows for a story about the building's residents that spans society. The action is set in the 1990's. And the basic panorama goes something like thisIn the foreground is Zaki Bey El Dessouki or Zaki Pasha Adel Imam a superannuated playboy kicked out of the family apartment by his mean halfcrazy sister. He may seem seedy but he's the house aristocrat. Fanous Ahmed Rateb is his faithful manservant. Dawlat Essad Younis is his nutty vindictive sister who has always resented his fun loving ways and not is out to get him. Hatem Rasheed Khaled El Sawy is a gay editor who takes a goodlooking soldier Abd Raboh Bassem Samra .from the country as his lover. Rasheed isn't mincing but he reflects an Egyptian discomfort with gayness still he's seen threedimensionally. He likes dark Nubian men because they remind him an early experience with a family servant. The film's treatment of the sexual aspect of Hatem's relationship to the soldier feels like something made in the 1950's. In general sex is a burden for the people in this movie either a risky temptation or an ordeal. It gets nasty and then the camera shrinks away.Haj Assam Nour El Sheriff is a selfmade millionaire through a chain of stores selling modestlypriced women's clothing with political ambitious. wants to get into the People's Assembly Majlis al Sha'ab for access to power. He takes a penniless young widow with a young son Soad Somaya el Khashab as a second wife and forces her to have an abortion. As Lalani puts it Assam is the nouveau riche to Zaki' Bey's aristocrat. The brothers Abaskharon and Malaak Ahmed Bedire are Coptic Christians who save every penny they make by legal and illegal means in order to finally afford a room on the roof.On the roof are Taha Mohamed Imamand Buthayna Hind Sabry. Taha is the son of a bawab. A bawab is a doorkeeper more like a concierge or a super in New York rather than janitor as it's translated. With such a lowly father Taha is turned down by the police academy as not socially adequate to become an officer and adopts a plan B to major in political science which leads him to sympathy with the university religions fanatics and he eventually becomes an Islamic fundamentalist. His girlfriend Buthayna leaves him when he becomes religious and eventually she goes to work for Zaki who's reformed and treats her well. She's previously been sexually harassed in every job she's had  as we're shown in a lurid scene. Perhaps she feels too defiled to be worthy of one so innocent and decent as Taha and she seems hardened A reader has pointed out that she is much poorer in the book than here. Laila Lalani says Egypt's young men are easy preys to religious extremism while the country's young women are victims of sexual exploitation. Taha is imprisoned and given Abu Ghraib treatment that deislamicizes him. To get revenge he trains as a terrorist  a chain of events that looks frighteningly uptodate.The film has little details any Cairo downtown resident will know  like Zaki yelling angrily because another resident has left the door of the antique elevator open on their floor so no one else can use it. Though this isn't Naguib Mahfouz like him it attempts to draw a richly representative picture of a whole society. It's a rather sad picture with its disapproval of the present and nostalgia for the past.. And again despite the three or six million dollars spent some exterior sound is awful the wrong kind of lens is used to pan up and down the city buildings and some of the Islamicists' beards look pasted on. But with all that's going on it holds your attention.Shown as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival 2007. Earlier in the year one of the Film Comments Selects series at Lincoln Center New York.".

	schema:reviewBody "This excellent black drama is a must see despite its nearly threehour running time the movie is one of the most watchable and enjoyable pieces of art in Egyptian Cinema.I didn't read the story before seeing that controversial movie so I had low expectations. But despite that got hooked as early as the quality intro that takes you smoothly through an enjoyable ride to discover the background behind that nostalgic building in central Cairo through a Sepia short clip.The film is an artistic black drama which is full of cultural and political symbolism if you read carefully between the lines my interpretation is that the building is a clear symbol of the country itself and how it transformed dramatically from the nostalgic early days of the 40s till the present day shedding light on the price that the Egyptian society had to pay during that rough trip and how the society has clear double standards that everyone is trying to ignore.Every side story evolves in a different direction and involves controversial characters who are linked only by the same building society in someway or the other the different stories are interweaves in an artistic way to dramatise different controversial issues and taboos from adultery political corruption homosexuality to Islamic fundamentalism.The movie has a general sad feel around it especially for anyone who lived in Egypt as it touches on the deterioration and many negative issues that are becoming more and more the norm in most Egyptian society levels that was once a conservative and religious society. It is strong wakeup call to those who love their country to stop burying their heads in the sand when it comes to double standards that's affecting everyone in the society making everyone feel inferior to the country. The story will make you think deeply about how and why a country like Egypt could end up where it is today.The cinematography steady cams crane camera movement is brilliant the smooth cuts and soft transitions boosts the romantic dimension of the storyline. As expected the music score by Khaled Hammad is expressive romantic and adds a lot of depth to many scenes. The tempo of the movie is just right giving enough time for actors to express their feelings through longer than usual shots that will never leave you bored. Action scenes are also very well done.A must see piece of art for anyone who is living or used to live in Egypt.".

But no! this movie tackles all these issues in an upfront and honest yet classy and sophisticated way. However I have to point out that Mohammad Imam's performance was somewhat shaky but he overall gave an OK performance for his first movie. On the whole this movie is a breakthrough for the Egyptian cinema and in my opinion the best movie ever made in the history of the Arab cinema. Hopefully more movies of that genre will be made in the future because every second of that movie was entertaining in every aspect and i was enjoying it until the very last second and i even didn't want it to finish.this movie is just BEAUTIFUL!!!".

There are areas where the movie is not perfect it is so highly pessimistic and denounces the greed and selfishness of Egyptian men with so much vigor that it appears somewhat simplistic. It does tend to ramble a bit. But the power and the humor of the movie it is quite funny despite being tragic transcends all that and makes those minor faults. I understand the director is very young so he will have ample time to overcome and transcend these youthful imperfections. I didn't like Slumdog Millionaire because it told me everything about India that I already knew it feels like a package tour where you are shown the sites you expect to see and are whisked from one location to another. For a western viewer Omaret yakobean is like a journey where you land at the airport and are immediately carried away by the atmosphere the culture shock the bustling streets the misunderstandings from which you emerge with challenged assumptions and a wider view of the world.".

Even the soundtrack the picture and the dialog just so good. this movie had me thinking all night about it and made me live it. this movie made me laugh cry bothered It is a masterpiece. I just hope the movie industry in Egypt keeps on bringing those types of movies. those movies which remind us of the 70's movies where at least 2 or 3 big movies stars act together. Now I'm thinking to take the rest of my friends to it so i can be able to watch it second time. It is one of the best movies I've watched this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Yaboubian Building reminded me of those overheated Spanish soap operas that air nightly on Telemundo. The sweep and size of the film not to mention its length may fool people into thinking it's a more important picture than it actually is when really it's not much more than one big soapy melodrama that manages to stay mostly entertaining over the course of its three hours.There's a lot going on in this film and you may find you have your work cut for you just following the basics of the plot. I suspect much more of the film would have made sense to me had I known more about Egyptian culture. As it is there are a lot of terms and situations in the film that probably didn't have their full desired effect. Of course it's tough as an American and therefore one used to experiencing art that throws critical darts at my country's beliefs and institutions to fully understand how controversial this film and the book on which it is based has been in Egypt. By all accounts the frank candour about corrupt government homosexuality and the prostitution of Egyptian citizens of all types and at all levels of society have been greeted with quite an uproar in this film's country of origin. It's a noble effort on the part of the filmmakers and I can understand them wanting to pack in as much punch as they can but the film tries to do too much and the plot feels like several different agendas unsuccessfully unified into a coherent whole.Much of The Yacoubian Building is no less hamfisted than your typical Hollywood film not the least of which are the scenes that explain outright the film's central metaphor the Yacoubian building itself as a representation of Egyptian society. But much of it works quite well too especially the acting which is pretty good across the board the crisp pacing and the driving musical score.A big bold movie that bites off more than it can chew but provides a solid few hours of entertainment nonetheless.Grade B".

The character and his motivations were too undeveloped to understand his convictions and his actions and I feel that it is irresponsible to release such a superficial overview to the West.

I am so happy to have seen so many taboos on the screen in order for the people to discuss and find solutions.

Therefore Marwan Hamed's Omaret Yakobean The Yacoubian Building in English turns out to be even more important. The movie depicts 21stcentury Egyptian society as morally bankrupt while also looking at topics that are usually taboo in Muslim societies e.g. homosexuality.I view the movie as sort of an Egyptian version of movies like Amores Perros and Y Tu Mam Tambin both of which show the degeneracy of Mexican society by looking at the different aspects of society. Here we see just about every problem that infects Egyptian society. Although the movie is a scathing indictment of what the most populous Arab country had become under Mubarak it poses the question of whether this is a matter of governance or something else. We saw how the corruption and autocracy continued under Mohamed Morsi and has gone supernova since the military coup led by Fatah alSisi. Indeed the nationalist and independence movements often betrayed their own ideals as political parties either became entrenched like in Algeria or strongmen took over like Idi Amin in Uganda. Is it doomed to always be like this?! All in all a very good movie.".

The book was better in relating characters and analyzing themi know that the book has a better space to do that and that the movie had a limited timealthough it was 3 hours longbut still the movie gave much on screen space to some stories that weren't that deep like Adel Emam's story and little time to more deep and important ones like terrorism in Mohamed Emam's story and Gayness in Khaled El Sawy's story. The casting and acting were very good except for Tamer Abd El Men'em who was very annoying and not fit for his role! Also Adel Emam was not that good although he finally played a role that fits his age. New people in the movie like Bassem Samrai guess that's his name! and Mohamed Emam were greatespecially the first. Best acting was by Khaled El Sawy who played Hatem Rasheedthe gay journalist..he was perfect and deep unlike Youssif Sha'ban in Hamam El Malatiliwho was very naive and stupid!! i'd give Khaled El Sawy a 1010. Also Is'ad Younissalthough her role was smallwhenever she appeared on screenshe just entertained me. Khaled Saleh was gorgeous as usual as Kamal El Shaz.. i mean Kamal El Fuly lol The Montage was absolutely terrible! that's all i can say about it. I think it's a very good Egyptian movie that deals with the real Egyptian society and it must be seen. Finallyi applause for Ali Abo Shady for not cutting anything out of the movie.".

I was surprised when I found out that the younger actorsactresses have matched  and sometimes exceeded their older and more famous counterparts. Hend Sabry continues her breathtaking displays with a very natural and hearttouching impersonation of Bouthina the poor little girl who find herself surrounded by a crucial mother asking her to bring money home regardless of how she does so and numerous men trying to use her body to satisfy their sexual desires. Adel Imam  Nour El Sheriff put the wisdom of years of acting into producing very real characters from the Egyptian society. What came as a a surprise is Adel Imam's son in real life The bawab's son who become a terrorist and Khaled El Sawy The Gay. No matter what you say about gays Khaled El Sawy faces the difficult task of making you hate him and then sympathize with him as he recalls the lack of attention he got from his parents that caused him to become a gay. Also the scene where he tries to convince the soldier that he takes back home that being gay is not 7aram and that its 7allal. I think this would be his best ever role and he proved himself as a capable actor today. I would say a 9 over 10 and a new record for Egyptian Cinema. A Must See.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie offers three stories that are not linked except by having some of their events taking place at the same building Yacoubian Building Emarat Yaqubyan. The small hints in one story that may refer to another one are so insignificant that you can take them out of script without any damage to any of the stories. The main story is about the rich playboy Adel Emam who is turning old. The second story is about the devout merchant Noor elSharif and his quest for more. The last small story is about the homosexual newspaper editor and his quest for a lover. Having so disconnected stories in one building might be a symbol for the way Cairan society is so many disconnected lives living in one big city. And this applies for all of Egypt too.Unsurprising about Adel Emam's movies this one is full of sexual scenes and is extremely antireligious with uncompromising tone. Decency is not welcome here and is not encouraged. It is pro'mutual consent sex' but anti'sexual exploitation' something that Emam has always featured in his movies against the norms of the Muslim traditions of Egypt and the Arab World. When discussing religion the movie gives the extreme cases of terrorists and opportunists. No moderate Islam or Christianity is introduced although Egyptian and Arab societies are mostly moderate and honest.I'm not surprised by being disappointed. Egyptian moviemaking should stop being so liberal and turn to the truth of Egyptian society. I'm not Egyptian but I know that Egyptians are fed up with negative stereotypes that are introduced in their local movies. Egyptians should not be blamed for attacking this movie and all other movies that don't mirror the facts of Egyptian society.The story is great the moviemaking is nice but the messages are bad. I would recommend seeing this movie but don't take it seriously. It is not the whole truth and many events are untrue like allowing extremist Friday prayer and sermon in a major mosque under the currently effective Egyptian martial laws. It is just drama and not true life but full of symbolism and some true things.".

Some of the romantic scenes were enticing but I have to say that the presentation of the Gay character as a predator who obviously deserved the unhappy ending he gets at the end of the movie was disturbing. It is a bit the way homosexuals were presented in American cinema 2550 years ago. On the other hand an old charming straight man hits the jackpot at the end. Don't get me wrong. How things ended for the old straight guy was beautifully done. I just wondered why the Gay man was not given a better portrayal. Poorly done and too black and white for my tastes.".

	schema:headline " A brilliant portrayal of junk addiction and love in East London.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pure a film about a heroin addict mother in East London could all too easily have become a cold and hopeless rendition of the destructive nature of drug use. Instead through sensitive screenplay and compelling performances from the cast it successes in showing how a binding familial love can triumph over the modern evils which so many face. Molly Parker who plays a widowed junkie mother of two compels us to discover how she can care more about heroin than her two sons. However the saving grace of the film is the mature and grounded portrayal of her older son Paul played by Harry Eden. His simple heartfelt acting gives the audience a sense of his position trapped between loyalty to his mother and the social services. It is Eden's acting through which the film is shown that we are immersed into the grimy drudgery of West Ham. His facial expression never contrived or obvious gives a realism which makes him shine out against other child actors today. And when he too smokes heroin with his companion Louise played by Keira Knightley in a refreshing change from her swashbuckling we wonder whether the vice of this drug can grip him too. The image of a ten yearold boy chasing the dragon tips us to the edge of our seats and ponders what lengths this film will go to to show us such a different world. The cinematography offers haunting visions of this concrete jungle and is very effective. I felt the film's only downfall was its soundtrack which is written by only one person and gives little variation from its initial theme. However at some points its sentimental sound is appropriate. I really did like this film because at its core stood the moral that despite what influences of sin and hatred we might undergo love will always remain. Well worth seeing.".

I said interesting but not really fully accomplished. The story is moving an eleven year old kid who loves his young heroing addict mother and who fights for her recovery from drugs until he succeeds. Even so the movie script makes nothing to make the characters sympathetic especially in the case of Molly the junkie mother. The kid Harry Eden is just a revelation at least for me though I have read that he is also exceptionally good in another movie called Real Men and delivers a realistic performing in every way including his passionate and loving attachment to his mother. Unfortunately the audience cannot see why is that mother so lovable and the fact that the kid gets reunited with her at the end seems awkward and offputting instead of emotional. Come on the kid is just another example of the typical subservient relationship that addict or drunk parents develop with their kids. A relationship where the kids wash cook and clean and in short take on themselves the obligation instead of being the opposite way to take care of their addicted parent. What are the assurances that this sick manner of relating to each other is not going to be perpetuated especially when during the movie we have not seen any other kind of relationship being developed.Besides that the script fails miserably in the scene where the kid arranges the arrest of the drug dealer David Wenham. Suddenly without any explanation we find out that the restaurant's owner is the big supplier of the drugs that have been used throughout the movie. Hey that's just too easy and completely out of the blue. Besides that the scene itself is just badly planned. Moreover the final scene is just to put it bluntly stupid. Do you imagine social workers and relatives alike deciding by spontaneous voting if a reformed junkie mother should be reunited with her sons? Even so the good sections of this movie become a delightful experience because of Harry Eden's acting which is always believable always realistic. Especially remarkable are the scenes when he has his first sexual approaches with the character of Keira Kneightly and when he tries drugs for the first time in his life. Here we have the most convincing line of the whole movie and which is the only natural development of what his mother has been doing to him Now I am like you mom.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pure is a story about disintegrated families victims of the drug addiction. Mel Molly Parker after the death of her husband becomes a junkie and leaves the fate of her family into the hands of Lenny David Wenham Upton Park's local pimp and drug dealer. Paul Harry Eden Mel's ten year old son is the main hero who tries his best to ensure the safety of his younger brother and the health of the helpless parent. In spite of Paul's efforts to stop mom's dependence on heroin Mel does little to keep her family together. Only at the sight of her stoned child she decides to give up and predictably succeeds.Gilles MacKinnon Regeneration creates a film in which the moods of the character are expressed elegantly in the use of intense colours being juxtaposed to blurred ones drama and passion are juxtaposed to comedy and joy  all creating a mixed psychological tableau in which the parents need to be taken cared of and the children excel in their moral superiority. Alison Hume's script based on a detailed research of drugaddicted mothers in Leeds tries to combine the independence of the capital with the community spirit present within West Ham's supporters in order to achieve the dramatic impact expected from films that tackle similar themes.The effect is far from expected. Although Harry Eden tries his best to impress in his struggle between understanding of and love for his mother there is still quite a bit to go to challenge Haley Joel Osment. Arguably most characters tend to seclude too easily into stereotypes and remain shadowed by the overall picture. The only decent cast is Molly Parker Kissed Men with Brooms who manages a most memorable performance particularly when she ends up admitting I know I am a st mother. I never say it but I always think that. I love you. At the end of the day she proves that a junkie mom is better than no mom.Pure is a film that would appeal mainly to the families with similar experiences but may be of little interest to the general public. The one touching thing is the soothing soundtrack which tends to give an optimistic feeling to the story in the lively piano tune. Otherwise the film is too pure to be disembodied though many might disagree. After all the Berlin International Film Festival Jury had to have a few good reasons to honour it with two Manfred Salzgeber Awards.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's taken a while for this British movie to make it to DVD in the USA I think it got a limited theatre release so I feel slightly fraudulent reviewing it 4 years late. Was it worth waiting for? Hmmm. That's a toughie.The problem is I feel I ought to like this movie more than I do. It showcases a gutwrenchingly good performance by Molly Parker as the heroin addicted mum Mel an astonishingly good performance from young actor Harry Eden as the central character her son Paul very good support from two of my favorites actors Keira Knightly as a young waitress Louise who befriends Paul and David Wenham as the local big shot dealer Lenny with smaller but effective roles by Gary Lewis and Geraldine McEwan.I know this is a good movie its production values were high it's well acted well scripted more than adequately filmed on location in the East End and has a very wellmeaning and ethical story about the redemptive power of love. Briefly ten year old Paul runs a household under the shadow of West Ham United's Upton Park football ground in the multiethnic East End of London while his mother struggles to admit she has a drug problem and then overcome it. Paul finally is instrumental in getting the local dealer nicked and in getting his mum to stick with rehab and the family reunited. Yet I have to admit that I found it vaguely disappointing. A good TV drama but I can see why it didn't get a wide theatre release.If I was backed into a corner and forced to make comparisons I might describe Pure as Vera Drake meets Trainspotting. But unfortunately it doesn't have the impact of either. Pure lacks the black humour of Trainspotting which made that film such a cult classic and which also made it so shocking. In Trainspotting one moment the audience is laughing at this bunch of complete losers and wondering if it really matters if idiots like this choose to kill themselves with drugs? The next moment we are shocked out of our seats by the death of the neglected baby which haunts the film. Pure also lacks Vera Drake's basic moral dilemma namely is this inconspicuous rather nice kind woman Vera really doing something wicked when she performs doityourself abortions on desperate volunteers? Does she really deserve to go to jail for it? After all the rich get away with it. But in Pure there are no such contradictions or doubts and really no great moral dilemma for the audience to wrestle with. As shown here heroin addiction is awful. It has no redeeming features. People die unpleasantly or mess up their lives. Drug addicts make lousy parents. But I think I knew that already. It showed us the intimate details of the devastation that drugs can wreak on a family but it didn't really say anything new. There is no doubt that the pimp  dealer Lenny is nasty that the child Paul is heroic and that his mum wants at some level to be a decent parent. The film is really just confirming for the audience what most of us already knew.Lenny probably says the only mildly contentious lines in the whole movie when he says and I'm paraphrasing Heroin doesn't make people's lives lousy it just helps them cope with the lousy lives they already have. That might have been an interesting lead to follow why did Mel get into this state? OK she was widowed young but plenty of women are widowed young and don't become junkies. Lenny gets his comeuppance he deserved jail for his Argyle sweaters alone never mind the drug dealing... mum gets off heroin and Paul gets his family back. It's all very well presented and yet it doesn't make for great drama with the possible exception of the scene where Paul attacks Lenny's Audi with a brick and then lays into Lenny. I'm struggling really to pin it down but Pure didn't quite work for me.One level on which it failed for me was the incredibly banal soundtrack. I watched Pure with my 16 year old son I often use my kids as sounding boards for movies because I realize as a middle aged woman I'm not a statistically important part of the demographic and he said the soundtrack reminded him of a movie he saw recently called Grizzly Man in which a guy goes to study bears in Alaska and gets eaten by one. Certainly to me the sound track seemed more reminiscent of the National Geographic Channel than the East End of London. A sound track should enhance the movie or else not be there at all. I found Pure's intensely irritating and rather trite and felt most of the best scenes were the ones without any music.All the performances were faultless. It was an interesting role for Keira Knightly Molly Parker and Harry Eden were superb and Australian David Wenham proved again that he does a great turn as a thug. He also nailed the accent perfectly which I find interesting. Because this is where I have to admit that I'm an Essex Girl myself and I grew up not far from where this movie is set. Although I've been away from London for 30 years and living in California for 9 of those I still retain a slight Essex accent. And yet here in California I'm frequently asked by the locals what part of Australia I'm from. I guess the accents are closer than I'd realized. I watched Pure twice in case I picked up some interesting nuances second time that I missed first time but no. It did nothing more for me second time around. Well meaning movie but not especially memorable unfortunately. I'd watch it in preference to most of the dross on TV here but I can't pretend it's a great film. Sorry...!".

Pure' is British drama set around a London based single mother and her two sons Lee and Paul as played by Eden. A promising start to the film shows young Paul preparing drugs for his heroin addicted mother and handing her the syringe. A desolate look appears on his face as his mother confesses to having forgotten his birthday.Billed as a gritty and powerful drama this movie is good but hardly outstanding. Eden's performance is superb given the material he has to work with. For the best part of the film young Paul looks for all the world as though he is hardened to the situation in which he lives.  There is a empty tired and vacant gaze behind his eyes reflecting the impact of living with a drug addicted parent.The film is not without gentle touches of humour. The scene in which Mel played adeptly by Molly Parker hands over the child Rose to the doctor on the bus is both sad and gently amusing as Paul glances back to the doctor warning him don't give her pepperoni  it gives her the shits'.From here the film delves into the world of heroin abuse with detox scenes and the inevitable problems that arise from them. Unfortunately this is where the film is ultimately badly let down.The film is good but that's as far as it goes. It could have been so much better and barely warrants its 18 certification.  Harry Eden is an outstanding actor and this film could have been such an opportunity to explore his vast potential.  Sadly though this role is a little like giving Michael Schumacher a Mini  you just know that Harry could have done so much with the part given the chance.  He is denied the opportunity to portray any real emotion  it is only in the last 15 minutes in which we see this world weary ten year old cry.  Whether this is intentional is difficult to say as the direction of the film doesn't have quite the impact to allow any true sense of desperation.The detoxification is reasonably well handled but is not shown with the impact that it would genuinely have.  Overall the main problem is that the film is too likeable and nowhere near uncompromising enough given the subject matter.  Paul's introduction to heroin to feel what his mother feels' seems to have been put in for shock value and is unconvincing and unrealistic and using it as his mothers inspiration for kicking her habit is clichd nearly as much as the family suggesting pie and eels' for a celebration meal is a jaded and stereotyped image of the real cockney'.For all its faults though Pure' is a decent enough film with characters you can warm to and is generally a very likeable film.  Sadly it is this likeability that detracts from the seriousness of the subject matter and one cannot help but feel that Harry Eden is not given enough room to allow his character to develop.  This means that the viewers are robbed of the opportunity to see this young actors remarkable talent at its full potential.  A well earned 7.510 for this well meaning but sugar coated movie which could have been so much more...Ollie".

I was surprised by Keira Knightley too who has usually adopted for costume drama roles. The star of the show is no doubt Harry Eden played wonderfully as the suffering mature son of a heroin addicted mother.The film has a strong cast and the story is a realistic portrayal of a suffering family on a hardened estate. This film may just put you off drugs for life! Some of the scenes are heart breaking and emotional and it makes me count my lucky stars I was never involved in petty crime and drugs. Yet I can relate to the film and the characters. People are sucked into drugs by animal dealers and they just sit back and watch the carnage while Harry  a 10 year old boy picks up the pieces. solid stuff. 810".

	schema:headline " On Target View of Drug Addiction  Set in London";
	schema:reviewBody "The most important aspect of this film is how it focuses on a 10 year old boy and his problem with his heroin addicted mother not on a mother dealing with a boy using drugs.Keira Knightley is the star power but she's neither the sexiest nor the most slender that goes to Molly Parker Deadwoodand it's easy to see how she could attract men to enable her ongoing drug use. Her acting is as good as it gets but never falls into the trap of excess usually used to portray drug users. The portrayal of the boy Paul is also very real for being matter of fact rather than excess. The cinematography in a working class London neighborhood does not overdue the squalor but shows a pretty nice place to live  for those who haven't abandoned religion patriotism the work ethic selfrespect and other traditional English values.Widespread drug use beginning with heroin began with MY generation those who were young adults in the Kennedy Era. Heroin spread like uncontrolled wildfire across America  from the inner cities of New York Chicago and LA the only places where drugs were common in 1960 into every town in America. The 1 carrier of the disease were the college kids  spoiled brats who embraced heroin with open arms and spread it directly or indirectly to their children. Hippies with their aversion to soap spread their false credo of Peace and Love  if only the world was stoned we'd all love each other. Hippies are just so Yesterday but their poison legacy lives on.Children dealing with stoner parents that's the reality. Young people today have little idea how rotten things were in America in their parents' generation. Drugs and crime everywhere. When kids like Paul in this movie began to rebel against their corrupt and useless stoner parents that's when things changed. How nice that this film gets it right.".

Seriously this movie fairly much progresses just as you would expect it to and it just doesn't really have any surprises in it.Yet it picks in original approach by telling the story from the viewpoint of an 10 year old boy who's mother is an heroin addict. So you see the usual story from an unusual viewpoint. It adds some originality and effectiveness to the story but yet overall the movie remains mostly shallow which is not due to the acting or overall written but more to the directing.The movie really isn't always flowing well and it also isn't helped much by its horrible musical score. The way the story is being told is weak at times and the movie too often chooses fast cuts and scenes often end too abruptly. The movie at points often leaves an unsatisfying impression because of this though the movie its intentions are all good. Because of the storytelling I felt a certain distance to the story and character and wasn't overall grabbed by it. The movie because of this also doesn't work out as realistic as it potentially could had. Despite the actor's efforts most characters remain mainly stereotypical ones. No I can't say Gillies MacKinnon is my favorite director even though this movie is the only one I have seen by him. The movie is just not the most effective or powerful one within its genre.All of the actors are basically doing a good job but they don't really make the movie or their characters more interesting than they are. Harry Eden is praised to heaven for his performance and it is a good role for an 12 year old but no people he really isn't that great. In some of the sequences especially the emotional ones his acting is simply lacking and I couldn't ever feel any of the pain or anger his character went trough which again might also be rather due to the movie its directing approach than anything else really. The movie also stars David Wenham and Keira Knightley before their days of fame. I like Keira Knightley and all but you can actually wonder what she is doing here in this movie. Her role on paper might seem like a relevant one but in the movie it works out as a redundant one whose plot line is distracting from the one the movie is really all about.I don't mean to sound too harsh about this movie since its definitely a watchable one. It's just that it's also currently being overrated and overpraised on here for something that it just really isn't.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".
