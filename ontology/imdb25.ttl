	schema:reviewBody "The original film is a nostalgic mix of mechanical owls Division One footballer haircuts and lumbering beasts in my head  no more than that. I'm sure if you put me on the spot to comment on it I would have fond things to say but perhaps this is only due to the passage of time. Perhaps the original Clash of the Titans was nothing more than a rather wooden effects movie like this remake is  but yet for some reason the 1981 film is given praise for it and this remake was battered for doing just that. Well I don't have enough memory to be able to compare and contrast so I will just focus on what I watched last night.It is just what it suggests it will be by producing endless CGI beasts and effects in one serviceable action sequence after another. I only saw it in 2D 3D still not really attracting me but I have to admit that the size of the creatures and so on was impressive even if only in terms of being to see all that money up there on the screen. Of course this is not the same as saying as the film is particularly good  because it isn't really  it is only OK. Part of the problem is that it is a very hollow movie everything looks pretty good on the surface of it technically but there is nothing below this. I'm not suggesting that the film must be some worthy epic with layering and character depth but to be honest I would have settled for a bit of fun or a bit of actual excitement rather than just lots of things to look at. As it is though the film is all about the effects and nothing else is really forthcoming.You can see this in the cast  not so much their names because there are some big names in here but more in their performances. Worthington is a solid actor and good looking guy  that is what he brings to the table and in this film he probably does enough with that. Neeson and Fiennes have nothing to do  Fiennes in particular looks awkward and uneasy with his character and it is clear this film is a job to him rather than a project. Flemyng is OK under all that makeup while Atherton is pretty but pointless. None of this is a surprise though it is not a film for actors but rather for effects.Clash of the Titans is a shrug of a film. If you are looking for undemanding noise that will not tax you one bit mentally but will provide big creatures and spectacle to stare at then this will do the job. It won't do the job particularly well but it will do it and then move on  you'll have forgotten it within a week though as generally it doesn't have much special or of interest about it.".

The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' guardian angel of sorts Io Gemma Arterton.

	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I watched Clash of the Titans at a local theatre and I have to be sincere the direction of the movie was so bad that I was speechless for a few minutes for all the wrong reasons. I'm still trying to understand how someone could leave such a rich tale so undeveloped on every front with 106 mins of running time at his disposal. It's one of those movies which offer you over 1.5 hours of nothingness. The introduction is insanely rushed as you see the main character go through different stages in his life within 34 minutes giving you just enough of each for the director to squeeze in a couple of supposedly memorable quotes regarding the character's destiny which you forget in about a minute.Now I have to mention this because my friends seemed to notice this issue too Worthington stood out like a sore thumb in this movie. He just looked too modern. We agreed that it was due to his look being too 'clean'. His head is shaved the same exact look he's had in both Terminator Salvation and Avatar which is just lazy and his look never changes during his supposedly long epic? voyage. No scars barely a hint of a beard after days of travelling and the occasional fight. I like the actor and I don't think he was miscast but he was not used well imo.The characters in general were left TOTALLY undeveloped. People walked in walked out and died throughout the story and you never care about any of them. Important characters go from looking invincible to dying all of a sudden. I'm serious. WHAM! They're dead. Some 'important' characters die so quickly that you're not even sure you understood how they were actually killed.As I said before this movie lacked all direction. Some supposedly comic situations begged to be reshot. The delivery was terrible and the director simply seemed in a rush to wrap things up. Not even the accepted clichs worked well in this movie. One ends up looking at the people sitting next to him to see whether he was supposed to laugh or whether they were sharing his same agony as this mess unfolded. The cuts from one character to another also seemed very odd. You cut from a characterthen to another and then back to the first one and each time the character is looking in a completely different direction! It was so surreal like a low budget 70s movie.Anyways this movie has so many problems I can't relate all of them or this review would end up being more epic than the movie itself. I won't even go into how cheap and useless most of the dialogue was or the shocking LACK of action meaning that the first battle which is supposed to be against minor enemies ends up being the most noteworthy 'CLASH' in the whole movie!Bottom line this movie was a complete mess. The direction was terrible and the story was incredibly boring leaving some moviegoers asleep as the end credits rolled.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are SPOILERS here so beware....I remember years ago a friend and I discussing how awesome a remake of Clash of the Titans would be. 10 years later this comes along. The remake deviates way too much from the original. I get the attempt to make a stand alone movie but this remake is pointless. In the original the whole journey is for one reason only Love. Perseus is attempting to save Andromeda from the wrath of the Gods. The remake makes it a journey based only on revenge. Perseus in the original was a young naive boy who discovers his inner hero. The remake shows Perseus as a defiant musclebound idiot who automatically has the kind of skill the warriors he travels with have devoted their lives to attaining. in the original Perseus had to tame and gain the trust of Pegasus. Not here.... he just shows up. Convenient. Bubo the golden owl as cheesy as he was is nothing more than a sight gag in the remake. Calibos poses no threat here. He was such an integral part of the original. The addition of the character Io is just annoying. Her presence is completely unnecessary. The Medusa trainingseduction scene...ridiculous. The Medusa scene was easily the best part of the original... here it is anticlimatic. The Kraken? Besides the creature being way too big the whole movie hinges on what a threat this monster is. Yeah it looks cool I'll give it that... but for being such a threatening monster he sure is dispatched easily. Perseus spends more time chasing a blurry harpy around than actually dealing with the Kraken. Perseus's relationship to Andromeda is nothing more than casual the 3D and slow motion are pointless and there is no giant vulture. Sam Worthington should not be allowed to work again until he can do so without his accent. The director Louis Leterrier is just the wrong person for this job. Transporter 2...sure. This? No. Liam Neeson Pete Postlethwait and Ralph Fiennes are truly slumming it on this one. I'm sure no matter what is said people are going to line up for this one. I'm aware of how I sound here. But this movie truly is a let down on every level. While they had the chance to make a fun popcorn movie in the vein of Jurassic Park Iron Man or even Star Trek 2009 they really missed the mark here. The film is terribly cast acted and directed. A true waste of the title... but hey... it sure looks pretty doesn't it?".

	schema:headline " Just your basic run of the mill average action movie........at best.";
	schema:reviewBody "Is it wrong to remake a movie just so you can update its special effects? Hollywood doesn't seem to think so. The classic claymation and stop motion sequences of old are some of the first things we think about when bringing up the subject of mythology movies. But one still cannot help but think how totally awesome it would look if it were updated.Anyone who has ever read mythology knows that every single tale is of epic preportions. And by epic i don't just mean the battle sequences......im looking more towards the actual time line. Each individual book always tells a story of one mans struggle against countless odds that stretch over a long period of time. So normally about halfway through you begin to say to yourself How much more can this guy take?. And in saying that i think that is where this movie failed. I didn't feel hatred towards these gods. I didn't feel the need to have my thirst for revenge quenched. I didn't feel sorry for the main character Perseus.......because i didn't feel any depth to his character or the plot. This movie focused way to much on the action scenes as opposed to the story.........which is suppose to be epic right? But yes the action sequences are really great and the scenes with Medusa and the Kraken are awesome. But thats all i can really give to this film. It just felt empty.The transitions between each action scene were really poor. You can tell that the director was trying his hardest to make you feel for these characters by adding one or two lines of pathetic dialogue. And since we are on the subject of dialogue......man it was bad. There was no emotionality all the little tid bits of humor fell flat at every turn. It was like Michael Bay wrote the dialogue.Bottom Line this is just your basic run of the mill average action movie........at best. This is certainly not one of those movies that you will be telling your friends about the next day. Its action is really good its story is bland its dialogue is weak........all things that i really wouldn't consider epic. Also and this is important for you people who are tight on money. This is the first time i have ever said this but please do not see this movie in 3D. It is a giant waste of money. You will get the same satisfaction seeing it in regular 2D........trust me. There really was no point in making this movie in 3D at all other than to squeeze every dollar they can out of a average action flick.".

	onyx:emotionText "Is it wrong to remake a movie just so you can update its special effects? Hollywood doesn't seem to think so. The classic claymation and stop motion sequences of old are some of the first things we think about when bringing up the subject of mythology movies. But one still cannot help but think how totally awesome it would look if it were updated.Anyone who has ever read mythology knows that every single tale is of epic preportions. And by epic i don't just mean the battle sequences......im looking more towards the actual time line. Each individual book always tells a story of one mans struggle against countless odds that stretch over a long period of time. So normally about halfway through you begin to say to yourself How much more can this guy take?. And in saying that i think that is where this movie failed. I didn't feel hatred towards these gods. I didn't feel the need to have my thirst for revenge quenched. I didn't feel sorry for the main character Perseus.......because i didn't feel any depth to his character or the plot. This movie focused way to much on the action scenes as opposed to the story.........which is suppose to be epic right? But yes the action sequences are really great and the scenes with Medusa and the Kraken are awesome. But thats all i can really give to this film. It just felt empty.The transitions between each action scene were really poor. You can tell that the director was trying his hardest to make you feel for these characters by adding one or two lines of pathetic dialogue. And since we are on the subject of dialogue......man it was bad. There was no emotionality all the little tid bits of humor fell flat at every turn. It was like Michael Bay wrote the dialogue.Bottom Line this is just your basic run of the mill average action movie........at best. This is certainly not one of those movies that you will be telling your friends about the next day.

In a world full of guys with long hair and beards our hero walked around in a buzzcut and a gangsta attitude.. Why not just throw in the saggy pants and tattoos while you're at it? The dialogue was extremely bad. Everything was some kind of reverent lofty quote as if everyone was a Shakespeare. The giant scorpions and flying harpies were CGI nightmares....more fake than the old stopaction creatures. Medussa was just a CGI joke  shrouded in shadowy jerkyaction. The Cracken was scary looking and huge but ultimately not that menacing. It seemed like a monster with a disability of some kind. All the action sequences were of the confusing CGI fast paced nonsensical variety  people rubbing up on each other falling 60 feet getting up like nothing happened etc. And the whole thing was filmed in a kind of amber hue that sucked out any color.

	schema:headline " The uneven original is remade into an abysmal joyless adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "Remakes these days are almost always terrible and having seen production photos of COTT before its release photos that didn't inspire much confidence I decided not to see the remake on the big screen opting to wait for it on DVD or download. I always had a lovehate approach to the original which I saw at the cinemas when I was a young teen. So take this as someone who's not a fanatic of the original and was going to hate any remake from the get go. With that said the new film is thoroughly awful in almost every way possible. Except for the beginning which is OK not great the action packed but not suspenseful Medusa scene and the clearly OTT ending there's nothing much else to see. The entire cast of characters is uniformly unpleasant. Not one likable character in the whole thing including a growling Perseus played by onenote Aussie actor Sam Worthington. This is difference with the original. I basically liked almost every characters no matter how cardboard they were.Here's a breakdown of the filmthe changes to the story humans vs gods doesn't make any sense.Adding the religiouscult storyline with the crazy leader was awful. It added nothing and the character was annoying as hell.It doesn't really look Greek at all but more Pompeiish than anything else. The design of Argos though spectacular during the climax has absolutely nothing to do with Greek designarchitecture.the look and design of Mount Olympus is tacky. Looks like a cheesy scifi movie.Like the original the other Gods do not have much to do.In the original Perseus had to tame Pegasus which made sense for a Heroic journey. In the remake Pegasus who's black appears to him and well that's it. Totally dull. The original was much better in this regard. And the reason they made Pegasus black because the CGI is more forgiving than if it was white.the scene with the scorpions doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the original the Medusa's blood mutates the scorpions into big monsters but in the remake Calibos' blood after his hand was cut off drips on some sand and the scorpions appear from the ground killing most of the men from Argos but then Perseus and his men team up with the mysterious beings that use the big scorpions as transportation like nothing had happened! Huh?the set for the Medusa scene is pretty good and the Medusa is OK as a superfast slithery creature but the scene is more action than suspense. And Sam wears fleshcolored tights during many shots which makes it look very silly.The ending is so overthetop that it's almost a thing of beauty. Here's a breakdownIt takes the Kraken 15 minutes to surface. There's slow and slow but man that beast is constipated.The Kraken looks like a turtleoctopusthat monster from Return of the Jedi thingyThe climax occurs during an eclipse. Why?The ending or confrontation between the Kraken and Perseus is ridiculously drawn out extended by having those winged demons snatch the bag with the head of the Medusa how did they know what was in the bag?the action is often so confusing that the characters have to tell us what's going on such as when the winged demons snatch the bag Perseus yells that they stole it because we clearly couldn't see what was going on.Andromeda which is not the love interest in this version hangs from the sacrificial altar hundreds of feet above the sea strung up by her arms which she never seems to find painful. Unlike other Sword  Sandal films where people were in extreme pain when hanging from their arms Andromeda is remarkably calm and nonchalant about it all.When the Kraken becomes a statue the whole thing is beyond silly. It looks like the monster has a sudden rash. It crumbles from its own weight and Andromeda falls in the ocean and yet Perseus is able to find her underwater amidst the whole chaos. He must have a heat seeking device on him.Sam Worthington's Aussie accent can be heard throughout the movie. Plus the fact that his hair is not in style with the times the less time Sam is on screen the better it is.The score is totally forgettable unlike the Laurence Rosenthal score for the original which is beautiful and soaring.All in all this remake is at times so bad that in its own way becomes a thing of beauty. I mean how can a film get it so wrong on so many levels? Even the brief cameo of Bubo which was a sight for soar eyes was mishandled. The film was a huge success and even though the Kraken is dead and the Medusa is headless Warner has already greenlighted a sequel!Because of this remake I have to reevaluate the original which after watching this suddenly comes out as brilliant on almost every level including the fact that its more in tune with Greek mythology than this unpleasant version. Well I still find the original uneven at best but it's also more enjoyable memorable and far sexier too.".

Almost everything about this movie was boring. The story was quite bad as I found myself drifting in and out of the movie unable to pay much attention to it. The acting wasn't very good as half of the cast looked like they didn't want to be there and just tried their best to hide that fact. The characters were quite boring and you didn't care for any of them at all. The direction wasn't bad but I can't say the same for the script as that was terribly boring. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the battles which were quite entertaining and were executed quite well. The CGI was okay as well it wasn't terrible but it weren't all that great.Hollywood has done it yet again by making another pointless remake. Clash of the Titans will please some but not others. If you like CGI battles and don't care about anything else then I think this will be the movie for you. However if you like a good story and good acting then you might not like this. I normally like both I love a story to grip me and I also like great action or CGI scenes but unfortunately for this movie one outweighs the other. The story bored me so much as did the characters it felt like the actors was bored doing their roles sometimes. However the CGI was pretty good and the action scenes were executed well but they weren't enough to cover the fact it had a tedious and terrible story. It's a movie with a bad story and terrible characters which are covered up with CGI battle scenes.

Back in 1981 when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films we had the original CLASH OF THE TITANS. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences especially when Perseus Harry Hamlin met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods how they felt about humanity and how humanity felt about them dominated the storyline. Yes there was an ACTUAL story.Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this messofaremake that relies almost solely on CGI and well basically nothing else.The brief understanding of the godhuman relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2D ...if at all.My son went with me to see it he's as much of a movie junky as I am and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other What was the point again? Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. TERMINATOR SALVATION and AVATAR are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters from TAKEN to KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story or lack thereof stifled his performance. Probably.I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos DEFIANCE as Perseus' love interest Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her and things do happen.My final word of caution comes to those of us all of us struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism and sometimes occasionally Hollywood allows us to have it. But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!".

In doing so he based the stories on existing myths respecting the characters and plots as best as he could. Great work.Now why in 2010 they had to copy the copier and not the original it is a mystery for me. Scorpions AGAIN ? Cracken AGAIN ?

It wasn't half the movie and my wife wanted to leave the theater and how can you blame her? Since you heard the narration at the beginning of the movie you got that feeling there is something wrong here. And that feeling just grow every single minute while you watch the movie. The whole plot of the movie is based on the hate and resentment of the human against the Gods? In the original movie Perseus grows to be a hero because of love and because this was his destiny. In this movie Perseus is just a guy with bad attitude who suddenly changes from a fisher man to a one man army with a huge ego.It turns out that everyone knows but Zeus knows that Perseus was his son it doesn't make any sense to me. The only thing they respected from the original version was the name of the characters and they added a lot of unnecessary ones Io? The Hunters? The Genies? The crazy preacher at Argos? This was just an awful movie they destroyed one of my favorite movies with this remake. What was the deal with the joke about Bubo? I feel it like an insult to the original movie. Anyway I'm sure some people enjoyed this movie and that cool but if you ask me this was one waste of time and money and half the theater agreed with me I just saw them leave one by one.".

	schema:headline " Mishmash of the Titans...";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never seen the 1981 original version of Clash of the Titans. I wasn't originally planning on seeing this new updated version either. Going by the previews this looked like nothing more than a CGIfest...which is what it pretty much ended up being. To quote Sam Worthington from various interviews it's basically him in a skirt with a rubber sword killing monsters. If you're expecting anything more than that then yes you will probably be disappointed.Some of the cast manage to make the most of what they're given to work with. Having not seen Sam Worthington in anything prior to this film except Terminator Salvation I don't really have anything to compare his acting to. He was good in Terminator Salvation and he's good in this as well despite the occasional slipup of his accent. He serves his purpose as Perseus playing the action hero well enough. His interaction with the humans who accompany him on his journey is probably the most entertaining part of the film. Mads Mikkelsen who was a memorable villain in Casino Royale actually gets to play a fairly decent good guy in this film Draco. Sure it's the role of the typical grumpy guy who's reluctant to follow the saviour and is a bit of a bully teaching the hero how to fight and who eventually comes around to respecting the hero and ending up on good terms with him...but Mads manages to make his role a bit more than a cardboard cutout thankfully. The other men who accompany Perseus aren't too bad either they do provide a bit of humour but they're not given much character development at all. Actually there's very little development for any of the characters.As far as the gods are concerned they're basically just a bunch of folk who stand around in Cloud City I mean Olympus and talk. Liam Neeson isn't given a whole lot to work with as Zeus shining in his silver armour as brightly as Marlon Brando did in the original Superman movie wearing his tinfoil costume. Ralph Fiennes while good is kind of irritating with his raspy voice as Hades though thankfully that goes away by the end. The rest of the gods have jack squat to do or say. I really didn't like Jason Flemyng's satyr character. Alexa Davalos pretty much just plays the damsel in distress in the movie and leaves very little impression as Andromeda. Gemma Arterton as Io however proves to be the most successful female character in the movie. As a sort of angel on Perseus's shoulder she guides him teaches him and actually proves useful. Her and Worthington work well togetherhave good chemistry and I enjoyed watching the two of them share scenes. I was happy with how they ended up in the film.As for the FX the previews basically give it all away Clash of the CGI might have been more befitting a title for the film. Perseus fights giant scorpions Perseus fights the Kraken and Perseus fights Medusa. As largescale as the Kraken was I personally enjoyed Medusa more. The fight with her proved to be the most interesting of the many fights in the film. I liked the 'look'design for her and I also really enjoyed Pegasus the flying horse. I'll just come right out and say it the movie has many a flaw. The story isn't great the pace is off the writing is slapdash and most of the dialogue is sketchy at best. While the movie does try to get across a message it comes through in a somewhat haphazard sort of way. Having said that if you go into this film not expecting much more than a Monster Mash of the Titans...then hopefully it should prove to be entertaining enough. Crap of the Titans? Not quite. But at the same time it's kind of forgettable. As Worthington describes it it's a popcorn flick. Take from that what you will.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to start off by apologizing to all of the people who I assumed were giving this movie poor reviews out of loyalty for the original. Honestly they weren't harsh enough.This movie was awful I couldn't believe how terrible it was. This has nothing to do with the fact that the movie was not at all faithful to the actual myth of Perseus. As you will recall the original Clash of the Titans resembled very little of the myth. However the original movie had deeply involved characters an interesting plot that was well written and some decent action and special effects.What did this remake have? I'll tell you. It had plot holes big enough for a barge to fit through worthless characters who did nothing to help what little plot was there and a rather disappointing ending.The movie starts off with baby Perseus being found by a fisherman after he and his mother Danae were thrown into the sea. Danae died but Perseus survived. The fisherman raised Perseus with his wife and later his daughter. When Perseus is grown Hades attacks his family for no real reason than just because he could while at the same time the kingdom of Argos is declaring war on the gods once again for no real reason than because they could. Perseus is saved and is told by Hades that Zeus is his father. Why Hades would do that I have no idea. Up on Olympus Zeus is apparently finding out for himself that he has a demigod son which makes no sense because Zeus is the creator of Men he would HAVE to be aware that he has a son.Because of Argos's sudden desire to attack Zeus Hades declares that he will release the Kraken on them in ten days. They will only be spared by letting Andromeda be sacrificed to the Kraken. Again this didn't make sense. If Hades was mad at Argos he wouldn't give them a way out he would just destroy the kingdom. In the original story the sacrifice of Andromeda was brought on because of Cassiopeia's vanity and the insult it delivered Thetis. Here it was just like Hades thought it would be fun to see Andromeda chained to rock. Perseus agrees to help Argos not because of love for Andromeda but because he wants revenge against the gods. At this point Io shows up and talks a lot. That is pretty much all Io does throughout the movie is talk. My guess is that the writers wanted to introduce a strong woman to the plot instead what they introduced was a wasted character who actually had no business being in the myth.Hades meets up with Calibos and reveals his master plot to take over Olympus. Huh where have I seen this before? Oh yeah that's right in Hercules. It's a sad day when an action movie has to steal the plot of a Disney movie because they can't come up with anything on their own.What follows is a lot of action scenes which aren't half bad but are pretty worthless because they slow down the story. To be fair there isn't much of a story to slow down. They kill off several characters who mattered to nothing during the fight with Medusa. After Medusa is killed Calibos kills Io. I know that her death was supposed to be meaningful to Perseus but it just seemed odd. Their interactions before were not very intimate in fact there was only one scene that could be construed as some what romantic. Pegasus appears from no where and takes Perseus to Argos where the Kraken is being released. The battle between the Kraken and Perseus consists of the Kraken ripping down some buildings for about two minutes then Perseus turns him into stone with the head of Medusa. Then he sends Hades back to the Underworld my what marvelous revenge. You did a bad thing Hades now you go home. Yawn. Perseus saves Andromeda and then leaves her on a beach to go to some worthless rock in the ocean. Unlike in the original Perseus does not fall in love with Andromeda. It wasn't a shock since Andromeda did basically nothing useful except for give bread to children and dangle a hundred feet over the ocean. Perseus then meets Zeus who suddenly seems pleased with his son though Mankind still hates the gods. He then brings Io back to life so she and Perseus can be worthless forever.I gave this movie two stars because there were only two things good about it the CGI and the music. I'll stick to the original movie because while the graphics aren't as good as the remake at least I actually care for the characters and the storyline makes sense.".

Sam Worthington has proved himself to be a competent actor recently but his performance is just nauseating with his embarrassed delivery of wooden dialogue. The script is awful and the overblown spectacle of the entire thing is so selfindulgent that I was bored within the first 15 minutes.I will say however that the only redeeming factor is the film's action sequences. Though they do tend to drag on for nearly 10 minutes too long in every case they are well shot and the handheld camera adds to the effect of the battle's intensity.Slightly below average action film. Don't go expecting a faithful adaptation of the original myth or even a quality remake of Harryhausen's classic film.510".

In my naivety I couldn't see where Hollywood could go wrong after all it's never let us down in the past! Right?! With this being said I was therefore completely taken aback when the final credits rolled on this dismal dithering trainwreck of a film. Before I critique this film though I must warn you that there are possible spoilers below so if you are definitely going to watch this film don't read on! I find it difficult to know where to start with this film I think I'll first outline the few positives The CGI especially of the Kraken is very impressive Gemma Arterton is a stone cold fox it has a beginning a middle and an end. There that's just about it.Now for the negatives The dialogue is corny unlovable embarrassing to watch at times and so contrived that it actually makes you uncomfortable the exact same can be said of Sam Worthington and pretty much every other character in this tripe. The plot seems to make no sense as the Director spends next to no time on the background to the story things just seem to happen randomly and for no reason that you particularly care about. The action scenes are as boring and predictable as you could possibly imagine the giant scorpions in particular had me yawning. I'm not even exaggerating.On top of that I found myself not caring at all if the island gets destroyed at the end by the Kraken as both Perseus and Andromeda are so bland and shallow as characters that I felt no connection with them whatsoever. The 3D is also belowpar with everything appearing blurry and unfocused and it just seems like an unnecessary gimmick that was added on as an afterthought. The finale is also abysmal to the point of incredulity I point to the fact that Perseus spends more time chasing down one of those Hadesbirdcreatures than actually trying to kill the massive titan currently hellbent on destroying a civilisation. I also point to the cringeinducing comic relief of the scorpion ridden by two instantly forgettable characters helping out Perseus by killing one of the Hadesmonster things. My last point is focused at the anticlimactic defeat of the Kraken I mean just showing it the head? Is that really all it takes? A titan which was powerful enough for Gods to fear it being killed by a frightful stare? I know that was consistent with the original storyline but it was very disappointing all the same and you're left thinking... was that it? This film is another black mark on the copybook that is Hollywood high budget rubbish. Clash of the Titans would fit in nicely alongside The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and Transformers 2 as an example of how a big budget can totally ruin instead of enhancing a cinematic experience.Final Thoughts Go see the formidable and wonderful How to Train Your Dragon instead of this sleazy rambling thoughtless shallow pedantic embarrassment of a film.".

I know that was consistent with the original storyline but it was very disappointing all the same and you're left thinking... was that it? This film is another black mark on the copybook that is Hollywood high budget rubbish. Clash of the Titans would fit in nicely alongside The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor and Transformers 2 as an example of how a big budget can totally ruin instead of enhancing a cinematic experience.Final Thoughts Go see the formidable and wonderful How to Train Your Dragon instead of this sleazy rambling thoughtless shallow pedantic embarrassment of a film.";

I sat through the movie wondering why I don't care about any of these characters. On top of that I'm wondering why I spent the extra money to see it in 3D. The best 3D effects came during the opening credits. Other than that I could have thrown the glasses away. Now I know why James Cameron is not a big fan of making films 3D after the fact. To make a long story short I was incredibly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Go see the original Clash of the Titans if you want to lose yourself in a good movie. After seeing this one all I could think of was oh how the mighty titans have fallen.".

That aside though the nineteen eighty one version is a classic memorable slice of mythological nostalgia something the remake will not be in twenty nine years time.For me its flaws are many but the most notable are the scene choices of the director and the lazy reliance on CGI.Where are the elements that made the original story so compelling? The riddles of Calibos delivered to the dreaming Andromeda Perseus falling in love with her the REASON for his quest in the first instance the politics of the gods and their chesspiecelike manipulation of the mortals who worship them.Instead we have an inaccurate tale rushed through in small stuttering scenes and lacking in any creativity of its own.The actorsactresses assembled make a fine castreading but are universally wasted in their chosen roles. None of the gravitas of the original is conveyed by any character in this version.The CGI further reduces the movie's impact. The mythological beasts look cartoonish and hardly befitting an epic tale of such importance. Look to the original yet again to see how even stopmotion triumphs over CGI. In particular the scene in Medusa's lair is tense in the nineteen eighty one showing contrasting greatly with the routine ridiculous remake.That's not to say that CGI cannot work. Jurrasic Park is a rare example of effects being used well.Sam Worthington quickly becoming a name to avoid movies by has a character arc that is almost nonexistent such is the hurry to transform him from fisherman to warrior.

All things considered the original will remain a classic for some time despite the ropey effects while the remake will be quickly forgotten by a fickle audience looking for the next CGI bonanza.Just as Avatar before it Clash Of The Titans 2010 is a simple moneymaking machine not concerned for a moment with anything close to an imagination or REAL characters. Or for that matter with any heart.It will gross vast sums of money nonetheless which further proves that the public don't really want creative or intelligent movies Moon Pans Labyrinth Amelie but are content to settle for 'plastic' and patronising movies that disencourage thinking.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Clash of the Titans";
	schema:reviewBody "Clash of the Titans is one of the earliest films I can remember having watched it as a kid in a big theatre not the multiplexes we have today and I liked it so much it probably ranks up there as one film that I've watched the most times on television reruns or off a recorded video tape. The story's fairly simple but to a kid it had plenty of charm and a basic 101 guide to Greek mythology of which the promiscuity of the Greek gods struck me as quite odd save for the need to produce plenty of demigod heroes from which stories are spun of.Percy Jackson probably drew first blood in saturating the market about the new adventures of a fresh teenage demigod having him battle creatures similar to those found in this mythology. In fact Clash of the Titans would find it difficult to beat the fun factor of the original film and the modernized spin that Percy Jackson had to offer. There's little story here and everything that happened was a sad excuse to get the story quickly moving onto the next big set action sequence. Lead character motivations had been changed significantly especially with Andromeda Alexa Davalos being nothing more than a flower vase and having her romantic subplot with our hero Perseus Sam Worthington being totally removed. I felt that was the first sign of narrative trouble.Then it became more generic approaches in how to string the action scenes one after another. Each battle will last a significant amount of time then a little more posturing before going onto the next. It can easily be split into this sequence of scorpionsmedusa kraken and each creature design was a shadow to predecessors like Scorpionok's attack in Transformers Uma Thurman's rendition of Medusa and Hollywood's Godzilla flop coming complete with that foam on water approach to the mainland.If anyone wants to make a film about a hybrid character then look no further than Sam Worthington who has been half man half machine in Terminator Salvation half man half Na'vi in Avatar and now halfman halfgod who's tasked to save Andromeda of Argos from being monster sacrifice should he be able to defeat Hades' Kraken the source of his power and threat to mankind. Worthington seems pigeonholed into these kinds of role and because of Hollywood's current dearth of worthy action heroes Worthington becomes the latest It boy with his physique and perpetual scowl being suited perfectly well into this scarcity of actors who can act with their fists without the compelling need to launch into lengthy dialogue as a professional and career development.Otherwise the other star studded cast don't do much but pose and prance about in their costumes with Liam Neeson looking constricted by his Zeus armour Ralph Fiennes playing Voldermort all over again with his rendition of Hades and Mads Mikkelsen as Drago the Argos general who has the nicest smirk caught on screen. Gemma Arterton is a surprise inclusion in the film as Io the immortal which is a new character and given a lot more significance in the mythos now and is in part one of the major changes in Perseus philosophy tutoring and motivation so much so that if I were to use a modern term the word cougar would suit their relationship just fine.And it is these kinds of little artistic license taken that will likely leave the purist in you perturbed. Bobo the Golden Owl has a quick cameo to appease fans but like the gods who are never satisfied with the pittance of worship obtained from the humans we too think that it's not enough since Pegasus too went through a none too subtle change in skin colour. Sorry but to me Pegasus the winged horse will forever remain white. There are a few conversational pieces in the film that brilliantly introduces us to the world of the jealous Greek gods and they work wonderfully such as their innate differences and why the brothers Zeus and Hades hate each other so much but some were rather cringeworthy especially when modern curses somehow found their place in a swords and sandals film as this.I suppose you'll know by now that the film was never shot using 3D technology and that it was only during post production thanks to the mega box office success of Avatar when it was decided to have a 3D version made for this film as well. The result? Millions spent enhancing nothing. Sure there's depth of field but nothing to wow a jaded audience familiar with what a 3D film is expected to bring to the table. In fact this film would be better off seen in a digital 2D format since none of the action sequence even had a whiff of a suggestion of being in your face since after all it was conceptualized for a flat presentation.Bottom line it's extremely sterile and devoid of soul whereas the original film had plenty of heart and charming stop motion special effects to alleviate it to cult status. This one will likely be forgotten since it's nothing more than mediocre drama and ordinary set action pieces though I will not deny that its marketing would ensure that it will garner some decent cash from the Easter holiday market segment. The original is so much better since this is all generic action and little charm.".

Worthington seems pigeonholed into these kinds of role and because of Hollywood's current dearth of worthy action heroes Worthington becomes the latest It boy with his physique and perpetual scowl being suited perfectly well into this scarcity of actors who can act with their fists without the compelling need to launch into lengthy dialogue as a professional and career development.Otherwise the other star studded cast don't do much but pose and prance about in their costumes with Liam Neeson looking constricted by his Zeus armour Ralph Fiennes playing Voldermort all over again with his rendition of Hades and Mads Mikkelsen as Drago the Argos general who has the nicest smirk caught on screen. Gemma Arterton is a surprise inclusion in the film as Io the immortal which is a new character and given a lot more significance in the mythos now and is in part one of the major changes in Perseus philosophy tutoring and motivation so much so that if I were to use a modern term the word cougar would suit their relationship just fine.And it is these kinds of little artistic license taken that will likely leave the purist in you perturbed. Bobo the Golden Owl has a quick cameo to appease fans but like the gods who are never satisfied with the pittance of worship obtained from the humans we too think that it's not enough since Pegasus too went through a none too subtle change in skin colour. Sorry but to me Pegasus the winged horse will forever remain white. There are a few conversational pieces in the film that brilliantly introduces us to the world of the jealous Greek gods and they work wonderfully such as their innate differences and why the brothers Zeus and Hades hate each other so much but some were rather cringeworthy especially when modern curses somehow found their place in a swords and sandals film as this.I suppose you'll know by now that the film was never shot using 3D technology and that it was only during post production thanks to the mega box office success of Avatar when it was decided to have a 3D version made for this film as well. The result? Millions spent enhancing nothing. Sure there's depth of field but nothing to wow a jaded audience familiar with what a 3D film is expected to bring to the table. In fact this film would be better off seen in a digital 2D format since none of the action sequence even had a whiff of a suggestion of being in your face since after all it was conceptualized for a flat presentation.Bottom line it's extremely sterile and devoid of soul whereas the original film had plenty of heart and charming stop motion special effects to alleviate it to cult status. This one will likely be forgotten since it's nothing more than mediocre drama and ordinary set action pieces though I will not deny that its marketing would ensure that it will garner some decent cash from the Easter holiday market segment. The original is so much better since this is all generic action and little charm.";

The 3D was awful and I found myself squinting at times just to see 3D glasses make the screen darker. Here are some things that I found perplexing in this film Why was it necessary to kill Perseus's mother in the beginning? Her predicament was the reason Perseus set out on his adventure.Why would Hades begin a spree like that of a serial killer? The three brothers Poseidon Zeus and Hades decided amongst themselves who would rule whatthere was no trickery involved.Why was the Kracken sea monster a child of Hades? It came from the sea so should it not have been Poseidon's child? It was Andromeda's parents who angered Poseidon and caused the Gods to send the sea monster to destroy their city.Why was it necessary to add the cougarlike character Io? It was Athena who coached Perseus on where to find the necessary equipment to defeat Medusa.Why were additional new characters addedthe black magic beings in the desert? They look like something stolen from Star Wars Tusken Raiders perhaps.Why was a task from the myth of Psyche and Eros stolen and used in this film? What am I talking about you ask? Perseus never bribed the ferryman Charon to get to the underworld. Psyche bribed Charon to complete an impossible task given to her by Aphrodite. Does Hollywood think no one reads anymore or that no one will notice the stealing of material from another myth? This really angered me Why the team of men to defeat Medusa? It would have been much more interesting to see Perseus using the winged sandals mirrored shield sword and helmet of invisibility that were given to him. If Hollywood wanted to addlib why not add in Medusa's sisters after her decapitation? Pegasus was born of the blood of Medusa and Poseidon. The winged sandals made Perseus's getaway easy not Pegasus. Why the color change for Pegasus? Why was Zeus wrapped in a glowing tin foil looking war suit? Andromeda became Perseus's mate not the cougar Io. Why was it necessary to change that? Why why why? There are many other distortions of the story in this new movie that irk me I will just stop here. I should have known better... to expect more of Hollywood was foolish of me.".

	schema:headline " More than just a romanticcomedy Breakfast is a real love story";
	schema:reviewBody "The main reason I like Breakfast at Tiffany's so much is because I think it is one of those rare romantic comedies that actually transcends the genre and becomes a genuine love story. I have a theory that most love stories that get made aren't really about love. They're either about romance or lust. I don't think that many people in Hollywood or society in general today even know what real deep meaningful love really is. Breakfast at Tiffany's on the other hand is one of the most beautiful real love stories ever told.SPOILERS Tiffany's is basically about a woman who is incapable of loving. She considers herself a free spirit a wild thing an independent adventurous woman who lives for the moment. She is also a bit of a social outcast because her profession is essentially that of a call girl. Whether or not she actually sleeps with all of these men or just some of them who pay her is unclear but she definitely uses them. She is not a woman of high moral character and despite her constant up attitude and optimistic outlook she is really quite lonely. It's all a reflection of how she really feels about herself I think. It's almost as if she needs to keep trying new things and distracting herself from the truth because if she were to actually take a moment to stop and look at herself she would be confronted with how unimpressive and ordinary she really is. She would also have to face the fact that she is not really that stylish. She is an actor playing a part. Holly Golightly isn't even her real name. As I said she is incapable of loving others because she doesn't really even love herself. She feels she is unlovable. Her selfperception is really quite low and that's why she concocts these huge elaborate fantasies about being elegant classy and witty. When I first saw the film I was so impressed by the charm and beauty of Audrey Hepburn that I instantly fell in love with her. The more I watch the movie the more I realize how utterly sad and pathetic yet still likable her character really is. As Marty Balsam says in the film She's a phony but she's a real phony. Paul Varjak the character played by George Peppard pre ATEAM days of course is in a similar situation. He is also playing a role and has a lousy selfimage. He wants to write but has had such a hard time at it that he has resigned himself to taking money from a married rich woman who considers him to be her good time on the side for his living. Paul and Holly start out as simple neighbors later become friends and eventually fall in love which ends up scaring the pepper out of Holly. She's okay flirting with someone but as soon as she crosses that line over into falling for someone she becomes afraid and runs away. She sees love as a cage something that stifles people and sucks the life out of them. She needs help. She needs someone to love her and she needs to be able to love them back. This man is the perfect one for her because he needs her just as much as she needs him. They can help each other. They can lift each other up. By themselves they are nothing but together they are complete. They are two miserable people who can find happiness in one another. I like movies about redemption. Stories about otherwise lowly people who are raised to the heights of happiness through love without it seeming forced or sentimental are exceptionally rare but when they do show up they tend to appeal to me that's the reason why I like the story to Sabrina so much too. I will never EVER forget that last scene in Breakfast at Tiffany's where Holly is finally confronted with the painful truth that despite all her attempts to deny herself to hide from her own ordinariness nothing about her has really changed. As Paul says No matter where you go you just keep running into yourself. She admits that she is lonely and unhappy. She goes back for the cat that she set free moments earlier upon realizing that she was coming dangerously close to owning him. In going back for the cat she is really going back for herself. She sees herself as the cat and in fact there is frequent imagery throughout the film that connects them Holly wearing the cat mask that she steals from the shop Nine Lives being the name of the book that Paul wrote etc.. She didn't want to give him a name because she didn't want him to belong to her she would consider that caging the animal. So she called him simply cat but over time Cat ended up becoming his actual name. In reclaiming the cat she is sort of reclaiming her own life. For a few moments it looks like Cat may be gone forever but when she hears the soft meow and pulls him out of a cardboard box she is elated. She is the happiest woman on earth. Like the cat she was lost but now is found. She embraces the cat and kisses her love Paul as they stand in the rain. The music swells Gotta love that Moon River song and the screen fades to black. It is in my opinion one of the greatest endings of any movie ever.".

The star wasn't much more enthusiastic she never considered it among her best work. And the reviews were mixed. But regardless of what Truman Capote Audrey Hepburn or the critics thought about it the public adored itand the image of Audrey Hepburn wearing a black evening dress nibbling pastry and window shopping has passed into our cultural iconography.The film is indeed lightweight stuff. Audrey Hepburn is a New York goodtime girl who makes a living by clipping her wealthy escorts for fifty here and fifty there. When she meets handsome George Pepparda writer who makes ends meet by trading favors with society matron Patricia Nealcan love be far behind? But Audrey's mysterious past and her determination to marry rich George's status as a kept boytoy and their occasionally questionable associates provide plenty of complications to fill out the story.What makes the film work is the remarkable charm of its two stars. Most of the attention goes to Audrey Hepburn and the film shows her to remarkable advantage she is a remarkable actress personality and beauty and she works wonders with the ultralight script. But when it comes to charm George Peppard is no slouch either the film catches him at the height of his early goldenboy good looks and he is the perfect foil for Hepburn in both their comic and dramatic scenes. Mickey Rooney's excessive performance as Yunioshi aside the supporting cast is also very entertaining with Patricia Neal Buddy Ebsen Martin Balsam and Dorothy Whitney all give enjoyable turns. The film looks great make sure you get the widescreen version the score which includes Moon River is excellent and director Blake Edwards keeps everything moving at a pleasant pace. This a great film to cozy up with on a cold nightromantic entertaining and as comforting as a cup of hot chocolate. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "I've loved Breakfast at Tiffany's since I was nine. Even before I completely understood about Holly's profession I was captivated by the grace and magic that was Audrey Hepburn.George Peppard plays Paul Varjak a writer who has to earn his living through a wealthy socialite Patricia Neal as her kept man. Audrey who plays Holly Golightly is a golddigging call girl who is looking for the right rich man to marry. Though you would think these two would be unflattering characters they are both very charming and put on phony personas especially in Holly's case in order to survive.You have to marvel at how a woman like Audrey could look so good in anything she wore. At the beginning of the movie when she first meets Peppard she's only wearing a simple white shirt that she wears as a nightgown or at the party scene when she first comes out and greets her friend O.J. Berman wearing nothing but a sheet made up to look like a dress! Gorgeous!It's a marvelous piece of acting when Holly first meets Paul in her apartment and she's talking about how she has to get ready to meet one of her clients in jail Sally Tomato and she's talking about her profession looking at herself in the mirror getting dressed asking Paul to find one of her shoes etc. and then voila! the famous basic black dress and hat with the wide brim. Very stylish  and in the scene she is given much to work with the way she has to juggle the dialogue and the action of what she is doing all at once. Very natural and sophisticated at the same time.Audrey is very believable as Holly because her character is someone who is pretending to be sophisticated hanging around with phony people but really comes from humble beginnings. Once in a while you will hear in her voice the countrygirl drawl and you will see through the facade of Holly Golightly who she really is. George Peppard is also very handsome and believable as the starving writer who also has to sell himself out in order to earn a living.Many complaints have been made about Mickey Rooney and the stereotypical portrayal of the landlord Mr. Yunioshi. Yes it is stereotyped but nonetheless I still thought it was funny. The party scene is one of the best in the movie  hilarious! Wonderful score by Henry Mancini. Of course it's a classic scene when Holly pulls up in front of Tiffany's in the New York taxi drinking coffee and eating a danish in front of the window. New York City itself is like a vibrant interesting character in the movie. I could go on and on.And to top it all off it's a very romantic love story about two people who find happiness in the crazy mixedup world we live in. A classic. Recommended to anyone who loves old Hollywood cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "An army of fans consider this Hepburn's signature role and in many ways it is even if she overcame miscasting to portray it. Based on a rather biting novella by Truman Capote he somewhat surprisingly wanted Marilyn Monroe to play the role. The casting of Hepburn couldn't be more different yet she made it her own and in the process created an icon that is every bit as lasting as Marilyn's skirtoverthesubwaygrate or Bette Davis's offtheshoulder chainsmoking Margo Channing. She plays an offbeat effortlessly sophisticated party girl in New York City who subsists on the favors of various rich men. Though her livelihood couldn't be more tasteless somehow Hepburn's presence adds a sheen of innocence and sweetness to it. When blocked writer Peppard moves in upstairs kept by married socialite Neal the two find themselves developing a friendship which eventually begins to turn into love. But since they are both people who use their bodies to earn their keep and are heavily dependent on others the chances of their relationship lasting are slim at best. To read the above synopsis one would expect a gritty vulgar film. However in director Blake Edwards' hands and with Hepburn floating around in exquisite Givenchy gowns the movie is a candy box of color style humor and romance.Even when she's hungover or just getting home from an allnighter as in the famous opening scene Hepburn strikes a graceful and glamorous figure. In fact it's when she's trying to act disoriented or disheveled that her performance is at it's weakest. It's as if she was so inherently stylish that she had to try too hard to present anything else! She does a very fine job with the role even if the character's past is nothing short of preposterous. Peppard comes off as blandly attractive but wooden. His arrogance regarding his role fiercely protecting the traditional leading man image not only undercut his own performance but also slighted that of Neal's who was diminished as a result. However sentimental filmgoers probably prefer his more heroic approach and Neal would certainly recoup her losses earning an Oscar a short time later for Hud. The most controversial aspect of the film is Rooney's portrayal of an Asian man who lives above Hepburn and who is awakened at all hours by her lifestyle. Whether or not one is offended by the overthetop stereotype of the buck teeth and slant eyes the role is not funny anyway! It's all way too forced and obvious with his pratfalls in sight long before they occur. A lamp exists RIGHT over his bed for the express purpose of giving him something to hit his head on continuously. Move it already! There are many memorable moments in the film including a sequence of Hepburn and Peppard doing things they've never done before Hepburn sitting on the fire escape plaintively singing the Oscarwinning song Moon River which is used throughout the film by master composer Henry Mancini and wacky party scene a prelude to Edwards' The Party? in which all sorts of outre things take place including the cry Timber! when a tipsy guest begins to collapse. There's a surprising frankness for the time regarding Peppard and Neal's relationship. It seems to be one of the earliest Hollywood films in which the leading man is implied to be nude under the covers in his bed. The film is not without its flaws. Some of the dialogue is annoyingly indulgent and the storyline is fairly patchy with a tacked on ending. Still with the sparkling presence of Hepburn in some mindblowing hats and costumes and the slick work of Edwards it is easy entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Breakfast at Tiffany's is a mostly charming film which serves as a wonderful showcase for the great Audrey Hepburn. In her portrayal of Holly Golightly Hepburn created one of the most iconic characters in film history. This is a memorable film and it's Hepburn who makes it so. She is at the center of everything that goes on in the film and you can't help but be charmed by Holly Golightly. The movie has its flaws most notably one incredibly unfortunate casting decision but all these years later it is rightly remembered fondly by most who have had the pleasure of seeing it.Holly Golightly makes her living as an escort but it's not as unseemly as it might seem. What she really is more than anything else is an extroverted Manhattan socialite around whom all kinds of craziness swirls. That craziness is best typified in a famous party scene in Holly's apartment. There are so many people crammed into Holly's little apartment there's so much going on that you don't even know where to look. But inevitably the eye is drawn back to Holly herself. The character has such style and charisma as of course does the actress playing her. Everyone remembers the famous black dress but the beauty and elegance of Audrey Hepburn shine through no matter what Holly Golightly's wearing. Heck she could wear a sheet and make it seem elegant. In fact she does. And that sums up Holly Golightly rather nicely. Beautiful charming engaging...and more than a touch eccentric.It's Audrey's movie through and through and she is never anything less than wonderful in her performance. Playing opposite her in the key male role is George Peppard and he at times comes across as being a little wooden maybe somewhat dull. But perhaps his character is just suffering in comparison to Holly Golightly who is many things dull certainly not one of them. Buddy Ebsen has a small role but an important one as it is his character who provides some insight into who Holly really is or at least who she used to be. We come to learn that Holly has pretty much reinvented herself and there are some wistful moments as we see why she may have felt the need to do so. There will be some roadblocks thrown up in the way of Holly's seemingly blissful existence and as she confronts these obstacles there are times where you know she's doing the wrong thing. But you love her anyway and just hold out hope she'll get it right in the end. That's the irresistible charm of Audrey Hepburn working its magic.It must be said that for all its charm the film does have one serious black mark against it. Mickey Rooney's portrayal of Holly's bucktoothed slanteyed stereotyped Japanese neighbor Mr. Yunioshi is absolutely appalling. It's the type of thing you'd expect from a film made in the 1920s. By 1961 you would have hoped people would have known better. Apparently not. Every time this character appears on the screen you can't help but cringe. The character takes you out of the movie watching experience entirely. You don't see him as a character named Mr. Yunioshi all you see is Mickey Rooney in hideous yellowface makeup. Awful. And for a character meant to serve as comic relief even had an Asian actor been cast there is no way around the fact that the character is just not funny at all. It's the one major flaw in a film which while maybe not an alltime classic is certainly charming and enjoyable throughout. And as a showcase for the talents and elegance of Audrey Hepburn it could not work any better.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am never sure which Breakfast at Tiffany's is. I can certainly think of movies which more accurately portray the human condition but of few that are more fun.Neither Holly nor Paul seem to represent real people. Their attraction which is the focal point of the movie is a character unto itself. Paul sees Holly as scared vulnerable and in need of rescue and enjoys his role as potential knight in shining armor to her damsel in distress. She is drawn to him because he sees beyond her facade of fabulousness to the scared little girl she is inside and which she tries not that hard really at all to hide. Adding to her attraction to him is the fact that he stands up to her when she treats him shoddily. This probably does not happen to her too often and it intrigues her. These are mostly the tricks a romance novelist uses to keep readers baited and rooting for a fictional possibly doomed romance to work and do not reflect the real nature of love. There is however enough chemistry genuine affection and respect between the two characters to keep the story from seeming utterly implausible.Of course a movie doesn't have to be realistic to realistically portray what is right and what is wrong with the world we live in. Breakfast at Tiffany's doesn't do a whole lot of that either though. After watching I can never pinpoint one solid message from it. What it does have a lot of as many others have pointed out is stylish witty good fun. This is almost always the movie I choose on the rare occasions when my husband is working late my son is asleep I have energy to spare and good bottle of wine just begging to be uncorked. Believable or not it is welltold and compelling and remains one of the better movies a gal can lose herself in.".

I just look her beautiful black dress and her hair up in a bun sure shes always a beautiful and great actress so Hollywood would expect her to have good looks in her roles!I honestly didn't think her character needed a lover she would've been better off if she didn't bother with a lover and look after herself more. In my personal opinion I didn't think George Peppard was a good lover for her I mean like they should've got a better actor to play her lover. He looked rather like a boy than a man. He probably was in his 20's while doing this but same time I personally didn't think he was a good match for Hepburn tbh..Its a great entertaining film anyway I give it a 810 including Audrey Hepburns singing!".

I mean how would one not be having married a dirt farmer at fourteen run away to the city to become a free spirit and survive on fifty bucks a throw while partying their life away? Underneath the glitz and glamour of Holly's life was a troubling aspect of alienation and despair that couldn't be easily fixed by a next door neighbor 'kept' by an older woman. It was the perfect set up for that happy ending I think most viewers expect and which the movie delivered but lacking in virtually any credibility when one really stops to think about it.And yet the movie does serve up it's share of entertainment value. Hepburn is very pleasing to the eye and her fashion sense is exquisite she even wears a bed sheet glamorously. If I had to guess the character of Rusty Trawler Stanley Adams looked to me like a standin for the novel's writer Truman Capote though that idea was given less credence when the newspaper headline declared he took his fourth wife. And gosh up till now I thought the worst characterization of an Asian in a movie was James Cann's impression of a Chinese man in El Dorado but Mickey Rooney ran the table here on that score. What was anyone thinking about when they came up with the Yunioshi character? Pretty pathetic.But as a time capsule reminder of New York City life in the early Sixties this one has to be classic. Get a load of the vendor prices in Central Park  a frankfurter for twenty cents peanuts and popcorn for a dime and if you're willing to pony up a couple more pennies a box of Crackerjacks for twelve cents! I know it was a half century ago but those numbers just don't sound right to me but I was just a kid back then and not paying attention.Well if there's a message here it would probably be Lula Mae's advice to Doc Golightly Buddy Ebsen  You musn't give your heart to a wild thing even though that idea seemed to capture the spirit of Holly's confused character. I'm sure the story's happy ending elicited more than it's share of teardrops for movie audiences of the Sixties coming as it did in the face of Paul Varjak's George Peppard challenge to break free of her cage and stop running into herself. You just had to wonder if she could do that after the final credits rolled.".

	schema:reviewBody "Checking out both the original novel and the Wikipedia article on Breakfast At Tiffany's I was surprised to see how different Truman Capote's vision of this story was. Capote who wanted Marilyn Monroe cast as Holly Golightly lived to see Audrey Hepburn make his literary creation one of her best cinematic creations. I think given Marilyn's track record for behavioral problems on film sets Capote Blake Edwards the director and everyone else concerned with Breakfast At Tiffany's probably dodged a bullet. Capote's story is set in the Forties and the film is contemporary 1961 when it was filmed. There's no real plot to it Capote did a character study and so is this. It's about two people and the fascination that George Peppard's character develops for the unconventionality of Holly Golightly as Hepburn essays her.Hepburn is the kept woman of a cross section of the male species and Peppard is the boy toy of another woman who rents in their apartment Patricia Neal. Neal who would win her Oscar the following year for Hud has her character as curiously underdeveloped. It's the main weakness of Breakfast At Tiffany's.The strength is of course Audrey Hepburn who took Capote's character completely over and it's her vision of the story that we see when the film is broadcast. She's an amoral minx who in the end realizes that her life is really meaningless. Breakfast At Tiffany's won two Oscars both for Henry Mancini for Best Musical Scoring and Best Original Song for Moon River. That song is best known for Andy Williams's rendition but there are also superb recordings by Frank Sinatra and Tony Martin. Hepburn got a nomination for Best Actress and the film was also nominated for Best ArtSet Decoration for a color film and Best Screenplay adapted from another medium in this case Capote's novella. Considering all the changes made maybe the credit should have read inspired by Truman Capote's work. In any event this film belongs in the top rank of the works of Audrey Hepburn.".

Before Roman Holiday I had never seen an Audrey Hepburn film and I have to say that I am becoming more and more of a fan of her's. She was so beautiful and very talented not to mention she seemed like a very classy and elegant lady. But the film itself was a pretty good one this was the movie that made romantic comedy clichs so that's why I let it go so easily. It seemed like this film had what a lot of romantic comedy films steal now a days.Holly is a huge socialite in her grand world she finds happiness and joy in the jewelery store Tiffany's. She is also being paid 100 dollars to visit a drug Mafia leader in prison to make his day. But things begin to change when a very handsome man moves in down stairs from her Paul but she calls him Fred since he looks like her brother. He's also in a similar situation where his Decorator is paying him for a good time. But together they find themselves helping one another and realizing they may need each other.Breakfast at Tiffany's is an elegant classic that I would rate up with Seven Year Itch starring Marilyn Monroe. It has great humor and sizzling romance that anyone could fall in love with. Audrey Hepburn took on a role which the character could have been neuritic and annoying but she made Holly into someone every woman would like to be. Her and George were great together I would highly recommend Breakfast at Tiffany's it's a great classic.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is an amazing achievement for Audrey Hepburn. The part was clearly written for Marilyn Monroe. To think of Hepburn as a backwoods girl is absurd. Monroe would have made a meal of this and it would have been her signature role. But she was in the midst of her emotional troubles at this time and the role was given to a very different actress in Hepburn who produced a very different Holly Golightly. And yet she did it so well that it became HER signature role instead. It's not unusual for an actor to make a role his own such that you can't picture someone else in the role even thought there are actually many who could have played it. But to take a role intended specifically for another one for which one does not appear suited and make that your ownwell that's a great acting achievement. It certainly is Audrey Hepburn's greatest role a performance with many more complexities than any other she ever gave. It's also a fabulous film. I love beauty emerging form contradiction like a rhapsody emerging from apparently unrelated themes and musical noises. Here we have something that is at times a wacky comedy a breezy romance and yet is full of depth and drama. So many things have happened and we have been introduced to so many characters at the end it's amazing they all fit together. I also like the bravery of doing a story about two people who are basically prostitutes in 1961. It's daring yet there's nothing sleazy about he film because it concentrates on who these people are as people what they are not what they do. And the film has the most eclectic cast I can imagine. Romantic heroine Audrey Hepburn. Method actor George Peppard. Sleek mankiller Patricia Neal. Actor's actor Martin Balsam. Old reliable Buddy Ebsen just before he hammed it up as Jed Clampett playing a subtle and touching version of the same thing. Mickey Rooney provides the only jarring note with his scenery chewing performance as the Japanese landlord something we could surely have done without. Did you know that Audrey's gangster sugar daddy is played by Alan Reed the voice of Fred Flintstone? And don't forget John McGiver's delicate turn as the clerk at Tiffany's. You can debate the virtues of a film into the night. What really counts in the end is Does it stay in the memory vividly years later? Would you like to watch it again? And when you watch it again does it take you back to when you first saw it? Breakfast at Tiffany's certainly does. It will always be the prize in the crackerjack box.".

Rooney's Asian caricature is pretty offensive but a worse problem I think is the dialog throughout which is very arch and mannered and writerly sounding as well as the nods to Hollywood convention the party the gamboling about NYC  the silly paternal Mafioso  one can imagine somebody insisting that there better be some fun dammit in this movie. Most importantly there's a general restraint throughout the picture the real story here is sad and dark and it's aching to get through but instead it's stamped down with a lot of overlycute Hollywood bits.Yet that dark story is powerful. Both Peppard and Hepburn are badly damaged people the fact that they get together albeit awkwardly is a tribute to the magic of movies but their relationship full of quiet suffering and little hurts seems very real to me. Peppard is effective as a nice guy who's falling for the wrong woman Hepburn has some pretty awful dialog but her performance as a woman who's selfdeluding as a way to defend herself from despair as Martin Balsam says she's a real fake is very strong. This is what I liked best about the movie.Well that and Audrey Hepburn herself  one of those performers for whom movies were invented she is just amazing to watch.

I didn't mind Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi I forgot it was him and since the movie's edge softens a bit as the film goes on it needs Yunioshi for some of that lowdown comedy inherent in the film's first hour. George Peppard as neighbor Paul is perhaps too smooth and a readymatch for Holly he only bristles a bit early on but Peppard as an actor is suitable for Hepburn he allows her room to sparkle while keeping the film grounded. His frequent bemused looks are charming and I thought his scenes with Patricia Neal were very good the filmmakers are a little tough on Neal she's made to seem decadent and lascivious and when Peppard calls her on it I'm not sure if we're supposed to feel sympathy for her though I did.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a little odd watching BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and realizing that of it's main stars only Patricia Neal Mickey Rooney and Jose Luis de Villalonga who played the wealthy Brazilian in the movie are still alive as is the director Blake Edwards. Audrey Hepburn George Peppard Buddy Ebsen Martin Balsam John McGiver Alan Reed Jr. Stanley Adams and Dorothy Whitney are all gone as is Truman Capote and George Axelrod and the cats who played Cat.The city of New York is still a fascinating one but much of it has changed. For instance the card catalogs of the 42nd Street Public Library that Holly Golightly and Paul Varjak visit are not in those card drawers as they showed in the film scene. They were photocopied into multivolume sets of card catalog volumes in the early 1970s and since then the remainder have been put on computers. Even in the late 1960s and early 1970s the reading room did not have any sculptures in them  just desks and library shelves and the central area to pick up the books you ordered.The period of the film is quite set in New York City in 1959  61. Take a look at the Halloween masks on sale in the Woolworth's that Holly and Paul steal. Among the masks they try on is one of Huckleberry Hound the HannaBarbera cartoon character who was popular in 1960. It is mentioned on this thread that the mask reminds us of the lyrics in MOON RIVER regarding my huckleberry friend. But that reference was to Huckleberry Finn and his being found on the Mississippi River possibly the original for the Moon River of the song. It had nothing to do with the cartoon character.Come to think of it Woolworth's itself is a thing of the past  it having gone out of business five years ago. But the story is still quite compelling and Holly remains Audrey Hepburn's best remembered performance even more than her Royal Princess in ROMAN HOLIDAY. Only her performance as Eliza Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY is as recalled by name and Holly is more glamorous from the start.Holly is not really Holly but Lula Mae Barnes Golightly  one time second wife of Doc Golightly Ebsen who tired of country living and got an annulment and has only tried to get some financial footing to help herself and her brother Fred who is currently in the army. She has always found life hard Doc tells Paul that Lula and Fred were caught by him stealing turkey eggs when kids. So Holly discovers that only if she can be a sophisticate can she break her poverty routes. She is discovered by Hollywood movie boss O. J. Berman Balsam who classifies her as a real phony meaning that she really buys the glitz and color he has taught her. But Holly is a call girl and she has not found the man who can rescue her and brother Fred from poverty.She does find a fellow drifter  Paul Varjak a writer and kept man for wealthy Mrs. Failenson. He is living in the apartment above Holly's and the two do become close in the original story they only become confidants  Paul in the novel is gay. Slowly in the film Paul finds that Holly is such a fragile type that he falls in love with her  unlike himself she needs protection. But she is determined to hook her millionaire  so she goes after Rusty Trawler the ninth richest man in the world and Jose Da Silva Pereira  the wealthy Brazilian. In the meantime to pay the rent between her dates Holly agrees to deliver weather reports from Sing Sing prison where she visits mobster Sally Tomato Alan Reed in a really nice little cameo. She is unaware of the meaning of those messages.Holly is something of a classy featherhead not being able to understand the reports of snow in New Orleans from Uncle Sally nor being able to understand how she gets under the skin of her neighbor the photographer Mr. Yunioshi Mickey Rooney. She drives the latter crazy by her constantly waking him up to let her into the apartment when she forgets her passkey and also by her loud parties. Yet even Yunioshi is secretly captivated by this annoying neighbor notice how she gets him to calm down by promising to allow him he'll photograph her in the buff.All the performances are fine of note see Ebsen in his saddest part as the brokenhearted Doc but notice too John McGiver's fine salesman at Tiffany's. Rooney's Yunioshi is now considered racist but it was not seen as such in 1961  in fact it was normal compare to Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON. On the whole the film still is well worth watching.".

It turned out to be the most disappointing film versions of all the times.First there is no trace of the original message of the novelI hear that the author was not very happy about film version either which gives no hint of any sugarysweet romance at all and the character of Hollie had been grossly transformed if not mutilated.Second the actors and their protagonists are a horrendous mismatchAudrey Hepburn with all my sincerest admiration and love for herplays some girl poor Truman Capote had never dreamed about of putting into his novel too naive and pure too highclass and too sweet to be a real phony as one of the film's characters O.J.Berman calls her.Mr Peppard is absolutely wooden so he looks and sounds the phoniest of all with his love confessions.Mickey Rooney is a bad really bad! caricature of a Japanese  forget about political correctness it is just bad taste!man. It is a great pity that a really wonderful piece of writing has had such a disappointing destiny in Hollywood! Though for those who know Hollywood tastes and culture it is no surprise at all.".

	onyx:emotionText "The famous film Breakfast at Tiffany's is supposedly based upon a brilliant novel by Truman Capote.Excellent music by Henry Mancini the striking elegance and charm of Audrey Hepburn the big name of Blake Edwards as the one of the best Hollywood entertainers promised an unforgettable picture.Alas! It turned out to be the most disappointing film versions of all the times.First there is no trace of the original message of the novelI hear that the author was not very happy about film version either which gives no hint of any sugarysweet romance at all and the character of Hollie had been grossly transformed if not mutilated.Second the actors and their protagonists are a horrendous mismatchAudrey Hepburn with all my sincerest admiration and love for herplays some girl poor Truman Capote had never dreamed about of putting into his novel too naive and pure too highclass and too sweet to be a real phony as one of the film's characters O.J.Berman calls her.Mr Peppard is absolutely wooden so he looks and sounds the phoniest of all with his love confessions.Mickey Rooney is a bad really bad! caricature of a Japanese  forget about political correctness it is just bad taste!man. It is a great pity that a really wonderful piece of writing has had such a disappointing destiny in Hollywood! Though for those who know Hollywood tastes and culture it is no surprise at all.";

	schema:headline " Sappy romantic comedy made charming by Hepburn";
	schema:reviewBody "Quelle movie! Mushy and improbable but a fun frothy light hearted bit of romantic fluff meant to be taken as a love story rather than a sociological study. It's a film most notable to me for Audrey Hepburn's amazing performance her lovely rendition of the haunting sentimental Moon River from her balcony and the dramatic rainy ending that foolishly made me cry. Basically it's the classic tale of a damsel in distress and a knight in shining armour who sets forth to rescue her.Holly Golightly is a vibrant and free spirited creature kept in a New York City apartment by various grateful wealthy men who maintain her apparently glamorous lifestyle. She is desperate for a millionaire husband to take care of her and her beloved brother Fred. Frequently hung over or returning home from an all night outing Holly is befriended by a handsome unsuccessful writer named Paul Varjak who has just moved into her apartment building. Paul doesn't judge Holly as he is in something of a similar position having a rich lady friend of his own. Holly fears being owned or making any sort of commitment even to her marmalade cat which she refuses to name lest she grow too attached. Instead she calls this very endearing stray simply Cat. To counteract what she labels the 'mean reds' worse than the blues Holly likes to visit Tiffany's which seems to impart to her a sense of security. At the beginning of the movie she appears breakfasting on coffee and a pastry while window shopping there hence the title. As for Tiffany's itself it actually comes across here as quite an obliging understanding establishment!Audrey Hepburn makes this movie with her marvelous portrayal of the superficially breezy and quirky Holly actually a very frightened insecure vulnerable and unfulfilled woman. However I have read that her portrayal of what is essentially a call girl is the one part for which Hepburn herself felt she was miscast. Holly is a gal from humble roots but has adopted a sophisticated veneer and keeps company with assorted phony people. No lady wears her clothes more elegantly than Audrey Hepburn does here notably the classic little black dress outrageous wide brimmed hats pearls tiaras and oversized sunglasses. Also no other actress could so convincingly invite herself into the bed of a man presumed naked with whom she's barely acquainted and still come across as charming and innocent!Paul is portrayed by the handsome blond George Peppard an actor with whom I was previously unfamiliar. He carries off with sympathetic dignity the role of Holly's stalwart confidante protector comforter and friend who sees beyond her daring sophisticated facade and falls in love with her. Buddy Epsen plays Doc Golightly the likable middle aged country bumpkin Texan whom Holly married at age 14. Paul's lover and benefactress is played by Patricia Neal. I agree with negative comments made about casting Mickey Rooney as a ridiculous ranting Oriental landlord. What's the point here? I'm not one to be overly obsessed with political correctness but this caricature is simply too offensive.There's a cute little sub plot involving Holly's regular visits to a Mafia convict in Sing Sing prison. She is paid to bring him weekly 'weather reports' that is secret coded mob messages from the outside world. The apartment party scene comes across as a little too absurd and clich for me to have found funny. Also Holly  Paul's little shopping spree at the five and dime may be amusing but it's definitely not laudable! For those in this more enlightened age who object to all the smoking done by the two lead stars of course this would have been the norm back in that era. Holly herself has a notable cigarette holder a foot or two long. There's a great scene in which Cat an extremely compelling character! plays with the holder's bobbing end. Though not truly an outstanding film it does feature some witty dialogue. Without Audrey Hepburn it might all have appeared just too silly. However she has made it into something of a classic by her unforgettable portrayal of this woman who drifts unsuccessfully from one millionaire rat to another in search of the security and happiness that constantly allude her. In any case the movie certainly has a real humdinger of an ending.".

She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max Erich von Stroheim. She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite Salome which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywoodespecially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Normait makes them stars tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors agents screenwriters even entire studios! It has a tight quick script is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with himand he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed itbut she doesn't. She's mad for surebut you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.I am bigit's the pictures that got small. All right Mr. deMilleI'm ready for my closeup.".

	schema:reviewBody "The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return held to for 20 years is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood the parade has passed by but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other oldtimers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Fayestill working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... the stars are ageless. Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says nobody leaves a STAR that's what makes one a STAR. True again but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma her fans have already left. Hence if one is left one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream temporarily of being a writer Max gives up his dream of directing and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max directing the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the alltime great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech which sums up everything there is nothing else is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her a STAR....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends supposedly into madness and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about being back and all those wonderful people out there in the dark which of course includes us every time we watch the film.I cannot think of any other film possibly CITIZEN KANE that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!".

	schema:reviewBody "Until 1950 American films were strictly entertainment some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and starmaking. In essence everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset with Gillis played by that most cynical of actors William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma Gloria Swanson living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned 10000 midnights ago. How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mindboggling considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY both of which took their vicious hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable the dead writer floating in a pool eyes wide open looking right at us at the beginning the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps. says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voiceover. Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naivet combine to give us one of the most electrifying give and take between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even wax figures as Holden calls them Buster Keaton H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people GONE WITH THE WIND Zanuck Menjou. This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ruining the industry. The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma who is quite insane and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille who once directed NormaGloria back in the silent heyday tries to set her straight telling her pictures have changed. They had indeed especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios even the front gate and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that Valentino once danced on. There is so much to discuss but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN one of the alltime entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING 10 of 10".

What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naivet combine to give us one of the most electrifying give and take between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even wax figures as Holden calls them Buster Keaton H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people GONE WITH THE WIND Zanuck Menjou. This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ruining the industry. The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma who is quite insane and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille who once directed NormaGloria back in the silent heyday tries to set her straight telling her pictures have changed. They had indeed especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios even the front gate and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that Valentino once danced on. There is so much to discuss but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN one of the alltime entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING 10 of 10";

Now in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her so full of pity and the care her butlerexhusband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950.

If that weren't enough there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton among others.One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how in the story an aging forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era the silent film era.  What's interesting is that now so many years later we're looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating and a little chilling I might add. I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever but we don't often consider the abandoned participants much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line while watching one of her silent films ...we didn't need dialogue we had faces I'd like to also add that they didn't need movies they had films.They truly don't make them like this anymore. 1010".

It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is topnotch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest filmnoir of all time. I don't think it is a filmnoir at all. For some aspects the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white Germanexpressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity' femmefatale but these two are not enough to make a filmnoir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horrorthe end is horrifying for me and with some very very dark comedy.Overall This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive also making those movies a must see. 1010".

	schema:headline " A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "In Hollywood of the 50's the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis William Holden is not able to sell his work to the studios is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silentmovie star Norma Desmond Gloria Swanson who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling Erich von Stroheim. Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry and is protected and isolated from the world by Max who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema and the smalltime writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer Nancy Olson Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.Sunset Boulevard is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career being forgotten by fans and the industry and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched Sunset Boulevard for maybe five or six times I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called Sunset Blvd. A Look Back a.k.a. The Making of Sunset Boulevard with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Crepsculo dos Deuses Dusk of the Gods".

	onyx:emotionText "In Hollywood of the 50's the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis William Holden is not able to sell his work to the studios is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silentmovie star Norma Desmond Gloria Swanson who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling Erich von Stroheim. Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry and is protected and isolated from the world by Max who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema and the smalltime writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer Nancy Olson Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.Sunset Boulevard is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career being forgotten by fans and the industry and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched Sunset Boulevard for maybe five or six times I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called Sunset Blvd. A Look Back a.k.a. The Making of Sunset Boulevard with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Crepsculo dos Deuses Dusk of the Gods";

Here Swanson plays a silent film diva Norma Desmond leading a secluded life in her mansion almost a metaphor of a princess in a tower. And lo unexpectedly there comes a prince about to save her in the form of a failed screenwriter Joe Gills Holden who is on the run from his creditors. Learning that the former diva is completely out of touch with reality he moves into the villa pretending to help her with the script for her grand comeback. He also learns that her butler Max enables her delusions by writing the letters she believes are sent by her fans. Eventually the charade is exposed and things get out of control.This is arguably Swanson's biggest accomplishment and she deserved all the accolades she got for it. Her portrayal of a woman refusing to face the music borders on hysterical and paranoid all the time and she dominates every scene she's in. It's a lesson on character inhabiting and Holden also does his bit by giving the audience a cool detached narrator framing the story of his own demise. Erich von Stroheim shows just how far one is willing to go to protect the woman he loves creating a web of lies and illusions to keep his love sane. Put any other aged movie star into Norma's shoes and you'll get a similar story. The ending scene is a masterpiece.".

Except for the distracting shadow of the camera on William Holden's back as he moves to Norma's bed to wish her Happy New Year Norma . . .  a technical flaw I've never understood why wasn't the move relit and reshot since everything else in the film is perfect? But what continues to haunt me is Swanson's performance. Her silentscreen theatricality is always remarked upon. Yet there are several moments of utterly contemporary naturalism that show she knew exactly what she was doing as an actress and Wilder as director.Her sweetness in her bathing beauty scene where she recounts her days in the line with Marie Prevost and Mabel Normand then leaps onto the sofa beside William Holden  is so beguiling that you completely understand her sex appeal and warmth for a moment. When she asks for his match for a moustache for her Chaplin impression and tells Holden to close his eyes Close 'em!  the Close 'em! is clearly an ad lib that is so real and intimate that it is almost instantly lost in the macabre sequence that follows  all flashing eyes and volcanic eruption that C.B. DeMille himself hasn't phoned her.Soon afterward believing she will be making Salome for DeMille there is the astonishing montage of Norma's marathon beauty treatments in preparation for her return. Extreme closeups of Swanson's face without makeup reveal a stillyouthful lovely woman with flawless skin. Even under the magnifying glass even with the worried expression of Norma Desmond Swanson is stunningly beautiful for a few moments. Ironically for the rest of the picture she had to be made up to look older. Yet here we get a glimpse of the real Swanson at 50whatever and she looks merely a few years older than Holden.Finally the entire sequence when Holden returns to find Swanson phoning Betty Shaefer to tell her the truth about Joe Gillis Swanson is in coldcream and wings to smooth her cheeks and eyes  an actress completely exposed and without vanity.She plays the entire sequence naturalistically and in complete contrast to her theatrical I AM big. It's the pictures that got small style.Here in her bed caught by Holden realizing she's going to lose him she begs him Look at me! The desperation and helplessness the momentary admission of reality as Norma acknowledges her fears and insecurities and pleads with Holden are heartbreaking. Swanson's playing in the scene is astonishingly courageous for any actress and deeply true to the character.Finally as Joe packs to leave her and Swanson pleads with him to stay  grabbing his luggage and begging What do you want? Money?  again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.Everyone tends to remember Swanson's overthetop stylized performance yet her total control as an actress and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness however fleeting are something to behold.Swanson's is truly one of the most astonishing performances on film. Her range here is jawdropping.Watch her transitions in the Chaplin scene alone in one continuous take from heartrending comedy to blind rage. No cutaways. Amazing.I happened to see Swanson live at the Huntington Hartford Theatre in Hollywood on Vine in the late sixties in a stage show written especially for her called Reprise. This pieceoffluff comedy about a famous movie star returning to her home town was hardly TonyAward winning. But from her first entrance you were in the presence of a great actress.Barely five feet tall she swept in and immediately established a bodily line that commanded attention from then on.Her performance was delightful. Even more so when after intermission the second act began with her character giving a QA session at the local Rotary Club.Swanson walked down steps and into the actual audience greeting old friends that night's audience members reminiscing about her career  even sitting in a man's lap and teasing him for not remembering when they dated  as real film clips from her silents played on a giant screen onstage.She was outrageous and girlish she was approaching 70 at the time and delightful poking fun at herself and her character's career.It was a brilliant bit of stagecraft and an impressive revelation of the real Gloria Swanson.Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this stillstunninglooking yet downtoearth young fellow  over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.Swanson was the antithesis of Norma Desmond. She was entrancing magical adorable and everybody wanted to take her home.Honestly perhaps the only other two live theatrical performances I've ever seen and I've seen hundreds that could compare to Swanson's sheer talent and charisma were Maggie Smith in Lettuce and Loveage and Vanessa Redgrave in Orpheus Descending. Believe it.Not every actor understands the difference between film and stage performance nor can every actor deliver that difference vocally and physically this was WAY before the days of amplified body mikes. Swanson did.I was in first grade when Sunset Boulevard was released. I was in my 20s when I saw Swanson onstage in Reprise in Hollywood.You could still see the magic that had made her the global phenomenon she had been in silents. You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with Sunset Boulevard three decades later.You could understand where Billy Wilder got his line She was the greatest star of them all. Every time I watch SB I think She probably damned well was.".

While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed were continuing to change and those they left behind it also shows us how in some ways they've remained the same.

The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws evertighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for and Swanson is pitchperfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion right down to the wide roving eyes and clawlike hands. They're wellsupported especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel haunting tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do old movies actually live up to their reputations but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noirdrama stands the test of time.

	schema:reviewBody "SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses they both are cynical sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And of course they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts perhaps grudgingly that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just a great star a true star. Margo's rival Eve Harrington may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this Eve being the first bearer of life and sunset being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts locked away in a haunted house coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of filmmaking that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life like her career is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant still beautiful still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed her voice is magnificent sultry insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad. I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed she may have been unstable all along but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her and I suspect that involves Max Erich von Stroheim. In his Great Movies essay Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max her exhusbandexdirectorbutler is the heart of the story that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max like Joe Gillis Norma's erstwhile boytoy may be trapped in Norma's web but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient but he is the one in control he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness. I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback. There is more than adoration that cements the relationship between Max and Norma perhaps guilt jealousy desperation  who knows? All I know is that it is best kept as a subtext a part of the film's impenetrable mystery. The less we understand Norma the more intriguing she is.However if I were to be so bold as to make one major change in SUNSET BOULEVARD it would be to replace William Holden as Joe Gillis. I respect Holden as an actor but his screen persona has always been one of strength and  if not integrity  confidence he is not one who plays vulnerable with any conviction. Plus he doesn't play the part of Gillis with any gentle shadings. The romance between Norma and Joe is the least convincing aspect of the film. Joe treats her with barely concealed contempt and a bit of occasional pity which makes it hard to believe that a selfabsorbed diva would even tolerate him let alone make him the house pet. The role of Joe was originally intended for Montgomery Clift an actor with a proven ability to appear passive even as he plays sinister. His work in THE HEIRESS and A PLACE IN THE SUN illustrate this point. I see Joe Gillis not as a bored hangeron but as sycophant who is in awe of Norma even as he exploits her and therefore he doesn't realize that he actually is the one who is being used sort of a younger version of Max. I think Joe should be someone who is cunning but naive about his own limits not someone who is already bitter corrupt and cynical as the story begins. Maybe I am wrong but I get the feeling that Holden was very uncomfortable playing the part of well a mistress and especially one kept by such an older woman. Perhaps his manhood was threatened and that uneasiness shows. Clift or an equally rakish young actor like say Farley Granger or Robert Wagner would enliven the story and make the romance with the perpetually needy Norma more credible. I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated. The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as longterm there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable. Holden's interpretation that Joe is just doing it for the money just doesn't ring true. While a pairing of the aging diva with an ambitious  and yes probably gay  younger man is practically a show business institution. Yet even with these reservations it is undeniable that SUNSET BOULEVARD is quite a film. A little bit Hollywood satire a little bit moralistic fable and whole lot of Gothic melodrama. And Swanson's justnotquite over the top performance is mesmerizing. It was assumed that BOULEVARD would revitalize Swanson's career. It didn't. But apparently it didn't matter to her she dabbled in acting now and again when the part amused her but she had better things to do with her life. Swanson played Norma Desmond but she lived life as Margo Channing.".

	onyx:emotionText "SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses they both are cynical sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And of course they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts perhaps grudgingly that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just a great star a true star. Margo's rival Eve Harrington may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this Eve being the first bearer of life and sunset being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts locked away in a haunted house coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of filmmaking that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life like her career is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant still beautiful still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed her voice is magnificent sultry insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad. I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed she may have been unstable all along but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her and I suspect that involves Max Erich von Stroheim. In his Great Movies essay Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max her exhusbandexdirectorbutler is the heart of the story that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max like Joe Gillis Norma's erstwhile boytoy may be trapped in Norma's web but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient but he is the one in control he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness.

This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this thirdrate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort but he is at least sane and though he has an understanding of decency he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time when it is an inconvenience but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness as the insane Norma Desmond while superficially credible has no inner life or even a hint of one as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo Joe Gillis is believable as a hustler but seems in his narration and occasional asides to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters in other words go through their motions as the plot dictates and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people an immoral 'moral tale' it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws though the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond Gloria Swanson is magnificent larger than life and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland boy next door types and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far and made Holden overnight a hot property and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and especially narration his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the SelznickWellman A Star Is Born but it does its job better with pungent dialogue brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie filled with heartache love tragedy and ambition Sunset Boulevard is one of the most interesting to have ever been on screen. It's plot is one of the rare ones that takes the viewer behind the scenes and into the Hollywood realm albeit probably not painting the most accurate of pictures but still adding to our as viewers limited knowledge of the Hollywood world.  This movie is about desires and wants. There is the desire of the penniless writer to make it big and then there is the desire of the actress to know that she is still beautiful and wanted.Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a glamorous film star whose career abruptly ends with the introduction of talking pictures. And sadly enough she is caught in her memories of a time when she was viewed as beautiful and glamorous not realizing that the world around her is still moving on. In Norma's lifetime being a film star was all about the cinematic gaze and how it showed her. There was no sound to tell if an actress was good or not. The camera can make or break a person. She knew what made her popular and that was being under the constant scrutiny of the camera of having it always on her. Sadly when that phase of her life ended she didn't know what to do with herself.  Most women are objectified on film by the camera the director the audience etc. and most would try and distance themselves from that but oddly enough Norma wants to be surveyed. She wants to be scrutinized or praised or whatever else as long as she is getting the attention she craves. I suppose Norma feels that this attention is what she needs to be happy. Attention and approval from others is what kept her going and without it she became a pitiful woman. And the littlest bit of approval she gets makes her feel that much more important but when its revealed the fan letters she receives are from her butler once her husband you can't help but feel sorry for her. Overall I think that you will love this movie. The cinematography is incredible and creates an amazing setting and atmoshpere. The movie shows the worst sides of what some view as the most glamorous lifestyle and way to live.".

What was best for me however was the sympathy that both the lead characters managed to evoke in spite of their obvious and outrageous flaws.  What could be more realistic pitiful but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer?  The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying.

	schema:reviewBody "At the risk of sounding overly bombastic Moulin Rouge is the best film I've seen all year perhaps the best one I've seen in over a year.  It is operatic in the best sense of the word being at once massively outlandish and deeply personal.  It is clear that a lot of people took career risks in choosing this film and although Moulin Rouge may not rack up a huge box office I think this film will become a classic alongside his other two films Strictly Ballroom and Romeo  Juliet.In the showing of Moulin Rouge I saw last week at least 5 people walked out.  At the same time I heard audience members audibly gasping at the films visuals and talking back to the screen.  The source of these strong reactions?  Baz Luhrmann's confidence in his garish cinematic vision and the commitment his actors have in him.  The cast fills their roles with relish even when the entire scene totters on the edge of overkillbut oddly enough it is the focus that sets Moulin Rouge apart from other films these days.  Whereas some actors sleepwalk through their roles as they collect their paychecks everything about Moulin Rouge is done in earnest.This movie is the antiPearl Harbor because instead of being a hodgepodge of markettested ideas Moulin Rouge presents a bold vision and dares the audience to accept or reject it.  I for one accepted it with delight.  A telling comparison Luhrmann has Nicole Kidman and Ewen MacGregor sing the film's love song.  Very daring.  For Pearl Harbor Michael Bay chose Faith Hill.  Very safe.  Too safe.  Can you imagine Ben Afleck belting out There You'll Be?Moulin Rouge glitters with such bold decisions.  It is a sumptuous feast for ear and eye featuring gorgeous costumes intricate sets Nicole Kidman's boudoir in a gigantic elephant is a case in point and outlandishly choreographed dance numbers are paraded with frenetic relish.  And the music the MUSIC!  As you probably know by now Luhrmann has thrown into his period piece a collage of musical snippets from among many bits The Sound of Music Madonna The Police and Elton John.  In most cases no one song gets performed without intersplicing.  Witness Luhrmann's audacity the opening number includes a melding of Labelle's Lady Marmalade with Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit.  And here's the spooky part it works.The entire movie plays this way and for the most part it works.  Most surpising is that Moulin Rouge has a solid deeply sincere emotional core. Although the film professes to be about love I'd add that it is equally about loss.  The Moulin Rouge is a playground where adults pretend they are children with the added spice of sensuality.All the performances are excellent but the hidden gem is Jim Broadbent as Zidler.  Broadbent for years has been doing majestically understated supporting work from Brazil to Enchanted April to TopsyTurvy.  In Moulin Rouge he manages to be both repulsive and endearing.  His spirited rendition of Like a Virgin is classic.  Too bad it's not on the soundtrack.Expect to be overwhelmed by Moulin Rouge in the most unexpected delightful ways.  It will make you wonder why other films can't or won't dare to be that bold.".

I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music the editing was too swift or it wasn't their taste.  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top every scene more stunning than the next and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate onscreen couple entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.".

The story the music the acting the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy maddening beautiful and heartbreaking!  The music is rapturous and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly.  This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two starcrossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away.  The story is grand huge and operatic as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern popular songs and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible particularly Nicole Kidman's.  I truly felt for these two people and truly felt that they were in love.  My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking visionary masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original daring shocking film like this comes along they don't know what to do with it. But then again this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only The Wizard of Oz ever has before. Yes the story is sad but what  a journey it takes you on! A journey I will be sure to repeat over and over and over again.".

	schema:headline " One of the few movies out there worth watching several times just because of the sheer visual and musical enchantment.  out of four";
	schema:reviewBody "MOULIN ROUGE!  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchMoulin Rouge! revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant expensive Broadway production on screen with enough open courage engrossing passion and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films Moulin Rouge! may be a clichridden love triangle but Baz Luhrmann the film's director shines a fresh stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid exuberant style for his charactersa mixture between a fastpaced music video and lush exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy but it is the perfect approach to the material. From the opening moments Moulin Rouge! plays full force overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this we cut to The Sound of Music where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching Moulin Rouge! is in the visual stimulation the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J Ice Cube Jennifer Lopez and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. Moulin Rouge may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again even to my great reluctance John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century as Christian McGregor enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him including the French artist ToulouseLautrec Leguizamo and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club ran by the robust Harold Zinder Jim Broadbent. It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular sexy lead performer and courtesan Satine Kidman to work in their production.After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat The Duke Richard Roxburgh Satine falls in love with Christian much to the dismay of many. However she believes herself to be a simple prostitute who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue but only under his circumstances things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously the best thing in Moulin Rouge! is the music. Apart from the cast the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe Christina Aguilera Mya Pink Fatboy Slim Beck and many others. The kind of music that plays here does not account for a period epic at all however. Moulin Rouge! doesn't try to be a historic depiction but instead an expression of fantasy and passion. The elegant sets eventful style and powerful choreography scream modern day postpopculture. I ran out to purchase the motion picture soundtrack. You should too. But listening to the soundtrack on your CD player at home is nothing like experiencing the memorable singing and dancing sexual energy and relentless enthusiasm on the big screen.As I say in very few film critiques some movies are you watch others you experience. Moulin Rouge is an experience not to be missed. It is a bizarre unique blend of exhaustive energy and lively actionone of the bravest most ambitious and entertaining movies of the year.".

	onyx:emotionText "MOULIN ROUGE!  2001  out of fourBy Blake FrenchMoulin Rouge! revives our imagination and relives the musical era of Hollywood. The film is like an extravagant expensive Broadway production on screen with enough open courage engrossing passion and zesty energy for several motion pictures. It's one of the year's best films Moulin Rouge! may be a clichridden love triangle but Baz Luhrmann the film's director shines a fresh stunning originality on a familiar plot. He creates a candid exuberant style for his charactersa mixture between a fastpaced music video and lush exotic images. He uses a vast variety of camera placements and shooting angles. In several of the songs he cuts on nearly every word. This does indeed make us dizzy but it is the perfect approach to the material. From the opening moments Moulin Rouge! plays full force overpowering our senses. The film doesn't even wait for its opening credits to begin. The usual 20th Century Fox logo appears on the screen within a screen as a little bald musician rises from the bottom and continues to frantically conduct the traditional Fox fanfare. From this we cut to The Sound of Music where young writer morns over the loss of his true love. The film includes an interesting use of the bookend structure and I like how it reveals the information about the main character's deadly disease early. This is the kind of movie that does not need to astonish us with sudden plot twists or unexpected character revelations. The joy of watching Moulin Rouge! is in the visual stimulation the plot is more interested in its own character's discoveries than playing mind games with the audience.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they can really sing. Most of the time celebrity singers turn to the silver screen with a lot of star power but little acting ability. Look at LL Cool J Ice Cube Jennifer Lopez and I just know Brittany Spears is going to turn up in a movie one of these days. Moulin Rouge may be one of the first movies to open musical doors for its leading performers. Even Jim Broadbent proves to be well cast in a crazy intensified character that he really sinks his teeth into. I will never look at any of these stars in the same light again even to my great reluctance John Leguizamo.The film takes place in the early 19th century as Christian McGregor enters Paris hoping to write love stories. Several peculiar figures live above him including the French artist ToulouseLautrec Leguizamo and his Bohemian troupe attempting to construct a play. After a freak accident Christian is suddenly thrust into the middle of their play. The crew hires him as the star writer. He then takes a visit to the flirtatious Moulin Rouge night club ran by the robust Harold Zinder Jim Broadbent. It is here where he tries to persuade the club's popular sexy lead performer and courtesan Satine Kidman to work in their production.After mistaking Christian for a rich and powerful aristocrat The Duke Richard Roxburgh Satine falls in love with Christian much to the dismay of many. However she believes herself to be a simple prostitute who should never fall in love because it will get in the way of success. When the Duke agrees to produce a major production at the Moulin Rogue but only under his circumstances things become even more complicated. The Duke demands that Satine becomes his personal property if Harold and the others want his financial support. Obviously the best thing in Moulin Rouge! is the music. Apart from the cast the film's big list of musical artists includes David Bowe Christina Aguilera Mya Pink Fatboy Slim Beck and many others.

Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well if not better than the images. Yet some how through genius magic luck or some combination Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film and by choosing not to focus on one over the other and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old established techniques with innovative experimental ones resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful the mixture of modern songs is ingenious and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances a cinematic experience that people will be loving analyzing and trying to imitate for year.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900 living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor of their art for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian a penniless writer and a singer named Satine who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  Moulin Rouge' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color of soaring hearts and aspirations but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.If Disney had commissioned a film to be written by Shakespeare directed by Fellini and produced by Spielberg this would be it.  It's a dizzying whirling burst of lights colors music drama and comedy that assails the senses and will hold you spellbound from beginning to end.  Like the bohemians he portrays Luhrmann leaves convention behind and dips instead into his own inspired and highly imaginative formula to tell his story. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine and art direction by AnnMarie Beauchamp and Ian Gracie are brilliant as well as the production design by Catherine Martin and the sets by Brigitte Broch.  One of the many inspired touches Luhrmann employs here is the use of different film speeds throughout which when combined with the superlative quickcut editing by Jill Bilcock makes it all transporting and surreal.Ewan McGregor turns is a terrific performance as Christian the young man who arrives in Paris with nothing more than spirit and a head filled with ideas and ideals.  When artistic differences leaves Zidler Jim Broadbent proprietor of the Moulin Rouge without a writer for a new show Spectacular Spectacular' Christian steps in.  And so does McGregor who shines in the part.  And the boy can sing!  He may not have the greatest voice in the world but it's a good stage voice' and most importantly he can sell a song as evidenced by the scene in which he puts across Elton John's Your Song.'  McGregor has a charismatic screen presence and in this role he really gets a chance to demonstrate his versatility as an actor.As Satine Nicole Kidman is saucy and sensuous bringing her character vividly to life this woman who makes her living by being every man's fantasy as she sings and sashays her way through this world of the Moulin Rouge.  In her heart she longs to be a serious actress and if this new show is a success she just may get her chance.  But first the show needs someone to finance the lavish production.  They may have one the Duke of Worcester Richard Roxburgh has expressed interest but he has one condition.  If he pays for the show he wants something in return besides a profit on his investment.  He wants Satine.  But so does Christian who has nothing to offer the show but his talent and nothing for Satine but his love.  Zidler meanwhile aware of the Duke's demands urges Satine to turn her back on Christian to save him.'  And beyond and besides all that is happening there is something else going on with Satine something more personal that ultimately will have an effect on the outcome of the dilemma for all concerned.The supporting cast includes John Leguizamo Toulouse Lautrec Kylie Minogue The Green Fairy Garry McDonald Doctor Jacek Koman The Narcoleptic Argentinean Matthew Whittet Satie Kerry Walker Marie and Laszlo Lukas Conductor.  With an eye for detail and his imagination thrust into overdrive Luhrmann has put together and delivered one of the brightest films to come along in quite awhile.  Moulin Rouge' is an explosion of sights and sounds a film laced with humor and visual largess that holds a poignant and dramatic story at it's heart.  Entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable this is a memorable film and a satisfying moviegoing experience. It's a story about love a story told through the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

It is a gloriously cinematic spectacle with opulent imagery directed with an eye for rich color especially the color of rouge... It is also a breathtaking and poignant piece of cinema a disco of dreams a crazy and daring show a vibrant screen fantasy a Bohemian Revolution a magical movie for those who love romance pop music and old musical movies...Nicole Kidman gives the film its soul... She is the sparkling diamond of the show the toast of Paris the city's top courtesan... She melts her characterization with a sizzling yet tender performance... She is undeniably sexy a beautiful singer a flashy dancer whose heart sings whenever she sees Christian... In many ways she is drawn as the ultimate sex goddess as enigmatic as Greta Garbo and her glamor masks her pain as well as her happiness... Kidman gives the film its central erotic charge and its romantic thrills... She sways on a flying trapeze belting out Marilyn Monroe's Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend and Madonna's Material Girl.Ewan McGregor achieves a nice mix of optimism and desperation emphasizing the sincerity of the lovestruck poethero... Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth beauty freedom and most of all love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in returnJohn Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called Spectacular Spectacular.Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too... Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous cancan chanteuse in an exclusive contract.Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operaticstyle... Like Orson Welles Luhrmann loves the technical magic of movies... When a red curtain opens an orchestra conductor emerges to direct the unmistakable '20th Century Fox' theme opening we immediately realize we're in for something really magical A spectacular costume revue an eyecatching fin de sicle exuberance an inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...".

Christian is a young idealist who moves to the bohemian section of Paris during the 'summer of love' of 1899... He is hired to write a show about 'truth beauty freedom and most of all love.' Christian battles for the body and soul of the ravishing Satine... His fundamental believe is 'the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and to be loved in returnJohn Leguizamo is vulnerable and sweet as Henri de Toulouse Lautrec needing a good writer to come up with story and lyrics for his new show called Spectacular Spectacular.Jim Broadbent is wonderfully comic as the ringmaster Harold Zidler... He is a jovial impresario who peddles the charms of a successful Satine to a mesmerized public... He is the owner of the infamous nightclub who has promised Satine to the evil Duke of Monroth... He has his eye on her too... Richard Roxburgh is odious as the jealous benefactor obsessed with Satine to the point of murder... He is stunningly arrogant wanting the gorgeous cancan chanteuse in an exclusive contract.Luhrmann combines 1900 Can Can burlesque with modern musical poetry exploiting Kidman's grace and beauty and overwhelming the audience with frenetic dance numbers delivered in operaticstyle... Like Orson Welles Luhrmann loves the technical magic of movies... When a red curtain opens an orchestra conductor emerges to direct the unmistakable '20th Century Fox' theme opening we immediately realize we're in for something really magical A spectacular costume revue an eyecatching fin de sicle exuberance an inspiring rebirth of the movie musical...";

	schema:reviewBody "The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition but alas this happens with many great movies e.g. Requiem For A Dream Donnie Darko. The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical comical dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap with tears in their eyes at the magnificent movie they have watched.   The story is very simple but very complicated at the same time giving enough music action and laughs for everybody's taste. The characters are very easy to relate to and the edgeofyourseat directing gives edge to this masterpiece. Christian a young writer arrives in Paris against the will of his father to seek a career as a writer. He meets a group of bohemians who are planning to set up a musical play at the famous club Moulin Rouge and they invite him to rewrite the story of their play but at the same time to lure the famous courtesan Satine as to star in their play. Satine confuses Christian with the Duke who on the contrary is expected to sleep with Satine to finance the upcoming play. The confusion continues and finally Satine and Christian convince the Duke to accept to finance the play. As the play is made Christian and Satine fall in love but the Duke's rights to the play also count for the body of Satine. She is his. And so the lovers try to keep their love a secret before everything is lost. On the way jealousy betrayal and trust is needed for their love to be contained.   Satine is portrayed by the beautiful Nicole Kidman who delivers an astonishing performance. Her character has so much life inside her which makes you fall in love with her. Nicole was truly the one for Satine for her beauty and character match like no other. She did in fact break two ribs during the making of Moulin Rouge! Ewan McGregor one of the finest young actors on the Hollywood AList plays the writer Christian with success. Christian is a threedimensional character with feelings and compassion. Both of these excellent actors' singing and dancing skills help in the portrayal of their characters.    The direction is simply amazing. With the best director there is what can someone expect? Baz Luhrmann shows us his creative and brilliant ideas through his direction cinematography editing and camera work. All of these factors give you a dazzling effect. The editing gives you enough to be kept at the edge of your seat and also to feel those small goosebumps running up and down your back. The music is absolutely fantastic. The idea of mixing old songs together and forming this huge masterpiece is just amazing. The original music created by Craig Armstrong one of the finest also has atmosphere and is truly brilliant.    Mr. Luhrmann also takes us comprehend the importance of the visual world of movies with Moulin Rouge! The whole movie is a visual attack giving you enough colours to come back begging for more. It dazzles you amazingly and twists you around. The costumes are excellent and the sets are simply fantastic. The mixture of all of these given to you by the editing will leave you speechless and coming back to watch it over and over again.   Moulin Rouge! is a movie for the people. It has something everyone can relate to. It has been an instant classic ever since it came out in the cinemas. The more you watch Moulin Rouge! the more you get addicted to it and the songs can even make you sing along. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor show off their acting and singing capabilities and at the same time director Baz Luhrmann mixes them together and forms his finest masterpiece up to date. Moulin Rouge! makes you proud for who you are and will make you fall in love with it. This is a movie about Truth Beauty Freedom and above all thing Love...Savvas Stavrou's Rating 1010  A True Masterpiece".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for MOULIN ROUGE for both its usage of creativity and for its stars Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store.MOULIN ROUGE has indeed garnered much favoritism from critic's circles award panels and esteemed film reviewers alike. Unfortunately the only award I would hand this film would be a Golden Raspberry.The opening sequence of MOULIN ROUGE was interesting enough. I enjoyed the camera sequence going through the city of old Paris as we are introduced to Ewan McGregor's character... and then the film pretty much falls flat on its face from thereon in.I am not Nicole Kidman's biggest fan. I did enjoy her in THE OTHERS but I have to say that her performance in this film would be about on par as that in BMX BANDITS or BUSH CHRISTMAS. I thought the musical pieces in MOULIN ROUGE were 'earbleedingly' awful especially the sequence where both Ewan and Nicole are serenading each other with snippets of songs such as I Was Made For Loving You and Silly Love Songs. There is one truly awful moment in the film that involves a man screeching out an unforgivable horrendous rendition of The Police's Roxanne.It was about the scene where John Leguizamo and his sidekicks gatecrash Ewan McGregor's personal homewarming to have him join their performing art troupe where Ewan finds himself bellowing out a sonnet of The Hills Are Alive from THE SOUND OF MUSIC that I found myself losing patience for this movie. My nerves and patience at that point were already at razor's edge. A special appearance by Kylie Minogue as 'The Green Fairy' in a 'Tinkerbell'type role was the final straw for me.I shifted myself to the next room to work on the computer and for the next two hours all I heard was nonstop 'yahooing' and music that resembled the sound a tin bucket would make after it was kicked down an endless flight of stairs. Towards the end I was wondering aloud Please! Make the hurting stop! The two other people I live with had already secretly exited the living room behind my back to escape the noise.I know that Nicole Kidman's main professional talent is targeted mainly towards acting. It is not a fair suggestion on my behalf to opine that she should work harder on the acting and leave the 'singing' thing alone altogether.I was very disappointed with this movie. For all the fabulous writeup it has been receiving from famous reviewers and everyday people like you and I I was expecting a great deal more from MOULIN ROUGE. I really REALLY wanted to like MOULIN ROUGE but I just couldn't get into it. Please don't accuse me of having a narrow mind because I am a very openminded person when it comes to film projects. I am sure that Baz Luhrmann had a wellplanned artistic dream when he put this film together. Unfortunately for me it turned out to be one long nightmare. One reviewer on this website mentioned that they are in love with Moulin Rouge. I guess my motto would be I hate Moulin Rouge.My Rating 1 out of 10".

Visually the movie is a great reference for any commercial or video director. But unlike a music video that lasts only three minutes Moulin Rouge begins with a visual volume worthy of Spinal Tap and tries to sustain it for 120 minutes. It doesn't work. The rule of dynamics applies as much to a pretentious musical as it does to an ambitious action film. If the volume is too loud you simply can't hear anything. Everything gets lost in Moulin Rouge's hurricane of desperate art direction and production design. The film's leads talented actors though they may be simply aren't charismatic enough to compete. The movie requires posturing not acting. And frankly there are no less charismatic actors than Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. In fact their appeal is in their pastiness not in their screen presence. What's more the music can't compete either. Great songs are dwarfed by the neverending onslaught of CGI visuals which after a while become tedious. We get it already. The moral of this story is that you still need one to make a good movie. Nothing can replace pen and paper. Unglamorous though it may be a good script is everything. The filmmaker's previous effort with Romeo And Juliet worked precisely because he had a great script to begin with. The production design was icing on the cake. With Moulin Rouge icing is all there is and a satisfying meal it does not make.".

And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline.

It wasn't even really a movie it was an insult aimed directly at everyone who paid 9 to see it.You see they wanted to do a musical only they knew people wouldn't go see a musical unless it featured a random assortment of unrelated canned popular music.

The answer is no.This is the kind of idiocy that Oklahoma! displaced where the songs are unrelated and the action and character don't even rise to the level of formality.  Only it's worse because it specifically targets songs which are attached to your memories and butchers them.  When I saw them quote out of context the song U2 wrote to commemorate the life and death of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in an idiotic scene on the back of a big fake elephant I almost walked out.  I should have.  It only got worse.The only way this would be even permissable would be in parody but this is no parody.  It clearly wants to be taken at least marginally seriously apparently without going to the trouble of having anything at all to say unless you count the apparent reality that people are very very stupid are essentially devoid of any and all merit and are not worth watching.Do not believe the hype.  Do not see this movie!  If you do see it at least have the good sense to get really really high first so that even if it takes itself seriously you don't make the mistake of doing so.".

I have to believe the A.D.D. style of cutting was his vision not hers. Check out Road to Perdition or Elizabeth to see her true skills.What was with the gratuitous slowmotion? Every other shot was in slomo for apparantly no reason at all.The singing made me want to sharpen a pencil and shove it directly into my ear.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw MOULIN ROUGE! the other night on Netflix and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely selfindulgent contrived soulless and pretentious. And yet people keep calling it one of the greatest movie musicals ever. It's literally all style and no substance.There were many things about this movie that annoyed me so I'll try and keep it to a minimum.1 The plot I've never seen a romance in a movie that felt so fake as in MOULIN ROUGE. Kidman and Gregor have no chemistry on screen but to be fair that's probably more of the director's fault then theirs. They keep saying crap like love will shine through or love will conquer all or the popular the greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return. Give me a break. I literally counted how many times they said love in this movie and it was 126 times. Although I may have lost count during the Madonna number when the chorus sings Love! a dozen times every 5 seconds. The love that this movie babbles on about isn't real love. It's formulaic planned polished and fraudulent Hollywood romance. The relationship between the writer and actress never felt true because whenever their relationship was in danger it was because the onedimensional Duke threatened never the two in love. That Duke only exists to the convenience of the plot. Real problems in a relationship come from the lovers like their personalities life choices etc. There's more to love than just pure romance. It's about getting past problems and working through them instead of just waiting around and doing nothing hoping that love will conquer all in some clichd climax. There are better romance films out there musical and non that actually show real love like CASABLANCA GONE WITH THE WIND CABARET LOST IN TRANSLATION and more.2 The characters These people seemed so nonexistent. In fact the characters in this movie weren't characters they were set pieces that could move around sing badly and make stupid faces at the camera. There are great actors in this movie like Ewan McGregor Nicole Kidman and Jim Broadbent yet director Baz Luhrman favored their costumes and bedrooms more than their acting. A real shame and a real waste of potential.3 The editing Based purely on this aspect I believe MOULIN ROUGE! was made for people with severe ADD. Not one shot lasted more than 3 seconds. All it is is just people mugging at the camera as it zooms from one room to the next. It's as if Luhrman is afraid that the actors will distract from the movie's style so he yells CUT!! right before the actors summon a real emotion. Characters should never be upstaged by the visuals the visuals are there to add to them and the story. Ironically this MTVstyle approach actually hurts the movie's look because we can never get a good look at the amazing art direction. These sets are fantastic! Let us see them! 4 The music My friends kept telling me how brilliant and innovative the soundtrack is and when I saw the trailer I thought I was going to adore it. But when the McGregor character first sang The Hills are alive with the Sound of Music! I groaned thinking to myself Great it's a jukebox musical. For those who don't know a jukebox musical is a musical that uses already existing music for its score. It's damaging Broadway right now with shows like American IDIOT and preventing musicals to move forward artistically. It should be used as an homage to great composers and their work but nowadays it's just a cheap move to enhance album purchases. I guess in MOULIN ROUGE it's supposed to show how love is universal in all kinds of music but it makes the movie seem anachronistic. Plus if a movie like MOULIN ROUGE is going to have this much hype around it it better have original songs. Some people say Come What May is the only original piece but I've done some research and it apparently was used for Luhrman's previous film ROMEOJULIET. It wasn't even written specifically for MOULIN ROUGE. It's an awful song anyway. I can't stand it when people praise this soundtrack because there's nothing really brilliant about simply rearranging and orchestrating existing pop songs and having them sung horribly. Kidman is not a singer! Why is she used in this and NINE?! 5 The directing Pretty much everything I've complained about is because of Luhrman's direction. People wonder why he never got an Oscar nomination for Best Director. It's because he didn't care about the story or characters only the sets and costumes. It's actually kind of amazing how much he didn't care. There's no sense of pace subtlety or consistency. There's nothing wrong with trying to make your movie look spectacular. But if your story and characters fall flat then the images just become something nice to look at and dissolve from the audience's memories once the movie's over. There's got to be something else that gives the film its drive other than clothes art direction and choppy editing.Well that's all I can think of for now. Hopefully I didn't rant too much. Obviously I'm in the minority but that won't change my opinion. But who knows? Maybe I'm just missing something. I just wish people would acknowledge and admire real musicals instead of a collection of pop songs pretending to be musicals.".

I saw a preview in Vogue of the costumes and eagerly awaited the film but was dreadfully disappointed in it.

There isn't one scene that lasted long enough for my eyes to focus on it. The mix of songs some stolen from other musicals were staged in a blend of people and animation and are awful. Though I was surprised to find that Nicole can really sing while her costar cannot.The story is taken from the real life of an actual French dancer but what is in reality a tragedy of life cut short is here made into a comic travesty. It's a different style film than others before it but different doesn't mean better. I give it two thumbs down. Skip it.".

The toll the selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had kids of their own was making itself felt.Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular throughout the 1980s and it's one of the best. It gets a rather bum rap now because it's known as the film that beat Apocalypse Now for the 1979 Best Picture Academy Award but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast they're not remotely the same but can't we enjoy them both? Directorwriter Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything fancy with his movie its strength lies in its performances those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep particularly playing a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly over their son. The courtroom scene in which they duke it out for custody and in which each is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways is devastating and feels authentic. The movie doesn't present Hoffman's solid dad as a hero or Streep's straying mom as a villain. They're neither good or bad as people  they're simply bad at being married.The film is tearjerky at the finale but not in a manipulative way. It earns its right to elicit sobs.Grade A".

The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does they get to know each other better. But then the mother and wife returns and she wants custody of the boy. Kramer vs. Kramer has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in Rainman which won him his second Oscar is his best. He was great in that film but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep like Hoffman also won her first Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Kramer vs. Kramer as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry who was only 8 years old when the film came out is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category Best Supporting Actor. Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress where she lost to costar Streep. Kramer vs. Kramer is a great film from start to finish. Writerdirector Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable.  out of four".

It's all about ordinary people with our problems. What's different and catchy about Robert Benton's filmmaking was here we are not trying to put ourselves in the actors' shoes the actors are trying to put themselves in our shoes.The story is about the Kramer family which is broken father and mother are separated and they have to fight for their son's custody in court against each other. After his wife walks out on him Ted Kramer's life completely turns upside down. He has to take care of his son Billy but at the same time he's very busy with his position in an advertising company. Soon he loses his job Billy has an accident his wife wants Billy to live with her. Against all the problems Ted is facing he always fought with his heart. Ted's a very emotional and sensitive man but a strong person at the same time.Ted Kramer character was a new model for Dustin Hoffman. But since the late 1950s' Elia Kazan's pioneer approach of modern drama making on film with the basic instalment of the leading actor into a conflict Ted Kramer's strong character raised Dustin Hoffman's acting to become a legend  just like it did to Marlon Brando Sylvester Stallone Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson with 1970s'.Something more about the movie the linear cut has been 43 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Most of this cut has included Meryl Streep's deleted scenes. Also Meryl Streep has been originally cast in the role of Ted's one night stand eventually played by second supporting actress Jobeth Williams. Meryl Streep's role as Joanna Kramer has been primarily offered to Kate Jackson but due to her contract rules with the TVseries Charlie's Angels she hasn't been able to accept this role. Joanna Kramer character has been designed to be the leading actress and subject to have more scenes before director Benton making the last decision of the plot's focus point.Both Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman today have splendid fame on movie career and Kramer vs. Kramer was an important milestone for both of their careers. Dustin Hoffman's Oscar speech winning the best actor at the 1979 Academy Awards ceremony is one of the best Oscar speeches of all Academy Awards history like the movie Hoffman's Oscar speech is also available to watch on Youtube.".

That year though 'Apocalypse Now 1979' was undoubtedly the more impressive piece of cinema the Academy decided to award the top honours to a film that was more intimate and closertohome perhaps they were also hesitant after 'The Deer Hunter 1978' to reward a war picture two years in a row. 'Kramer vs. Kramer' received not only Best Picture but also a welldeserved Best Actor Dustin Hoffman's first win Best Director Robert Benton Best Adapted Screenplay Robert Benton and Best Actress in a Supporting Role Meryl Streep's first win. Young Justin Henry aged 8 years became the youngest actor in history to be nominated for a competitive Oscar.At the beginning of the film we are immediately aware that Ted Kramer Hoffman is not a perfect husband. His commitment to work means that he has largely neglected his strained wife Joanna Streep and indeed he isn't even listening to her when she finally announces her intentions to leave him. With Joanna having departed for California in order to find herself Ted is left alone to care for their young son Billy Justin Henry during which time he must juggle both his working and family lives. As Ted takes up this mammoth task we notice that up to this point he hasn't been much of a father either blundering his attempts to make a simple breakfast and having to ask in which gradelevel his son belongs. Eventually however though it reflects rather poorly on his career Ted and Billy formulate a truly touching fatherson relationship and for the first time Ted seems satisfied with his family life  until that is Joanna returns to claim custody of the child.Perhaps it's just being a male that influenced my emotions but I absolutely loathed Joanna Kramer. The mere notion of a mother walking out on her son only to return 15 months later with the expectation of receiving custody left me absolutely livid and were it not for the character's final act I might even have labelled her as the film's villain. However to do so would probably oppose the primary message of the film which is that both Ted and Joanna are young Billy's parents and that they must each come to accept this and to accept that they are both equally responsible for the wellbeing of their child. The ending of the film with the elevator door closing to irreparably separate Ted and Joanna once more destroying any idealistic hopes that the two would get back together creates an openendedness to the story that I thought was very suitable. As in reallife there is no clear resolution to the story and the future is hopeful but uncertain.".

Kramer vs Kramer was indeed one of the best classical drama movies I've witnessed for a long time that even I myself couldn't imagine how it touched me. The story was strongly emotional but is not saturated with such. The characters weren't unrealistic for their roles they possess qualities that make viewers like them whatever position they have in the film like the role of Meryl Streep she was a mother who honestly concede her mistakes at the past but then she's confident to stand up her emotional motives to get what she desires in a fair and square battle. Dustin Hoffman was way too outstanding I can't even fathom how this guy could play seriously difficult roles and suddenly jump into another role which is completely different then performed it well. Even though I have already seen the movies a lot of times when I seat back and lounge at my home scanning worth movies to peer and buy a time for it catching a glimpse for Kramer vs Kramer will make my experience another worthwhile moment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a good movie with excellent performances by Dustin Hoffman Jane Alexander and the kid Justin Henry. However unfortunately Meryl Streep's role isn't really very developed and we don't get to understand very well what is going on with her.The film shows the agony of people going through a contested Court battle over custody. Although the agony is very real for those going through this it needs to be noted that the more modern approach to a custody dispute is to require the parties to mediate their differences. By stressing the concept of parenting time in which time with the child is divided in a reasonable way between the two parents as opposed to the eitheror choice depicted in the film differences can often be worked out in mediation by simply working out a schedule of who has the child when.SPOILER COMING UP Another problem with the film is the screenwriter's assumption that the mother should receive custody unless she is unfit. This has not been the law for many many years if indeed it ever was. In this situation where the child had bonded so wonderfully with his father it seems doubtful that even the older Judges would award custody to the mother. Judges will usually continue whatever the status quo arrangement has been if it is working as it was in the film. Certainly the mother would not be permitted to come in and litigate custody simply because she has changed her mind. Rather it is necessary to show a change of circumstances to even get into Court.The story is told from a decidedly upper middle class viewpoint. Both parents have good jobs and the film seems to accept the idea that a person's worth as a parent is determined by how good of a job he or she has. During the Court hearing when the mother says how much she is making the camera shows the father's surprised reaction. The mother's attorney is eliciting this information to show how she has gotten herself together and therefore should now be granted custody. And when the father loses his job right before the hearing he desperately finds another one because he knows he has no chance at custody unless he has a good job. And then during the hearing the mother's attorney derides him for making less than he had previously made.I submit that this viewpoint is just plain false. One's worth as a parent does not depend on how much money one makes! Indeed it could be argued that the reverse is actually true in that the less time spent on making a living the more time and energy one has to devote to the care of one's children. The issue is not who has the best job but who can best care for the children. Who is the most willing to go the parentteacher conferences take the children to the doctor read to them a story at bedtime etc.Despite the various flaws in the film it still rates an 8 out of 10 due to the very strong performances and the wonderful way it shows the developing relationship between a father and his son.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a good movie with excellent performances by Dustin Hoffman Jane Alexander and the kid Justin Henry. However unfortunately Meryl Streep's role isn't really very developed and we don't get to understand very well what is going on with her.The film shows the agony of people going through a contested Court battle over custody. Although the agony is very real for those going through this it needs to be noted that the more modern approach to a custody dispute is to require the parties to mediate their differences. By stressing the concept of parenting time in which time with the child is divided in a reasonable way between the two parents as opposed to the eitheror choice depicted in the film differences can often be worked out in mediation by simply working out a schedule of who has the child when.SPOILER COMING UP Another problem with the film is the screenwriter's assumption that the mother should receive custody unless she is unfit. This has not been the law for many many years if indeed it ever was. In this situation where the child had bonded so wonderfully with his father it seems doubtful that even the older Judges would award custody to the mother. Judges will usually continue whatever the status quo arrangement has been if it is working as it was in the film. Certainly the mother would not be permitted to come in and litigate custody simply because she has changed her mind. Rather it is necessary to show a change of circumstances to even get into Court.The story is told from a decidedly upper middle class viewpoint. Both parents have good jobs and the film seems to accept the idea that a person's worth as a parent is determined by how good of a job he or she has. During the Court hearing when the mother says how much she is making the camera shows the father's surprised reaction. The mother's attorney is eliciting this information to show how she has gotten herself together and therefore should now be granted custody. And when the father loses his job right before the hearing he desperately finds another one because he knows he has no chance at custody unless he has a good job. And then during the hearing the mother's attorney derides him for making less than he had previously made.I submit that this viewpoint is just plain false.

The greatest scenes are the beautifully moving interactions with Dustin Hoffman and his adoring 6year son played magnificently by young Justin Henry. The performances are very realistic. The directing is facepaced and no one at any time seems superficial in their roles. Anyone who has gone through or is going through a divorce or even a bad marriage will find some great meaning and insight from this movie.The only drawback is Meryl Streep. I always believed that she was an overrated actress. But in Kramer vs. Kramer there is something missing from her character that I think creates an aloofness in the scenes that she is in. I could tell from her body language very early on in this movie that she had strong emotional problems. Throughout the film she seems so quiet and unsure of herself that you begin to feel even MORE sensitivity for the real troubling issues facing Ted Dustin and Billy. Justin Their scenes together are SOOOO well done that you really see them as a father and son and not actors. There is also no sappiness or soap opera dialog to muddle this fine story. I must also give credit to director Robert Benton for a movie that pulls at the heart strings many times.This is a very fine film.".

This is not to discount the film... it isn't terrible but without the great performances by both Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep who flesh out their ratherthin characters into nearly realistic people it is much ado about nothing.I was disappointed watching the film because there was nothing memorable about it... it was a slight experience marked by a lack of substance. Even on the second viewing many years later I had forgotten the film as quickly as the end credits had rolled. What WAS important about this movie was that it represented the firsttime Hollywood really acknowledged the downfall of the American family an endangered species being increasingly torn apart by divorce in which the children emerged as victims and pawns. I'm sure it was more sensational at the time of it's release... but today a woman leaving her husband and forcing him to raise their son alone is not going to win Best Picture... a film today with a plot that tame might never get made. I suspect in fact that Kramer's Oscar sweep was due more to the film's amazingly talented actors both at the top of their game than the actual film itself. Streep is very good in a role that is entirely unsympathetic... we're given no reason for her departure and no rationale for abandoning her child. A lesser actress in this role would have had the audience hissing but Meryl Streep gives us at least some insight as to Mrs. Kramer's motivations. Dustin Hoffman is great believable as a father and human enough to engage anyone. The film sidesteps many key issues very cleverly such as never showing us Mr.  Mrs. Kramer happy together a necessity since Hoffman and Streep are not only unlikely as man and wife they also share zero chemistry unless of course they're outacting one another from opposite sides of the courtroom.A film that stands the test of time will linger on your mind bear repeated viewings and be just as vital today as the day it was made... Kramer Vs. Kramer is long past its expiration date. The performances are still watchable but not essential in either actor's canon Hoffman and Streep have both been in many timeless films...

	schema:reviewBody "Ted Kramer Dustin Hoffman is an advertising executive whose career means everything to him. In fact it means so much to him that his wife Joanna Kramer Meryl Streep can no longer tolerate his behaviour anymore. Joanna leaves Ted and also leaves their 8 year old child in his care. However Ted finds himself in new territory when he now finds that he has to struggle juggling both working fulltime and looking after his son.This is a film that for me will always be relevant  it's actually probably more relevant now than it was when it was made as divorce rates are probably higher now than they were in the 1970's. The film begins OK Joanna leaves Ted and we find ourselves engaged when Ted is forced to actually take an active role in being a parent. It shows how much he relied on Joanna and clearly he took her for granted of course he only realises how much she actually did after she left him. This is all fine to begin with but the problem I had with this film is Joanna's disappearance for 15 months. 15 months? Really? What kind of mother would do that? I expected her to perhaps leave Ted with their kid for a few days possibly a week to give him a lesson in parenting but I just couldn't accept that any rational parent would disappear for that long. Later in the film Joanna does explain her reasons for going away but I still didn't buy it. I don't care what anyone else says abandoning your kid for that long is unacceptable!! There are many things that this film gets right and one thing I did like about it is that it does at least represent both parents as being flawed individuals. It would have been very easy for the writers to put all the blame at the door of one of the parents but this would have been both unfair and unrealistic. There are many humorous and heartfelt moments during the film  many of which involved Ted and his son. I'll admit that I was pleased that his son ended up bonding better with Ted towards the end.Despite the fact that Ted was made out to be the villain of the piece at the start of the film I personally found that I connected more with his character than I did with Joanna. I think the main reason for this is that I saw that he was flawed as a person rather than bad  look at the pressure he was under at work even his boss kept telling him that his work is more important than his family  he didn't use those exact words but it's quite clear that he wanted Ted to put his job before his family. Yes Ted should have remembered that blood is thicker than water but at the end of the day he needed to keep his job to provide for his family. He made mistakes but I actually liked his character. It perhaps would have been better if Joanna's character was developed better as we would have then got more of an insight into her characters thoughtsfeelings and I would have then been able to connect to her character. However her character is quite thinly written so it's actually impossible to do this. Kramer vs Kramer is an enjoyable film that is funny and heartfelt and both Hoffman and Streep were excellent. It probably deserves a 7 or 8 out of 10 but I was so annoyed by Joanna's actions that I had to downgrade it to a 6 out of 10. It's still a film that I would whole heartedly recommend watching though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kramer Vs. Kramer is a nearheartening drama about shocking drastic augmentations of the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep in the throes of her trademark maternal sensitivity plays an unhappy stayathome mother who feels confined to such a role and within the first five minutes of the film leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman to find another role for herself. Hoffman is dumbstruck having absolutely no idea what to do with himself having taken so much for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about getting his son to school in the morning.Hoffman seamlessly characterizes this husband as such a juicy load of setbacks. He is restless relentless and impatient but even though the positive side to those three adjectives should include just the opposite he is unremittingly fixated on whatever he turns his head to. He's been focused on his career in advertising and when he is left to raise his son Billy all by himself chaos ushers in immediately. He's the one throwing temper tantrums and quitting angrily halfway through an activity. After awhile as he befriends his neighbor and Joanna's former friend played by sexy Jane Alexander Hoffman cools his jets enough to understand why his wife left. In the meantime his boundless energy redirects towards raising Billy and he loses his job.The custody battle of the title is a brilliantly grey circumstance. Even if the ending is a little unmotivated subjectified for the audience the last line and the last shot still have that witty screen writing touch that seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Moving beyond words is this heart breaking story of a divorce which results in a tragic custody battle over a seven year old boy.One of Kramer v. Kramer's great strengths is its screenwriter director Robert Benton who has marvellously adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic while delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling emotional tales like this was to prove itself again with Places in the Heart where he showed as in Kramer v. Kramer that he has a natural ability for working with children.The picture's other strong point is the splendid acting which deservedly received four of the film's nine Academy Award nominations two of them walking away winners. One of those was Dustin Hoffman Best Actor who is superb as frustrated business man Ted Kramer a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As said wife Joanne Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong sensitive portrayal of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Also nominated was Jane Alexander for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. Final word in the acting stakes must go to young Justin Henry whose incredibly moving performance will find you choking back tears again and again and a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination came his way.Brilliant also is Nestor Almendros' cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing while musically Henry Purcell's classical piece is used to effect.Truly this is a touching story of how a father and son come to depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together come to know each other and form an entirely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life and slowly comes to realise why Joanne had to go.Certainly if nothing else Kramer v. Kramer demonstrates that nobody wins when it comes to a custody battle over a young child especially not the child himself.Saturday June 10 1995  T.V.Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the heartache of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the child's best interests at heart. Aside from a superb screenplay and amazingly controlled direction both from Robert Benton it's the superlative cast that make this picture such a winner.Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer the man torn between his toppling career and the son whom he desperately wants to keep. Excellent too is Streep as the woman lost in eight years of marriage who had to get out before she faded to nothing as a person. In support of these two is a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret an outstanding Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle and a top cast of extras.This highly emotional heart rending drama more than deserved it's 1979 Academy Awards for best film best actor Hoffman and best supporting actress Streep.Wednesday February 28 1996  T.V.".

It doesn't have the camera work or the cinematography like these other films but that doesn't mean that this is a bad movie or does it? I think the reason why this film is underrated is because a lot of people always compare it to other great Oscar winning films you should never do that which makes it hard to understand the beauty and the realism in this movie. In the categories Best Picture Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role this film really deserved all of them. The magnificent Dustin Hoffman gives us once again one of his best performances. A couple of times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son because it was just so real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that specific role but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman passes the test with flying colors in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve to be called the best Katherine Hepburn Meryl Streep Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman I can't help it I think she's great. Meryl Streep even though she's in a supporting role is amazing and real and you just can't help but being drawn ed to her talent and the way she makes it hers and real. Wow that's all I can say. Justin Henry was great considering his age his tears and his relationship with his mom and dad was beautiful so I say good job to cute little Justin Henry. While I was watching this film for like the third time alone I couldn't stop crying. I tried but I couldn't. Thank god I was alone! This is probably the purest film I have ever seen. Other films that were nominated for Best Picture was Apocalypse Now Norma Rae Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I'm ashamed cause I haven't seen any of them but from what I've heard Apocalypse Now is great but when I heard about Norma Rae I only thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees this film deserved it's five Oscars and that it'll continue to touch and make other people cry for a long time in the future just like it has for the past 28 years. Good job all the actors and actresses in this film for giving us great performances and memories from watching this film that we won't ever forget.Thanks for your time.".

Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning and even now in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations and some of them have had some good points of their own.

A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film and director Victor Fleming along with countless other behindthescenes technicians craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI witty dialogue and eyepopping Technicolor THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a onceinalifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quiveryvoiced solemnfaced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz clutching her beloved Toto impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry the terrier. It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role as Temple's doeeyed cutesyvoiced shtick would have been a catastrophic illfit for the tone of this picture. Conversely Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential womanchild always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold ArlenE. Y. Harburg number Over the Rainbow into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating makeup and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality and Ray Bolger's gravitydefying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of fullthrottle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed scrutinized or satirized the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a topnotch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous milestone of a film.".

Yikes!  In contrast even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that Oz doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.

	schema:reviewBody "Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives especially as children has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair her transition from little girl to wise young woman and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepiatones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now as it had did back then. In my world this is an utterly fantastic film.And what is Oz by the way? Well from a little girl and the child in all of us it's that place where our imagination runs wild where everything is perfect where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement places our place and therefore our own selfexpression our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years when unemployment was at an all time high it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm but then throwing a parentless girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character the same way the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl and having Judy Garland  not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one  play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen freshfaced innocent and vulnerable she is Dorothy and we can't imagine anyone else not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream it's more than logical many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams  it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they but Dorothy most of all lacks  courage love and wisdom  makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story so when they grow as characters so do we and of course so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple so honest but so deep in its messages about love and selfdiscovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here and all those backstories... well their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic it's all here in about two hours of pure entertainment.".

	schema:headline " A fantasy rooted in the landscape of your childhood.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind' 'Citizen Kane' 'The Godfather' 'Star Wars' have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. The movie in front of and behind the scenes has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copperbased makeup. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds sweltering costumes partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be overhyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played imagining a place to go and characters to interact with a colorful world bigger than our small confined worlds. Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way The Scarecrow The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in where work means keeping the farm. No work  no farm  no home.For 1939 Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who in the midst of the depression packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role 17 at the time but with wideeyes and a beautiful open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood she has apparently lost her parents and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939 Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design aweinspiring in 1939 is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement our dreams our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.".

That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939 Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design aweinspiring in 1939 is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement our dreams our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.";

The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys a talking lion the astounding ruby slippers and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway the forest the witch's castle and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion tin man and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.Even though this is a movie for everyone it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe special effects musical talents and even the famous yellow brick road are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. Hence the name.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm during a tornado she along with her dog Toto is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard it's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that their not only is no place like home there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz and really when all is said and done there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture it clearly isn't. At times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised some of the performances in the piece are far from an excellent standard but crucially any misgivings are quickly erased due to the wonder of it all because the film has an ability to transport everybody who is watching into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals and caters to every demographic and pretty much any age group adventure meeting new friends fears and trepidations booming colour songs to singalong with and of course it's total point of homely values The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 70 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star Judy Garland. Viewing now and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was myself as a 14 stone lump of waning machismo I have no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as tho I'm being sent spinning into another world that's the power of the piece as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz nothing else in my world matters I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being original castings to be W.C. Fields Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin munchkins running riot drunken cast members sadness and suicides and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read for sure but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic that actually deserves to have that tag. One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 1010 movie and then some.".

Beautiful scenery  colorful cinematography by Harold Rosson  spirited adventure and a stirring climax lift this story . It is a genuine as well as imaginative tale written and directed with great sensibility  fairness and imagination.

A perfect cast and enjoyable secondaries in the perfect fantasy . As a likable acting by Judy Garland as an adorable girl who is swept away to an enchanted land .

Spectacular and glamorous sets  production designer Cedric Gibbons studied the films of Walt Disney classic films to achieve the appropriate Art Deco design for the Emerald City of Oz . The film was completely shot in studio  the only location footage in the entire film are the clouds over the opening titles .

The motion picture was stunningly directed by Victor Fleming  though supported by other notorious as well as uncredited filmmakers such as George Cukor  Norman Taurog  King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy  also producer . However  Richard Thorpe the original director of the film had shot around two weeks of footage before he was fired . A recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as video which has enabled children of every generation to see it.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to overstate the true significance of this film. The Library of Congress informs us that it is the most watched film ever made. Its signature song Over The Rainbow written for the film didn't merely win the Oscar for best original song of 1939. More significantly decades later the Recording Industry Association of America and the National Endowment for the Arts both voted this song as the number 1 song of the twentieth century. The American Film Institute ranked it as the greatest movie song of all time.But the film's accolades go on and on. It is one of only a few films listed in UNESCO's Memory Of The World Registry. Even in a supporting role actress Margaret Hamilton turned her Wicked Witch into American Film Institute's 4thgreatest villain of all time behind Hannibal Lecter Norman Bates and Darth Vader. All of the main actors and many people responsible for the film's technical achievements have received and continue to receive innumerable awards and honors seventy years after the film was released.From its inception as a children's book in 1900 by author L. Frank Baum the simple story was retold countless times in novels stage presentations and other forms in many subsequent years including 1908 1910 1914 1925 1933 and 1938. But it was the film of 1939 directed by Victor Fleming that propelled the story into immortality.With its perfect 3Act structure the script creates iconic characters and iconic dialogue. Some lines have morphed into cultural clichs they are so often repeated. How many times has the line Toto I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more been borrowed by hack writers to use in their hack scripts? I think it was Oscar Wilde who said imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness.At a deeper level than the wellknown story the film's many allegories have been and will continue to be debated by scholars. Many of these allegories are so subtle they may never be appreciated by viewers especially in an age when subtlety has been rendered a forgotten art. Is the nave Dorothy really the American people? Does the yellow brick road symbolize the gold standard? Is the Emerald City a symbol of materialism that we in the early 21st century might equate to Wall Street?A deep intellectual script it may be but the film would be merely great without its underlying emotional appeal to the heart. It's the visuals and music that render the film so beloved by the world.And when you join the simple yet intellectual story with the power of great visuals and great music you create a timeless expression of the human experience. The summary message is thus conveyed that no matter where or how far you may roam and no matter what joys and friendships you may experience along the way after all and in the end there's no place like home.It's almost impossible to view this film objectively critically so magical mythical and powerful has it become. It's a film that does not require a plot summary it's too well known for that too burned into our collective consciousness.Academy Award films wellmade classic films linger with us. But The Wizard Of Oz isn't just another Oscar winner or classic film. It is unique its own category a oneofakind artistic expression. There will never be another film quite like it. If humans are still around a thousand years from now someone somewhere using some form of futuristic technology will be watching it enthralled by its universality its timelessness.".

Another great special effect is in the very beginning when the tornado hits and the lady is riding by on her bike and as she passes the window she gradually gets closer to it at the closest point she turns into a witch. I love the fact that Dorothy's uncles in the beginning are the same characters or representative of the same characters as she finds down the yellow brick road scare crow tin man and the lion. I also like the whole general meaning of the movie. I think that it is a great children movie because of this. It teaches you that you have to look within yourself to find the parts of you that you are missing you can't just expect someone to give it to you. Overall I love this movie!!!!!!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wizard of Oz is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's full of life energy and heart. This is probably what defines the term moviemagic. There are so many classic moments here after all this movie is still heavily quoted in popculture 75 years after it was first released! The story is basically about a girl who longs for somewhere over the rainbow and then gets what she wants... or is it really what she wants? The movie starts as most people know in plain sepia color but when we first enter Oz it switches to full color. This is truly amazing to see especially in the 3Dbluray release! I must admit that I was a bit skeptic towards the 3D version but when I watched it I was blown away! I felt suck in to the movie in a way that I had never been before! So I recommend everyone to watch this movie no matter how old you are! And if you have the opportunity then watch it in 3D it's totally worth it!".

It's not supposed to be realisticobviously. It's filled with metaphors and meaning. Here's some trivia that can be missed. Repeated viewing reveals that the 3 characters that Dorothy meets are based on 3 people she knows. They are seen earlier in the movie and are played by the same people. When rewatching their early dialog becomes more noteworthy. The music is VERY memorable. And the movie has a very popular catch phrase everyone's heard many times. Also there was a play on PBS in '95 based on the movie and I loved it. It starred Jewel and Roger Daltry as the Tin man and he ROCKed  literally. It was classic. I like how the audience laughing added to the play. It's out on VHS.".

The detail of Glinda's  The Good Witch's  costume and many other costumes was amazing. The rust marks on the Tin Man's  Jack Haley's  body was very detailed and later very shinny after their visit to Oz.We also heard several adults explaining to their children some of the story line before the movie started. A new generation was being introduced to the Wizard Of Oz just as if they were at the opening in 1939.I suggest all lovers of The Wizard Of Oz relive this classic again with their children and grandchildren the way it was meant to be seen on the big screen.".

To many of you these claims may be outrages but i hope and pray that you will take this into your heart. As many of you may know The wizard of Oz is the classic tale of a small Kansas girl named Dorthy and her adventures in the magical land of Oz all to find a wizard who can take her home. But when you can look past all of that you can see the storys real dark meaning. It may shock you to know that the wicked witch of the west is actually a parody of Christianity out cast and feared. Glenda The good witch represents Satan who may seem nice on the outside but is actually out to get your soul. And of course sweet innocent Dorthey is the modern heathen who is pulled away from Christianity by Satan. Also there is the Lion the Tin man and the Scare Crow an obvious mockery of the Trinity! But friends it dose't end there if you look closely enogh in one scene You will see some munchkins sacrifice a virgin on an alter! I am appauld that they show this movie in schools to CHILDREN! So I urge you to throw out any Wizard of Oz related items you may have and instead READ THE BIBLE. It is a great book written by the best aurthor ever!End of quote. Whew!I believe in the Bible as much as anyone but why oh why do so many thumpers insist on ramming it down peoples throats? I suppose they don't realize they're doing the exact opposite of what they're attempting to accomplish. Good Lord get a life.The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. Period. End of story. Did you notice I said story? It's a fairytale. A delightful fantasy. Nothing more nothing less.".

There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch such pleasure from movies is rare to be had and I cannot recommend this enough not just as an antidote to MTVgeneration philistinism but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting  the amazing sets the imagination the witty songs the metaphors and the songs all of which are perfect.

It has to be the best fantasy movie ever made.A twister sends Dorothy her dog Toto and their home to the magical land of Oz. When there she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way she meets up with the Scarecrow Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West's strange monkeybat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard who gives the Scarecrow his brain the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying There's No Place Like Home but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.The best song in the movie has to be Somewhere Over the Rainbow which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles Burt Lahr Ray Bolger Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it. The VHS copy I own also features some extras including one on the making of the move.Rating 5 stars out of 5.".

How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful but the dynamics between the characters  all of them selfish even Skylar  is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers preferring to acknowledge indeed highlight the complexity and pain of personal growth and selfrealisation.You could read a lot of selfhelp books but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared what it's like to experience loss how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema I felt sombre. When I got home I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly inside you.As cinema it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class.

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie and I only hope to add a few more praises.The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.Yes there is a girl but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.The writing is witty brilliant and hilarious at times both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time and lands an easy 10 out of 10.This one is a keeper in my movie library.".

The movie lasts for 2 hours and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.Matt plays Will Hunting who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben.

Then moments when he William's character says gems like I'll save you the suspense sport she isn't perfect  neither are you the question is whether you are perfect for each other. I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships and life career decisions the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some white trash as someone else said some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash just normal hard working middle class guys  it's about love life and courage courage to ante up  try again no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning  I am sad for the people that didn't get it.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship love pain the past holding back who we could be in the present acceptance or not of our place in society.Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could with his talents. Will works as a Janitor but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story the resident Maths guru Professor Gerry Lambeau sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realises he has a genius hiding in his midst.When Will is later involved in a fight he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college Sean MacGuire played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form. who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.It is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and passages of dialogue. In particular Williams monologue to Damon when sat on the park bench is sublime. Wills relationship with Skylar played by Minnie Driver is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Wills character from the cocky kid pushing everyone away to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.There are very few flaws to be found in this film largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathise with in real life. The characters are richly written and they are all interdependent in the telling of the proceedings. You really care what happens to these people.I could nick pick and draw attention to the psychiatrist scenes in Robert Redfords Ordinary People 1980 which bear close resemblance to the ones in Good Will Hunting but I think Damon and Affleck just took the bar up another notch with their interpretation of the Doctor  Patient working relationship.All in all an uplifting and worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave the cinema.".

	schema:headline " The Genius In Our Midst";
	schema:reviewBody "So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen or it's not box office subject matter or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest wackiest most innovative comics that ever walked the earth drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is if you don't use it and move up and on you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied learned and developed.Unlike Will Hunting Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.".

	onyx:emotionText "So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen or it's not box office subject matter or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.Robin Williams one of the wildest wackiest most innovative comics that ever walked the earth drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is if you don't use it and move up and on you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.I've known a few Will Huntings in my day blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks.

The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet the casting is so well done and the acting at such good level that interest is nicely maintained.What Hunting essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast director and of course the script. While the basic situation is really quite farfetched it is made to seem plausibleagain the mark of good convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still one can't really call it luck for both Damon and Affleck paid their dues  and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men with perseverance and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality.

	schema:headline " So unrealistic that it hurts";
	schema:reviewBody "Good Will Hunting is a story about a 20 year old MIT janitor named Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. The notsoflashy hobbies of Mr. Hunting include hanging out with his friends telling jokes drinking beer and starting fist fights. But you know what? He's also stupefyingly gifted at mathematics. Will seems to know math better than anyone else in the world including a Fieldmedal awarded professor with whom he talks in the movie just because he has heard some MIT lectures and read a couple of books.Sounds realistic? No it doesn't. What the movie loses in it's realism it aims to gain in it's emotional power. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story of the hardships of a mathematical genius the way they did to make a typical moviegoer identify himherself with the main character. At it's core Good Will Hunting is a collection of very finely executed drama romance violence fight against authorities. You name it GWH has it. The level of acting offered by Damon Affleck Skarsgrd and Driver is good. Robin Williams is excellent.The movie contains a reference to Srinivasa Ramanujan a mathematical prodigy from a poor Indian background who astonished the world with his unconventional theories in the early 20th century. This real life genius received a big book about advanced trigonometry from his teacher at age 10 came to understand it fully by the age of 13 and dedicated the rest of his life to mathematical research.If Hunting was portrayed as an eccentric like Ramanujan and if his mathematical abilities were an integral part of the character's way of seeing the world this movie wouldn't probably have had as much viewers as it ended up having but it could have had some depth and believability.Sadly Hunting's mathematicallogical abilities are only portrayed in scenes in which he draws some diagrams on paper or chalkboard. It's understandable that creating a superbly talented mind entirely from scratch is hard for writers who are not mathematical geniuses. You might ask then why did Damon  Affleck choose to write a story about a mathematical genius in the first place? Had they chosen any other type of talent they would very probably have been able to create a more convincing character. My guess is that they did that simply because mathematical abilities are often seen as something mystical and mystical abilities draw in crowd to theaters.I had high hopes for Good Will Hunting. Sadly this movie is embarrassingly childish and sentimental collection of audience luring issues with very little credibility.".

	onyx:emotionText "Good Will Hunting is a story about a 20 year old MIT janitor named Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. The notsoflashy hobbies of Mr. Hunting include hanging out with his friends telling jokes drinking beer and starting fist fights. But you know what? He's also stupefyingly gifted at mathematics. Will seems to know math better than anyone else in the world including a Fieldmedal awarded professor with whom he talks in the movie just because he has heard some MIT lectures and read a couple of books.Sounds realistic? No it doesn't. What the movie loses in it's realism it aims to gain in it's emotional power. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story of the hardships of a mathematical genius the way they did to make a typical moviegoer identify himherself with the main character. At it's core Good Will Hunting is a collection of very finely executed drama romance violence fight against authorities. You name it GWH has it.

Robin Williams is excellent.The movie contains a reference to Srinivasa Ramanujan a mathematical prodigy from a poor Indian background who astonished the world with his unconventional theories in the early 20th century.

The information is accurate but the source is ludicrous. There is no way that his character could make such an argument even if he had read the authors and understood them. He showed knowledge of the Harvard curriculum that even someone in the Liberal Arts Department would not know. It just strained credibility as this whole movie does.

And the laughing moments range from chuckles to totally surprise you as they burst out of your chest howls out loud. Though we have our boys we are waiting to adopt a girl so the theme of parents who want a child that they can't seem to have and the theme of taking in a child that you didn't give birth to andor adoption really hit home for us. I sat at the end of the movie and cried and they were tears of laughter and sadness and hope all mixed up together. Even if you're not interested in adoption this is really a touching show. I wish Disney made more movies like this. Totally clean nothing even remotely possibly offensive and yet it wasn't just a kid show. It was interesting engaging witty. As noted above  good for everyone from ages 5 to 40!".

His young female friend Odeya Rush is the best in the cast. Joel Edgerton is perfect for Lifetime movie of the week. They are all really likable. So I just wished I liked the film more. And the message is terrific. I cry in schmaltzy films but I think it says much about this film in that the only time it brought any tears was in the final scene which was grounded in reality. When the fantasy was going I just wasn't sucked in.7 may be a generous rating but this is a solid family film with a strong positive message. There is a big audience out there for this film.

	schema:headline " Despite best efforts of Jennifer Garner  CJ Adams odd movie is boring and dumb";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie opens with Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton as prospective adoptive parents trying to make their case for application. The three agency characters shown are bureaucratic caricatures except for occasional interjections of nasty and misanthropic attempts at humor that no bureaucrat would risk losing her or his job to make. It is during this time that to explain what experiences have prepared them for parenthood that they tell their tales of The Odd Life of Timothy Green in flashback. Having been told finally that natural parenthood is impossible for them the Greens perform one final exercise of writing down what their perfect child would be like then putting them in a box and burning it. Lo and behold Timothy the only boy name selected comes out of the garden and behaves with all the characteristics they imagined as time unfolds one pronounced trait at a time. I love good fantasies but they should be internally consistent within the rules of the fantasy world they create. This one isn't close. I also enjoy feelgood movies  one description many reviewers use for this. This movie has an awful lot of misanthropic characters and humor for a feelgood movie. It plays to me more like an ironic fantasy of Raold Dahl Matilda Charlie  the Chocolate Factory etc. without the sharp wit or the internal consistency. You know you are in trouble when the kindest and sweetest of the supporting characters is played by M. Emmett Walsh. David Morse normally a personal favorite plays Edgerton's father so devoid of humanity that we never get a clear view of his face. Rosemarie DeWitt Tara's sister in the US of Tara plays a stereotyped condescending judgmental and catty sister. Michael Arden is still another sarcastic friend and coworker with his own agenda. Diane Wiest another favorite and generally wonderful in fantasy Edward Scisssorhands is so nasty and unlikable that her transformation seems ridiculous. The untalented Ron Livingston is even nastier and less convincing than usual as Edgerton's slimy boss. Edgerton is no better than adequate as the husband. CJ Adams is marvelous and thoroughly credible as the Timothy Green he creates and Jennifer Garner does manage to move my heart as contrived and nasty as the script is. These are two standout performances far better than this movie deserves. One real problem is that even though Timothy's appearance transformation deeds and exit actions are magical that magic is nowhere to be seen or appreciated onscreen. This makes the movie a pointless and dense 105minute talkfest for kids and pointless and unlikable for most adults looking for entertainment. Another major problem given how contentious and nasty the Green's friends and relatives are and given the mysterious appearance of this boy and the movie's smallcompanytown atmosphere how is it that nobody has asked questions to the local adoption agency about this boy or seriously investigates where he came from. Finally the people and town also seem too affluent and dress too well for a company town whose main business is failing. Also how is it that Dianne Wiest who runs the company where Garner works is suddenly onstage for the climactic scene in the pencil company where Ron Livingston takes credit for Green's invention? What is the soccer coach doing there? Has the movie suddenly morphed into Gung Ho? I could continue to go into the inconsistency of Timothy's homilies about his gifts and the couple actually getting a kid form the bureaucrats but that too would be pointless.".

	schema:headline " So Sugary Sweet I Got a Cavity Watching It";
	schema:reviewBody "This Disney fantasy is way too sugary sweet and predictable for my tastes. It stars Jennifer Garner Joel Edgerton and C J Adams as Timothy.Garner and Edgerton are a married couple living in the small town of Stanleyville. The town is idyllically beautiful and it has as its' main enterprise a local pencil factory. The factory has been owned for generations by the Crudstaff family.However due to the economic times the factory is in danger of closing. Edgerton works at the factory while Garner is employed at the Crudstaff House and Pencil Museum as a guide.The film is told in flashbacks as the couple are being interviewed to be adoptive parents. They are relating their magical experiences with Timothy Green to the counselors.Having been told by their fertility doctor that they cannot have children they decide that night to write down all the wonderful qualities they would have liked their child to have. They put the papers in a metal box and bury it in the backyard. During the night a huge rainstorm hits and suddenly a young boyTimothymagically appears in their home.Guess what? He possesses all the characteristics that they had written down and will follow the path that they had envisioned for him. However there's one big caveat. He has leaves attached to his legs and in time as the leaves are shed one by one you can guess what will be the end result.I'm puzzled why the makers of the film decided to make many of the supporting cast such unlikeable characters. Garner's sister portrayed by Rosemarie DeWitt is selfcentered and fairly obnoxious while Edgerton's father played by the wonderful actor Robert Morse is basically a macho bully. Also pretty much the entire Crudstaff family Dianne Wiest and Ron Livingston in particular are quite meanspirited.Not all the supporting characters are unlikeable. Odeya Rush plays a young girl who befriends Timothy when no one else will. She shows him what is apparently a large red birthmark on her shoulder which has caused her to be kind of an outcast as well.All in all this film may appeal to youngsters who will ignore the schmaltz a lot more than it appealed to me. Also possibly to adults who like these type of complete sweet fantasies.".

By all means this should had been a great entertaining and heartfelt modern fairy tale for the whole family to enjoy but the movie handles certain themes poorly and make some odd choices with its story at times.And honestly I still foremost really liked the movie. It's harmless and cute enough still and the movie has its moments. But that doesn't take away anything from the fact that this movie still is being a bit of a missed opportunity.All of the right intentions were there it just didn't always worked out successfully. The approach they were going for was a heartfelt family movie in which a mysterious young boy brings people together and changes their lives for the positive. It just happen to do it all in a wrong way for most of the time. First of all it does far too little with its mysteryfantasy aspects. They accept the boy for who he is and where he came from pretty early on and easily. Besides it all seems like the boy is doing very little special actually as if the movie was afraid it would loose some of its viewers if it was going to be more heavy on its fantasy aspects.That perhaps was the movie its biggest problem it wasn't heavy on its fantasy. The movie rather picks some uninteresting plot developments instead. It prefers to be about pencils as opposed to something more heartfelt or bigger than life. It seems like the movie still wanted to be about morals and wanted to teach you about life but it mostly does so by inserting stereotypical characters and some forced or formulaic dramatic moments. It's not as warm and emotional involving as this movie required to be in order for it to let it all work out.I am also still a bit confused about it who this movie was aimed for. It seems to be a bit too slow and uninteresting for young children and not convincing enough for adults. It's a bit in between of being an entertaining children's movie and a modern fairy tale for adults. I did wished they had balanced certain things out a bit better so the movie would had been better and more fun to watch for both adults and youngsters. The movie is still being fine as it is. I mean all the things I had problems with didn't ruined the movie for me in any way and I could certainly still enjoy and appreciate it for what it was. It's cuteness factor and innocence still make this a recommendable film. Just don't expect to be very taken or blown away by any of it.710 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Peter Hedges the director and cowriter of the film did a nice job with this movie which doesn't have lots of special effects but delivers the hallmark family fun that Disney is known for Peter finds a way to draw your sensitivity out and make you develop an emotional attachment to the characters from the movies first scene of parents struggling to have a child to when a naked kid shows up and then all the way till the end.The odd life of Timothy green is about a couple Cindy and Jim Green Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton who couldn't have children. The couple has done all they can to get pregnant but all to no avail so they began to dream about what their child would be like they wrote down all they wished he would be achieve and become placed it in a box and buried it in the backyard.One stormy night young Timothy CJ Adams shows up on their doorstep and calls them mum and dad.CJ Adams was exceptional in his task as Timothy Green child actors seem to have a difficult role sometimes when they have to convince you but CJ did a good job and I was impressed by his acting.As Adams plays young Timothy who sees life differently hey!

	schema:headline " A very odd film to say the least";
	schema:reviewBody "Please don't ask about my leaves. I'm generally a fan of Disney family movies and don't mind when they get overly sentimental or extremely sweet as long as the characters have depth and the story rings authentic. The problem I had with The Odd Life of Timothy Green wasn't that it was too emotional or sweet but rather that the story never felt authentic. I know the story is fictional but even so I never believed the father and son relationship and the movie really never connected with me. Like the title suggests it felt too odd and weird. I enjoyed Peter Hedges previous movie Dan in Real Life. He is mostly known of course for writing the screenplay for What's Eating Gilbert Grape. Hedges definitely has a lot of talent but this film just failed to connect with me. In my opinion it is one of his weakest efforts. He adapted the screenplay from Ahmet Zappa's story. I really wouldn't watch this film again even though I liked the actors. I loved Joel Edgerton in Warrior and Jennifer Garner is a well liked actress. CJ Adams did a very good job in the title role as Timothy but as much as I liked these actors I never enjoyed the story. Everything seemed so disconnected from reality and I couldn't find any character with depth. It was like if they were in a rush to tell the story and they never stopped to focus on the relationships that were being built.The film begins by introducing us to a young couple from Stanleyville the pencil capital of the world who is trying to adopt a kid. Cindy Jennifer Garner and Jim Green Joel Edgerton are being interviewed in order to see if they are qualified and thus they begin to narrate the story about the boy who changed their lives Timothy. The entire film is told in flashback style while the couple is in the interview. They story begins with them in the doctor's office where they are given the bad news that they will never be able to have children. That night they arrive home devastated by the news but Jim decides to dream for one last night about their child. They begin to name several qualities that child would have and they write them down. After coming up with several qualities they put them inside a box and bury it in their backyard garden. That night a strong storm hits their home and they wake up to a strange sound in the house. They discover a young boy named Timothy CJ Adams who has leaves growing out of his ankles. Timothy calls them mom and dad and that is when Jim and Cindy discover that their dream child has grown out of their garden. Timothy teaches them several lessons about life and parenting. He also falls in love with a young girl named Joni Odeya Rush who helps him to adopt to the new life. A few surprises happen along the way as Timothy meets the rest of the family and town members. He inspires and changes the lives of Jim and Cindy forever.As much as I wanted to like this family friendly movie I couldn't. The film lacked authenticity or at least a sense of minimal believability in a fairytale. I liked CJ Adams performance but his character wasn't really well developed either. He was a little too odd and I never felt the connection between him and his parents. This is yet another movie that seems to tell us that children are wiser than their parents but I will make an exception here because we were dealing with a miraculous kid. There is not much more I can say about this film you either love it or hate it. With me it failed to make any connection whatsoever but it is a sweet family friendly film. I didn't find it to be very emotional although it does try to be a tearjerker. It never reached that emotional level or touching moment that I was hoping for.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

The storyline is both magical and grounded in reality where we follow Timothy Green learn about others and life. This includes bullying love competition and yes even death. I found it to be a bit of a mix between two other old live action Disney movies Polyanna and Mary Poppins.The acting in this movie is superb especially CJ Adams as the main character and Dianne Weist as the grumpy old lady everybody knows. Both of these actors were able to play their characters multi dimensional and I really got a laugh out of Weist's dour expression for most of the movie. The movie rounds out nicely with M. Emmet Walsh David Morse and what? Common.The only gripe I had with the movie was I felt that it was a bit slow moving and could have been about a 30 minutes shorter but it still was one of Disney's bests and one of the best movies I have seen this year.When it comes out next week I highly recommend seeing it. A unique family story about adoption with a sprinkle of that Disney magic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Count me as the odd man out in my opinion of this picture.Disney Studio's effort to create a benign supernatural tale  with more than a passing nod to Forrest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  about a young boy who magically appears from a garden at first seemed a bit ludicrous. Upon viewing The Odd Life of Timothy Green however reveals it is actually a bittersweet emotional heartfelt experience. Yet there are some glaring distractions which make it difficult to give that experience a total recommendation.Directed by Peter Hedges Pieces of April Dan in Real Life and written by Hedges and Ahmet Zappa The Odd Life of Timothy Green often cannot decide which road it wants to travel. Some critics may label this a wellmeaning yet thinlyveiled sentimental blahfest I tried to see it more as a positive family film certainly flawed and certainly clichd in part but overall somewhat satisfying with several genuine lumpinthethroat moments. However unlike the recent Moonrise Kingdom where the presence of two offbeat young characters was a revelation here it becomes tiresome.Told in flashback to an international adoption official the story has married couple Jim and Cindy Green Joel Edgerton Warrior and Jennifer Gardner Arthur unable to conceive yet passionate about having a baby. So in true Hollywood fashion they write down the attributes of a perfect child and bury the notes in their garden. I cannot imagine anyone doing such a thing but . . . thanks to a Home Alonelike mystical contrivance though a little boy Timothy CJ Adams Dan In Real Life makes his entrance.At first the Greens believe him to be a runaway but realize he has come from a place they could not possibly comprehend the leaves growing from his ankles illustrates the weird circumstances they find themselves in. They make no effort to explain his presence to family friends and school officials other than to say it was a miraculous adoption. Then trying to be perfect parents they find themselves repeating the same mistakes their own mothers and fathers did. This is especially true of Jim whose dad David Morse 16 Blocks ignored him andor bullied him for years.Yet for all of his strangeness he goes into trances while looking at the sun and seems blissfully idiotic at times Timothy has a most positive attitude and brings joy to older actors such as M. Emmet Walsh Back to School and Dianne Wiest Parenthood among others. He also becomes involved with another bizarre loner Joni Odeya Rush Curb Your Enthusiasm TV series who has a birthmark instead of vegetation and drags giant tree limbs around on her bicycle.Meanwhile a subplot concerning the possible closing of the town's pencil factory causes more consternation since both parents are employed at the plant. Token villains including Cindy's snobby sister Brenda Rosemarie DeWitt The Watch and factory owner Franklin Crudstaff Ron Livingston best known for Office Space are inserted simply to root against. A sports element is also thrown in for no particular reason other than to show the good and bad side of moms and dads who derive success and failure from their offspring.The messages contained within while certainly valuable and sometimes acted admirably often lack a sense of subtly  sometimes the writing is carved with a chisel and smeared with too many situations we have seen many times before. That and there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads with Garner's irritating performance as the meatheaded mother provoking much more anger and impatience than empathy.My frustration was also how to separate the wheat from the chaff here. I think any movie that supports a profamily proadoption agenda has a definite place in our current film lexicon. I just wish that The Odd Life of Timothy Green was a better example of those values.".

Emmet Walsh Back to School and Dianne Wiest Parenthood among others. He also becomes involved with another bizarre loner Joni Odeya Rush Curb Your Enthusiasm TV series who has a birthmark instead of vegetation and drags giant tree limbs around on her bicycle.Meanwhile a subplot concerning the possible closing of the town's pencil factory causes more consternation since both parents are employed at the plant. Token villains including Cindy's snobby sister Brenda Rosemarie DeWitt The Watch and factory owner Franklin Crudstaff Ron Livingston best known for Office Space are inserted simply to root against. A sports element is also thrown in for no particular reason other than to show the good and bad side of moms and dads who derive success and failure from their offspring.The messages contained within while certainly valuable and sometimes acted admirably often lack a sense of subtly  sometimes the writing is carved with a chisel and smeared with too many situations we have seen many times before. That and there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads with Garner's irritating performance as the meatheaded mother provoking much more anger and impatience than empathy.My frustration was also how to separate the wheat from the chaff here. I think any movie that supports a profamily proadoption agenda has a definite place in our current film lexicon. I just wish that The Odd Life of Timothy Green was a better example of those values.";

	schema:reviewBody "First of all let me give this disclaimer. I am one of the background actors in the movie AfricanAmerican male at the picnic soccer games factory and town hall so there might be a little bias.The movie is actually very good but alas is a Disney film and Disney tends to keep their movies under two hours to match the attention span of the intended audiences.That said this movie could have used another 1520 minutes to help flesh out the main and supporting characters. Having spent almost 20 days on the set I can say director Peter Hedges About A Boy What's Eating Gilbert Grape probably did have such a film only to have to cut another chunk or two.Sadly those chunks would have helped.The story begins with Jim Green Joel Edgerton and his wife Cindy Jennifer Garner talking to an adoption agency administrator Shohreh Aghdashloo. The Greens have left key portions of their paperwork empty  the parts concerning prior experience and why they would make good parents. For that Jim and Cindy decide to recount the odd life of Timothy Green.From there we see in flashback Jim and Cindy being told by a doctor that Cindy cannot get pregnant. The couple go home to cry about it but Jim doesn't want to give up. So he puts all the wishes he's had for a children on paper and encourages Cindy to do the same. They bury the wishes in a box in a hole in the garden.A strange rain storm hits. When Jim and Cindy investigate they find a mysterious boy covered in mud in the room they'd set aside for the kid that would never be born. His name is Timothy and he's soon calling Jim and Cindy Dad and Mom. And he has a big secret  he's got leaves growing out of his ankles leaves so strong and natural that local florist Reggie LinManuel Sanders breaks his shears trying to snip them.Afterward the story goes in a whirlwind. Timothy is introduced to the rest of the family  Cindy's sister Brenda Rosemarie DeWitt Uncle Bub M. Emmet Walsh Uncle Mel Lois Smith and Jim's dad Big Jim David Morse as well as friends Gregory Marshall Smith Paul Kakos Sonia Guzman Chance Bartels Paul Barlow Jr. among others. It's here we see the effects of the editing as the introductions of these characters is missing leaving us a bit confused. We know Jim and Big Jim don't see eye to eye but we get no real sense of the tension. We learn Brenda is more successful than Cindy and has three kids but we can't get a feel for the sibling rivalry. Uncle Bub and Aunt Mel look like they were thrown in.And this is how much of the film plays out. When we meet Bernice Crudstaff Oscar winner Dianne Wiest whose father started the town's pencil factory we only catch glimpses and only learn her name later. Her husband Joseph James Rebhorn is virtually a ghost getting perhaps two scenes. Their son Franklin Ron Livingston runs the pencil factory and is supposed to be a hard case but we only see a few wisps of his snobbery including at the crucial town meeting where he gets called on the carpet.About the most interesting parts of the movie are Joni Jerome Odeya Rush a local girl with her own little secret and Coach Cal rapper Common who treats Timothy as a mere water boy for the factory's soccer team. Joni gets a chance to reveal her secret and find a friend and vice versa for Timothy while Coach learns it's more about gamesmanship than winning.Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner make a charming and believable couple but C.J. Adams who plays Timothy steals the show. He ably and superbly plays all of the emotional weight put upon his shoulders as he has to emulate all of the wishes of his movie parents.Knowing what I know of the production I honestly believe another 1520 minutes of footage from the Scott SandersAhmet Zappa production could have done wonders for plot and character development.Overall though it was a very good film that could have been better. For now just revel in Timothy's wonder Jim and Cindy's growth as parents and the fun of the soccer games. Yes it's odd but so is the life of Timothy Green.".

They write down all the things on little pieces of paper and put them in a wooden box. In a terrible rain storm with lots of thunder and lightning they bury the box in the garden. The next morning Jim wakes up and instead of Cindy in the bed he finds dirt. Puzzled he calls the police because he thinks someone has been in the house while they slept. He refers to the storm the night before but they tell him there was no storm. It seems it was only at their house. Shortly they find a small boy covered with dirt in the house playing with some things packed in a box..

	schema:reviewBody "There's a joke early in the film in which Timothy asks his parents why the skeleton didn't cross the road. The answer is that it had no guts. This level of humor sums up the tone intelligence and target audience for The Odd Life of Timothy Green which struggles to find creativity worthy comedy and resonance. The basic unsophisticated nature of the sparse laughs demonstrates a rift in movie makers to viewers. It attempts to appeal to adults simply by having matured characters and to children just by including childish adventure. But much is left to be desired especially when the adults act insincerely and the adolescents are unnaturally aloof.Jim Joel Edgerton and Cindy Green Jennifer Garner wish to adopt a child. They must argue their case to an impatient agent Shohreh Aghdashloo of the United States Adoption Services fatefully choosing to recount their bizarre tale of a tenyearold boy who magically entered their lives as proof of their competency. The couple both of who work in various aspects of the pencilproducing capital city of Stanleyville becomes frustrated at the ultimate news of not being able to have children. In a final night of dreaming up ideal qualities for the kid they can't have during which they fill a box with handwritten attributes that is then buried in the garden something unexplainable happens.

	onyx:emotionText "There's a joke early in the film in which Timothy asks his parents why the skeleton didn't cross the road. The answer is that it had no guts. This level of humor sums up the tone intelligence and target audience for The Odd Life of Timothy Green which struggles to find creativity worthy comedy and resonance. The basic unsophisticated nature of the sparse laughs demonstrates a rift in movie makers to viewers. It attempts to appeal to adults simply by having matured characters and to children just by including childish adventure. But much is left to be desired especially when the adults act insincerely and the adolescents are unnaturally aloof.Jim Joel Edgerton and Cindy Green Jennifer Garner wish to adopt a child. They must argue their case to an impatient agent Shohreh Aghdashloo of the United States Adoption Services fatefully choosing to recount their bizarre tale of a tenyearold boy who magically entered their lives as proof of their competency. The couple both of who work in various aspects of the pencilproducing capital city of Stanleyville becomes frustrated at the ultimate news of not being able to have children. In a final night of dreaming up ideal qualities for the kid they can't have during which they fill a box with handwritten attributes that is then buried in the garden something unexplainable happens. A young boy enters the Green's home revealing strange little leaves growing from his legs upturned dirt and the shattered remains of the box are discovered in the backyard. Timothy has enchantingly grown to be the exact offspring the Green's had always hoped for.

	schema:reviewBody "This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not. When the final credits rolled rather creatively at that I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film. I could not decide. I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine. While it was a very interesting audio commentary it only provided more indecisiveness. After thinking about this for two days I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing there has to be something spectacular about it and there was. After two days I was able to put my finger on it. You had a very chilling story a deeply disturbing confession a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman and then there was Ethan Hawke. I put him aside because it was his acting his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection. Let me explain.This is a story that on the surface seems small is very large in structure. While its only setting is inside a motel room the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies we never really know anything about him. Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single but we never really get to know Ethan's character. This is what muddled in my mind for those two days I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was. Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted. Who knows? I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince. We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this selfappointed villain or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose. Instead what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him. Here is what I could hear Ok Ethan your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave do whatever it takes. Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot. Does this make sense? I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told. I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer but this story needed a hint. It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation. I felt Ethan held us back from learning that. Someone else in the role may have done better but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.As I said before Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders. I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work but his true acting ability really came forth. The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of husband and wife away while working with Ethan. I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate. The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering. I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created. Outside of Ethan they did a great job.The story was a very tight story. I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room. I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle but Stephen Belber who also wrote the play did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters. Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament. The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera. Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts. I thought this was annoying at times and quite dizzying. It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story. That is my only critique of Linklater's direction which was nearly flawless.Overall this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element. It took me a while for me to realize this and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind but that is the nature of this film. It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends. I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material. Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired. I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role. Either way this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100 pure acting.Grade  out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not. When the final credits rolled rather creatively at that I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film. I could not decide. I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine. While it was a very interesting audio commentary it only provided more indecisiveness. After thinking about this for two days I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing there has to be something spectacular about it and there was. After two days I was able to put my finger on it. You had a very chilling story a deeply disturbing confession a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman and then there was Ethan Hawke. I put him aside because it was his acting his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection. Let me explain.This is a story that on the surface seems small is very large in structure. While its only setting is inside a motel room the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies we never really know anything about him. Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single but we never really get to know Ethan's character. This is what muddled in my mind for those two days I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was. Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted. Who knows? I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince. We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this selfappointed villain or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose. Instead what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him. Here is what I could hear Ok Ethan your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave do whatever it takes. Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot. Does this make sense? I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told. I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer but this story needed a hint. It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation. I felt Ethan held us back from learning that. Someone else in the role may have done better but Ethan just felt lost and stagy.As I said before Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders. I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work but his true acting ability really came forth. The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of husband and wife away while working with Ethan. I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate. The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering. I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created. Outside of Ethan they did a great job.The story was a very tight story. I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room. I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle but Stephen Belber who also wrote the play did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters. Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament. The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera. Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts. I thought this was annoying at times and quite dizzying. It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story.

	schema:reviewBody "When it starts Tape seems like a very unprofessional student film and I was expecting not to like it  but by the time it's reached it's conclusion Richard Linklater's talky little drama has hit all the right notes and despite the fact that this is simply three actors spending 85 minutes in one location Linklater has done what he did with Before Sunrise and proved that great dialogue is enough to make a film great. Of course he didn't write this film and that honour goes to Stephen Belber whose play this film is based on. The dialogue itself is brilliant and it's constantly fascinating to see how the characters are built up through what they say. Although we don't know anything about these characters before the film starts by the end we know about them just through their dialogue which shows the thought that has been put into everything the characters say. The plot is deliciously simple which gives all of the characters room to expand and interact with each other. Basically what we have here is two high school friends that meet up in a motel room for the first time in ten years. While there they discuss the darker areas of their time together at school Of course for this film to work good actors are a definite must have and this film definitely has them! Ethan Hawke massively impressed in Linklater's Before Sunrise and he does so again here albeit in a totally different way. The character he has been given here is much harder to like than his one in Linklater's masterpiece but Hawke shows his worth as an actor by brilliantly stepping into the role and giving his character a definite grounding in realism. His costars Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman give similar portrayals and the ensemble helps to make the film what it is. What makes films like Tape great is their ambiguity. Many of the things that the characters say can be interpreted in different ways and most people will have different ideas as to why certain characters say certain things. The story behind the immediate goings on is well orchestrated and even though nothing that the characters are talking about is shown it's still easy to picture it. What happens in the hotel room is also very well executed and the playwright has made sure that his story is never boring. Linklater's use of the camera is good with the swirling angles creating a claustrophobic feel within the small confines of the hotel room. Tape is the sort of film that can be analysed in all different ways and that gives it infinite rewatch value and when the material is this good rewatching can only be a pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Linklater's new film Tape is the most jarring film of his career. The film takes place entirely in a hotel room in Michigan where the main character Vince played by Ethan Hawkeis downing two beers at once.  He is waiting for the arrival of his old friend John Robert Sean Leonard an indie filmmaker whose new film is playing at a local filmfestival.Vince's motivations for seeing John have less to do with seeing his friend again and more to do with confronting him about an incident which happened when they were younger. Apparently back in their high school days John raped a woman named Amy played by Uma Thurman.  Amy was Vince's exgirlfriend and someone whom both men are still infactuated with. However the story is less about the somewhat ambiguous question over whether or not John raped Amy and more about these two characters and their lack of control over their lives. If any character in a Richard Linklater film can be described as a loser it's Vince.  He drinks beer smokes pot and snorts coke throughout  the entire movie.  He is a drugdealer who deludes himself that he also has a legitimate job and therefore control over his life as a volunteer firefighter. John on the other hand seemingly has more control over his life but that's only because he deals with his shattered ego internally while Vince deals with it externally. John has a dream job  a young up and coming film director whose movie is playing at a filmfestival. And yet he is terribly dissatisfied with his life.  He tells Vince that the film festival is only showing his film once in the afternoon and that it is only a small filmfestival anyway.  One gets the feeling that the only reason why John hangs out with a guy like Vince is to feel secure in his own existence.  He only seems relaxed wheh he tells Vince that he should get a life.Twothirds of the way through the movie Amy herself makes an appearance in the hotel room.  And it is then that we realize that all this time she has been merely a pawn in these mens' lives to allow them to feel they were in control of their own lives.  Whether or not John raped Amy or merely had violent concentual sex with her that situation was all about the selfconscious John feeling that he was controling someone else since he couldn't control his own life.  And Vince's defence of Amy's honor has more to do with the fact that Amy never went all the way with him and John did. As it turns out Amy is the only one who has any control over her life. And subsequently it is she who uses these two men as a kind of revenge at the way they have been using her. This is a very daring and extremely unconventional film which will have a hard time finding an audience.  Certainly it will not be for everyone. Visually it is far different from any film Linklater has made in the past.  In films like Before Sunrise and SubUrbia Linklater's camera was brilliantly unobtrusive enabling us to quietly observe these charcters and what makes them tick with Linklater never drawing attention to the camera. In Tape on the other hand the viewer feels like a voyeur intruding on something that has nothing to do with them  the way Amy herself probably feels when watching these two men.  And the camera is constantly drawing attention to itself to the point where it's actually distracting and even infuriating.  If the sight of people talking in previous Linklater films felt inviting this feels more like an uncomfortable situation you can't get out of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shot on DV in one night at 'Tape' makes the viewer feel like a voyeur peeking into a motel room. It's set in a motel room where two friends reunite after 10 years ironically Hawke and Leonard also appear together on screen more than a decade after their last film 'Dead Poet's Society' and have a private conversation that turns from the common catching up to unravelling secrets.The entire movie is pretty much a conversation but it is a layered film with layered characters. The writing is brilliant. The editing it very tight. As the events unfold with clever twists it becomes an intense human drama and a thrilling experience for the audience. While we are provided with sufficient background information on Amy and Jon Vince remains somewhat of a mystery. His intentions remain for the viewer to interpret as there are hints that point in different directions. The handheld camera mostly acts as hidden camera that lures the viewer to look into a private moment of these three character's lives. The swirling camera actually acts like a person itself who's just sitting there while no one is aware of its presence. Once Linklater builds the tension he sustains it and keeps the viewer engaged right through the end.Being a conversational piece it relies strongly on acting. The performances are solid. Ethan Hawke does a fine job of the druginduced hyper but manipulative Vince. His character may be a bit ambiguous but he plays the part to the T. Robert Sean Leonard is adequate but in some places he seems a little lost. However after Uma Thurman's entry he is remarkable. Uma Thurman looks sensational with simple makeup. This is one actress who can look very plain when needed and supersexy when required. Her acting is excellent as she puts the pieces together while cleverly blindfolding the audience allowing them to figure out what happened.While some people may feel confused at the end it is very thoughtprovoking movie as one would try to figure out the puzzle. On the whole 'Tape' takes us into a different territory that only a few Hollywood films have done. It has some great performances good direction brilliant writing and will very likely keep you glued to the screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an amazing experience this is! Stephen Belber's screenplay based on his play is magic pure magic. Richard Linklater with his daring direction has done the impossible and made a totally compelling film with only three characters in a single dreary motel room. How does one do that? How would you ever get funding for such a crazy project? This is just about as extreme a cinematic risk as it is possible to take. But they more than pulled it off they triumphed. And by 'they' I include the three spellbinding actors Ethan Hawke Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman. What a showcase of acting genius this film is! It is impossible to fault any of the three in even the slightest flicker of a facial muscle or the slightest whisper of dialogue. One wonders whether they may possibly have rehearsed for six months and all lived together day and night to do this. Were they in fact cooped up in that motel room for the duration of the shooting? I would believe it. This film goes beyond honesty it goes beyond revelation it goes beyond nakedness and baring of an actor's soul it is an Xray film or even a gammaray film where every organ can be seen and every pulsation or heartbeat viewed through the transparency of the shimmering and aetherial forms which they all have. One wonders whether Belber may have lived through this. Can he possibly have imagined it? Could anyone? Uma Thurman meets these two fellows for the first time in ten years since high school. They inflict their traumas on her and she inflicts hers on them. This is mutual laceration which is as brilliant as that found in Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' which may have inspired Belber. Thurman's character has pride and does not wish to be dragged into the open admission of a past indignity whereas Hawke's character is driven obsessively to expose it ostensibly in her interests but really in his own. Leonard's character is in a way the hapless victim of both although he was the perpetrator and the original guilty party. The psychological dynamics of all this are as complex as a NATO war game. We are on the edge of our seats every second or we are if we are interested in human nature. This is spectacle without concession. This is raw seriously raw. Everything is ripped away here. This is what might happen at the Day of Judgement. There is nothing left to hide.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think anyone does small dialogueheavy indie film like Richard Linklater. He is the master of them and that only makes me madder when he remakes movies like Bad News Bears. Before Sunrise and Before Sunset are beautiful films shot simply and effectively showing that cinema can rely on words and actors without the need for cranes or effects. Tape is one that works very well with those as a darker companion. Adapted by Stephen Belber from his own play Linklater gives us a claustrophobic account of three old friends' psyches as past pains are dug up to devastating effect. This is one intense film from all angles and very powerful leading one to remember things they have done it the past that they may regret. But do we ever truly recall them how they actually happened or just how we have seared the events into our minds? No one can know the real objective truth just his own subjective outlook.Brought about by one man's insecurities on why his first girlfriend in high school would not sleep with him yet as soon as they broke up did so with his best friend the night starts out light and snowballs into more than he ever could have anticipated. Planning the entire evening in order to entrap his oldest buddy into admitting something that may or may not have happened not even he could have imagined what emotions would be stirred up getting the two participants into the same room ten years later. Both Vincethe orchestratorand Jonthe accusedare selfabsorbed in a way that they can't see for themselves. One has not grown up and seems to be in the same rut he has been since graduation while the other has made something of his life yet it appears somewhat shallowly and not as important as he may want to believe. Always in competition with each other to show how they differ while the other attempts to explain how they are the same this night is no different. Neither of them has any stake in others and truly is only out to save themselves. Whether we are shown apologies happiness truth or lies every moment is selfserving full of empty words spoken to assuage their guilt and not to instill regret or compassion for those they wronged.The title of the film is that of the device used as the catalyst for everything. Vince planned it all to perfection in his head gets buzzed and sets up the motel room as though he was wasted drink one beer dump another down the drain and throw both cans across the room. The room is made so that Jon feels a bit more open to talk exactly what is wanted as the tape recorder listens to it all. A confession sounds a lot different when uttered than when heard from a tape. What is said in the heat of the moment can be a sobering experience when listened to and can make you think things that may or may not be true. Whether Jon truly did what he eventually confesses to is subject to opinion and when the victim enters into the equation you can throw all you thought was true out the window. Did she see the incident in the same way? Did she know exactly what she was doing? Only they know for certain but the mind is a fickle machine evolving over time changing events to mirror the memory instead of the reality. One man's moral crusade his attempt at gaining closure for himself while possibly also for his friends finds that his selfishness not only could destroy the one relationship he truly relies on but also the lives of the three involved.With an intense script to begin with it all becomes more so from the setting and film style. Trapped in a small room for the duration the stakes rise higher and higher as we are shown a slowly uncovering past. The camera begins to film more closeups and we never get to go outside the door nor into the bathroomthe room gets smaller and smaller until it is stifling with the addition of our last character. A big part also is the real life relationships between those involved. The three actors as well as the director have a bond that allows them to be as real as possible on screen making it all believable. You have Ethan Hawke as Vince his reallife wife at the time Uma Thurman as Amy and I'm assuming friend Robert Sean Leonard I guess this because he does so little work and costarred with Hawke in Dead Poets Society that maybe he joined the cast as a favor to his friend and close collaborator Linklater whom Hawke has worked with extensively. Each is phenomenal in their execution and once the climax comes to a boil you finally see the true self of all. Maybe the victim is actually the strongest and maybe the selfrighteous accuser is the weak link to the group always running and always hiding. It is really up to the viewer to decide what is true and what isn't. Just because a confession is on tape does not mean it is truth. That is in the eye of the beholder.".

That is usually a good thing as I'm rarely disappointed by a movie when watching it with that attitude.  However Tape didn't just disappoint me it wasted my time.  I've watched 'Police Academy 5 Assignment Miami Beach' with a better reaction than this pompous load of nonsense.I'm not a big fan of some of the movies in which Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard have participated which began upon my viewing the ultradepressing Dead Poets Society but both actors have made movies I've enjoyed 'Gattaca' and 'In the Gloaming' top the list of favorites and they are very talented actors.  Uma Thurman almost always pleasantly surprises me especially in 'The Truth About Cats  Dogs.'  In fact she was the most positive factor in this film full of negatives.  The actors gave a good effort but the material is sadly lacking.  It was one of those movies you keep watching...HOPING that it will get better.  Unfortunately it doesn't get better.  It doesn't do much of anything.I found this movie to be tedious pretentious and really quite tiresome. It had a rather claustrophobic feel to it most likely on purpose and the characters didn't seem to be well developed.  Tape tried to have its share of twists but they seemed scattered illconceived and not particularly compelling.The bouncy backandforth camerawork in one scene felt akin to having gone on a TiltaWhirl and personally left me with a splitting headache.  Good concept poor execution.In conclusion there are a lot better ways to spend 86 minutes.  My advice is to find one of them instead of watching this movie.".

The actors gave a good effort but the material is sadly lacking.  It was one of those movies you keep watching...HOPING that it will get better.  Unfortunately it doesn't get better.  It doesn't do much of anything.I found this movie to be tedious pretentious and really quite tiresome. It had a rather claustrophobic feel to it most likely on purpose and the characters didn't seem to be well developed.  Tape tried to have its share of twists but they seemed scattered illconceived and not particularly compelling.The bouncy backandforth camerawork in one scene felt akin to having gone on a TiltaWhirl and personally left me with a splitting headache.  Good concept poor execution.In conclusion there are a lot better ways to spend 86 minutes.  My advice is to find one of them instead of watching this movie.";

His girlfriend Amy cheating on him. 2. The person that she cheating with was Vince's best friend Jon ten years ago. Vince a petty drug pusher and user who has a job as a volunteer firefighter using the job as cover for his drug dealing in the firehouse. Jon a struggling filmmaker who has a movie that's going to be displayed at the local Lancing Film Festival. Amy is an Assistant DA in the Lansing Justice department. Long winded movie that tries to make a point but the point seems to be that when you get three different people who are eye witnesses to an accident you get three different versions of what the accident was. Vince is so annoying and obnoxious with his jealous obsession about his former girlfriend having an affair with his best friend that his nagging and prodding both of them makes them see just want Vince wants them to see or at least in Amy's case she makes it seem that way that it wasn't love but rape on the part of Jon in his relations with Amy back then. Vince's constant nagging even got Jon to believe his viewpoint and after Jon admitted it Vince to Jon surprise produced a audio tape of his confession. Amy at first reacted to her affair with Jon in a sweet and loving way by saying that she loved Jon at that time and her affair with him was totally free and consensual on her part. But with Jon's neurotic actions about what happened due to Vince's manipulation of him Amy's opinion completely changed. She suddenly and inexpediently started to act like Vince wanted her to toward Jon's actions that he raped her.In the end of the movie it was Vince who got shafted big time by Amy who seemed to have caught on to what his plan was with her and Jon. Vince in a panic ended up holding or better yet flushing down the drain his bag of tricks. Good acting with great dialog made the film holds your attention from start to finish.".

	schema:headline " a Linklater travelogue where it's about alienation and meandering around better on a second viewing";
	schema:reviewBody "There were moments watching this narrative experiment the first of many for Richard Linklater where it comes about as close to being totally mundane as can be possible with the camera. It probably wasn't a problem for him to get his shots as it looked as if he was making his own personal 'home movie' with him either on the train or in stations or just bumming around Austin Texas. In that sense it's almost close to being a documentary even though according to Linklater it's not really quite himself on screen even as it is himself. In real life he isn't this mundane and sort of driftless however does admit that the feelings are in him and were in him then and it's on a second viewing that a sort of pattern emerges from what looks like barebones storytelling. Unlike Jarmusch's Permanent Vacation it doesn't necessarily try to relate some sort of 'character' in the sense that it's something created by the actor and then surrounded in the typical indiemovie easygoing scenes. Here Linklater is showing how such everyday things like traveling on a train walking through a town getting stopped by someone to see your tshirt watching TV watching movies reading doing laundry doing dishes reading a Kafka quote driving listening to music so on and so forth can have some kind of interest in the initial disinterest in seeing this.On the one hand the narrative is lax and unlike Slacker there isn't even the framework of a bunch of characters in a small town. But on the other hand out of all of these seemingly random shots of a guy going through the motions in life dealing without a job the 'whatever' attitude of hanging out with friends or a girl taking care of a car becomes a narrative itself. It's experimental and as Linklater also has said certainly not for a large audience to see and many haven't until the DVD of Slacker was released with this film included but the visual language is rich in its detachment and at the least is a curious effort that doesn't just keep the audience on a sort of line away from typical emotional involvement but is about the same thing. Far from being any great success but for a real student effort selftaught student you could get much worse. Watch for a Sterling Hayden tribute in one scene and a sense of dissatisfaction with 80s TV.".

Unlike Jarmusch's Permanent Vacation it doesn't necessarily try to relate some sort of 'character' in the sense that it's something created by the actor and then surrounded in the typical indiemovie easygoing scenes. Here Linklater is showing how such everyday things like traveling on a train walking through a town getting stopped by someone to see your tshirt watching TV watching movies reading doing laundry doing dishes reading a Kafka quote driving listening to music so on and so forth can have some kind of interest in the initial disinterest in seeing this.On the one hand the narrative is lax and unlike Slacker there isn't even the framework of a bunch of characters in a small town. But on the other hand out of all of these seemingly random shots of a guy going through the motions in life dealing without a job the 'whatever' attitude of hanging out with friends or a girl taking care of a car becomes a narrative itself. It's experimental and as Linklater also has said certainly not for a large audience to see and many haven't until the DVD of Slacker was released with this film included but the visual language is rich in its detachment and at the least is a curious effort that doesn't just keep the audience on a sort of line away from typical emotional involvement but is about the same thing. Far from being any great success but for a real student effort selftaught student you could get much worse. Watch for a Sterling Hayden tribute in one scene and a sense of dissatisfaction with 80s TV.";

He provides us with not much backstory as to why the events are occurring but dives into topics such as why he made this film in the first place and how he sympathizes with the youth of today who are trying to break free of typical life conventions.I mentioned in my review of his official directorial debut Slacker that by defining the word itself as people who are ultimately being responsible to themselves and not wasting their time in a realm of activity that has nothing to do with who they are or what they might be ultimately striving for he is giving adolescence a tremendous amount of reassurance and confidence in their minds.

It offers no insights no coherency no drama and no real message or purpose. It does however erect a soothing and primitive aspect from its Super 8 home video cinematography and its focus on the smaller aspects of life a wobbly 7up can that makes a cool sound.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie in the mid 70's late one Saturday night on Sinister Cinema in Portland OR and it kind of scared the crap out of me. They replayed it about a year later and same thing It scared the crap out of me. I have now seen it 6 or 7 times over the years including twice in the last few months with the VCI Entertainment version of the dvd.The movie doesn't scare me like it used to but it still amazes me how it transports me into it's own world of the fog shrouded town of Whitewood Massachusetts. The story itself is common enough A woman Patricia Jessel is burned at the stake for witchcraft and she leaves a curse on the people of the town as she is consumed by the flames. Forward 300 years to the present day and we have Nan Barlow Venetia Stevens as a self determined college student who decides to write a paper on witchcraft. Her professor Alan Driscoll Christopher Lee gives her directions to the town of Whitewood where 300 years earlier an alleged witch was burned at the stake. She goes to the town and after a few days disappears. Her brother then goes to the hotel where she was last seen and runs into all kinds obstacles not the least of which is the innkeeper of the Whitewood Inn who just happens to look exactly like the witch burned 300 years earlier and also Christopher Lee who happens to be a long ago resident of WhitewoodThere is an old blind priest who stays in his church despite the fact that he has no congregation. His granddaughter Betta St. John Patricia Russell who seems to not be a witch and has just returned to the town to take care of her grandfather runs the local used book and antique store. She had befriended Nan before she disappeared and is now working with her brother Dennis Lotis Richard Barlow to try and find out what happened to Nan.Of course they run into the witches along they way and there is a showdown of sorts. The strength of this movie is in it's crisp acting and smart script. Especially notable are Patricia Jessel Christopher Lee and Venitia Stevens. Despite it's low budget the director John Llewellyn Moxey has made an altogether unforgettable film. This ranks right up there with other unique horror movies such as Carnival of Souls 1962 The Wicker Man 1973 The Thing From Another World 1951 and Village of the Damned 1960.The VCI Entertainment release is just what this movie has needed for years. An excellent transfer at 1.661 with two extra minutes of footage added from previous video and dvd releases. There is a commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey and another separate commentary by Christopher Lee. There are also three interview segments with Lee Moxey and Venetia Stevenson. Pretty impressive extras for a 40 year old low budget movie.The commentary by Christopher Lee is interesting in that he has not seen this movie since it came out 41 years earlier. He is watching it with an interviewer from VCI who knows more about what is going on in the movie than Lee does. But Lee's ability to recall information about people and give anecdotal information is unsurpassed. He is literally a walking talking encyclopedia of info on people he has worked with over the years.This is one of my prize dvd's and I really cannot recommend it highly enough. The VCI version lists for around 25 but I have seen it cheaper. There are also several basic versions without the extras or extra footage of the movie along with another movie on one dvd. Most notably the Diamond Entertainment version where it is packaged along with Carnival of Souls for under 10.".

Forward 300 years to the present day and we have Nan Barlow Venetia Stevens as a self determined college student who decides to write a paper on witchcraft. Her professor Alan Driscoll Christopher Lee gives her directions to the town of Whitewood where 300 years earlier an alleged witch was burned at the stake. She goes to the town and after a few days disappears. Her brother then goes to the hotel where she was last seen and runs into all kinds obstacles not the least of which is the innkeeper of the Whitewood Inn who just happens to look exactly like the witch burned 300 years earlier and also Christopher Lee who happens to be a long ago resident of WhitewoodThere is an old blind priest who stays in his church despite the fact that he has no congregation. His granddaughter Betta St. John Patricia Russell who seems to not be a witch and has just returned to the town to take care of her grandfather runs the local used book and antique store. She had befriended Nan before she disappeared and is now working with her brother Dennis Lotis Richard Barlow to try and find out what happened to Nan.Of course they run into the witches along they way and there is a showdown of sorts. The strength of this movie is in it's crisp acting and smart script. Especially notable are Patricia Jessel Christopher Lee and Venitia Stevens. Despite it's low budget the director John Llewellyn Moxey has made an altogether unforgettable film. This ranks right up there with other unique horror movies such as Carnival of Souls 1962 The Wicker Man 1973 The Thing From Another World 1951 and Village of the Damned 1960.The VCI Entertainment release is just what this movie has needed for years. An excellent transfer at 1.661 with two extra minutes of footage added from previous video and dvd releases. There is a commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey and another separate commentary by Christopher Lee. There are also three interview segments with Lee Moxey and Venetia Stevenson. Pretty impressive extras for a 40 year old low budget movie.The commentary by Christopher Lee is interesting in that he has not seen this movie since it came out 41 years earlier. He is watching it with an interviewer from VCI who knows more about what is going on in the movie than Lee does. But Lee's ability to recall information about people and give anecdotal information is unsurpassed. He is literally a walking talking encyclopedia of info on people he has worked with over the years.This is one of my prize dvd's and I really cannot recommend it highly enough. The VCI version lists for around 25 but I have seen it cheaper. There are also several basic versions without the extras or extra footage of the movie along with another movie on one dvd. Most notably the Diamond Entertainment version where it is packaged along with Carnival of Souls for under 10.";

Horror Hotel aka City Of The Dead is one of my alltime favorite horror classics. Beautiful black and white photography a stock pile of atmosphere a literate script terrific acting and chills galore! I have seen this gem many times first when I was very young and caught it on the Late Show. It has had an effect on me everytime I see it. The plot seems familiar I am sure a witches cult is operating in a small New England town but there is much more then that! From Christopher Lee to the chilling witch hunt and stake burning of the opening to the climatic battle with the coven in the graveyard. Outstanding! Mist and fog drown this small town and what strikes me most is that this entire production was studio bound!!! no location shooting all done in a studio and it comes off without a hitch! I happen to have a copy of this film on video that I cherish. It's not a newly remastered pristine copy. It's a copy that seems to have been copied from a television broadcast and I love it! It looks grainy old had pieces of hair and dirt on it and I wouldn't trade it for the world. It brings back great memories of films shown when I was young in the 60's and 70's and adds an extra dose of charm and atmosphere to the film. A true classic and one I highly recommend!".

The town of Whitewood is both in the dark and fog at all times in the movie with not a single ray of sunlight ever descending on it. This gives the town a really creepy look as well as unnerving everyone in the theater audience watching the film. It makes one feel that the movie was made in Northern Alaska during the time when it has six months of darkness instead of the state of Massachussetts.

Horror Hotel1960 has an Italian flavor with its atmosphere and mystery.  Whitewood like Dunwich is a cursed and unsavory little town. An underrated horror flick of the 1960s.

The scene where the boyfriend of the missing girl crashes into a tree after seeing the image of Selwyn burning and laughing is something out of The Devil Rides Out.  Christopher Lee does a good job in hiding his rich British voice.  May be the influence for Lucio Fulci's Paura Nella Citta Dei Morti ViventiCity of the Living Dead1980 and Dario Argento's Inferno1980.  For example Inferno1980 uses a couple of this film's plot device.  An intriquing line in Horror Hotel comes from Christopher Lee in the early first half when he says The basis of fairy tales is reality basis of reality is fairy tales.

	schema:headline " Great Film...But About The Ending...";
	schema:reviewBody "Horror Hotel aka City Of The Dead has become classic cult horror and was director J.L. Moxey's first feature film. Starring Christopher Lee. It's notable for being the first feature film produced by Amicus in their attempt to rival the Hammer horrors.It tells the story of a young female university student who is passionate about her studies into satanism and the occult. So passionate in fact that she desires to do a little field research. With her professor encouraging the idea...and offering a few suggestions.He tells her she should visit and old off the grid inn in a shutoff old town that is renown for it's historical connection to witchcraft.She agrees this is a good idea and heads off leaving her brother and boyfriend behind.But when she doesn't return and is unable to be reached. The two men start to get worried. So they head off towards the town to figure out what is going on.Turns out that while she was investigating a series of odd rituals undertaken by the local townspeople she happened to be kidnapped by a mysterious satanic cult that seems to be made up of a group of immortals who have sold their souls to the devil for eternal life.However the local priest has been battling these dark forces that have been plaguing his town. And he helps the young woman's brother figure out what has happened to his sister endowing him with the knowledge concerning how these undead cult members can be defeated.This was a pretty intriguing and engaging film that managed to capture and hold my attention throughout. It's shot in black and white which compliments it's dark and dreary atmosphere. The acting is pretty good across the board and the content of the story is really appealing.Just one thing about the ending....how would that have worked...at night...during a rainstorm...in the fog?! Other than that I really enjoyed this early 1960's witchcraftcult based horror.6 out of 10.".

For it's time it's one of those real standouts for horror suspense and atmosphere. Next to The Crawling Eye and a few others of this genre and period.The story line was pretty tight as well. Actually you could easily put Horror Hotel up against a host of these so called horror movies they have cranked out over the last couple of decades to this day and it would hold it's own. Unlike what appears to be a good number of my fellow IMDb members I have not seen this since I was a kid but it's imagery and story are still with me. I'd love to get a copy on DVD and see what my kids think of it and to refresh my memory as well. Besides what movie has the great Christopher Lee treated us to that was butt crack? My favorite scenes are... 1. Where Nan Barlow's brother is driving to Whitewood to check on her wasn't he warned in someway that she was in danger? and then the image of Elizabeth Selwyn appears in front of him in the middle of the road burning at the stake and laughing her hideous laugh which causes him as planned to crash his car into a ditch on the deserted road leaving him broken and bloody.2. Well the 2nd would be the ultimate spoiler for anyone reading this that hasn't seen it yet. Let's just say it's connected with the above scene and always sent a rush of courage fused adrenalin through my heart to counter act the icy grip of fear it was in for the last hour or so.No you have to use the shadow of the cross! THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS!!! We all have seen a lot of remakes some good most bad. I wonder if Horror Hotel would benefit from a proper redo.".

	schema:headline " Very VERY creepy!";
	schema:reviewBody "This modest lowbudget chiller unexpectedly became one of the best horror films I ever saw and therefore I can't praise and recommend it enough. You won't believe how genuinely scary this film is! Straight from the golden years of horror early 60's the period that also pleased us with milestones like Black Sunday Carnival of Souls and Psycho comes this extremely atmospheric terrortale that pretty much covers all the elements horror fans so desperately look for. The moody opening sequences take us back to 17th century New England where a woman accused of witchery is burned at the stake. Nearly 300 years later an obsessive university professor advises his female student to travel to the town of Whitewood in order to learn more about background of demonism and witchcraft. Against the will of both her brother and boyfriend Nan rents a room in the Raven Inn in Whitewood. The town looks unworldly and it soon becomes clear that the villagers don't like strangers. Horror Hotel is the perfect example of how to build up an almostunbearable tension and atmosphere! This ghostly little town in the most ominous setting ever! The streets are enshrouded with fog and the image of the ancient cemetery and nightmarish inhabitants gives you shivers. Add to this a creepy musical score decent makeup effects and an ultraeerie black and white cinematography and you somewhat get the idea of how wonderfully sinister Horror Hotel actually is. Christopher Lee is naturally credited as the star of this film even though his role is only a supporting one. But even then this legendary horror veteran still impresses you big time as the witcheryexpert who obviously knows more than he lets on. Equally brilliant is the rather unknown Patricia Jessel in her double role as the wicked witch Elizabeth Selwyn and Mrs. Newless. I can't stress enough how amazing this film is! I like to think I've seen my share of horror shlock and exploitation cinema by now and yet this Horror Hotel scared the bejezus out of me! John Moxey's debut is one that counts and I can't wait to get my dirty little hands on some of his later work. Watch this movie under the right conditions late at night alone or with people who respect the genre.... and I guarantee you'll be sleeping with the lights on.".

I got a rare chance to see a 35MM print at the American Cinemateque this week with Producer Max Rosenberg in attendance along with a showing of THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD. An experience to remember!  Had a hell of a time. But the night also brings to mind a couple of curious critical conundrums  First is it wise to go back and see a film that you cherished when you were 20 or more years younger? Second do some films actually work better on TV than on the Big Screen? On the first point Going Back. It was interesting. A few hours before departing for the theater I debated even going! You see I so vividly remember watching HORROR HOTEL on a 19 inch BW TV in my college dorm and feeling that it was a buried treasure. And creepy to boot! You almost don't want to spoil such a memory. Luckily though the film has its glaring weaknesses and has a patchy first act or so it DOES still work! And there are some scary bits that hold up fine. Whew! On the second point TV vs 35MM. I'm the LAST person who would seem to advocate TV over a theatrical experience. I always wince when I hear a friend say that they'll wait 'til it's on HBO rather than go to the multiplex. It pains me DEEPLY that in a town like L.A. where you can STILL see classic cinema on the silver screen you can't drag people to actually do it  Hey it's on videoDVD they'll say. And yet  Some films do work on the small screen. It's more intimate your expectations aren't as high  and low budget production flaws aren't magnified as they are on a 50 foot screen versus 19 INCHES!. Revisiting HORROR HOTEL made me wince a little at the faux New England setting I am a native the fog which lays on the ground like a deviant shag carpet the  at times  trite musical score not so annoying on those tiny tinny Zenith speakers! the hasty staging in a some scenes the variable acting though mostly fine a few risible bits of dialogue and some other annoyances.  Yet I am happy to report  it still works! Just not quite as well. So buy the DVD. DON'T use the Home Theater Sound System. Turn off the lights. Get close to the TV and enjoy.SPOILERS! BELOW! P.S.  On the point others have made about the similarities with Hitchcock's PSCYHO i.e. A pretty blonde woman checking into a creepy hotel. Stripping down to lingerie. Not living for the 2nd Half of the picture etc. One MORE little point that crossed my mind that night The Author of the book PSYCHO was based on was Robert Bloch. The same Robert Bloch that was involved in so many of Producer Max Rosenberg's Amicus Films I.E. ASYLUM HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD etc. Interesting....".

	schema:reviewBody "Psycho Black Sunday House Of Usher Peeping Tom... 1960 truly was one of the greatest years ever for Horror cinema. In the same year in which Mario Bava brought us THE single greatest witchcraft film of alltime and in my personal opinion one of the greatest films ever with his masterpiece La Maschera Del Demonio aka. Black Sunday John Llewelin Moxey came along with this awesome and immensely creepy little Horror gem named The City Of The Dead aka. Horror Hotel. While Horror Hotel may not quite be a milestone en par with Black Sunday this doubtlessly is a masterwork of creepy atmosphere. None other than the great Christopher Lee stars in this surprisingly obscure Gothic tale which is stunning from the first minute. This truly is a genuinely scary and terrifying cinematic experience that no Horror lover could possibly afford to miss.The City Of The Dead ingeniously begins in 1692 when the accused Witch Elisabeth Sewlyn is dragged to the stake and burned by the people of Whitewood Massachusets. Almost three centuries later Professor Alan Driscoll Christopher Lee is teaching history classes on the phenomenon of Witchcraft. He sends his best student a girl named Nan Barlow Venetia Stevenson to the village of Whitewood where she is to do research on the Sewlyn case... The first few minutes alone are actually creepier than the majority of films get at their climax and a scary beginning certainly isn't the only thing this film has to offer. The village of Whitewood is the creepiest place imaginable an obscure cemetery and a gathering of eerie old houses surrounded by dark menacing forest. The ingenious black and white photography intensifies the film's atmosphere this could not have possibly been as intensely creepy if it had been shot in color. Equally great is the score the main theme is easily one of the creepiest pieces of Horror soundtrack I ever heard. It do not suppose it is necessary to mention that Christopher Lee is one of the greatest Horror icons ever and he is once again brilliant in his role. So is Patricia Jessel who is ingenious in her doublerole and who sadly did not appear in many other films after this one. Great supporting performances include Valentine Dyall and Norman Macowan in the role of a blind old priest. In short Horror Hotel is a film that is still terrifying after almost half a century and a mustsee for every Horror fan!".

But is there another reason why she's sent to the tiny town of Whitewood Massachussetts?To begin this is the first film from the director responsible for the original The Night Stalker so the wellwritten script is in good hands. This is one of the most entertaining and frightening movies about witchcraft I've seen and I've seen quite a few. While it does have its campy side to it City of the Dead stays on the road  the wrong one as you'll find  and the tension builds to a memorable conclusion.While many will find it predictable as most horror films go it takes the same surprising left turn as does Psycho released around the same time. It's also a Black and White goody long known for its rounds on the Saturday night TV horror fests in The '60s and '70s hence my handle  screen name  here on The IMDb. Personal Viewing Experience If you're from the greater NYC area you'll remember Creature Features on WNEW Channel 5. This is how we got to see this film as Horror Hotel. First Glenn Strange's posteurized face melting back and forth from positive to negative  then the feature film! Good grief the nightmares! Better the first time we saw this the babysitter decided not to show up so we were home alone watching it! D'oh!  That was then this is now. I recently got ahold of a new DVD edition of City of the Dead aka Horror Hotel and it looks fabulous! For a film that's been dogged by fifthgeneration dupes for years when it can be found at all this is a great restoration plus it features interviews with the director and surviving stars! What great fun.Horror Hotel has GREAT atmosphere. I don't think there's one scene where the sun is shining. Whitewood is the epitome of creepy with its old dilapidated buildings choking fog a handful of very suspicious townspeople with drawn faces and a graveyard of condemned witches on the town green! The Raven's Inn is what you may find today as a bed and breakfast in Old Salem complete with period fireplaces and shadows!Cheers Wonderful atmosphere. Great lighting. Proves that for some films Black and White is best. Interesting jazzy soundtrack. Instances of silence that allow for room noises such as clocks footsteps and crackling fires. The Salem you always thought of dark distant isolated paranoid foggy and foreboding. Performances drip with evil. Great cast. Not the usual drivein cheapie ... it's worth it.Caveats Predictable. Dated. Black and White.  Look color has its place. Not here.  Gore fest freaks will be sadly disappointed. May move too slow for some.In short the next time you drive up to Massachusetts watch for a sign that reads Whitewood. Don't stop keep driving. Don't watch this movie alone.".

I enjoyed watching and hearing people I could genuinely relate to discussing problems which if not all directly paralleling my own concerns I could at least understand. The movie deals with the role that money has in personal happiness and how it changes the dynamics of friendships and effectively shows that while money is neither a universal panacea neither is it the root of all evil. One of the interesting questions the movie raises is also what you focus on and contemplate when money isn't an issue for you. I thought the movie accurately portrays many of the misgivings that women in their 40s experience even when they're financially comfortabledealing with Olivia's feelings of invisibility Jane's quiet despair at the loss of the hopeful anticipation with which she used to view her upcoming life Christine's external expression of her mental offbalancedness and gracelessness.

	schema:reviewBody "I would watch it weekly without fail. The characters are 3D their lives interesting the dialog graceful and funny...so why was I so disappointed by and frustrated with this movie? Because there just needed to be more. The short running time compacts all the problems and situations down to bare essentials and there is too much going on for this film to skim across the surface the way it does. I guess the point is to show us a snapshot of these people at a very specific point in their lives and then move on. The morethanable cast certainly helpsparticularly Frances McDormand who can do more with just her eyes and mouth than most actors can with a page of script just watch the way she looks at everything around herespecially other people. And while I am a huge fan of 70sstyle nonendings I admit that this movie's abrupt stop after a very convenient and pat wrapup left me with an Eh kind of feeling. While it is certainly watchable and interesting AS FAR AS IT GOES this movie is no Walking and Talking. Have you seen that movie? W and T is absolutely brilliant another small portrait of longtime female friends but because it narrows its scope to two characters in a particular situation one's wedding it achieves all the depth and poignancy and hilarity that Friends with Money lacks. If F w M were a TV series if it fully explored the characters' lives and situations in some depth and detail I'd be its 1 fan.

	onyx:emotionText "I would watch it weekly without fail. The characters are 3D their lives interesting the dialog graceful and funny...so why was I so disappointed by and frustrated with this movie? Because there just needed to be more. The short running time compacts all the problems and situations down to bare essentials and there is too much going on for this film to skim across the surface the way it does. I guess the point is to show us a snapshot of these people at a very specific point in their lives and then move on. The morethanable cast certainly helpsparticularly Frances McDormand who can do more with just her eyes and mouth than most actors can with a page of script just watch the way she looks at everything around herespecially other people. And while I am a huge fan of 70sstyle nonendings I admit that this movie's abrupt stop after a very convenient and pat wrapup left me with an Eh kind of feeling. While it is certainly watchable and interesting AS FAR AS IT GOES this movie is no Walking and Talking. Have you seen that movie? W and T is absolutely brilliant another small portrait of longtime female friends but because it narrows its scope to two characters in a particular situation one's wedding it achieves all the depth and poignancy and hilarity that Friends with Money lacks. If F w M were a TV series if it fully explored the characters' lives and situations in some depth and detail I'd be its 1 fan. Maybe the DVD will include deleted scenes say about 40 or 50 and the movie will finally feel complete.";

Her Olivia is a believable person who just has incredibly lousy taste in men  thus far. Watching the hurt and disappointment on Aniston's face when Mike's Scott Caan true character comes out shows this woman's got talent.Mike actually might be this film's most intriguing and interesting character. Caan's very good in the role and just when you think you like him he does something despicable.Holofcener's film centers around a group of friends most of whom are affluent if not stinking rich.

Here's an actress who can take small moments in a film and turn them into unforgettable ones. Keener's so completely compelling and honest in her performance. Christine's discussions with her husband David Jason Isaacs never ring false thanks to two strong performances.The weak link in the film really is Frances McDormand's Jane. This isn't the wonderful McDormand's fault. Trouble is Holofcener paints McDormand's Jane as such a onedimensional person  a woman who turns her suppressed rage into a rather annoying persona. Holofcener never bothers to penetrate the surface of Jane's problems. We just know she's angry and that's all we see of her. It's a shame because a woman of McDormand's infinite acting talents deserved a much richer character.Friends With Money seems rather superficial at times because unlike Holofcener's previous two films this one simply skirts the surface of the characters.

In fact I had some doubts because it had Jennifer Aniston in it whom I had never been impressed with not a fan of Friends at all. But this movie changed my mind about her and I really enjoyed it.I do tend to like this kind of film which some people would probably term a chick movie. I don't think it is though. I think it's a people movie. But even that's too much for some people probably the kind of guy who wouldn't sit right next to another guy in a theater because people might think they're gay. And no I'm not gay just emotional and sensitive.Still I liked it more than I expected. Sometimes movies can be a little too girly for me but this one was really about ALL the people involved although the main connections were between the four women who are the leads. All friends one of them has not done as well financially as the rest but it's not only on her story that the plot of the movie turns. All four are going through some sort of issue in their lives and there is some resolution with all of them not all of equal import. And none of it is complete there is no easy wrapping up here of any one story line. You do leave wondering what will happen with each of the characters with the sense that life is going on beyond the final fadeout. I really liked that about the film.As a nottoowelloff person living nottoofaraway from the affluent area of Los Angeles this is set in I usually don't feel comfortable watching movies about people who have a lot of money and don't seem aware of the rest of us. These people share the view that they coexist in the world with a lot of other people who are not as well off they're sensitive to the dilemmas of others and are grateful that they so far are leading privileged lives. Even the most wealthy of them is a real human being has issues is far from perfect. This is a reallife view of Los Angeles people who are living real lives. I highly recommend it to anyone who themselves has a real life.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie that has contradictions all over the place. Are they happy or not? Is he gay or not? Am I to feel any sympathies for these people or not? Determined or annoying? There is really much to admire about this study of the welltodo citizens of the Westside of Los Angeles. Unlike Crash this one gives us the positive and negative sides of what these people can be. Those of us who are familiar with the area can recognize how important image is to those with money and how their perceptions are so different from the rest of the world. We try to emulate them but if we don't have the resources it isn't possible. For instance this is a point that is repeatedly made by the main characters in the film. We can afford it and you most of the audience can't. It's hard to relate to that type of character.What we can appreciate is some very fine performances from Cusack's very restrained socialite a woman who seems to be unable to cope with the wealth she owns. She appears to be normal but she's pretty much limited by her standing. Her husband a lesser character appears to be more true to his social class and he makes no apologies for his social position. Then we have McDormand's neurotic designer who is now losing control and is sinking into some very strange psychological episodes. There is not much of an explanation and it's very frustrating to be amused or concerned by her problems. Still McDormand does a very capable and entertaining job with her character. The standout is Anniston who normally doesn't register much in her star turns but here as she did in The Good Girl she shines because she manages to keep her character real and believable. Her dissatisfaction with her actual situation is a cross to bear and her bad luck in her relationships is something we can find at least believable. She knows these characters and has learned to survive in their immediacy but she truly understands she will always be an outsider.One of the most frustrating aspects in this film is how short and underdeveloped it seems by the time it is over. Maybe as I mentioned before it remains true to its ambivalent nature. Here is what might have started as an indepth analysis of what it is to be rich but in the end feels like a sloppy job. It moved well shined at moments and suddenly it stalled. Is there a sequel in the works? I would certainly like to know where this is all going to end.".

There is not much of an explanation and it's very frustrating to be amused or concerned by her problems. Still McDormand does a very capable and entertaining job with her character. The standout is Anniston who normally doesn't register much in her star turns but here as she did in The Good Girl she shines because she manages to keep her character real and believable. Her dissatisfaction with her actual situation is a cross to bear and her bad luck in her relationships is something we can find at least believable. She knows these characters and has learned to survive in their immediacy but she truly understands she will always be an outsider.One of the most frustrating aspects in this film is how short and underdeveloped it seems by the time it is over. Maybe as I mentioned before it remains true to its ambivalent nature. Here is what might have started as an indepth analysis of what it is to be rich but in the end feels like a sloppy job. It moved well shined at moments and suddenly it stalled. Is there a sequel in the works? I would certainly like to know where this is all going to end.";

Although at times it seems to skim over certain issues that are produced the overall movie left me with a confused contentment. It didn't answer all the questions and left it decidedly up to the audience to figure out and is possibly a good mirroring of life itself sometimes things aren't just resolved and we are left to our imaginations to decide how we want it to end. Although many people did not recommend the movie I found it was a beautiful epitome of a more modern indie film that the main actors rise spectacularly to. Jennifer Aniston whom I must admit is not one of my most favorite actresses at the moment following her boxoffice bombs plays a smaller role but does so in an unimposing way and allows the other great cast to have their fair share of the movie as well. Altogether I found it confusing at times and yet agreeable in the end. Not for the pickiest of film critics this movie is to be enjoyed whilst in a more airy state of mind. Enjoy and try to look at the movie as more of an art not just any old movie.".

She smokes some pot pines for a married man she had a fling with dates a personal trainer who's a dick in the end she winds up with a customer who's a slob but turns out to be nice and quite rich. Olivia's three friends are Jane Christine and Franny. Jane Frances McDormand is a successful but very feisty and angry clothing designer with a gayseeming husband named Aaron Simon McBurney who attracts gay and gayseeming men. Jane's Aaron finds another Aaron Ty Burrell equally gayseeming and they have a sort of date but this is to tease us or educate us about men both Aarons are happily married and their friendship leads to dinners for four and that's that. Christine Caroline Keener writes scripts and has nasty verbal fights with her husband David Jason Isaacs her marriage is crumbling while the couple build a second floor on their house that will ruin the view for their neighbors. When Christine realizes this and that her husband knew it she dumps him. Franny Joan Cusack is very rich just raises her kids with full time help and is perfectly happy with her husband Matt Greg Germann her two children and the world.There are several themes here fortysomething women's crises Jane Christine a single woman's aimlessness and passivity Olivia men who either seem gay or are creeps like Franny's personal trainer Mike Scott Caan whom she sets up with Olivia and who is rude and exploitive toward Olivia Christine's husband who can't be nice to Christine  though she can't be nice to him either. And money. It's always there as an issue.A pivot point is the pet fiction in American social comedy that friends stay together even when their fortunes come to vary widely. To distinguish her people from each other Holofcener resorts to something like the eighteenthcentury comedy of humors where a character is dominated by a single trait or quirk Olivia is obsessed with skin lotions and will even steal to get them Jane picks fights with strangers and won't wash her hair Christine is always hurting herself by accident. Franny's rich husband is almost invisible except to insist on spending money and he is the best man. He isn't possibly gay either.Besides the marriedmenwhoseemgay theme there's a sequence when Olivia allows the boorish personal trainer to accompany her on her housecleaning jobs where he lounges around and then demands from her and gets a cut of her pay. Finally he gives her a kinky maid's uniform and orders her around in it on a job a prelude to sex. Only at the end of this episode when she follows him and sees he's dating somebody else in the evenings does Olivia decide to stop seeing this creep.What is one to make of such a movie? It's an opportunity for some amusing character acting and McDormand and Cusack and McBurney stand out. Anniston is well cast as the slightly depressed rudderless but still independent female who somehow carries herself well enough to be accepted by her welloff comrades  though Franny and her husband agree that if she met Olivia now she might not make the grade.The rambling incidents and scattered emotions are united at the end by a conventional comedy device a final public event that brings the main characters together in this case a charity dinner for people with Lou Gehrig's disease. Franny and her husband have bought a table and Jane provides the women with dresses from her collection. Jane washes her hair for the occasion. Christine comes without her husband because they're breaking up. Having gotten rid of the unpleasant personal trainer Olivia comes with the slob customer and his revelation afterward in the car and in bed that sloppy personal habits and problems aside he is so rich he need not work promises a solution to her problem she like her friends will have money. But this is decentralized  really centerless  and clearly TVinfluenced plotting. In traditional drama the characters' lives would dovetail neatly in the end in farce the couples would recombine in amusing ways. Instead here the characters have just been moved around a little like checkers on a board in a game that ends in a draw. The episodes have the staccato separations that remain in cable television dramas even when there are no advertisements to interrupt them.There are some interesting  and repellent  examples of bad behavior the selfcentered personal trainer Jane's rude aggressions in public Christine's and her husband's mean slurs during their fights. But unlike Neil LaBute Holofcener doesn't show how moral failures or failures of will ruin relations between the sexes. She likes to play with our expectations. The slob customer is jobless and he bargains Olivia down for the cleaning from 100 to 65 and then turns out be rich. The Aarons make us think Jane's husband really will turn out to be gay  he tells her in bed You're my best friend. But in the end both the gay theme and the money theme seem like red herrings. Are the gayseeming men a critique of machismo? Is money a source of happiness when there's enough of it? This movies hasn't got answers. But what I'm wondering is whether it has any questions. TV writing can be very good as Sex and the City and Six Feet Under two Holofcender has written for Oz The Sopranos and various other programs show. But it doesn't always translate well into the single vessel of a movie.".

With each additional interesting project that she accepts Jennifer Aniston edges away from the baggage of that daft and shallow TV show upon which she built her name. Frances McDormand as a wife undergoing an existential crisis is grittily beautiful and 100 believable. I doubt whether most twentysomethings will find much with which to connect in this film in fact the message boards seem to indicate that they're hankering for a 'plot' Wot? No murder?. Having said that younger viewers with decent attention spans whose tastes tend toward more stimulating 'art house' fare might well feel rewarded. The movie's characters are real people with real issues issues which aren't necessarily wrapped up neatly and tied with a bow by the end of the movie as is the case in most sitcoms. Their issues are recognisably human and not the standard manufactured Politically Correct ones such as those didactic gender issues that are so frequently wheeled out in mainstream Hollywood movies. How dull that could've been... Furthermore rather than serve up a neat 'Beginning Middle  End' the film gives us a sense that the characters' lives and issues continue beyond the scope of the film and that we've simply been privy to a slice of their timeline. The dialogue which crackles like a pinecone in a blazing fire is also worthy of being singled out for praise. While the film isn't a comedy it boasts some wicked laughoutloud lines. This is a beautiful sad funny and engaging drama for discerning audiences. Bravo Nicole Holofcener!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie seemingly wants us to care about a group of West Coasters most of whom make a lot of money and one of whom doesn't.Well I tried. But I didn't care about the woman Joan Cusack with apparently inherited wealth who never seems to have worked for a living and is out of touch with reality who plans to give 2 million to her kid's school but can't spare 1800 for her good friend a maid. I didn't care about the belligerent clothing designer Frances McDormand with a feeling of entitlement who's having a midlife crisis and feels no remorse at insulting anybody who crosses her path. I didn't care about the oblivious screenwriter Catherine Keener who's busy alienating her neighbors by building an extravagant house addition but acts like she doesn't know it's an eyesore and who doesn't pay any more attention to her husband than he does to her and then she has the gall to complain about him.So why don't I care? Because I don't live the West L.A. lifestyle for one and find it hard to relate to clothing designers screenwriters and the idle. Yes two of them have problems we COULD relate to midlife crises and sleepwalking through life but the script didn't flesh out these characters well enough for me to understand what was really going on. It was like turning on one episode of a soap opera and trying to figure out weeks of plot development  where are we going and how did we get into this hand basket? If the point of this was to show how money doesn't make you happy then okay already. That could have been illustrated with just one character and done more fully.I thought I'd care about the woman Jennifer Aniston who leaves a supposedly good teaching job to work as a maid and who needs every nickle she earns. Sounds like it could get really interesting. However the character's lack of ambition spinelessness and downright deviousness wears thin.Interestingly enough I cared more about one of the husbands the possibly closeted gay man Simon McBurney. The selfabsorbed screenwriter Jason Isaacs would have been interesting if his character had been more fully developed. The third husband Greg Germann who exists on his wife's wealth is pretty much just wallpaper and a complete waste of breathable air. Of the two men who have relationships with the the maid one is an opportunist Scott Caan who gets way too much screen time doing the same thing over and over and the other is a cardboard character Bob Stephenson who in the end turns out to be another idle rich person who doesn't hesitate to chisel the less fortunate.By the way what was the purpose of the unflattering shots of most of the actors? Frances McDormand is a really wonderful actor but the camera made her look much older than her character's 43 years. Why? What was the point of making Joan Cusack and Catherine Keener look wrinkled and much much older than Jennifer Aniston? Why the bad hair on Simon McBurney? Because in real life we pretend we don't see these things? But this is a movie kids and things usually happen for a reason in order to make a plot point.All the actors were terrific and I do admire their performances. Jason Isaacs was marvelous as always. But the story went nowhere for me. I'm not a fan of slice of life. I want character development motivation reasons. In other words something to think about after I leave the theatre. After leaving this movie all I could think about is what was the point? For the Woody Allen fans out there you'll love it. For the rest of us rent an old copy of 'Our Town' and stay home.".

After seeing it I think my wife and I are going to be looking at our friend in a whole new way. What did she see in this thing? If you have it save it for a rainy day when you have no other DVD's to watch the TV is out and there are no books or board games. Even then....";

	schema:reviewBody "Wrong. Just saw this film hoping for some clever humor original dialogue and an interesting theme. Well some say I expected too much and they were right.Catherine Keener was excellent in Walking and Talking as well as Lovely and Amazing  do not expect this film to equal EITHER of those even by half. While the sliceoflife idea is exploredas it has been since the mid 80's by Woody Allen it is not terrible nor is it terribly creative either.We see McDormand Joan Cusack and Keener in various stages of marriage. Jennifer Aniston portrays the solitary single girlfriend. I gave this movie a chance because I have to admit I have a bias against Aniston. Unfortunately those who say she is only for the small screen are 100 correct. She plays the same mixedup dissatisfied womanchild getting high working as a maid in southern California while her friends are sympathetic yet financially comfortable.Some of the scenes with McDormand are amusing and Keener is always realistic when portraying marital discord her husband intimates she eats too much junk food they begin yet another argument. Actually if Keener's character was more fully developed she and McDormand could have carried the film.The Cusack character seems superfluous she has too much money and doesn't know where to spend it. She attends charity dinners and tells Aniston she will lend her money for therapy but not for personal trainer lessons. Is this an inside joke?. If so the audience of 3 in the theatre I was in was NOT laughing.The male characters are onedimensional and barely examined apparently this is another woman's movie. Instinctively I did not ask my husband to sit through this.I have always loved McDormand even in Laurel Canyon and Keener. Unfortunately it seems this project was designed for a particular audience. Judging from the attendance at an extremely large Muvico in Boca Raton Florida Aniston and her quirks do not a movie make. And McDormand and Keener deserve better. 210".

Often laugh out loud funny whilst simultaneously depicting those dramatic human interactions that bring your own conflicting emotions to the surface. Nicole Holofcener Walking and Talking Lovely and Amazing writes superb dialogue and directs the ensemble cast with accomplished focus. The film steps into the lives of the four women in their everyday situation with no backstory we are voyeurs into this snapshot moment Who has money Who has a good marriage careerlife Where are the characters in their lives? The couple with most money FrannyMatt Joan CusackGreg Germann seem the most happy and fulfilled. Our experience of their life's journey appears practically seamless whereas Christine and David Catherine Keener and Jason Isaacs are financially comfortable but not with each other living in a cold angry place. Trying to work together as a screen writing team but at this point clearly on opposite sides of the playing field and using the extension of their house as an attempt at rescuing a relationship too far gone. Similarly financially comfortable Jane Frances McDormand is going through an emotional depressive sometimes almost psychotic midlife crisis portraying cringingly funny moments that we all recognize. Husband Aaron Simon McBurney is sympathetic to her loss of confidence but needs nurturing of his own. His complex portrayal of questionable sexuality and tentative exploration outside of his marriage is exquisite. All three couples look at their younger friend Olivia Jennifer Aniston and judge themselves further along in their life's journey both in the size of their bank accounts and their relationship status i.e. married. Olivia has given up her teaching job habitually calls her ex and gives him the silent treatment smokes pot at bedtime and haunts the malls for freebie cosmetic samples. To make ends meet she works as a maid cleaning houses while her nonexistent self esteem functions to bring her into humiliating relationships with men. Jen's portrayal is subtle enough to be convincing. She gives in to others even though she recognizes that it is demeaning her and this draws the audience to her character. In one of the funniest moments of the film Olivia smears 75 face cream onto her feet as if saying 'So there!' to the world. Ultimately the feel good ending for Olivia at the end of the film feels right. Nicole Holofcener elicits interest and empathy for her characters with an intellectually stimulating exploration of the topic of money and relationships. The subtle content leaves the audience feeling enriched but wanting more. This is a film you may want to see more than once to truly appreciate the many different levels on which the characters operate. The amount of laughter the first time round often masks the deeper levels in which the scenes and proponents engage  a must see for grown ups.".

You could tell she loved the reaction to the movie and her performance was her most revealing yet. She seemed very very happy and actually smiled at me for a solid 15 seconds after I made a comment about the warmth and kindness in the story.Joan Cusack plays a dramatic role that is very different than anything I have ever seen her play. What an under rated dramatic actress she is.Joan Cusack could catapult herself into a whole new genre of movies with this performance.What a rare bird directorNicole Holofcener is. Wittycharmingbold confident and incisively intelligent in her answers at the Q and A. A wonderful movie. No guns. No overt sex scenes. Just gorgeous and enthralling dialogue. Frances McDormand Catherine Keener and Simon McBurney are exquisite in their attention to every little nuance of their character. They are thespians of the highest degree. Don't miss this hipsmart and oh so real slice of American relationships. I promise you will not be disappointed. I am a writer by trade but not in the movie industry.".

What an under rated dramatic actress she is.Joan Cusack could catapult herself into a whole new genre of movies with this performance.What a rare bird directorNicole Holofcener is. Wittycharmingbold confident and incisively intelligent in her answers at the Q and A. A wonderful movie. No guns. No overt sex scenes. Just gorgeous and enthralling dialogue. Frances McDormand Catherine Keener and Simon McBurney are exquisite in their attention to every little nuance of their character. They are thespians of the highest degree. Don't miss this hipsmart and oh so real slice of American relationships. I promise you will not be disappointed. I am a writer by trade but not in the movie industry.";

The setup is quite good  there's definite intrigue here but it shoots it's load a little too early on although the actual identity of Zelda is kept secret until the end the reasons behind everything is a little predictable.

The film is well made  has a really icy isolated atmosphere I almost felt the Artic chill while watching this at home although the version I saw was horribly pan and scanned  you could hardly tell what was going on in certain zoomed in grainy as hell shots that surely would have looked so much better in it's proper aspect ratio. The action scenes  fights are nice enough  there's a few decent explosions as well.Filmed on location in Alaska Canada  in the studio in London England this looks good with good production values although it apparently bombed big time at the boxoffice which is probably why it's not more well known or more widely released. There's a good solid cast of pros here including Donald Sutherland Vanessa Redgrave Richard Widmark Christopher Lee Lloyd Bridges  Lawrence Dane although some of the accents are a bit poor.Bear Island doesn't have much in common with it's source novel but as an action adventure with a sprinkling of mystery you could do worse  I did like it worth a watch at lest if you can find a copy or catch it on telly.".

The actors and acting are brilliant how did they get so many stars in one film. the production is spot on creating moods of isolation claustrophobia and a great sense of realism just look at the abandoned UBoat pen. The action sequences range from good to spectacular have you ever seen a longer cliff fall than the one in this film. And of course the story is excellent coming as it does from Alistair McLean's novel.The film is not perfect of course but then what is. It did seem a bit long and a bit plodding at times but don't forget I was 12 with the attention span of a goldfish.All in all this is an intelligent action thriller and I wish someone would release it on DVD. Even the VHS versions are rare.".

Now was the first time I caught it on TV scandinavian TCM. I'm surprised to see it's only available as a Spanish DVD and has an such a low score on IMDb 5.410.I must say it's one of the better films I've seen this year although I'm easy to please when it comes to certain types of film and this really is one of them. The locations and set design are amazing. This kind of isolation feel of cold bleak winter snow storms are very rarely portrayed so well it's up there with Carpenter's The Thing. Grab a warm cup of coffee on a rainy day or a whiskey on a darkening evening while watching this.I saw this without subtitling and had a bit of a trouble keeping up with the plot even tho I'm pretty fluent in English. There are characters from USA Germany Denmark Poland etc and a lot of exaggerated accents. It also doesn't make it much easier to follow the plot when the actors have similar clothing and are covered all the way so you can't see their faces when outdoors.I'm not much into action but the scenes here worked. They are quite few but longish and build slowly. There is some noticeable trick cinematography and jump cuts but they're easily forgiven.It's a fun detail that the expedition to Bear Island is initially about investigating the global warming. Judging by the original book synopsis this wasn't the case on Maclean's book but added to the movie. The movie is already over 30 years old so it's a nice eye opener for those who think global warming is something Al Gore invented.It's far from perfect movie from a relatively unknown Hammer horror director! but the arctic scenery some enjoyable performances Sutherland make up for it. Catch it if you can TCM shows the widescreen version. It's a true nostalgia trip to a movie land that doesn't seem to exist anymore.".

Judging by the original book synopsis this wasn't the case on Maclean's book but added to the movie. The movie is already over 30 years old so it's a nice eye opener for those who think global warming is something Al Gore invented.It's far from perfect movie from a relatively unknown Hammer horror director! but the arctic scenery some enjoyable performances Sutherland make up for it. Catch it if you can TCM shows the widescreen version. It's a true nostalgia trip to a movie land that doesn't seem to exist anymore.";

In the background is World War Two in which MacLean's naval service was the making of him. The principals are uneasily allied in search of Nazi gold buried on Bear Island near Spitzbergen. There is much betraying and motiverevelation chases in boats and on skis and snowmobiles closequarters work with fists knives and guns before the treasure hunt is played out.

The pace is crippled by the conditions fights seem slapstick and there is a ludicrous moment when several characters flounderingly break into a run knee deep in snow at a leaden pace. The icy scenery is attractive but to get scale the camera has to stand well back diminishing the figures of the actors and making their manoeuvres seem as trivial as a puppet show.Director Don Sharp as Ken Annakin noted in his memoirs was better at derringdo than humour but nobody goes to MacLean for a laugh here too he is unlike Fleming whose pawky vein of wit was broadened by the Bond scenarists and has preserved the early 007 entries magnificently. The solemnity of Bear Island's furry flailing personnel becomes risible.The picture in short was a weary and chilly haul for the audience.

	schema:reviewBody "German scientist Otto Gerran Richard Widmark leads an expedition to icy Bear Island  which was also a base for Nazi Uboats in WWII  for some kind of environmental research. Included in the group are fellow scientist Frank Lansing Donald Sutherland nurse Heddi Lindquist Vanessa Redgrave Russian Lechinski Christopher Lee and boat captain Smithy Lloyd Bridges among others. When they arrive at the titular location the group discovers one of the three folks stationed there has gone missing. Before you can say TEN LITTLE INDIANS folks start getting offed in an effort to hide the island's secret. This is a pretty enjoyable actionmystery adaptation of Alistair MacLean's snowbound novel. The cast is all game which is good as this must have been a hell of a production to shoot as 70 of it looks shot on location Alaska and Canada. Director Don Sharp keeps things moving fast and while you'll probably solve most of the mystery early on there are still some nice twists. The production is nicely mounted with great sets and some nice Bondesquire snow chases. One great scene has Sutherland discovering a German Uboat and he finds the dead crew aboard it shackled to their posts. One interesting thing my friend who sent this to me pointed out is that this totally has a vibe of John Carpenter's THE THING. Now of course THE THING is a remake but I'd wager that film's screenwriter Bill Lancaster or John Carpenter saw this before setting about their version. The opening  where a lone guy runs across a snowcovered plain while being chased by a snowboat  sounds exactly like the opening of Carpenter's film. Look for Bruce Greenwood in his first big screen roll as Tommy the Technician sporting an epic beard.".

	schema:reviewBody "I held off on watching this one and I can't remember why. As soon as I finished this film I knew why. My instinct told me this was a flop. I should listen to myself more often.I think it was some time last year I watched a film called Rituals. It had Lawrence Dane in it just like in this one and I decided to watch the special features within that disc. He mentions in an interview very briefly that Richard Widmark complained constantly throughout this entire film. I assumed that was just Widmark being a fairly big star of his day being just that....a star. After I watched I knew why he was complaining. Bad Script Super Cold temperatures and probably knowing he was involved in a turkey...he wasn't too pleased.I've never read the novel this was based on but the idea in itself isn't a bad one. The problem is the plausibility of this happening is pretty far fetched. The acting in this isn't that bad really it's just the lack of any believable dialogue or just too many quiet moments it got to be a pretty tedious watch.There are a few funny moments that come to mind. Right at the end when the entire group at the station sets out to see whats happened to head of the group they look and see the boat leaving and 1 guy screams...Smitty. If you've seen this then you'll know that Smitty was played by the Lloyd Bridges character and he was killed off about 34 of the way through. Problem is Smitty is in the harbor on a boat at least 400 or 500 yards away. How can that guy see that far to see who it was lol. It's ridiculous. There are quite a few scenes where these characters walk around inside and out inappropriately addressed for a place at the top of the world. I mean we're talking about sub zero temps and they walk around with some basic jeans and sweaters and maybe some long johns. I don't have to live very far up north of anywhere to know you'd freeze your tail off with what they were wearing.There were many other yeah right scenes but they aren't worth mentioning because they sum up what this film is worth...not a heckuva lot. Save your hours of the day for doing laundry and not thinking you missed out on anything if you missed this one....Trust me...you haven't.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has an interesting cast but that does not unfortunately make it a good film. 'Bear Island' is based on a novel by Alistair Maclean a popular writer from the sixties whose novels were consistently on the bestseller lists. The story is set on a boat cruising around the Arctic Circle and is a strange amalgam of stilted action juxtaposed with a lot of endless talk about whose side everybody is supposed to be on. The ships passengers include Russians Germans and Norwegians. They're all talking as if World War II is still going on when the film appears to be set in the present day. The purpose of all this talk is to find a secret stash on the North Pole previously hidden by some very nasty people so it becomes a chase between the good guys and bad guys to get the loot and there is a lot of talky moralising on the part of the good guys about the virtues of looking for it at all.The luminaries in the cast include Donald Sutherland looking vague and bored Vanessa Redgrave talking very softly the good guys and Richard Widmark and Lloyd Bridges the bad guys. The only other notable thing about this film is that it includes a very bruising bareknuckle fistfight between Sutherland and how shall we say it  an Aryan which has something to do with  well I just don't remember but I think that Donald wins the fight and the good guys have at last something to cheer about.There are a number of meaningless chases across the snow and ice and a couple of explosions where a few minor characters get killed off but it all turns out right in the end. Vanessa Redgrave looks attractive in her fur lined anorak but doesn't have much to do. The scenic background of icebergs and endless floes of ice is effective and the only remotely fun thing about watching this film. Unfortunately none of it amounts to anything much and the story is too dreary oldhat and repetitive to be of any interest whatsoever.".

The story is set on a boat cruising around the Arctic Circle and is a strange amalgam of stilted action juxtaposed with a lot of endless talk about whose side everybody is supposed to be on. The ships passengers include Russians Germans and Norwegians. They're all talking as if World War II is still going on when the film appears to be set in the present day. The purpose of all this talk is to find a secret stash on the North Pole previously hidden by some very nasty people so it becomes a chase between the good guys and bad guys to get the loot and there is a lot of talky moralising on the part of the good guys about the virtues of looking for it at all.The luminaries in the cast include Donald Sutherland looking vague and bored Vanessa Redgrave talking very softly the good guys and Richard Widmark and Lloyd Bridges the bad guys. The only other notable thing about this film is that it includes a very bruising bareknuckle fistfight between Sutherland and how shall we say it  an Aryan which has something to do with  well I just don't remember but I think that Donald wins the fight and the good guys have at last something to cheer about.There are a number of meaningless chases across the snow and ice and a couple of explosions where a few minor characters get killed off but it all turns out right in the end. Vanessa Redgrave looks attractive in her fur lined anorak but doesn't have much to do. The scenic background of icebergs and endless floes of ice is effective and the only remotely fun thing about watching this film. Unfortunately none of it amounts to anything much and the story is too dreary oldhat and repetitive to be of any interest whatsoever.";

We both love Alfred Molina's acting and character that he portrayed however Walken steals the show with truly insane comedic genius.

The locations are refreshing and breathtaking. The cast is exceptional. Robert Pugh Alfred Molina Brenda Blethyn Naomi Watts and Christopher Walken are like never seen before. Pugh is superb as the jerk of a cheating husband. Alfred Molina is the perfect gentlemanmortician. Blethyn beautifully downplays the part of the simple slightly naive and lovable Betty. Naomi Watts plays the sluttish bimbette secretary and is overdone with makeup and props which makes her stupendously suitable for the part. Both she and Walkens prove their flair for comedy. Walken well I do not want to give away much. One just has to watch and see. 'Plots With A View' while being an immensely amusing comedy pays tribute to ballroom dancing. The dance numbers are well executed. There's one with Walken and Evans and two or three with Molina and Blethyn. All of them performed fantastically.

Walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of Molina in the undertaking business trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. We see a couple of very funny examples of the new style. The plot thickens with Pugh having an affair with Watts and her suggesting that they do Blethyn in. Meanwhile Molina has rekindled his long suffering romantic feeling for Blethyn and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the South Seas and dance away their days together. During the fake funeral Blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge. Watch it for a view of what funerals probably should bea celebration of life!".

She's married to a powerful local councilman who unbeknownst to her cheats on her with his vivacious secretary. Molina's role however provides the backbone of the storyline and he does a superb job carrying it through. Ultimately it's writer Ponzlov's deft intertwining of love and death that bring this comedy to life. Overall casting is firstrate the writing wonderful and the cinematography beautiful.

The reason? This movie totally dashes the names of those characters.The most unsettling part for me was the fact that the Three Musketeers are nothing like themselves. Porthos is not the least bit arrogant or overthetop. Aramis isn't religious at all. And Athos does not even remotely resemble the character in the book. Sadly Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell but only because he doesn't do any acting at all which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said if you just view it as a movie and try to block the actual story out of your mind it can be entertaining. The fight scenes are very well done and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. Perhaps this movie could have been really good if it was about the story of a musketeer NOT named d'Artagnan and his unique adventure. But since it tries to be an interpretation of Dumas it falls miserably short. As a movie it is soso but as far as an interpretation of the famous story it is absolutely terrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just really really really bad!First off this film is too much action not enough story.  The first time we see D'Artagnan fight there doesn't seem to be any point to it other than the fact to let us know that he's this amazingly and somewhat unbelievably skilled swordsman and fighter.  He also escapes the situation way too easily thanks to pathetic bluff and a cut away.The only saving grace in this film in my opinion is Tim Roth who had to make due as best he could with a very bad script.  But he looked cool the only person in this film with any fashion sense whatsoever.  Although later in the film he appears to have borrowed his Aunt Ida's  Sunday church revival meeting hat.Stephen Rea who I usually find extremely enjoyable to watch  came across as very ineffectual as the Cardinal Richelieu.  Instead of being the great evil and manipulating mastermind he almost seemed the puppet of Tim Roth's Febre...a character I've never heard of before who seemed to fill the role previously occupied by Rochefort as the one eyed man who killed D'Artagnan's father.oh for Tim Curry's RichelieuJustin Chamberlain is incredibly dull in this movie and never seemed to show any emotion.  It almost seemed like he sucked the life out of the actors around him.  His character comes across as a thinly veiled Bruce Wayne.  A young boy who watched his parents get murdered in front of him but could do nothing.  He's taken in by the kindly older friend of his father's.  He then grows up and trains himself to be the best fighter to become a hero and stop what happened to his parents from happening again.Athos Porthos and Aramis might as well not even have been in the film. All of the Musketeers were portrayed as drunken miserable arrogant lazy jerks.  Apparently D'Artagnan is the only one who still holds the ideals of the Musketeers.  It seemed like Athos was only there to avoid the question  Shouldn't there be 3 of them?  He didn't do a damn thing.  They gave all of his character traits to Aramis and Aramis the wouldbe priest was nowhere to be found.King Louis XIII and Queen Anne were in their late 50's huh? and were childless.  Okay where do Louis XIV and Phillipe come from then?  I somehow doubt that a woman in her late 50's in 17th century France would be up to having twins.  As far as I know they should have been young and not even married yet.The Musketeers all seemed closer in age to their Man in the Iron Mask selves than their Three Musketeers selves.  Athos even had grey in his beard.You would think that the King's Musketeers could have afforded to dress better.  Everyone looked like a bum...and there were a LOT of bad hats in this movie.  D'Artagnan looked like he should have been riding the range in 1880's Oklahoma.  And don't even get me started on the mullets.  Did everyone in 17th century France grow up in the 1980's?  The hair extensions on Justin Chamberlain were pretty bad too.The romance between his character and Mena Suvari didn't make much sense and seemed very forced.  Although it gave D'Artagnan an excuse to go skinny dipping so the bad guys could kidnap his girlfriend.Bad bad bad dialogue.  When Mena Suvari threatened to cut off someone's balls...I pretty much gave up all hope.The action and fight sequences were way over the top.  Apparently the Cardinal makes sure his men are well versed in the fine art of  How to engage in a swordfight while hanging 100 feet in the air one handed from a rope in the rain and not fall to your death.  The final fight between D'Artagnan and Febre in what we dubbed The Ladder Room was too much. It seems the ladders are strong enough to support two grown men who are jumping and balancing on them but are powerless when it comes to the mighty rapier blade.  It got to the point where I was thinking  for crying out loud would you just stand still and fight already!D'Artagnan also has this amazing horse that appears out of nowhere when he whistles despite having run off in a different direction earlier or having been left lying in the road practically dead that morning.What I found interesting is it seems that the Musketeers all bought their cassaque cloaks at Disney's The Three Musketeers wardrobe sale.  They looked EXACTLY like the ones worn by Kiefer Charlie and Oliver...right down the length colours and embroidery.One of the most confusing moments came when it looked as though a character had been fatally shot only to remark  I'm not dead.  But there is no clear explanation as to why they aren't dead and show up later no worse for wear.I guess the palace kitchen staff are very stupid as none of them realize that some of them have been replaced by imposters nor does anyone notice that one of the waiters is wearing a sword...well okay one person notices but that scene is silly and kinda creepy.Oh and the swords are all pretty ugly.  I'm also trying to figure out why if they hired a Hong Kong fight director to do all the choreography did they also have a sword master?Well that's my Musketeer rant.  As always that's just my opinion I could be wrong.".

Athos even had grey in his beard.You would think that the King's Musketeers could have afforded to dress better.  Everyone looked like a bum...and there were a LOT of bad hats in this movie.  D'Artagnan looked like he should have been riding the range in 1880's Oklahoma.  And don't even get me started on the mullets.  Did everyone in 17th century France grow up in the 1980's?  The hair extensions on Justin Chamberlain were pretty bad too.The romance between his character and Mena Suvari didn't make much sense and seemed very forced.  Although it gave D'Artagnan an excuse to go skinny dipping so the bad guys could kidnap his girlfriend.Bad bad bad dialogue.  When Mena Suvari threatened to cut off someone's balls...I pretty much gave up all hope.The action and fight sequences were way over the top.  Apparently the Cardinal makes sure his men are well versed in the fine art of  How to engage in a swordfight while hanging 100 feet in the air one handed from a rope in the rain and not fall to your death.  The final fight between D'Artagnan and Febre in what we dubbed The Ladder Room was too much. It seems the ladders are strong enough to support two grown men who are jumping and balancing on them but are powerless when it comes to the mighty rapier blade.  It got to the point where I was thinking  for crying out loud would you just stand still and fight already!D'Artagnan also has this amazing horse that appears out of nowhere when he whistles despite having run off in a different direction earlier or having been left lying in the road practically dead that morning.What I found interesting is it seems that the Musketeers all bought their cassaque cloaks at Disney's The Three Musketeers wardrobe sale.  They looked EXACTLY like the ones worn by Kiefer Charlie and Oliver...right down the length colours and embroidery.One of the most confusing moments came when it looked as though a character had been fatally shot only to remark  I'm not dead.  But there is no clear explanation as to why they aren't dead and show up later no worse for wear.I guess the palace kitchen staff are very stupid as none of them realize that some of them have been replaced by imposters nor does anyone notice that one of the waiters is wearing a sword...well okay one person notices but that scene is silly and kinda creepy.Oh and the swords are all pretty ugly.  I'm also trying to figure out why if they hired a Hong Kong fight director to do all the choreography did they also have a sword master?Well that's my Musketeer rant.  As always that's just my opinion I could be wrong.";

It's not a great movie by any means but it does have it's moments.The opening swordfight in the resturaunt is the best in the movie. At least it was the most believable with the exception of the barrels. I found the ladders and some of the ropeplay in the Versailles to be much more unrealistic.

He sets out to avenge the murder of his parents and finds his country cleaved by chaos and civil unrest. His heart softens only for Francesca a fiery peasant girl who claims D'Artagnan's heart on sight. D'Artagnan after witnessing his unarmed parents slain by the evil Febre grows up wanting to be a musketeer one of King Louis XIII's loyal protectors. Upon arriving in Paris however he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu who is usurping the king's authority with the help of his lethal henchman Febre.Traveling to Paris D'Artagnan verbally spars with witless quip spouting musketeers Aramis Athos and Porthos. D'Artagnan heads off guarding the queen who is traveling incognito as a commoner on her way to meet Lord Buckingham. The evil Febre his leash held loosely by the evil Cardinal Richilieu wants to kill the Queen in order to sow unrest and war which would create opportunities to profit a war between France and England.The Musketeer is a film that relies mainly of cheesy action scenes mostly on cheesy and unrealistic swordplay.Aside from thatit also has poor story that makes minimized Dumas' classic into a forgettable novel. Acting is decent and the editing presents somewhat a confusing story.OverallThe Musketeer is a MUST MISS film.".

The wire based fight scenes look dated and there are a few scene pacing problems.But overall this was quite fun. There is chemistry between the Queen and D'artagnan thanks to Catherine Deneuve who exudes star quality in every scene she's in. There are some nice performances from most of the character actors the original 3 musketeers are great and the humor if not the plot is very in keeping with the book. I first thought this was a made for TV movie because of the credits at the beginning so I wasn't really expecting much and this definitely beat my expectations. The movie looks good and aside from a few characters most of them seem fairly real the balance between schtick and too serious was handled well.Overall too many faults to be a classic but definitely enough class and fun to be very entertaining.

For unknown reason screenwriters changed simply everything and in the result they got silly and laughable story filled with numerous plot holes and anachronisms. Dialogs look like they were written by a modern teenager and somehow characters development was totally forgotten. No one cares about movie's characters they're uninteresting and pathetic while the whole movie is emotionally flat practically all the time. Poor direction leave room only for pointless action with ridiculously made in Eastern style fight scenes sometimes mixed with silly jokes. Add to all this horrible acting and most likely you'll get a welldeserved position in your alltime worst list. Absolute waste of 40 million dollars as well as your precious time and money.

The action is great but completely out of historical reality then again its a movie not a documentary. Entertaining? Yes I thought so. Not as much as seeing Oliver Reed and Micheal York. As bad as the lead was he was Oscar caliber compared to the absolutely useless Chis O'Donnell in the 1993 version. Given a choice between the 1993 version and this movie I'd take this one.If you want a good swashbuckler stick to Errol Flynn or even Mask of Zorro. If you want Musketeers see the 197374 version.

So many others complain that the movie does not follow the book.  Well I hope those who made those comments actually read the book and actually listened to the movie preview...The Musketeer is supposed to be a reimagined version of the The Three Musketeers not a page by page reenactment of the novel.Ok I'll admit some of the fight scenes were ridiculous but nothing that the filmmaker didn't warn the audience aboutso unless you went into the movie theater blind folded or never saw a martial arts movie you knew what to expect from a martial arts movie director.If you haven't read the novel I recommend you do it is an unforgettable experience.  D'Artagnan was an arrogant young man and he spoke dryly as Justin Chambers portrayed his character in this movie.  Justin still has a lot of maturing to do as an actor but nonetheless he did a good job at capturing D'Artagnan's character as Alexandre Dumas might have invisioned him.It is obvious that the screenplay writers did not write word for word they simply summarized the most important scenes from the novel.  D'Artagnan watching his parents get murdered him seeking revenge wanting to become a musketeer like his father the way he met Athos Porthos and Aramis.  The political atmosphere of the time was the same as it was in the book and our antagonist was of course as evil as a summarized version can get.What about the cinematography?  Yes it was dark it was in a way the director's way of making a movie that was packed with ridiculous action and two well choreographed fight scenes a little more serious.  France was at its worst with Spain and England ready to declare war.  Hunger and poverty plagued the country.  The movie had to be dark characters had to be in the shadows this was not the happiest and brightest period of France's history. In his novel Alexandre Dumas makes it clear that his novel was not just about an awesome adventure but also about history.All in all I like the movieI am not ashamed to admit it.  It was fun and reimagined so people should not get too caught up about the story line. One question still remains...why is it that people get all caught up in Justin Chambers' looks?  Did people complain about Christopher Reve in Superman or Val Kilmer in Batman lets admit it people like attractive protagonists...hello...this is Hollywood!!! what do you  expect?".

But you knew that.But here his lighting is very appealing and to my mind actually redeems this especially if you see it on a big screen. There's nothing original that I could see especially on the movement of the camera. But if you just look at the pictures they're quite enriching. Not a must see but definitely some gems rather like much classical' music It's banal but oddly hypnotizing in its chocolately overtones.Two minor points. The sound editing is pretty adventuresome and is equally rich. And not just the thuds of skulls but the jangle of chains squeak of leather splashing of bathwater against Mena's back. And then there's Tim Roth. He works not just walks through as Deneuve and Rea. I'm convinced that he is not a bad character actor but that he acts as a bad character actor acting a part above his head. We know he can act certainly the best in this cast The Cook 89' Vincent 90' Rosencrantz 90. Once you see him there you see that he acts the actor not the part. Check out his solution to the face puppet of Planet of the Apes.'".

Its not fantastic but It doesn't try to be the best film ever it's going for entertainment value.  Alot of people whined about the script and dialogue this film is a pg and has many childlike attributes the stereotypical hero saves the day and the damzel essentially it is a family film do disney films recite shakespere dialogue?  NO thats because making it to complicated would cut out the biggest part of the target audience. Compared to todays standard of films I don't think this is any worse than stuff I find in my local video rental place great sets great costumes a mixture of ideas which seems to work well.  One problem I would agree with is that at times the fight scenes are not shown off very well at all parts are to dark and camera angles are not always good but generally it's watchable and you see the best parts.  I would recomend this film for the entertainment and enjoyable value of it not bad at all.  Another period martial arts film I would recomend is brotherhood of the wolf that offers a little more in terms of script but less in terms of swashbuckling.".

Tim Roth has great moments as the bloodthirsty renegade Fabre. His dialogue with young D'Artagnan during the movie's opening scene are especially entertaining. And who could forget his conversations with Cardinal Richelieu? I'm about to butcher some quotes here so Musketeer fans prepare yourselves CR Without killing anyone I want you to embarrass them. F What if I  must kill someone? Then the Cardinal says rather apathetically Well if you must you must. Then later in the film the Cardinal becomes angry with Fabre's exploits and Fabre says Are you going to damn me to hell? I'm certain that's where I'm going perhaps we can finish our conversation there? Chilling. Francesca's threat to her incestdriven uncle about cutting off his gonads and then feeding them to the pigs made woman all over the world cheer in unison I'm sure. Steven Spiers as Porthos also gives a good performance. The physics seen in the more outlandish action sequences pulls me away from the movie realizing it's only a movie. But in the end it IS telling the fantastic tale of the valiant Musketeers so see it enjoy it take it back before the store closes... ONE FOR ALL! AND ALL FOR FUN!".

Unfortunately however they are few and far between. In fact there are only two in the entire film. Also important to note the enjoyment of these scenes are marred by the poor lighting. While the battles are gripping they also leave the audience wanting  for a better glimpse of the action.The costuming and the attention to grime is noteworthy. it paints a realistic picture of France  not the overly romanticized scenes and backdrops seen in other musketeer films disney's 3 musketeers and iron mask.Aside from the costuming and sword play the movie is horrible. The lines are delivered poorly as if someone were whispering on the side you talk now. The musketeers were drunkards  and not those that those who follow the genre have grown to love. the musketeer story in fact might as well have been thrown out  for it resembles nothing of dumas's original tale save the blue frocks and silver crosses.if you see it see it for the action and then go knowing it will be hard to see.".

Completely Absent. And as if this cake needed more icing the utterly generic score from the otherwise talented David Arnold Stargate Sherlock that doesn't do much adrenaline pumping nor has any real whimsy or levity to it.In the end this is the textbook definition of 'unnecessary'.

And as if this cake needed more icing the utterly generic score from the otherwise talented David Arnold Stargate Sherlock that doesn't do much adrenaline pumping nor has any real whimsy or levity to it.In the end this is the textbook definition of 'unnecessary'. The concept of swashbuckling  kung fu should make for at least good cheesy fun but when that is the ONE and ONLY thing your movie has going for it you have officially failed as a film maker.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is imperative to note that before reading the following critical assessment of The Musketeer' I have a personal bias towards Director Peter Hyams. I have never met the man nor would I bask in his company. Yet I would like to ask him one question. The question would be along the lines of Why do you continuously make horrible films?' This Director has made films in the past that have proved to be deplorable yet he still continues to work in Hollywood. Before a reader mistakes this review for a critical bashing' of this Director they are not mistaken. Simply watch the horrendous film that fuses Hong Kong style action with 17th century swordplay and one can determine the result without even viewing this film.      Peter Hyams has directed Jean Claude Van Damme in Sudden Death' and TimeCop'. He has also directed Arnold Schwarzenneger in End of Days'. In his early work he made 2010' and The Presidio'. These two films were generally regarded as decent films yet it is clear that his best days are behind him. The Musketeer' proves to be one of the worst films ever.     If I possess hatred towards the man I do not. I respect all Directors. The role of Director is the most respectable and most difficult task of any of the Cinematic tasks. Yet what I do not respect is when Directors make no attempt at creating a vivid and intriguing film. Clearly such is the case with the misdirected and ultimately devastatingly boring of films with The Musketeer'. Hyams' latest debacle stars Justin Chambers The Wedding Planner as D'Artagnan a man hellbent on joining the Musketeers in order to avenge his parents' death. The classic Alexandre Dumas story has been adapted for the screen many times yet never in a way that crucifies the script for the sake injecting a new style.      Director Hyams adds an infusion of Hong Kong style to the swashbuckling scenes in hopes of creating an updated Hollywoodized Eastern version of the great tale. The result  another failure on Peter Hyam's resume.     Not convinced of this film's ridiculousness? View the first half hour of the film and witness for yourself the most badly lit scenes ever captured on film. In broad daylight sequences revolving around indoor discussions Hyams who serves as his own Director of Photography captures his subjects speaking in shadows and dark profiles that seen completely out of place. Simply put I could not get past this flaw.     By this point one may have realized the utter wretchedness of the film. I am deeply apologetic because for such a massive production it is a poor poor attempt at updating a premise that should be finally left alone.     On another note I loathe the film and the Director simply because there is no attempt at creating a fun' film. The film's greatest flaw is that it takes itself too seriously. Notice Hyam's direction the entire film is shot rarely without any moving camera shots or intense close ups. The discerning viewer may count how many times the camera actually swoops and follows the action on screen. Even thought the fight sequences are choreographed in an outlandish style and could have been somewhat entertaining Hyams simply sets up his cameras from various angles and lets it roll.     Unfortunately the film is a horrible attempt at a fresh and inventive spin on a great tale. One last aspect to be noted  the opening credits. They are completely amateur and moody just like Hyam's lighting. In conclusion save your time and although the 1993 Disney Version was also horrible it still was a whole lot more enjoyable to watch than this sinful piece of filmmaking.Giancarlo's rating Can you spell GARBAGE?".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS The story of D'Artagnan and the musketeers is one most people know of. With countless adaptations made over the years legendary actors like Oliver Reed Christopher Lee Charlton Heston and Michael York have all featured in these classical tales. Based on an inaccurate history by Alexandre Dumas everyone has a version and a character that they like the most.As a result of the story's success therefore we are still receiving modern adaptations in the 21st century. In 2001 with martial arts stunts and a mediocre cast this FrenchAmerican collaboration entitled either The Musketeer or D'Artagnan depending on your country is mostly dreadful but with the saving grace that is Tim Roth.After witnessing the murder of his parents young D'Artagnan Justin Chambers is raised by his old friend Planchet JeanPierre Castaldi. Becoming the finest swordsman in France D'Artagnan tries to follow in his fathers footsteps by becoming a King's Musketeer. Times are not good for these heroes though with their leader Treville Michael Byrne imprisoned and the evil Febre Tim Roth out for blood.From the opening musical sequence The Musketeer smacks of awkwardness. With a script and a set up which would be more at home in the 1940s it attempts to redeem itself with lavish fight scenes. It never really settles into a decent routine mainly due to a script which feels like it was written by a child. With some lines so bad it is too embarrassing to repeat the script crashes and burns without a hint of reprieve.The fights as well whilst incredibly clever to set up and film never really feel like they belong. Reminiscent of traditionally Chinese films these fights just don't feel realistic and they are often excessive. The final major battle involving an enormous fight and a small hero vs badguy encounter is drawn out to it's excesses and is ridiculous to watch.Truth be told this film would probably be up there amongst the worst films ever if it wasn't for the one wonderful aspect which is Tim Roth's appearance.Roth looking like a homeless dog in desperate need of a grooming is wonderful throughout. Not helped by the dire script he casts a perpetually evil glance over the entire film. He struts around with a badly made eyepatch on and he manages to pull the part off. He has one or two scenes of pure evil which he makes work not because the script is remotely decent but because he speaks his lines with a sense of maliciousness and smoothness. Roth gets a badly scripted character he DOES overact but he somehow manages to make it work. He is the one highlight in an otherwise dire film.For not the first time and definitely not the last a film with little going for it is released. Loosely based on a work by one of France's greatest writers The Musketeer is a woeful encounter which is only saved by an excellent performance by Tim Roth. The film is worth watching ultimately for Roth and Roth alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersTo borrow and paraphrase from that great orator and writer Winston Churchill 'Never in the annals of human endeavor have so many witnessed the butchering of history by so few.'I remember a story on a national morning TV news program that was a major promotion for the debut of this huge waste of celluloid. This interviewpromotion took place aboard the aircraft carrier that's on permanent display in New York harbor. The major male stars Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett along with Producer Jerry Bruckheimer were interviewed by one of the hosts of this TV morning news show. In this interview all three claimed that they enjoyed talking to veterans and listening to their stories. Well I don't think they were paying much attention to those vets.Or at least they decided to ignore reality when it interfered with their script!Some historical facts that got in the way of Bruckheimer's blockbuster It doesn't matter how simple WWII aircraft are compared to today's jets. Ask any pilot and heshe can tell you that you just don't go from flying American P40 fighters one day go to England and jump into the cockpit of a British Spitfire fighter and start shooting down HIGHLY EXPERIENCED COMBAT VETERAN German PILOTS the next! I don't care that even a blind pig can find the occasional acorn! Each aircraft's handling qualities e.g. speed max altitude rate of climb rate of dive turning etc. are different. In other words a pilot has to be TRAINED on that aircraft! To ask us to believe that Affleck's character who hadn't seen REAL aerial combat prior to England can shoot down experienced German fighter pilots the VERY FIRST TIME HE STRAPS ON A 'SPIT' is not only LAUGHABLE it's insulting to the REAL pilots who fought and died in the 'Battle of Britain.'The famous 'Doolittle Raid' took place on April 18 1942  a scant 412 months after the Pearl Harbor attack. Yet we're supposed to believe that not only can Affleck's character IMMEDIATELY master unfamiliar aircraft forgetting that a B25 is a MULTIENGINE BOMBER no less for the moment! apparently so can Josh Hartnett's character. It took EXPERIENCED B25 bomber crews about that long to train for this extremely hazardous raid on Japan January 1942 to April 18 1942. No way in the world could P40 fighter pilots be chosen to fly B25 bombers in the 'Doolittle Raid!'What I don't understand is that since Bruckheimer was obviously not interested in historical accuracy in addition to Affleck's character's superhuman abilities of shooting down EXPERIENCED Germans pilots over England and BATTLE TESTED Japanese pilots over Pearl Harbor rescuing sailors trapped in halfsunk ships giving blood and eventually taking the war to the Japanese in the 'Doolittle Raid' why didn't Bruckheimer just have Affleck's character pumpout and raise the Arizona and singlehandedly save her crew from their watery grave. Thank goodness there are some things even Bruckheimer can't swallow!The special effects and battle scenes were great! Yeah I know. Bruckheimer wasn't shooting a documentary. BUT if you want an entertaining more historically accurate dramatic portrayal of the events of and leading up to December 7th 1941 stick with Tora! Tora! Tora! That movie is based upon the work of a historian considered by many to be the top of his field Gordon Prange. Although Dr. Prange wrote many books on this topic I believe his book At Dawn We Slept was the basis of Tora! Tora! Tora! As a MEDAL OF HONOR winner General Doolittle and the heroic pilots he led on that raid deserved better than the way they were portrayed in Bruckheimer's schlock film. Despite the romance scenes and when it was filmed 30 Seconds Over Tokyo is a much more accurate depiction of the famous Doolittle Raid. At least it's more believable! Affleck Hartnett and Bruckheimer may have listened to WWII veterans but they did not hear. They did not learn. Nor did they appreciate the immeasurable costs paid by those members of this country's 'greatest generation.'The only things I recognized as historically accurate about this film were 1 the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor by Japan on December 7th 1941 2 the US Army did fly P40s 3 British pilots did do combat with Germans in the skies over England during the 'Battle of Britain' 4 some British pilots did crash into the Channel 5 Cuba Gooding's character a black mess cook DID shoot down Japanese planes even though he received no gunnery training and 6 Doolittle did lead a force of 16 US Army B25 bombers from the carrier USS Hornet against Japan. I can't speak to any accuracies about the nurses or their quick thinking e.g. writing with lipstick on the foreheads of the wounded.The only way I'd own a copy of this film is if someone accidentally gave it to me as a gift.".

For one thing no Red Cross Army nurses died as they portray Betty dying. Also no US soldier would go to Britain to join the Royal Air Force. The US Army Air Force had a unit the Flying Tigers in Britain helping out the RAF but no US soldier would actually leave his unit to join another country's military regardless of allies.

Also Ben and Josh Hartnett's characters were fighter pilots. NOT Bomber pilots. The two are very separate things.

But like both those other two films PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.Okay  I could almost accept the hokey old love triangle romantic plot  certainly the stars are great to look at  but the dialogue really sucked I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you. Please!  And all those hero shots from the ground and the slow motion love bits and the soppy music and the eternal sunsets...But what this film really needed was an editor!  The climax of the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor  an American defeat.  But it seems the filmmakers decided that the American audience wouldn't be satisfied with this  and so the movie grinds on and on for another hour or so dramatising a revenge attack on Japan.  And we're supposed to believe that this attack was fought by the very same guys who were on the ground in Hawaii.  I mean we all know that America won the war in the end so did we really need this long epilogue?Personally I'd cut out all the Roosevelt and the Japanese high command scenes and concentrate on the experiences of the people on the ground at Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese stuff was all completely unbelievable anyway. The sad loss would be the superb performance of Jon Voight as Roosevelt  but maybe they could make another film about him.  I'd also end the film after the attack at Pearl Harbor as the survivors pick up the pieces.  So why not have a shorter Director's Cut  a novel concept  that makes this film the great film it could have been.  If you like I'll lend the scissors!".

	schema:reviewBody "OK the action sequences are fantastic the music is wonderful  gripping the Pearl Harbor attack was intense it was at many points very emotional and made you a bit teary eyed because you feel for all the brave men  women who died on that faithful day in December 1941. Now lets get down to why this is movie failed miserably 1. First off the movie is way too damn long I mean Jesus I would have to spend have a day to watch it so the makers failed to edit many scenes that didn't need to be in the film.2. Historical inaccuracies are everywhere. Little and small. I read a list of all the inaccuracies in this movie I couldn't possibly write all of them down in this review that's how bad this film is. If you'd like to know what these inaccuracies are checkout Wikipedia and search Pearl Harbor film. Trust me the list of historical inaccuracies are long.3. Waste of talent Tom Sizemore Jon Voight Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film.4. This is what really upset me. The movie is called Pearl Harbor I thought it would be about the events leading up to that faithful day. in fact it's about a cheesy love triangle A LOVE TRIANGLE! this entire movie is centered around three stupid  shallow characters surronded by characters just as annoying as they are. The Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come till the middle of the movie. there isn't much attention given to the events that lead to the attack just these clich characters. Pearl Harbor just seemed to get in the way. Goddam this is like a cheesy Soap Opera or a World War II version of Titanic. I mean how much more Clich can we get?5. The Pearl Harbor Attack was a n intense action packed sequence but even that was incredibly flawed. First off Why is there a Peewee baseball game being played so early in the mourning? second when Hartnett  Affleck get up in the air it seems like they shoot down about 20 planes in reality the Japanese air losses where bare minimum. third there is too much emphasis on CGI effects. fourth this really made me laugh when a group of about 5 men went up into a tower and shot down an enemy fighter with rifles and automatic rifles ..... right... Damn they must have had good accuracy.6. Kenneth M. Taylor is a legendary hero of Pearl Harbor. He was one of two pilots who got into fighter planes and began engaging  shooting down Japanese planes. The other pilot was his friend George Welch Basically Affleck  Hartnett were depicting them. Taylor called this film A Piece of trash oversensationalized  distorted. This was a man who was there and did these heroic feats so you can't discard his opinion. This is proof that this film is a disgrace to our veterans.Overall this movie was a huge disappointment  let down. If you are gonna do a movie based about Pearl Harbor then do it right! seriously! thousand of good men died that day so tragically in one of the most defining moments of American History and you wanna make a movie centered around fake characters and a cheesy love story. Michael Bay whether you realize this or not I think you disgraced a lot of WWII veterans. This film had so much potential and ultimately failed to deliver something spectacular that could have had a major impact in film. My recommendation watch Tora!Tora!Tora! a far more faithful retelling of the Pearl Harbor attack. Pearl Harbor had a budget but at least Tora!Tora!Tora! has heart.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK the action sequences are fantastic the music is wonderful  gripping the Pearl Harbor attack was intense it was at many points very emotional and made you a bit teary eyed because you feel for all the brave men  women who died on that faithful day in December 1941. Now lets get down to why this is movie failed miserably 1. First off the movie is way too damn long I mean Jesus I would have to spend have a day to watch it so the makers failed to edit many scenes that didn't need to be in the film.2. Historical inaccuracies are everywhere. Little and small. I read a list of all the inaccuracies in this movie I couldn't possibly write all of them down in this review that's how bad this film is. If you'd like to know what these inaccuracies are checkout Wikipedia and search Pearl Harbor film. Trust me the list of historical inaccuracies are long.3. Waste of talent Tom Sizemore Jon Voight Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film.4. This is what really upset me. The movie is called Pearl Harbor I thought it would be about the events leading up to that faithful day. in fact it's about a cheesy love triangle A LOVE TRIANGLE! this entire movie is centered around three stupid  shallow characters surronded by characters just as annoying as they are. The Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come till the middle of the movie. there isn't much attention given to the events that lead to the attack just these clich characters. Pearl Harbor just seemed to get in the way. Goddam this is like a cheesy Soap Opera or a World War II version of Titanic. I mean how much more Clich can we get?5. The Pearl Harbor Attack was a n intense action packed sequence but even that was incredibly flawed.

	schema:reviewBody "Contains Spoiler!! A matter of weeks before he is due to leave for England having volunteered to fight with the RAF Capt Rafe McCawley meets and falls for Evelyn Johnson.  He leaves very much in love with her but when he is supposedly killed in action his best friend Danny has to tell Evelyn that he is dead.  As they turn to one another for support and healing they gradually fall in love.  When Rafe is found alive he returns to America and finds his best friend in love with his girlfriend.  This complex love triangle is made even more complex when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and draw America into World War II.You can see why they made this film  a major emotional centrepiece around which a Hollywood love story between beautiful people occurs sounds like another Titanic right? I do not understand why that film became so very popular and showered with awards but I do understand why Pearl Harbour did so badly critically but it sadly still did make several hundred million dollars  something the gloaters tend to forget!.  The good thing about the film is the action  it seems to be the only thing that Michael Bay can really do well. You can see where the money was spent and it is pretty exciting.  The only reservation I had about it was that Bay cannot help but deliver the action like Bad Boys rather than Saving Private Ryan  in other words the sheer horror of the attack is lost in a sea of glossy special effects slick camera movements and big bangs it looks great but it is difficult to really be shocked or moved in the way that the events really should have.  Sure the shots of bodies and the hospitals sort of bring it home but you can't help but feel the majority of the action is rather soulless.  Of course very like Bay he doesn't know when to end and after the attack he follows the action to America's retaliation  where Rafe shows 'em what for'  here the action is silly and just far too simplistic for the subject involved.I think it was the other qualities' the film has that made it such a hated film.  The romance that is supposed to engage us with the three main characters is horribly banal and only serves to make the film's first half feel significantly longer than it really is.  The romance fails for two big reasons.  First of all there are zero characters they are plodding cardboard creations with allAmerican qualities and strong jaw lines. They were never real people to me and I swear this film could have ended with each of them being torn to bloody shreds by Japanese bulldogs and I would have struggled to care less  even the almost constant use of Hans Zimmers' score can't make this emotionally involving.  Secondly the script is a woefully inept piece of rubbish that makes the Telebubbies feel like the pinnacle of modern writing.  At best the lines just seem clunky and unnatural at worst they are heavy with clich and just smack of lazy writing  when I'd heard Afflect shout get me in a plane NOW' for the third time or Hartnett announce world war 2 has started' oh  so it didn't in 1939? I was already starting to feel my ears bleed.  Basically if it is not all clichd tough talk then it is corny romance dialogue  neither work and only serve to further destroy the foundations of an already weak film.The acting fits perfectly with the standard of characterisation and dialogue and is roundly average despite having a pretty impressive list of names in the cast.  Affleck is not a leading man and nothing he has done since Good Will Hunting has convinced me that he can carry a film like it or not DiCaprio was part of Titanic's success  Affleck is part of Pearl Harbour's failing.  He is nothing more than a rugged face square jawed hero type American boy  the only silver lining to the film is that at least a good script wasn't wasted on his flat and uninvolving delivery.  Hartnett is no better but least is pretty to look at it's just a shame that that is all he is.  Beckinsale is a nonentity who is given nothing to do and therefore does almost nothing.  Why or how these two men fell for her was never made clear.  Gooding Jr is so poorly used that I wondered why the film even bothered to keep him in it. He is poorly fitting to the period talking in modern ethnic clichs  a further sign of lazy writing and he exists to give us a vague focus on the ships and also be the first black soldier to get a medal but not the last' the film reassuringly confirms.  As poorly used as they are at least it is interesting to see faces like Jennifer Garner Dan Aykroyd Adam Baldwin Sizemore Voight Tagawa Everett Diehl Coates and Fichtner.  The only shame is that most of them have little to do and that some of them just seem really out of place Aykroyd and Tagawa in particular.Overall compared to the mix of spiteful or unfairly adoring reviews that are around this might seem a balanced one but understand that I really do consider this a waste of film and time.  Bay does the action with style but sadly missing the soul that the situation required.  The romance is awful and is a major problem since this was supposed to be our foundation and the script shows a complete inability to develop characters or put anything other than clichd dialogue into their mouths.".

	schema:reviewBody "I heard about this film while it was in production. I heard about how they were going to go out of their way to get all the right aircraft to film so things would look right. I heard how they wanted everything to look as authentic as possible. I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid ???  an early warning sign. I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970 allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous bigbudget movie about Pearl Harbor Tora Tora Tora.So I thought Given all this how bad can it be?.The answer unfortunately is AWFUL. This may not be Hollywood at its worst but it's pretty close.I don't know the origin of the phrase Titanic with bombs for describing this film but it's pretty apt. One difference is that Bay and Bruckheimer together don't add up to James Cameron. Both films feature trite sappy predictable love stories with every chestnut in the Hollywood Clich guide clearly in evidence layered over a reallife tragic event. However although I don't particularly like Titanic I have some respect for Cameron's success in reproducing the appearance of the RMS Titanic and the events of the Titanic sinking on screen. I am prepared to watch Titanic while fastforwarding over the love story bits just to see the history parts.Pearl Harbor fails this test. The portion of the film featuring the attack on Pearl Harbor comes off like a video game  Lots of sound and fury but no realism whatsoever. The problem here is that this is not only a real event but an event of pivotal importance in the history of the United States. Worse yet the event is still within living memory. How will we feel in 2061 when a director decides to make a movie about September 11 2001 and casually rearranges the events of that day to make the resulting film more entertainingmore commercialmore appealing to mass audiences? Do you feel sick even contemplating that possibility? That's how I suspect that veterans of the actual attack on Pearl Harbor feel about this movie. The late Brigadier General Kenneth Taylor one of the pilots who did in real life what Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray on screen described the film as a piece of trash...oversensationalized and distorted.Watch Tora Tora Tora instead. It's not perfect but it's a pretty accurate telling of what really happened at Pearl Harbor. Tellingly Tora Tora Tora used veterans like General Taylor as advisers to make sure that they got most of the details right. A newer film with improved special effects is not necessarily a better film.".

Finally here was a movie that would show what the attack on Pearl Harbor was like portray the event as it really happened pay homage to all the men American and Japanese alike who died there.Then I started reading the reviews. Overdone was a word I came across a lot. And there were the comments from the other girls at school Oh it's soooooooooooooooooooo sad! It's just the most beautiful love story and oh my GAWD does Josh Harnett ever look hot! At this point I started to worry. I even vowed that I would not see the movie. Oh Lord how I wish I'd stuck to that vow.First of all this movie should not have been called Pearl Harbor. It has next to nothing to DO with the battle of Pearl Harbor. Would anyone like to know how much time that battle takes up in this three hour monster? About twenty minutes.Secondly it shouldn't have been marketed the way it was. The trailers for this movie made it appear that it would be about the battle and the people who fought in it. Nope! God forbid there be anything useful and historically accurate like that. No what we have here folks is a soap opera. It's kind of like From Here to Eternity great movie only horrible. Here is our basic plot Best friends in the air force. One goes off to Europe to fly with the RAF and is supposedly killed only the audience knows he's not really dead because he got top billing. Dead guys buddy has affair with dead guy's girlfriend. She gets pregnant. Dead guy shows up to announce that he's not really dead. They fight. Oh and then the Japanese pull a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor but who cares?! Obviously not the writers director producer or anyone who could have stopped this blasted thing from being released.There's so much more I could say but I do have a word limit here. The one good thing in my opinion is the way the Japanese are portrayed here. Not demonized as one thinks they'd be but shown for what they were human beings.In closing I want to say that I have done my homework on Pearl Harbor. I've read the books I've seen TV specials and I've interviewed a survivor from the Oklahoma. I can say with all honesty that this movie is a complete insult to the event and all the men who died there and if this is all that the American public cares to know about something that was so important to our history we are in deep trouble.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't too concerned about historical accuracies of films which are based on true events as long as they were kept to a minimum but this movie changed my mind. Michael Bay completely changed the events of Pearl Harbor. There was just too much historical inaccuracy and fictional characters in the movie. The movie makes no mention of real life heroes George Welch and Kenneth Taylor the pilots who actually flew over Pearl Harbor. They're instead replaced by two fictional characters.The love triangle is the main focus of the movie which is completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Kenneth Taylor who died in November 2006 called this film a piece of trash . . . oversensationalized and distorted.The USS Arizona did not jump a few feet into the air when it exploded. There is actual footage of the ship exploding yet Bay made it more dramatic looking. Another obvious mistake is the A6M Zero which are all painted green resembling an army type navy types were all grey when they attacked Pearl.The Doolitte Raid was surprisingly included in the movie. Although the event is a response to the Pearl Harbor attack I feel it is merely to give the American audience some relief that at least they get to see some payback. I wonder if Doolittle ever said he would do a 'kamikaze' if his B25 was hit.Of all the actorsactresses who starred in this movie only Cuba Gooding Jr. delivered an outstanding performance as Doris Miller did shooting down two Japanese planes with only a machine gun. However the actor was merely playing a supporting role and his actions in the movie was far different from what he did in reality.The Director's Cut version does not change my opinion of this movie. Until a historically accurate  entertaining remake of Pearl Harbor has finally been formulated I will remain frustrated and angered at Michael Bay's awful directing.".

The film as a whole is brilliantly written it's not too soppy with the romance and not too over the top with pure action. People are saying that it's just too much shoot 'em up and too many explosions. Well I got news for you... They're at war! Bombs will go off and guns will be fired from all places possible. If you want to see a movie that's not so explosive watch Twilight. To me personally character development is very important in a movie and I believe Pearl Harbor succeeded with this. I grew attached to individuals and felt vulnerable as a member of the audience at the best of times. Absolutely superb watch and I'd highly recommend it! If you're offended by a film not being entirely accurate steer clear and stick to your documentaries. 910! Excellent!".

	schema:reviewBody "Never before have I rooted for the Japanese in a Second World War flick. Never before have I so loathed the Allied forces.If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by then the American Navy was wholly populated by loud obnoxious morons who spent their days courting emptyheaded bimbos while drinking and whooping like some thief had come along in the night scooped out their brains and trampled them under foot. The characters here are morons. Conversely the Japanese come across as smart resourceful and composed. They feel no need to hoot and holler and they don't seem to be secretly ogling male bum cakes like the American characters do. They're entirely more likable. Oh but what about the British? Well they enjoy fellating beefy horsefaced Americans  a British pilot tells Affleck that if the States has more men like him then their enemies should soil themselves. Like I say the Allied forces in this film are wretched.But I do have to say that even the glorious Japanese forces have their bad moments. In a politically correct effort to 'humanise' them there's one bit where a Japanese officer melodramatically says that a truly brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. And there's another bit where a Japanese pilot leans out of his plane and apparently warns some children of the impending carnage. It's an incredibly sappy moment. Although I'll change my opinion of said pilot if he was actually taunting the children and saying something like I'm going to kill your daddy. Another piece of political correctness is the portrayal of Doris Miller Cuba Gooding Jr.. In one scene he even holds his white commanding officer while telling him how gosh darn great he his. But perhaps more insulting is the way he indulges in hooting and hollering as he shoots the Japanese down  every American character in this film behaves like they're in the audience for some ghastly sitcom. I mean it's one thing to have a fictional character act idiotically but it's something else to belittle the efforts of a real person. And really the character is totally superfluous. Everyone else in the film has some sort of connection to Affleck Hartnett or Beckinsale but Gooding exists separately. His inclusion is really just a sad concession to political correctness. His character exists only to prove to stupid rightwing Americans that there were actually black sailors who fought bravely. You know just in case you're a Grade A moron and thought all the black sailors were hiding below decks eating fried chicken.But far more offensive than the political correctness is the 'romance'. Really the film is about as romantic as drunken masturbation. There's just not one iota of genuine feeling in the whole movie. And of course the whole thing is completely unbelievable. Oh some horseface falls in love goes to England is presumed dead then his girlfriend shacks up with his best friend before horseface returns then horseface's exgirlfriend finds out she's pregnant with his best friend's child on the day of his resurrection and then the best friend dies in battle and horseface and exgirlfriend shack up again and bring the child up together. Yeah that sounds plausible.But although the sequence of events is ridiculous the scenes themselves are far worse. One of the worst is the courtship between Affleck and Beckinsale. She's a nurse he's a pilot and she passes him to fly because she thinks he has a cute arse and because he begs her not to take his wings. Then he turns into Inspector Clouseau and smacks his head on things and fires a champagne cork into his face. Somehow this is meant to endear us to him. The only thing I can say in response is that it's a shame it wasn't a gun equinefeatures accidentally shot himself with.However I wanted to turn the gun on myself when Affleck goes to England and we have to hear Beckinsale writing her letters. Every night I look at the sunset and try and draw the last ounce of heat from its long day and send it from my heart to yours. Somewhere Fabio is nodding his head in approval. But there must be about a million sunsets in this film  Bay has never met a visual clich he didn't like.And Beckinsale writes her letters while sitting on a beach in a bikini with a flower behind her ear as waves crash on the rocks beyond. How old is Michael Bay exactly? It's like its been directed by a 13year old girl. And just how white are Beckinsale's teeth? They kept on distracting me. Teeth shouldn't be that white. They shouldn't look like someone's painted gloss on them. But I also hated the way that every establishing shot was some sort of swooping crane shot. Is Bay really that short on ideas? Wellyeah of course he is.But what really makes me laugh is the way that Bay has compared this tripe to a David Lean film. Lean made romantic films that didn't make you want to wretch romantic films that were written and directed with taste and style romantic films that were literate and intelligent. Bay's film is none of these things. It's an infantile disasterpiece. It's a film where simpletons have teary intercourse in a parachute hanger a film where two whooping morons almost singlehandedly make the Japanese air force retreat a film where FDR heroically rises to his feet to show what the American heart is capable of a film where a dying man says he's cold and then symbolically hands his children over to his best pal and a film where a bimbo with shockingly white teeth says Now I'm going to give Danny my whole heartbut I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you. No film has done so much to dishonour the Allied forces.".

Rafe McCawley Affleck goes to downtown London no one says downtown  it's known as Central London to serve in the RAF as a fighter pilot.

One thing done right was Dory Miller Cuba Gooding Jr. the cook who shot down an enemy plane and was later awarded the Navy Cross. But I doubt the real Dory Miller jumped and hollered when he did it.Then they include a scene or two with the Japanese fleet which I guess is an attempt to give us both sides of the story or to give the audience an enemy to hate. But Admiral Yamamoto was portrayed wrongly he wasn't gungho about attacking Pearl Harbor he lamented the decision.The movie could have ended with Roosevelt's Jon Voight address to Congress  and even that had mistakes in it  but it dragged on for another hour with Dolittle's Raid over Tokyo. James Doolittle is played poorly by antiwar mouthpiece Alec Baldwin who acts like a cheerleader rather than a military leader. And all of the sudden Walker and McKawley are bomber pilots?Now contrast this with 1970's Tora! Tora!

	schema:headline " Except for 20 minutes utter garbage.";
	schema:reviewBody "Possibly spoilers though not much to spoil.Essentially this movie is trying to be both Titanic romance with a historcial event as background and Saving Private Ryan strarly realistic miltary drama at the same time.  Basic summation of plot Guy 1 falls in love with this woman.  Guy 1 disappears and is presumed dead so Guy 2 Guy 1's friend falls in the love with the woman too.  Guy 1 later shows up again creating an awkward moment.  Pearl Harbor happens.  The characters involve themselves.  Dolittle's raid happens.  Guy 1 or Guy 2 dies leaving the other one to take care of the woman who is pregnant with Guy 1 or Guy 2's child.If you wondering why I only spend one sentence on the event that's the title of the movie good.  I am wondering why the title event takes up only 20 minutes out of the 3 hours of this movie.That 20 minutes seeing the actual Pearl Harbor attack is the only redeeming feature of this movie.  Special effects and cinemtography realistically and graphically portray the actual attack.  See those 20 minutes.As for the rest of the movie...The romance is poorly written and completely untinteresting.  And SLOW. Ben Affleck gives his most wooden perforamnce ever and for him that's really saying something.As for the historic events leading up to the attack the historical figures are a tad too prescient knowing way more than they possibly should as if they read ahead in the script.A really silly moment is when you see the Japanese attack plans... carved into granite.  Not kidding they actually are and what looks more like a momument in a park than a military headquarters.After the attack you hear one of the stupidest lines in the entire movie I think World War II just started!  Ridiculous in that nobody would ever say that in 1941.  There is no World War I yet it was still just called The Great War and the term World War II wasn't coined until after 1945 when it ended.  It really breaks the illusion of being at the even that the last 20 minutes did such a good job at.You see the charachters get involved in a rediculous unrealistic way though actions were based on actual historcial events though they're GREATLY exxagerated here.  The movie isn't satisfied with ending at the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack and moved right on to the Doolittle raid after more boring attention to the romantic plot.  Which leads to a predictable end after the raid one of the 2 dies in case you still care at this point.Very slow moving poorly written boring movie.  Except for the excellent 20 minutes of the attack see that part then return this.  Don't recommend you buy it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Possibly spoilers though not much to spoil.Essentially this movie is trying to be both Titanic romance with a historcial event as background and Saving Private Ryan strarly realistic miltary drama at the same time.  Basic summation of plot Guy 1 falls in love with this woman.  Guy 1 disappears and is presumed dead so Guy 2 Guy 1's friend falls in the love with the woman too.  Guy 1 later shows up again creating an awkward moment.  Pearl Harbor happens.  The characters involve themselves.  Dolittle's raid happens.  Guy 1 or Guy 2 dies leaving the other one to take care of the woman who is pregnant with Guy 1 or Guy 2's child.If you wondering why I only spend one sentence on the event that's the title of the movie good.  I am wondering why the title event takes up only 20 minutes out of the 3 hours of this movie.That 20 minutes seeing the actual Pearl Harbor attack is the only redeeming feature of this movie.  Special effects and cinemtography realistically and graphically portray the actual attack.  See those 20 minutes.As for the rest of the movie...The romance is poorly written and completely untinteresting.  And SLOW. Ben Affleck gives his most wooden perforamnce ever and for him that's really saying something.As for the historic events leading up to the attack the historical figures are a tad too prescient knowing way more than they possibly should as if they read ahead in the script.A really silly moment is when you see the Japanese attack plans... carved into granite.  Not kidding they actually are and what looks more like a momument in a park than a military headquarters.After the attack you hear one of the stupidest lines in the entire movie I think World War II just started!

Pearl Harbor was a horrific tragedy but this movie paints it as just another cool fight scene. Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted as this onedimensional bit part which he overacts anyway. Also at the end of the movie when Hartnett gets shot he's basically being crucified look at the bits of wood he's attached too. Just another offensive pretentious factor in this completely ridiculous excuse for a film. And when Hartnett got shot I actually cheered.

	schema:reviewBody "How can you turn such a powerful moment in American history into a trite love triangle?!! I've been privileged to know and read about so many amazing stories that occurred to sailors soldiers on both sides and civilians alike that defy description. Another film that any decent writer would have a field day with. There is so much grist for the mill you wouldn't be able to include it all. While the earlier movie version of Pearl Harbor Tora Tora Tora is done in a documentary style it stays true to the myriad reallife characters and is so well acted by a rich cast of veteran actors. Mr.'s Bay and Wallace could take a lesson from earlier movies like ToraTora Tora and the classic 30 Seconds Over Tokyo. The latter does have a corny lovestory at it's heart but is also a terrific drama and action adventure too that is respectful of the amazing couraqge of those heroes involved. And as far as that central love triangle of 30 Seconds... we do have to remember the time period it was done in. What might seem dated now was quite meaningful then to the thousands of men that went off to war and the women who were left behind to keep the nation's economy going and support the country and the troops. The love story as depicted in Pearl Harbor has none of the vital intensity of the earlier film and the love triangle is just unnecessary.Interesting is the fact that despite the main sell of the film which was it's amazing specialeffects this even suffers in comparison to one key scene in 30 Seconds.... Compare the scenes in both movies where the first pilot successfully takes off under the required distance needed to safely get off the eventual aircraft carrier. The 1942 version looks real while in the Michael Bay film we see the pilots cheering as the plane passes over the line and doesn't even leave the ground in the shot!Cuba Gooding gives the best performance of the film portraying reallife hero Doris Miller. The inclusion of Miller as a supporting character was the best idea that the screenwriter had and Gooding as usual turns in an excellent performance. Other good performances in the film are Tom Sizemore reprising his excellent Private Ryan performance as a tough soldier and Jon Voight's game effort as Pres. Roosevelt. Shameful in the film is the treatment and portrayal of the Japanese who are treated as caricatures. The wonderful Mako is wasted in his portrayal Admiral Yamamoto. His famous ..waking a sleeping giant. line is done as a throwaway. Yamamoto was such an extraordinary person that even the American pilot who shot him down and killed him during the war later came to revere him for his intelligence honor and vision. There is even the element of the mystical about Yamamoto. He was reported to have had a premonition about his death and on the day he made his illfated plane trip he purposely put on the dress uniform one would wear for a funeral.Ben Afleck and Kate Beckinsale are weak as the main characters. Josh Hartnett a good actor just seems whiny. In the face of all that's going on you feel like who cares about these three! What a shame a waste of money. One more film where special effects are relied upon to carry the film. Just imagine if 110 of the effort that was put into the special effects was put into the story itself. It would have been a more worthy memorial to our fallen and living heroes of Pearl Harbor. as Saving Private Ryan was to the fallen and living heroes of DDay.".

	schema:headline " Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining yet deeply flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "For the past two decades now Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions and with this heavy special effects garners wide success at the box office. Here Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn played by Kate Beckinsale. Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning December 7 Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost the U.S declares war against war. From there on Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle played by Alec Baldwin prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller the first African American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale including a line I love you so much it hurts a line that is highly laughable and far too corny especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story the film ends up running 183 minutes. Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre Saving Private Ryan Schindler's List. Overall this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws it still works and is entertaining to watch.".

You won't regret it.Just one word about the commentary track if you get the DVD. The best thing about DVDs of films directed by Michael Bay are the commentary tracks. Hearing this track I could easily see where some of the bad dialogue came from. The problem is that Michael Bay interviewed many Pearl Harbor veterans and he used the expressions they used in the movie. There's 125 different personalities crammed into a few characters that are spewing the bad dialogue. I'm guessing Mr. Bay took all the expressions these people said and had two or three characters say everything. So all the clichd expressions the veterans used during their lives are shoved into 3 hours. That's my take anyway. Mr. Bay does admit that one thing he would change if he could would be the earnest dialogue because the younger people seem to think it's corny.The DVD is very cheap to purchase at this point and is worth it for the commentary track alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story though seemingly impossible aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver give warm hearted performances as the designated tobelovers who meet by chance. But the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor as Minnie Driver's grandfather is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines Minnie as a 'sister' is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with James Belushi as her husband.  Classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again. Thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw the trailer for this film I said out loud to no one in particular this film is going to bomb.  I also said that about THE MATRIX and look at what happened there.  Now I am not a box office guru by any stretch but I usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and what is going to really suck.  In this case I was blinded by my complete and utter apathy towards David Duchovney.  Let me put it to you a different way  I don't like his as a person  from what I have read of him in interviews he is unbelievably premadonna like and he is full of himself considering all he has done is XFiles  or as an actor.  PLAYING GOD was a really poor film but he came off thinking that for some reason he deserved big bucks on the big screen.  But I am happy to say that even though those things may still be true about the man Return To Me is delightful and has it's heart in the right place.  Bonnie Hunt has directed a beautiful story and she has told it with class and grace.  This is one of the most romantic films I have seen and even though it may seem to be a bit sad and maudlin in its premise give it a chance and you will be hooked.It has to be said  and this pains me to do so  that the reason this film works so well is because of the story and the cast.  Duchovney and Driver are so wonderful and believable here that I honestly wanted to cry along with them.  There is one particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes home after his wife has died and he slumps down on the floor of his house. As it always does the family dog looks to the door to wait for his wife to come walking in.  She doesn't and with his shirt collar still stained with blood Rob  Duchovney  tells him that she is not coming home ever.  He then calls the dog over to him and they seem to share a cry together.  The dog lets out a small moan and then Rob cries.  And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I have ever seen in any character in any movie. You can feel his pain and at that moment I forgot I was watching an actor that I generally don't like and I felt that I was watching someone that I knew moarn the loss of his beloved.  This is powerful stuff.Another strength of the film is the supporting cast.  Bonnie Hunt has combined an ethnic melting pot of Irish and Italian characters that share a common bond.  They share a pub called O'Reilley's Italian Pub.  That is a delicious name all by itself.  And heading the diametric scale of clashing cultures is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia.  These are two proud old men that love their homeland but love their granddaughter and niece  I think it is  respectively.  And that is the character played by Minnie Driver.  This scenario is ripe for comedy and Hunt doesn't miss anything here.Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some funny moments together as the middle aged married couple and Belushi gets top points as he accepts humility gracefully and shows off his ample keg of a stomach for laughs. With his family consisting of three or four kids there is very little time for him and the wife to have quality time.  And again Hunt handles this with perfect elegance.  This is a wonderful story of finding true love knowing how lucky you are to have true love and the power of friendship and family.  Return To Me is a wonderful romance and even though I still don't have a great admiration for David Duchovney I have to admit that he was perfect in this role and I could not picture anyone else playing his character.  He was sensitive and believable and the movie was good because of him not just because of him but he sure added to the flavour.If you are a sucker for a good romance and you want a good cry then this is the film for you.  8.5 out of 10 I will see anything that Bonnie Hunt puts out with her in the director's chair.".

Well I was wrong Duchovny's performance in this movie is great. Minnie Driver also gives a likeable performance.Return to Me is a sweet romantic comedy and it seems different from other romcoms simply because of the premise which most of you know all about already so I won't bring it up here. But the movie isn't really different from other romcoms apart from the fact that it is sweeter more interesting and generally better than most other films belonging to the genre. But let's face it from the moment you pop the cassette disc into the video DVDplayer you know where this is going to end. The film is also about twenty minutes too long and some scenes are so obviously superfluous that you'll be asking yourself why they left them in the film. I'm thinking about the boring scenes with Grace's grandfather and his friends discussing music in particular. Also other scenes are ridiculous e.g. Sydney responding to Grace the way he responded to Bob's wife. Too much really.Overall though Return to Me is a good film with likeable performances by Duchovny and Driver.".

Minnie Driver also gives a likeable performance.Return to Me is a sweet romantic comedy and it seems different from other romcoms simply because of the premise which most of you know all about already so I won't bring it up here. But the movie isn't really different from other romcoms apart from the fact that it is sweeter more interesting and generally better than most other films belonging to the genre. But let's face it from the moment you pop the cassette disc into the video DVDplayer you know where this is going to end. The film is also about twenty minutes too long and some scenes are so obviously superfluous that you'll be asking yourself why they left them in the film. I'm thinking about the boring scenes with Grace's grandfather and his friends discussing music in particular. Also other scenes are ridiculous e.g. Sydney responding to Grace the way he responded to Bob's wife. Too much really.Overall though Return to Me is a good film with likeable performances by Duchovny and Driver.";

	schema:reviewBody "RETURN TO ME  2000 12Starring David Duchovny Minnie Driver Bonnie Hunt David Alan Grier Joely Richardson James Belushi Robert Loggia Eddie Jones and Carroll O'Connor. Directed by Bonnie Hunt. Written by Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake. Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG for language and thematic elements.Return to Me is a warm and fuzzy romantic comedy with heartin metamorphic and literal terms. Unlike a lot of recent romances this film is not suggestive or sexy but gentle and gradual. Director writer and star Bonnie Hunt is descriptive in believable methods detailing human emotions and the bitterness loneliness. This is one of the most effective if somewhat formulaic comedydramas this year.  David Duchovny stars as Bob Rueland a modern day construction consultant. He and his wife Elizabeth Joely Richardson are a happily married offspringfree couple living a life of honesty and hard work. Elizabeth is in the process of founding a natural habitat for gorillas currently living in enclosed captivity. Bob's best friend Charlie Johnson David Alan Grier supports the Rueland's whenever need may be. Return to Me contains two separate story lines before narrative connection in the second act. The secondary story centers on a young woman named Grace Briggs Minnie Driver who requires a heart transplant in the very near future. Megan and Joe Dayton Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi support her. This family owns an Italian Restaurant in which Bob and Grace meet one night.  This is an excellent setup containing thoroughly developed characters a clear dramatic premise emotional and physical conflicts and an unusual structure. Although we do not witness some of the important narrative actions Grace's recovery from surgery an automobile accident resulting in the death of a character the film firmly paces itself with various plot elements and emotional qualities. Return to Me inhabits many enormously likable characters. Both central characters Bob Rueland and Grace Briggs empathetic and believable are in a homespun situation. They both contain chemistryrich elegance and gracefulness. There are very funny moments planted by Megan and Joe's comically dysfunctional family. This family appears somewhat unfocused but wisely portrayed as background characters developing Grace's lifestyle with more depth. The film's humor is handled with delicacy and knowledge. The filmmakers are careful not to travel over the top in hilarity this is not a story about slapstick issues but about heartfelt secrets and personal fears. Comedy is not overabundant nor overwhelming and does not distract the story from developing its themes. Every funny moment in Return To Me is scattered throughout the context of the plot. David Duchovny and  Minnie Driver pair up for the perfect unlikely romantic couple. The inspirational performance by Driver induces lovable charm and imagination. Duchovny is also engagingly sweet filling his character with polished humility. Likewise the background performances are magically funny and heartwarming. The actors paint their characters beautifully.Return to Me is the kind of date movie where the characters and the audience go home happy and warm. Bonnie Hunt is on target with this comedy straight from the heart leaving viewers with a cuddly feeling of satisfaction.Return to Me is brought to you by MGM Productions.".

Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD. They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about. I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness anxiety and joy. The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family a rarity in film today which is a reflection of the director Bonnie Hunt based on the comments she made on the DVD.  David Duchovny showed me here that there is life beyond Fox Mulder giving a wonderful performance with some pretty poignant scenes. I highly recommend that you give this movie a viewing. I am really thankful to the creators of this film. They have given me a wonderful piece of cinematic viewing that I will recommend to all my friends. I have seen a lot of movies over the years and it is very rare that I come away with such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a film. I will watch this time and time again for years to come.  Return to Me reminds me that there are still moviemakers out there that know how to sincerely please their movie audiences. Thanks!!".

Minnie Driver is simply beautiful charming funny and lively in her role as Grace.Outside of these two leads however you are surrounded by Grace's closeknit family and friends.

	schema:headline " What a movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those rare movies that clicks it just has every element in it so right  and it is funny touching and everything else you can think of at the same time. The plot is something I have not seen too much in the past so it is original at least to me. David Duchovny plays a happily married man whose wife unexpectedly dies. He is depressed and downhearted but he meets a woman whose heart is actually his deceased's wife's as she was an organ donor and the new woman in his life took her heart.The strength of this movie is the cast and what a cast it is. The best in the cast is a personal favorite of mine Carroll O'Connor in his last film role. He plays the woman's uncle and he is priceless he is a character that is so funny and has so much heart he fits in this movie perfectly he is such a master of entertainment by now. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny are so good together they have a perfect chemistry Duchovny is not your typical leading man he is not so suave and debonair and Driver while she is cute is not your typical bimbo she is an actress with substance and proves it here.The characters here are very engrossing they bring you into the world and all of the nuances the sadness the happiness this movie has it all. the fascinating thing about a movie like this though is it is not a hardcore movie it is not intense it mostly is not violent it is just a sweet lite as air movie no cussing nothing like that and it it almost perfect. There is a minor clash of cultures movie as Duchovny's character is fairly wealthy while Dirver's character is more working class working in her uncle's restaurant. The jokes in this movie are well thought out not forced and not over the top. The jokes come from situations and dialogue and the movie is all acting the movie would be nothing without the performances How many movies like this can you say are all acting no gunplay or car chases or anything like that? Sadly not many. And there is not a week cast member either. David Alan Grier another comedianactor I like because he is such a different type of performer does a fine job. Robert Loggia James Belushi and Bonnie Hunt who was the brains behind this movie also do excellent jobs. And I can't say enough about Carroll O'Connor I wish you would saw him more before his death. It was sad too he could make any horrible movie or show excellent.The Chicago and Italy locations are excellent too. The cinematography is breathtaking. You gotta give kudos to Bonnie Huny for coming up with something so good she just has a knack for this kinda thing she should do more movies if they are going to be this good. David Duchovny also does an excellent job I wasn't a fan of the XFiles but he really proved himself as an actor here. He is very funny while doing some very good acting too.I also liked this movie because it borough together all of these actors and a lot of them are known but they're not marquee stars that brings a certain down to earth element to the movie. To add to that the movie works because nobody steals the spotlight the movie is a team effort everyone gets good lines everybody feeds off of everybody to make this movie so good. A lot of movies focus on one person and this movie works so well because it doesn't can you Imagine Tom Cruise or even Tom Hanks in a movie where he isn't the focus of attention most of the time? Somehow this movie manages to be magical or whimsical or something like that. I just got an incredible feeling watching this movie it's too bad more people didn't watch it it was phenomenal in it's own respect. In today's movie making climate it is amazing a studio would produce something so simple and it turned out so good. But sometimes the most simple plots and concepts turnout to be the best movies other movies can learn something from a movie like this maybe not in terms of ticket sales but in terms of quality. To me this is a movie for everyone I think most people would enjoy watching I might be wrong but this is a very good movie that doesn't have anything to offend anyone I wouldn't think anyway.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of those rare movies that clicks it just has every element in it so right  and it is funny touching and everything else you can think of at the same time. The plot is something I have not seen too much in the past so it is original at least to me. David Duchovny plays a happily married man whose wife unexpectedly dies. He is depressed and downhearted but he meets a woman whose heart is actually his deceased's wife's as she was an organ donor and the new woman in his life took her heart.The strength of this movie is the cast and what a cast it is. The best in the cast is a personal favorite of mine Carroll O'Connor in his last film role. He plays the woman's uncle and he is priceless he is a character that is so funny and has so much heart he fits in this movie perfectly he is such a master of entertainment by now. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny are so good together they have a perfect chemistry Duchovny is not your typical leading man he is not so suave and debonair and Driver while she is cute is not your typical bimbo she is an actress with substance and proves it here.The characters here are very engrossing they bring you into the world and all of the nuances the sadness the happiness this movie has it all. the fascinating thing about a movie like this though is it is not a hardcore movie it is not intense it mostly is not violent it is just a sweet lite as air movie no cussing nothing like that and it it almost perfect. There is a minor clash of cultures movie as Duchovny's character is fairly wealthy while Dirver's character is more working class working in her uncle's restaurant. The jokes in this movie are well thought out not forced and not over the top. The jokes come from situations and dialogue and the movie is all acting the movie would be nothing without the performances How many movies like this can you say are all acting no gunplay or car chases or anything like that? Sadly not many. And there is not a week cast member either. David Alan Grier another comedianactor I like because he is such a different type of performer does a fine job. Robert Loggia James Belushi and Bonnie Hunt who was the brains behind this movie also do excellent jobs. And I can't say enough about Carroll O'Connor I wish you would saw him more before his death. It was sad too he could make any horrible movie or show excellent.The Chicago and Italy locations are excellent too. The cinematography is breathtaking. You gotta give kudos to Bonnie Huny for coming up with something so good she just has a knack for this kinda thing she should do more movies if they are going to be this good. David Duchovny also does an excellent job I wasn't a fan of the XFiles but he really proved himself as an actor here. He is very funny while doing some very good acting too.I also liked this movie because it borough together all of these actors and a lot of them are known but they're not marquee stars that brings a certain down to earth element to the movie. To add to that the movie works because nobody steals the spotlight the movie is a team effort everyone gets good lines everybody feeds off of everybody to make this movie so good. A lot of movies focus on one person and this movie works so well because it doesn't can you Imagine Tom Cruise or even Tom Hanks in a movie where he isn't the focus of attention most of the time? Somehow this movie manages to be magical or whimsical or something like that. I just got an incredible feeling watching this movie it's too bad more people didn't watch it it was phenomenal in it's own respect. In today's movie making climate it is amazing a studio would produce something so simple and it turned out so good. But sometimes the most simple plots and concepts turnout to be the best movies other movies can learn something from a movie like this maybe not in terms of ticket sales but in terms of quality. To me this is a movie for everyone I think most people would enjoy watching I might be wrong but this is a very good movie that doesn't have anything to offend anyone I wouldn't think anyway.";

I've read in several reviews not here that James Belushi stole the movie with his supporting role but I thought if anyone did that it was Carroll O'Connor not Belushi. O'Connor is just great as the kind Godly Irish grandfather. He and all the older people actually are fun to watch in their matchmaking roles.THE BAD  For such a pleasing story the language could have been toned down. Having a young kid blaspheme by saying GD was inexcusable although it does point out the importance of parents being a better witness as their children often mimic them. Minnie Driver is okay but doesn't seem to fit the role and I wish Hollywood would come up with a different angle in these romancecomedies instead of the same lying routine all the time.All in all a pleasant but unmemorable 'chick flick.'".

	schema:reviewBody "Lurking beneath the surface of former gangsta rap video music director Benny Boom's derivative AfricanAmerican crime comedy Next Day Air  out of  lies the notsosubtle message that pedaling narcotics is a perilous occupation. This predictable Rrated 84minute Pineapple Express carbon copy about minority drug dealers in Philadelphia Pennsylvania blasting holes in each other over a lost horde of cocaine generates more bloodshed than buffoonery. Ironically firsttime scenarist Blair Cobbs has penned a melodramatic screenplay that casts its largely black and Hispanic actors in despicably stereotypical drug dealer roles.Nobody in Next Day Air deserves a shred of sympathy except the protagonist's mother. She is literally the only character that isn't up to mischief. Worse the producers have squandered the talents of one of the funniest black comedians aliveMos Defin a role so trifling that it qualifies as a cameo. Although she has been as criminally wasted in a similar minor role it is gratifying to see Debbie Allen of Fame back in a bigscreen film. Furthermore funnyman Mike Epps usually makes even the worst comedy tolerably entertaining but his presence does little to enliven Next Day Air. Director Benny Boom and scenarist Blair Cobbs establish in the first ten minutes of Next Day Air that the misguided protagonist Leo Jackson Donald Faison of TV's Scrubs loves to get high on reefer. His mother Ms. Jackson Debbie Allen of Fame calls her spoiled son on the carpet for his marijuana misadventures and threatens to fire him. Leo goes into a tantrum and pleads with her not to pink slip him. Nevertheless the threat of being fired has little impact on him afterward because he is back to puffing pot on his delivery route in no time flat.Meanwhile a trio of cretinous bank robbers Guch Wood Harris of HBO's The Wire Brody Mike Epps of Resident Evil Extinction and Hassie Malik Barnhardt of Belly 2 Millionaire Boyz Club sits around their dumpy apartment and play video games. Actually Guch and Brody do the sitting while an oblivious Hassie sprawls out on a nearby couch. The filmmakers appeared to have modeled Hassie on the Brad Pitt slacker in True Romance who hung out on a sofa in his friend's house. Recently these lowlives attempted a bank holdup that went hilarious awry for the silliest of excuses. Apparently Guch told Brody to grab the loot after they entered the premises. Instead Brody seized the video surveillance tapes. Now they watch the bank tapes and reprimand Brody for his incompetence.Guch and Brody reside in the same Philadelphia apartment complex near a Puerto Rican couple Jesus Cisco Reyes and Chita Yasmin Deliz who are anxiously awaiting a shipment of ten bricks of cocaine from a Los Angelesbased cigarsmoking drug smuggler Bodega Emilio Rivera an hombre with no sense of humor. Boom and Cobbs show what happens to the thugs who try to take advantage of Bodega and it isn't a pretty sight. After Bodega punishes a hood from misconduct he promotes Jesus to replace the dearly departed and Jesus knows that his life isn't worth a dime if anything untoward goes wrong through no fault of his own.Naturally Leo is getting high when he wheels in a giant box to the apartment complex and delivers it to Guch and Brody. Brody cannot believe his eyes while Guch insists that God has answered their prayers. Brody contacts his drug pedaling cousin Shavoo Omari Hardwick of Gridiron Gang and makes him a sales pitch. Initially Shavoo doesn't snap up Brody's offer because he keeps a stash in a rental unit downtown until he learns that somebody has stolen his narcotics from him. Shavoo decides to accommodate Brody but he is suspicious about everybody since the burglars hit his rental unit. Meantime Jesus phones Bodega and reports that the merchandise hasn't arrived. Instantly Bodega grows suspicious because he contacted Ms. Jackson's company Next Day Air and received confirmation that the package arrived safely at its destination.Bodega flies into Philly with his hardfaced henchman Rhino Lobo Sebastian of The Longest Yard who likes to get sadistic with Bodega's enemies. Along with Bodega and Rhino a desperate Jesus Cisco Reyes and Chita Yasmin Deliz set out to find Leo and clear up everything. They catch up with Leo still inhaling pot even when he drives his delivery van and Leo realizes to his horror that he did in fact deliver the package to the wrong address. At this point pandemonium erupts out as everybody converges on Guch's apartment with guns drawn and itching to shoot first and ask questions later.The best thing about Next Day Air is that director Boom doesn't wear out his welcome. This movie clocks in at less than 90 minutes. On the other hand this dud about a bunch of dimwits isn't exactly a laughaminute marathon. The finale consists of a hardcore Quentin Tarantinotype gun battle at close quarters. Boom stages this uneven comedy as if he were aspiring to be a Guy Ritchie of Snatch fame. Unfortunately the gunfire overshadows the guffaws. Next Day Air has absolutely nothing to redeem it and this Summit Entertainment release scrapes the bottom of the barrel for the modicum of humor that it has.".

At this point pandemonium erupts out as everybody converges on Guch's apartment with guns drawn and itching to shoot first and ask questions later.The best thing about Next Day Air is that director Boom doesn't wear out his welcome. This movie clocks in at less than 90 minutes. On the other hand this dud about a bunch of dimwits isn't exactly a laughaminute marathon. The finale consists of a hardcore Quentin Tarantinotype gun battle at close quarters. Boom stages this uneven comedy as if he were aspiring to be a Guy Ritchie of Snatch fame. Unfortunately the gunfire overshadows the guffaws. Next Day Air has absolutely nothing to redeem it and this Summit Entertainment release scrapes the bottom of the barrel for the modicum of humor that it has.";

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Leo Donald Faison works as a next day delivery driver who is delivering packages while being high on weed. Leo deliverers a package containing 10 bricks of high quality cocaine to the wrong apartment number. Two smalltime hoods Brody Mike Epps and Guch Wood Harris open the box and find a gift from heaven. They immediately arrange to sell the coke to Brody's drug dealer cousin for 150000. In the meantime Jesus Cisco Reves tries to track down who got his package before the drug kingpin Bodega Diablo Emilio Rivera notices that his drugs are missing. Unfortunately time has run out and Bodega is in town and he is furious that his shipment is lost. Bodega will get his drugs back or heads will roll. During the same time Brody and Guch are about to complete their drug deal with Guch's cousin. They are on a collision course with destiny because they are about to have company knocking at their door. My Comment This is a funny movie about a package shipping company and the things we think they do to our packages before we get them such as opening packages and taking watches or other items out and throwing packages around in the truck before they are delivered to us. The real companies try not to do these things or they would be out of business. But it is a lot of fun watching some of the things they do in this movie. Mike Epps and Wood Harris are just great as two inept criminals. The bank robbery at the beginning of the movie should win the stupidest criminal award this year. The movie is a little slow at the beginning but it picks up by the end. There is a moral to the story don't do or sell drugs. Summit Entertainment Run Time 130 Rated R710".

Mos Def also surprised me at how funny he could be. The Latin chick although served her purpose as the eye candy acting could have been a lot better.

The movie is both thrilling and funny although it is a bit off center and someone's thumb gets cut off which was not needed. The movie's final showdown also wears the movie down. It is a very good movie though. The movie is only about 90 minutes but it would of been nice if it was 75 minutes because that final bloody shoot out was not needed. The movie is still very recommendable and the cast is topnotch. The movie has a lot of laughs and still makes room for a lot of thrills.

And while you have glimpses of violence here and there it's more a comedy than anything else.

Plus it seems more coherent than some other gangsta movies though that does not mean that much now does it. The actors at hand try very hard and sometimes convince and are quite funny.All in all the action and the thin plot move forward nicely enough. Nothing great but OK. And while you have glimpses of violence here and there it's more a comedy than anything else. Still the ending might throw a lot of people of for being so different than anything we would expect from a movie like that. But then again maybe that's exactly what we wouldshould expect ...";

I suppose after having seen enough of these kinds of movies I shouldn't expect perfection in how every plot thread is tied up since very few movies manage it. However what the movie does excellently is setup the plot and build up the situation perfectly. Just starting as a literal man on a ledge we see subtle layers added until we get this full on crescendo of diamond heists negotiators cops convicts bad guys good guys all happening on in a single block in New York. So given that you're willing to suppress your tingling plothole sense it can be an enjoyable movie.The cast is quite good and the acting and tension is par for the course. The leads Sam Worthington and Elizabeth Banks do a great job. Seeing Worthington as an exNY cop exconvict and Banks as a negotiatorpsychologist with a past is surprising on paper but they manage to pull it off very well. However Jamie Bell is one of the heistteam but his opposite who plays Angie make for some cringeworthy comedy like some Sofia Vergara slapstick in the middle of a tense situation. Ed Harris looks emaciated but equally sinister as the villain and there are a host other minor NY characters.I can hear the Hollywood pitch for the movie in my head it's like The Negotiator combined with The Italian Job but happens in NY and instead of a hostage situation we have a jumper. And essentially it's just that  a movie that heavily recalls other movies from the past except perhaps for the man on ledge. On a side note it seems that every NY movie nowadays has a reference to the OWS movement and what a typical OWS protester might look like.The movie is at its best when it clamors for our hero who desperate and is fighting all odds to clear his name as he shouts from his ledge I am innocent and this is my retrial. The movie is at its worst when it's ungainly roping in all the plot threads it cast out but can't seem to put it together. Overall it's a good enough movie for people who like these kinds of movies. If you've caught yourself bitterly berating the many plot holes in heist movies maybe this isn't for you.".

Elizabeth Banks Zack and Miri Makes A Porno seems to be cut from the cloth of a Tea Leone sans the raspy voice.

The movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It manages to hold you on the edge of your seat. There are several turns and twists. Plus it's the guy from Avatar Sam Worthington who plays a former cop now fugitiveExcon Nick Cassidy. Never seen him in anything else just Avatar 3 times. He's sexy and believable. His Australian accent did come out a few times but on the whole it was endearing. The only thing he takes off is his jacket and the ledge. Most of the movie takes place entirely on a N.Y. Manhattan 21st floor hotel ledge. The crowd notices and YEs we have a JUMPER. I loved the crowd scenes I wished there were more close ups on some of the screaming dialogues. There were great characters in the crowd News team and your typical goodbad cops Swat and Tactical teams. Oh yes the fire department. The cast was well chosen. Ed Harris played the sinister millionaire perfectly. God he's good. Jamie Bell plays our leads' brother...Joey Cassidyhe's awesome too. He tricks and worries us several times throughout the film. His partner in crime Kyra Sedgwick plays Suzie Morales his girlfriend with a past is beautiful for all you straight men especially when she's in her undies and their dialogue is total comedy slapstick. I loved them I totally laughed and wanted to see more. Elizabeth Banks the police psychologist was perfect also in every way. The movie does not have any major violence or profanity but the heist is exciting. I liked it and would see it again.".

But know that this was a real thriller. The music set this thriller apart from others. It was fit in exactly the write places. The cinematography was also a real plus for the film. As the audience we were constantly reminded how high up Cassidy was from the rest of the crowd.There were some negatives however. Banks by no means was terrible in this movie. But they could've done a better job casting for the part. I actually think Worthington's Avatar cast mate Michelle Rodriguez would've been perfect for the role. Other than that this wasn't the most original script. There were a fair share of cheesy barbs between Joey Bell and Angie Rodriguez.Speaking of Genesis Rodriguez wow. I mean damn she's hot.

Elizabeth Banks is as dull as dull can be talking to a negotiator like that makes you want to jump off the ledge instead. Other betterstaged heist films would see MAN ON A LEDGE and laugh their ass off.MAN ON A LEDGE is essentially is a man who tries to prove his innocence there's a plot within a plot he makes the world think one situation while another related situation is happening at the same time. The interaction between the negotiator Lydia Mercer Banks and Nick Cassidy Worthington is underdeveloped. The only great performance in this film is by Ed Harris and even he couldn't save this ship from sinking. The way the film plays all sides is uneven and it's so obvious about it.

	schema:reviewBody "I knew when I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't going to see something like Dog Day Afternoon or The Bank Job but I at least hoped for something that would entertain me rather than insult my intelligence. Unfortunately it was not to be.The movie is about a cop Nick Sam Worthington who is wrongly convicted of stealing a diamond and framed by crooked cops and an evil multimillionaire played by Ed Harris. To set the record straight he breaks out of prison gets new clothes from a safe house goes to Manhattan and checks into a hotel and then goes out onto the ledge of the hotel so that everyone below will think he's trying to kill himself. This of course is just a diversion so that his brother and his brother's girlfriend can quietly slip into the building across the street to find the diamond he was accused of stealing. Simple right?Now here are just a couple of plot holes that I noticed. First are we to believe that a cop just happens to have a younger brother who has a girlfriend who are both seasoned cat burglars who know how to cut the right wire to deactivate the high tech alarm shimmy through elevator shafts and foil a high tech heat sensor? Wow that is awfully convenient. Second at the end when he jumps off the building without looking below mind you onto an inflatable mattress he walks away without a scratch? Really? Third when he finally confronts Ed Harris at the end after surviving his fall he simply knocks Ed Harris down and takes out the diamond and waves it in the air. And this is supposed to bring the cops that have been chasing him all day to a halt? And then because of this they swarm on Ed Harris. What does that prove. He waves a diamond in the air so he must be innocent? That can't be another diamond. Of course not. All the cops on the ground know is that he's broken out of prison and has attempted suicide and now has attacked a big shot millionaire. What does waving a diamond in the air prove? By the way Ed Harris' character is a Trumplike figure wouldn't he have more security around him? Also why would they take the time to frame Sam Worthington's character by cooking up the whole stolen diamond thing? Wouldn't it be easier to just kill his character rather than frame him? Of course these are only a few plot holes that I have shared here. I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton more for example the dad popping up at the end. What was that? And whose funeral were they at? And how was that planned? So do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.".

Unfortunately it was not to be.The movie is about a cop Nick Sam Worthington who is wrongly convicted of stealing a diamond and framed by crooked cops and an evil multimillionaire played by Ed Harris. To set the record straight he breaks out of prison gets new clothes from a safe house goes to Manhattan and checks into a hotel and then goes out onto the ledge of the hotel so that everyone below will think he's trying to kill himself.

You usually don't expect to see fine acting in action movies but she gives a great performance as a tough ballsy woman in a man's job who is tormented by a tragedy she couldn't prevent.

It's a solid basic suspense story with a few twists lots of clichs but they work in movies like this! the inevitable forgivable plotholes and a happy ending for most of the characters.

For example there may well have been an internal investigation into the events of the day. But that's not relevant to this story so of course they didn't go into it. Noone cares Ledge is not a movie to make you think or an exploration of any serious burning issue in life.

	schema:headline " Man on a Ledge 2012 review";
	schema:reviewBody "You can say this much about Asger Leth's 2012 crimethriller Man on a Ledge it really is about a man on a ledge.ExNew York City cop Nick Cassidy the always watchable Sam Worthington has just escaped from prison after doing two years for a crime he didn't commit. After masterminding the breakout that sets the movie in motion he winds up at Manhattan's famed Roosevelt Hotel dines on an apparent last meal of champagne and lobster calmly opens a window and climbs out onto the ledge of the building's 21st floor.Hold on stop the presses! A crowd of gawkers inevitably forms on the streets below eagerly waiting for Nick to take the plunge into oblivion. But things become complicated when it's soon revealed that there may be a lot more to Nick's scheme than a mere death wish. When New York City's finest arrive on the scene to try to talk him down he insists on only talking to a disgraced alcoholic police negotiator named Lydia Mercer Elizabeth Banks whose troubled character appears to be a nursing a hangover  because Nick believes that they both have something in common with each other in that they both know what it's like to have the whole world turn its back on them just when they needed help the most.That's just the first of many whoppers in a movie that has many and never really ceases to surprise as far as whiteknuckle Hollywood thrillers go and Man on a Ledge in its own uniquely preposterous way earns the title of a genuine whiteknuckle thriller that keeps you watching  no matter how preposterous things may seem  and thoroughly on the edge of your seat.Nick's plan isn't just a mere spectacle to garner media attention to help prove his innocence but it's also doubling as a carefully orchestrated heist of a 40 million diamond belonging to corrupt hotel mogul David Englander Ed Harris that also involves his younger brother Joey Jamie Bell and Joey's cheeky main squeeze Angela Genesis Rodriguez. And as the movie progresses Lydia and her skeptical former partner Jack Doughtery Edward Burns begin seeing for themselves the holes in the official story regarding Nick's presumed guilt by the courts and soon find themselves fighting on his side along with him as well.Man on a Ledge does have a bit of contemporary relevance going on during its proceedings with its script that was expertly authored by Pablo F. Fenjves. Immediately following the revelation of Nick's plight and the assembling of the masses down on the street 21 stories below him the movie sort of becomes a modernday take on Dog Day Afternoon 1975 with Nick becoming a parable of the socalled 99 a class I gladly fall into as well as a modernday folk hero.

He delivers an engaging and riveting performance here just like he did in other noteworthy Hollywood productions like Terminator Salvation 2009 The Debt 2010 and my personal favorite of his so far Avatar 2009. I personally loved watching him in those movies.Even though I was unsure of his character's exact nationality in this movie I would hazard a guess that he's Irish? I'm only saying this because of how he would sometimes slip from an American English accent into an Aussie one in between line readings. Yet while he may not be the most dramatic performer out there he's at least highly engaging and watchable and is always good at portraying the true Everyman his Avatar director James Cameron said he's the type of guy you could definitely have a beer with after a hard day of work and you could quickly become the best of chums. This last part is especially why he's one of my favorite performers of the moment  despite any bad raps he gets for his acting performances.Man on a Ledge is a movie that no matter how ridiculous its many plot twists and Big Reveals may seem is a movie that kept this viewer thoroughly on the edge of his seat. To me that's really all that matters here.810".

	onyx:emotionText "You can say this much about Asger Leth's 2012 crimethriller Man on a Ledge it really is about a man on a ledge.ExNew York City cop Nick Cassidy the always watchable Sam Worthington has just escaped from prison after doing two years for a crime he didn't commit. After masterminding the breakout that sets the movie in motion he winds up at Manhattan's famed Roosevelt Hotel dines on an apparent last meal of champagne and lobster calmly opens a window and climbs out onto the ledge of the building's 21st floor.Hold on stop the presses! A crowd of gawkers inevitably forms on the streets below eagerly waiting for Nick to take the plunge into oblivion. But things become complicated when it's soon revealed that there may be a lot more to Nick's scheme than a mere death wish. When New York City's finest arrive on the scene to try to talk him down he insists on only talking to a disgraced alcoholic police negotiator named Lydia Mercer Elizabeth Banks whose troubled character appears to be a nursing a hangover  because Nick believes that they both have something in common with each other in that they both know what it's like to have the whole world turn its back on them just when they needed help the most.That's just the first of many whoppers in a movie that has many and never really ceases to surprise as far as whiteknuckle Hollywood thrillers go and Man on a Ledge in its own uniquely preposterous way earns the title of a genuine whiteknuckle thriller that keeps you watching  no matter how preposterous things may seem  and thoroughly on the edge of your seat.Nick's plan isn't just a mere spectacle to garner media attention to help prove his innocence but it's also doubling as a carefully orchestrated heist of a 40 million diamond belonging to corrupt hotel mogul David Englander Ed Harris that also involves his younger brother Joey Jamie Bell and Joey's cheeky main squeeze Angela Genesis Rodriguez. And as the movie progresses Lydia and her skeptical former partner Jack Doughtery Edward Burns begin seeing for themselves the holes in the official story regarding Nick's presumed guilt by the courts and soon find themselves fighting on his side along with him as well.Man on a Ledge does have a bit of contemporary relevance going on during its proceedings with its script that was expertly authored by Pablo F.

And yes there were still quite a number of viewers  mostly women. I believe the problem is that people get worked up on the main character and get to dislike her strongly then reflecting this on the film as a whole. Which of course is not fair but maybe understandable. So if you want to see a marvelous well made well photographed and even well written film with an intriguing plot  this will be it. If you want to agree with all moves of the main characters and seek harmony happiness and want to relax  just stay away. My boys for instance hated 'Gegen die Wand' for the lack of happy ending and the pain the main characters live through. So does this mean that we Germans have an affinity to 'difficult' plots? including our GermanTurkish compatriots in 'Wand' Maybe. What makes the film less understandable  but very much more realistic  is that it is based on a true story. So why complain? The Carola character has her flaws and gets stuck between wanting to Europeanise the Massai life and adapting to their customs. Which in itself would render enough material for several films. The Massai accept her but are also stuck with their traditions  what else would you expect. But this film is not about how this dilemma can be solved  it is about Carola and Lemalian  and if you come to think of it two very brave characters no matter how they behave in detail. They existed!!! And the film gives you an opportunity to partake in their torment. Just take this as ONE possible outcome and ponder on the potential and possibilities such a setting can offer.

This movie is about love cultural differences and hard facts of life. It is very romantic but also heart stopping in the struggles for cultural understanding.The movie does not strictly follow the story of the book but makes a good job of squeezing the essentials into a 2 hour movie. The tensions the hardships etc are well caught much thanks to good acting performances.I really miss a lot of information in the movie. E.g. how was her relation with other people in the village especially with Mama in the same hut. Also there is often a lack of explaining what other people in the tribe thought of her actions. Some cultural differences are quite insufficiently covered e.g. how her way to talk to other men contributed to the jealousy of her husband. Many of the hardships in the book are also left out in the movie.What is truly great about the movie and the story is that her failures are not hidden. Its not a movie about that the native life in Africa is so hard for a sane westerner to live. The sacrifices made from both sides are vast from their cultural positions and values but still they are not sufficient to bridge the gap in so many issues.It is a really good movie. I recommend it to anyone. Ignore the other whining comments here. The movie does a good job if not perfect fitting the story into a 2 hour movie. The cultural differences are there to see and think about even if some things were left out.".

The acting is topnotch as well as the cinematography.However it seems that there are inaccuracies between the title the character Lemalian and the story between Maasai and Samburu people. Both are seminomadic indigenous that lives in Kenya and Maralal is located within the Samburu District but they are people totally distinct from each other. Lemalian speaks English and the Maasai are also educated in this language supporting the title of the movie. But Lemalian mentions in Nairobi when he goes with Carola to the Immigration Department that he is a Samburu murran warrior and he is illiterate what is a contradiction. The screenplay writer did not do his homework he should be more careful while writing about a true event and make a research. Unfortunately IMDb censorship did not accept my original review and I needed to rewrite removing the references to the Wikipedia that gave a better explanation to this contradiction. Despite this inconsistency this movie is engaging and highly recommended. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A Massai Branca The White Massai".

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent movie just received a standing ovation at its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Good oldfashioned storytelling with the drama of severe to the point of seemingly unsurmountable cultural conflict wrought out by strong acting from the relatively unknown leads. When Carola a Swiss woman as palewillowy and Teutonic as they make them vacationing with her boyfriend Stefan is smitten at first sight with Lemalian a Masai warrior she decides to follow her heart. As a viewer one feels part of the scene drawn into Carola's frame of mind experiencing her alternate euphoric connection with Lemalian and the strain of coming to terms with a culture and indeed even a man who despite their love is unlike what she is accustomed to.A warning for the squeamish there are several scenes of traditional Masai customs that while not brutal will at least make you cringe and avert. The film is based on an autobiographical book that was a huge bestseller in Europe. While I haven't read the book and cannot vouch for the film's accuracy its realistic tone is never in doubt. There are no saccharine contrivances about the culture gap or simplistic portrayals or any other false notes.In fact between the taut performances sweeping cinematography of the Kenyan countryside keenly observed detail of daily life and the pitchperfect score The White Masai almost has an epic feel to it.".

As a viewer one feels part of the scene drawn into Carola's frame of mind experiencing her alternate euphoric connection with Lemalian and the strain of coming to terms with a culture and indeed even a man who despite their love is unlike what she is accustomed to.A warning for the squeamish there are several scenes of traditional Masai customs that while not brutal will at least make you cringe and avert. The film is based on an autobiographical book that was a huge bestseller in Europe. While I haven't read the book and cannot vouch for the film's accuracy its realistic tone is never in doubt. There are no saccharine contrivances about the culture gap or simplistic portrayals or any other false notes.In fact between the taut performances sweeping cinematography of the Kenyan countryside keenly observed detail of daily life and the pitchperfect score The White Masai almost has an epic feel to it.";

No wildlife just goats and cattle seemingly nothing to read no one with whom to communicate except the odd visit to another woman in the town and a hostile pastor. It is so far from comprehensible that I viewed the film with increasing incredulity. Yes the scenery was wonderful but African is so much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand why people gave this film such a high rating. Ah OK I know it's all about romance. Well i like movies about love and romance. movies which cause that warm feeling around your heart and almost make you cry. But Die Weisse Massai is not quite about romance in my opinion. It certainly was intended to be but what came out is a movie about naivety and ignorance. So instead of a warm feeling around my heart i had to chuckle to myself all the time and couldn't await until the obvious happens. Spoilers from here on Let me introduce you to the story. A woman from Switzerland comes to Africa for holidays with her boyfriend. They meet an attractive Massai warrior who she falls in love with. After he helps them out of a dangerous situation and the both spend some time with each other she is determined to stay in Africa follows him to his village and they merry. After the romantic start the obvious problems begin. All of them are based on the culture clash. He is a Massai warrior and comes from a society where women count nothing. And she is a modern woman who tries to fulfill herself. He realizes that her mentality is different from what he is used to in his area and even allows her to open a shop. Soon he becomes jealous because from his standpoint it looks like she is flirting with her customers she is looking straight into their eyes and is smiling at them. He accuses her of cheating several times until she can't stand it any more and leaves him.I am aware that some women might admire her because of her bravery leaving home for an adventurous life in the bush with a mysterious stranger. For me it's just pure ignorance and naivety. In my eyes this relationship could have even worked if her husband wasn't the only one who makes concessions. There was so much she could have done. Take that driving scene for example where he crashes the car. Why didn't she just try to teach him driving when they were alone so that he wasn't ashamed of others watching his wife teaching him. Yes this might have been a very difficult task because of his ego but hey it's a challenge. Or take the jealousy. All she had to do is not to smile at her customers. She could have even try to teach him how to run a business. In the circumcision scene she did as if she never have heard about it before. And what did she expect? That there is a hospital at every corner?All those small things show how naive err i mean how much in love she was when she changed her life. It makes her character look like another ordinary ignorant white woman from the west coming to the beautiful beaches of the third world to roast herself in the sun.This movie might become interesting from another point of view. You can see it as a metaphor for the problems between the civilized west and the developing east third world. the west always tries to change the east but when difficulties arise the west flees back to his sheltered world leaving the east suffering.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having just finished reading The White Masai in paperback I waited in anticipation of getting the DVD from the local library albeit with some trepidations knowing that film adaptations of books don't always follow true to the written work. That is certainly the case with this one. Firstly why the change of names of the characters in the book  from Corinne to Carola Lketinga to Lemalian Napirai to Sarai etc? Everyone who has read the book will know the characters anyway no matter what their names are. Also there seem to be some vital points in the book that were not depicted in the movie. The novel extensively describes how Corinne's physical health was greatly affected from having to live in nearprimitive conditions with nil in basic amenities like proper drinking water and sanitation tropical diseases and inadequate diet. Doesn't it seem incongruous that in the movie this doesn't seem to be the case with Carola  she emerges from the hut cum loveshack each day fresh as a newlybudded rose skin aglowing  hair shining like gold in the morning sun? She merely appears to be in a reality TV tour group rather than having assimilated herself into the tribe. It would certainly have helped to have a Westernized educated Samburu character to help bridge the communication gap between Carola and Lemalian which in the book would have been James Lketinga's brother. That said the bottom line that both book and film raise is can two people of contrastingly different cultures live together in harmony and genuine affection? How much is one prepared to sacrifice in the name of love? The film is aware of all these questions but does not give a definite answer  it all remains up to the viewer to put himselfherself in the heroine's shoes and ask would I have done the same as Carola? Would I give up all the creature comforts of life that I've known and been accustomed to and live in woopwoop with a man I hardly know from a totally alien background? While the movie does portray nonwhites in a more positive light than other movies with a similar theme it continues the long history of inequivocal relations between whites and blacks in general and it concludes that the Africans have been and always will be culturally inferior to whites. Even though the film is sympathetic to the Samburu people and evidently shows how naive and clueless as far as cultural sensitivities go with Carola it's telling her side of the story. It would be very interesting indeed if the movie would be remade from Lemalian's point of view but alas that is just a pipe dream.".

She exudes intelligence in her approach to the character she is playing. Jackie Ido on the other hand is somewhat stiff. Never having seen anyone of the actors before we approached the film with an open mind knowing full well the limitations Ms. Huntgeburth must have encountered while filming in such a primitive setting.The White Massai will stay in our memory for quite some time.".

It was her loves to this man from a totally different culture a warrior that made her decide to live in such a Godforsaken place so far from her former reality. This Swiss woman who had owned a shop in Switzerland sold her store and then after some time thought she could best help her new husband's people by opening a shop herself and selling wares to the people in the surrounding areas. However she really had no feeling for what her husband was going through losing face for having his wife work as well as being able to drive a car which he thought was so easy to learn until he ran the jeep against the tree. One can at times sees that she is not very sensitive to the cultural issues regarding tribal life and position and this makes this relationship quite tense. On the other hand one can see that the African man makes quite a bit of effort to understand her and ease her way into his world even though he is not so aware of her upbringing and needs.Perhaps reading the book would give more insight to their other trials and tribulations. However I will have to say that I will now read the book and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It makes one think if two people from diverse cultures ever have a chance of survival.

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard of this movie I must admit that I have not known much about it. First I have not read the novel by Corinne Hofmann. Moreover there are no famous names of cast that would draw my attention. What called my interest was Africa the continent that has not been very popular in movies but so attractive in itself together with both its beauties as well as its difficulties. I saw some movies about this continent including The African Queen 1951 by John Huston and Nirgendwo in Afrika 2001 by Caroline Link. Therefore I went to see Die Weisse Massai expecting that I would equally like this movie. What were my feelings about it after leaving the cinema? The film surprised me as very good in some aspects and average in some other ones. The film does a very good job in one theme  it accurately shows the culture clash that is doomed to appear in the situation it shows. A Swiss woman Carola Nina Hoss goes to Kenya accidentally meets a Massai warrior Lemalian Jacky Ido falls in love and begins to live with him in harsh conditions almost unbearable for any European. At first it seems that love will conquer all difficulties and differences but in the long run the situation does not occur to be as simple as that. Everything is O.K. or Alles in Ordnung becomes a slogan that has nothing to do with the true situation...The first problem turns out to be sex with this man  he is deadly selfish and treats love between a man and a woman as an act of pleasure for man only. Carola teaches him how to love her...and it goes in the right direction but sex occurs to be not everything particularly in such a relationship. Soon she says The longer I live with him the less I understand him and not only kisses make a problem... So what makes the problem? Almost everything lifestyle traditions social behavior treatment of important matters in life and of course malefemale relations. I liked the way the movie showed this  Carola does not realize how difficult it is to live with Lemalian at first but gradually. When she sees how young girls are treated in the tribe she feels petrified and disgusted... yet there is nothing she can do as the Pastor says. This is the way they have been living for hundreds of years! What right do we have to change them? When she opens the shop it gradually brings serious problems since relatives don't understand how it should work. Why? Because she saw the business reality in a Swiss way and wanted to adopt it among the Massai  this adopting of culture by force was best presented in the shop sequence or when Carola allows Lemalian to drive. Finally the most serious problem Carola has to cope with is when her husband accuses her of betraying him with other men. She smiles at male customers in order to be nice. Her husband sees this as flirting... SPOILER Nevertheless the two scenes that I very much disliked were when Lemalian accuses the Pastor for making love to his woman and when Lemalian says to Carola that some rotten remains went out of her body. These were highly out of good taste! But generally speaking the film is an accurate presentation of the problem. People who think that malefemale love will do for everything should see this movie. There is another advantage of this movie  the true African reality. We see the cities the landscape the markets the real core of African life. The movie is mostly shot in Africa which makes it exceptionally authentic. Some scenes filmed in the beautiful landscape of Kenya are fabulous. We not only see the real African inhabitants but also hear their language. Moreover there is a lot to be found about their customs and traditions sometimes obscure habits but customs that have a right to be respected. This all provides a viewer with a chance to see the real Africa on screen. In this case I must mention the moment when Carola travels by bus a woman by her side asks her for the destination of her journey. The reaction to Carola's answer... for us such a behavior is vague but African people find this absolutely normal.The performances are fine. Nina Hoss does a very good job as a woman who is driven to do something by her desires and gradually realizes how difficult it is to live in such a reality. She gives a very appealing performance and feels the role straightly from the beginning to the surprising end. Jacky Ido is good as Lemalian a Massai warrior and a European woman's lover. But here a mention must be made of many African people who behave very naturally before cameras and make the film highly authentic.Finally there is however one problem about the movie  its totally predictable content. I watched the film and almost knew what would come later. It is easy to predict the behavior of such a woman. They are all very similar in what they do not to offend anyone at first see sex and then open their eyes and realize difficulties. Then they don't get used to harsh living conditions and give up this life. Yet the consequences do not disappear automatically... Therefore it appears that there is nothing that may conquer cultural conflict nothing  not even true love.All in all in spite of some drawbacks of the film THE WHITE MASSAI WOMAN is a nice psychological insight into culture clash. But even if you are not particularly fond of the story I still recommend you to see the film due to the authentic Africa. Besides the performance of Nina Hoss is exceptionally memorable. You will surely like something about the film. Worth looking for! 710".

	schema:reviewBody "As a white woman who was once involved with an African man I'm always a bit skeptical of these Jungle Feverlike movies. I was very pleased to discover there isn't a huge emphasis on titillation. The director could've easily made it more salacious. Interracial couples are more than just their contrasting skin colours or fodder for the sexual fantasies of others.I wasn't surprised by this woman's difficulties in the small remote Kenyan village. One could predict she'd face all those obstacles and more.I was surprised by how many of the reviews suggest her problems were her fault or that there is ANY reason for the husband's actions. No matter what the nationality of my various past boyfriends and current husband none of them would ever conduct themselves like that towards me and live to tell about it wink nor would they desire to do so. My African boyfriend was a model of civility and respect for women. Indeed every man I've been involved with has been the embodiment of the term integrity. Men who behave in insulting unjust much less violent ways towards women or anyone really aren't worthy of my consideration.It's not that I don't get why the dynamics between the two lead characters causes some conflict within the framework of the society in which they live. It's just that at some point some things are just right or wrong. Making false accusations especially against someone you profess to love is unconscionable. There is no excuse for his behaviour. Comparing his outrageous behaviour to her naivet is ludicrous! This man like soooooooooooo many around the world it seems is so infantile and weak he feels he must brutalize a woman to make himself feel better. ...Pathetic.Still I generally liked Lemalian Jacky Ido until he fell from grace. I was surprised by Carola's decision not to adopt more of the local customs as well as her ultimate decision at which point the movie ends. I could still see ways the two could work beyond their cultural differences especially since both had so generously tried to understand the other's point of view.In all honesty I found the couple's attire differences to be jarring especially in more urban settings. I fully expected one or the other to start dressing more alike. With the very traditional Masai garb juxtaposed against modern women's clothing I surprised myself with how much I noticed this contrast throughout the film.In all I enjoyed this movie most because it is alleged to be a true story. I think it wouldn't be either as believable or engaging if it were fictitious. I would recommend it as a video rental for an easygoing Sunday afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a really well filmed movie. The acting ranges from average to very authentic. I wonder how they managed to film some of the settings and how much the Massai way of life was disturbed by the film crew's visits. In any case on a technical level it is well produced. The message is the problem of this film. Ostensibly the film is a romance failed between western civilized white Swiss woman and eastern uncivilized black African man. They start off passionate but soon come the inevitable cultural clashes. In every circumstance the white woman reacts as a westerner would and not surprising  how else should one be expected to act?. What IS surprising is that we see the Massai husband attempt in every circumstance to accept or even adopt the ways of his wife. He fails almost every time but man did she find an understanding man to marry. He even goes so far as to cut off his precious warrior hair a symbol of his manhood so that she will be more pleased with him. The fact that he loses patience lashes out or accuses her of infidelity should come as natural as his ignorant wife steps over his cultural taboos repeatedly. But he manages to stifle letting his anger out fully because he loves her. Even his tribe accepts this woman who arrogantly assumes her ways upon them. Now I would have had no problem with these developments had the movie been completely neutral or sided with the Massai more clearly the Massai were far more patient with her than she with them. But this film seems to side with the white woman and subtly justify her decision to leave country and take their daughter with her leaving her husband disgraced and now childless. We are asked to sympathize with her and while we should we are not asked to sympathize with the Massai. What a wasted opportunity. The film gets 4 points for technical prowess but none more because of the story!".

The film is also unsuccessful in realistically depicting the internal thoughts and emotions of Carola's character when introduced to such a foreign lifestyle.

	schema:headline " Interesting film depicts ultimate cultural clash";
	schema:reviewBody "An interesting German film based on a true story about one Carola a Swiss woman touring Kenya with her boyfriend who is suddenly smitten by a tall slender Masai tribesman named Lemalian. She astonishes her fianc by deciding to stay in Kenya and look for Lemalian. Eventually she founds him among his people living off the land as subsistence farmers and decides to settle with him despite the obvious hardship of living there especially for someone coming from the highly developed world. They eventually marry and they have a daughter but the obvious cultural differences take a toll in their relationship.It might be hard to enjoy this movie if you expect the main character to be likable. As portrayed in the movie Carola is quite immature she is initially smitten by Lemalian when they dance sensually in a club. Clearly the only reason she was attracted to him initially was purely sexual. At times she looks both naive and arrogant one has the sense that if she has decided to live among the Masai she should have to be more accommodating to Masai cultural mores. For instance she is completely outraged when one of the girls in the tribe is circumcised as if she had never heard about this widespread costume before. When they open a shop that sells basic stuff to the tribe she arouses his jealousy by smiling to the male customers. And in the shop she also refuses to give credit to anyone despite the wishes of her husband ignoring a tribe's intricate kin relations. Lemalian's motivations are not very well explained in the movie he is something of a blank he doesn't understand why his wife cannot be more accommodating to Masai culture and at the end one fells a bit of a pity to him though not one forced him to marry Carola.Overall I found this film to be very interesting and entertaining. A very nice photography that shows both the pretty and seamy side of Kenya helps the movie a lot.".

	onyx:emotionText "An interesting German film based on a true story about one Carola a Swiss woman touring Kenya with her boyfriend who is suddenly smitten by a tall slender Masai tribesman named Lemalian. She astonishes her fianc by deciding to stay in Kenya and look for Lemalian. Eventually she founds him among his people living off the land as subsistence farmers and decides to settle with him despite the obvious hardship of living there especially for someone coming from the highly developed world. They eventually marry and they have a daughter but the obvious cultural differences take a toll in their relationship.It might be hard to enjoy this movie if you expect the main character to be likable. As portrayed in the movie Carola is quite immature she is initially smitten by Lemalian when they dance sensually in a club. Clearly the only reason she was attracted to him initially was purely sexual. At times she looks both naive and arrogant one has the sense that if she has decided to live among the Masai she should have to be more accommodating to Masai cultural mores. For instance she is completely outraged when one of the girls in the tribe is circumcised as if she had never heard about this widespread costume before. When they open a shop that sells basic stuff to the tribe she arouses his jealousy by smiling to the male customers. And in the shop she also refuses to give credit to anyone despite the wishes of her husband ignoring a tribe's intricate kin relations. Lemalian's motivations are not very well explained in the movie he is something of a blank he doesn't understand why his wife cannot be more accommodating to Masai culture and at the end one fells a bit of a pity to him though not one forced him to marry Carola.Overall I found this film to be very interesting and entertaining.

Of course she was always going to be extremely challenged in embarking on such a risky and impetuous liaison with a Massai warrior and attempt to embrace the culture of her husband without putting her own values on the culture in which she found herself and attempting to apply those values. The relationship for me seemed to start to disintegrate when she attempted to become an independent woman in such a society and relegate her proud husband to almost a subservient role when she established the shop. Also this enterprise seemed to introduce alcohol into the equation without her even realizing that would come with consequences. I suppose I would like to hear the story as told by her husband to attempt to get some balance in this story. The sudden relationship problems and his suspicion of her taking a lover all seemed to be attributable to her steadfast determination to change the culture of the tribe and assert her female independence about which she was warned well before she entered into the relationship. Having said that I did enjoy the story for what it was and the insight into such an African tribal culture was very interesting but ultimately not surprised at the outcome. Perhaps she was fortunate that she was able to take her daughter back with her as it would seem to me that it could easily have turned out to be quite different. Whether that is going to better for the child in the long run is one of the unanswered questions to come out of this movie".

The stars are great totally believable. Ms Hoss has the looks of supermodel Lauren Hutton Nina Hoss is very beautiful stunningly attractive the Masai male as portrayed by Jacky Ido very handsome.

	schema:reviewBody "Die weisse Massai or The White Massai is a German movie from over 10 years ago and mostly known today because Nina Hoss plays the title character and she has turned into quite a star recently especially in the United States. Well star may be a bit much but she has appeared in some highprofile films and series that most German actors can only dream of. The movie here is written and directed by Hermine Huntgeburth who adapted Corinne Hofmann's novel for the big screen here. The film makes it past the 2hour mark and tells us about a Swiss woman who travels to Africa and falls in love with a local tribesman. She decides to leave everything and everybody behind for that even her boyfriend who she has been with a long time.Almost the entire two hours is about her and how she not tries to adapt to life in the Massai tribe. The strict regulations especially in terms of gender roles constantly clash with her personal identity and also her selfconfidence as the modern woman she has been so far in life. It really is a 180 turn for her. Will it work out regardless in the end. Watch for yourself. This is by no means a perfect film and there is a weakness here and there yet the solid script and strong acting especially by Jacky Ido who you may know from Tarantino's World War II movie makes this one worth a watch. The good outweighs the bad overall in my opinion and I recommend watching it. Thumbs up for Die weisse Massai.".

Also the title White Massai is misleading since this woman does close to nothing to become a part of the Massai community. Even travel journalists sometimes put clay in their hair or sit down with the village women but Carola was to busy creating her own world there.Lemaian is not only a Samburu warrior first of all he is a huge male ego walking on two legs. With Carola's stubbornness and impractical ambitions the clash of civilizations was largely the clash of opposite sex and the clash of two egos.As we observe the development of their relationship we are reminded of some important aspects of sex such as foreplay female orgasm and cuddling after to which some men in many cultures may not pay enough attention. Also thanks to affection in the relationship Lemaian shows that he can be a caring and clever man it is a beautiful lesson to be learned. Sadly there are also certain contradictions in this character he is a respected warrior and goes to town more often than others yet he seems very naive and weak when confronting men from his family tribe. It is really annoying.But as I said you don't have to like nor understand the characters to enjoy the movie. It is really well shot and the landscapes are stunning.

	schema:reviewBody "I marvel at how simple this movie is. It's a romance but there's no villain there's no kissing there's no skin shown. Yet I was at the edge of my seat over whether the hero and the heroine would get together. The incidents have no fantasy no action chase scenes no amazing settings just everyday life at a seaside town a boarding house and a school. It reminds me of Ocean Waves another Ghibli movie that I absolutely adore. In comparison the average Hollywood romantic movie seems so loud and garish. The actors and actresses in typical Hollywood romcoms are the cartoons not these animated people I've grown to care about in the span of an hour and a half. What are comparable movies? In the Mood for Love from Hong Kong and Scorsese's The Age of Innocence. I'm in love again.".

	schema:headline " Gor Miyazaki finds amazing form. A great addition to Studio Ghibli's filmography";
	schema:reviewBody "Gor Miyazaki returns after his 'not so impressive' Tales from Earthsea in 2006 with a wonderful adaptation of Tetsuo Sayama and Chizuru Takahashi's 1980s manga. After gaining negative reaction including winning the 'Worst Movie' and 'Worst Director' awards in the 2006 Japan's Bunshun Raspberry Award many have been apprehensive towards Gor's next project. This criticism has certainly hurt Gor reputation but it all seems too critical. Many seem to forget that Tales from Earthsea was his directorial debut and with his father being the great Hayao Miyazaki it was always going to be tough for Gor to make a spectacular first impression. However From Kokuriko Hill is a fantastic addition to Studio Ghibli's strong filmography and certainly proves Gor Miyazaki has enough cinematic and animation knowledge to work under the prestigious banner. It's charming funny and refreshing after the constant magical and fantasy approach of the studio and Japanese animation in general. The story takes place in Yokohama in 1963 where we follow HighSchool student Umi Komatsuzaki. She looks after her grandmother younger brother and sister whilst completing the housework. Each morning she raises her 'Safe Voyage' flag and heads to school. After witnessing a stunt by the 'Culture Club' Umi meets Shu a fellow student who is 'secondin command' of the club and Shirou the President of the Student Council. It is this new found friendship and relationship between Shu and Umi which builds and matures revealing an intertwining background and charming romance. Alongside this characterdriven story is the struggle occurring between the highschool and the various students of the 'Culture Club'. The dilapidated building filled with history and memories is being threatened to be demolished. It's up to the students to convince the 'adults' that their creation and interests are preserved. Written by Hayao Miyazaki and Keiko Niwa the story is realistic and historic in theme. Gone are the cutesy magical monsters and characters as well as the environmental commentaries Studio Ghibli is best known for. Instead From Kokuriko Hill deals with the 'Rise of PostWar Japan' and the incoming Tokyo Olympics. The film certainly creates a fitting atmosphere. Shots of Japan's growing exporting and importing industries office businesses and the hustle and bustle of Tokyo clearly indicate the modern transformation of the country. We also experience the tragic nature of the Korean War and the impact on families and friends. The story also focuses on the widening gap split between traditional Japanese culture and the modern business age. It was during this 'miracle' period where Japan looked forward rather than back and the contest between the 'school' and the 'students' dramatise this theme. The contrast between the old buildings and industries of Yokohama and the trains cars of Tokyo symbolise the changing ideologies and philosophies of the nation.While it may sound very mature when compared to previous Studio Ghibli's films it still deals with adolescents in a adult world like Nausicaa and Laputa. However whilst magical characters and mysticism connect with the imaginations of children From Kokuriko Hill uses its highschool environment and the sincere pure nature of childhood relations to connect with younger audiences. It's the characters that help with the portrayal of the story and the bring these environments and themes to the screen. And they are fantastic. While not as memorable when compared to the likes of Chihiro Spirited Away and Totoro My Neighbour Totoro they still possess enough personality and charm for the audience to care for them. We are introduced to various different students all whom have different personalities. However the film focuses on the main characters of Umi and Shu and therefore unfortunately leads to other characters not being fully explored or developed to the same extent. Umi is beautifully portrayed and developed. Her calm mature exterior hides her damaged background. We experience the loss of her father and the growing pressure and responsibility she has gained with her mother studying abroad. Meanwhile the strongwilled charming personality of Shu also obscures an uncertain background that becomes clearer with the relationship with Umi. Gor and the writers have carefully constructed the characters and story achieving a steady pace that allows for a deeper exploration into From Kokuriko Hill's world. The film looks amazing. After the spectacular animation of the previous Studio Ghibli production Arrietty The Borrower it would seem impossible to top the artistic achievement of that film. However From Kokuriko Hill manages to. With its detailed interiors and sublime visual portrayal of Yokohama and the coast its simply jawdropping to see the painstaking animation artistic competence and talent that was involved in creating such an beautiful film. Clever sequences of animation liven up dull scenes like climbing stairs as the 'camera' constantly follows the characters rather than having still 'shots'. Alongside the fantastic animation is the soundtrack which is brilliant as always. Satoshi Takebe mixes longflowing orchestral pieces with lively jazzlike tunes like those of Kiki's Delivery Service. It all adds personality to each scene without overpowering or distracting from the visual nature of the picture. Aoi Teshima 'Summer of Farewells' is a fantastic theme song that remains in the memory well after the end of the film. Overall From Kokuriko Hill is a wonderful piece of animated cinema that certainly shows Gor Miyazaki growing talent. Not only is it a beautiful work of art and song but it's a triumph in storytelling and character development. While it isn't as memorable as the likes of My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away and moves away from the magical essence of Studio Ghibli it is still is impressively constructed and directed. And with the unfortunate inevitability that Hayao Miyazaki Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki won't be around forever it is reassuring that young artists and directors are successfully proving themselves as the future of Studio Ghibli. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment Up on Poppy Hill opens scans its world in photographic panorama and takes you into an ordinary Japanese kitchen where earlyteen Umi is preparing a meal you sense that this will not be like any Miyazaki film that you have ever seen. Still present is the flawless Studio Ghibli animation but all traces of fantasy are gone. Instead the film grabs your heartstrings and won't let go. It's a simple enough story neither harrowing nor heartbreaking but its telling is so rich and enveloping that you're quickly as close to it as if you were on the back of a careening bicycle with Umi.  Young children will be entertained by the wonderful animation and may have questions to ask about the differences between how Umi lives her daily life in 1963 Japan and how they themselves live. Anyone older than about nine will grasp the full depth of the story and will enter it through its richness and detail. If you are empathetic at all your eyes will be wet from recognition and often enough from joy. See this film and hope for more like it from the new Miyazaki generation. Note This review is for the Englishdubbed nonsubtitled version that opened in Los Angeles in late March 2013.".

	schema:reviewBody "After having seen Goro Miyazaki's Tales from Earthsea I didn't have quite high expectations from this. Goro proved me wrong this time by creating a calm sweet and tender anime. Hayao Miyazaki is the screenwriter and I was quite surprised that he moved away from his supernatural themes containing gods and flying castles choosing to write something realistic. Yes this realistic part is the heart of the entire film and it works so lovingly.Ghibli once again captures the audience with beautiful animation and a captivating score. The film successfully recreates the 60's world with meticulous details. Each and every character is energetic whether heshe is the action or just the part of the action. As the film is about saving the school's clubhouse we can feel that these teens really are trying to save it and you forget it's an animated film. Most of these characters are quite inspirational... The film is not epic or dazzling like teen oriented movies actually are. It's a simple nostalgic experience.In conclusion another simple and heartfelt film from Ghibli that you can enjoy with your friends and family. A good film for a relaxing weekend Drop by my facebook page httpswww.facebook.comfilmsthemostbeautifulart".

	schema:reviewBody "The newest Ghibli film which is already out on video overseas but will not play theatrically in the U.S. until March of 2013 is the second from Hayao's son Goro after the somewhat disastrous Tales from Earthsea. This one is definitely a success. It's a smaller Ghibli film more along the lines of Only Yesterday Whisper of the Heart and Ocean Waves. In fact it's probably most closely related to Ocean Waves in that it's about teenagers and their relationships. It's quite a bit better than that one though. The story revolves around a group of teenagers in Yokohama trying to save their school clubhouse from demolition. The story takes place in the early 1960s and their clubhouse is slated to be destroyed to make way for an Olympic stadium of some sort. The two main characters are Umi and Shun. Shun is one of the leaders at the clubhouse. Umi kind of falls for him and comes up with the idea to pretty up the clubhouse in order to impress the politicians hoping they'll move onto another site. The story is very small and simple but it's utterly charming. The artwork is truly stunning and the music by Satoshi Takebe is gorgeous. I doubt Disney will open this one wide but they are planning on giving it a modest Oscar campaign so unlike Arietty which would have easily won the award last year this should definitely get a nomination.".

	schema:headline " traditional 2D animation has plenty of juice";
	schema:reviewBody "Not all Japanese anime is the pow bang of giant robots fighting. We're familiar with whimsical often supernatural stories from Miyazaki and others and also the strong environmental themes that pervade much of Miyazaki's work. Then there's the shoujo subgenre aimed at preteen to teenage girls which tends to have female leads romantic subplots and resolutions involving personal growth. It seems to me shoujo substantially overlaps with anime that emphasize nostalgia and childhood. The Studio Ghibli anime Only Yesterday not distributed in the U.S. by Disney and hence perhaps not as well known was in many ways a pioneer in this subtype of anime.From Up on Poppy Hill the most recent Studio Ghibli fare is definitely a shoujo. It's directed by a Miyazaki too ...but not the Miyazaki. Hayao Miyazaki is officially credited as the writer and seems to have been intimately involved. But the actual director is his son Goro Miyazaki. Father and son share a strong preference for the traditional handdrawn style of 2D animation over detailed and beautiful background paintings. I found the result quite charming. It's less realistic and actionpacked than the 3D fare we usually see but more imaginative. This story is much calmer and slower and less frenetic than our usual fare something I found refreshing.Despite the placid surface the story is in fact quite intricate even suspenseful. Although not edge of your seat manipulative it definitely pulls you into the story and makes you continually wonder what's next?.Although released in Japan well over a year earlier the English version was released in the U.S. only in March of 2013. The distributor for this release is GKIDS which is not a name I'm familiar with.Disney made an agreement with Studio Ghibli nearly twenty years ago which suggests they have distribution rights over much of the globe for most Studio Ghibli products. The agreement has been amended a number of times in private and its exact terms are not known to me. It's had two important results for U.S. audiences First there's now a strong tradition of no cuts what Studio Ghibli animates is exactly what we see with no fiddling in an editing room. And second Disney has gotten us used to very high quality English soundtracks. In fact the quality is often so high that even anime connoisseurs who don't actually speak Japanese often prefer the English audio rather than the Japanese audio with subtitles. The traditional rule of thumb dubs suck has been modified to dubs suck except animes handled by Disney.Given that agreement and its recent history one would expect Disney to distribute From Up on Poppy Hill in the U.S. too. But in fact although Disney remains the international distributor in much of rest of the world it is not involved in U.S. distribution of this film. Most likely Disney chose not to exercise its rights in the U.S. either because Goro Miyazaki's previous effort was critically panned or because some of the themes of a typical shoujo entirely unremarkable in Japan are considered incompatible with Disney's image in the U.S. Another possibility is the agreement covers works directed only by Hayao Miyazaki himself not other Studio Ghibli directors. This seems unlikely to me ...although to be honest I really don't know for sure. But even though Disney wasn't involved this time the tradition was respected. The English audio is very high quality even to the point of translating entire songs not only for solo voices but even for a whole chorus. The voice acting is top notch the sync is perfect and considerable effort has been expended on translating idioms and slang from one culture to another.My local theater apparently scared either by the odd distribution or by Goro Miyazaki's previous reputation scheduled it on their teeny tiny art house screen. But there were lots of viewers of all ages and they seemed to like what they saw. It's definitely worth watching.".

The voice acting is top notch the sync is perfect and considerable effort has been expended on translating idioms and slang from one culture to another.My local theater apparently scared either by the odd distribution or by Goro Miyazaki's previous reputation scheduled it on their teeny tiny art house screen. But there were lots of viewers of all ages and they seemed to like what they saw. It's definitely worth watching.";

	schema:reviewBody "From up on Poppy Hill is a deserving addition to the Ghibli library. It's sweet small and relatable. The mangabased script is written by Hayao Miyazaki himself while his son Goro is directing this time. Poppy Hill is slightly different from the more known Ghibli films in the fact that it takes place completely in the real world and there's not even the slightest hint of anything supernatural. It makes it a different kind of film so I would recommend placing your expectations outside the TotoroPonyoSpirited Away territory. Once you settle into the setting the movie offers a good time the characters are colourful especially the philosophy guy he was hilarious! and relatable and the simplicity and down to earth feel of the story prevents the film from getting out of hand. The romance doesn't feel forced in any way and there are many heartwarming moments. By the end I was just smiling and left the theater with a warm feel inside.The movie has some issues that keep it outside of greatness status. The animation isn't bad but certainly not the level we've come to expect this might be partly because the film was in production when the 2011 tsunami hit so it's understandable. The story takes a while to get going and also I found the music almost interrupting at times. I wonder how the sound mixing went because at times the music felt almost too loud.But in the end Poppy Hill is a very enjoyable film. It takes a while to get going but it gives it the advantage of getting better and better as it progresses.Recommendation For Ghibli fans and newcomers alike From up on Poppy Hill offers a heartwarming feelgood film that will bring a smile to your face. Definitely worth seeing".

From Up on Poppy Hill is not quite one of Ghibli's finest like Spirited Away Princess Mononoke Grave of the Fireflies Castle in the Sky and My Neighbour Totoro but it is better than PomPoko and Tales from Earthseaboth are worth watching but I only consider them decent movies. Even with the rushed ending and a twist that is a touch too cheesy From Up on Poppy Hill is still a charming film. As to expect the animation is fantastic with the beautiful colours and ethereal backgrounds still evident. The music is also wonderful it does have a pleasant lilt to it and at times reminds me of the score from Kiki's Delivery Service. The song Summer of Farewells is one of my favourite theme songs of any Ghibli. The story is one of the studio's most realistic and it still has the heart and charm you'd expect from a Ghibli film especially in the middle if not quite the depth of Grave of the Fireflies for example. The script has a nice balance of humour and poignancy it doesn't have My Neighbour Totoro's whimsy but again From Up on Poppy Hill didn't strike me as the kind of film Totoro was and the characters are likable and engaging throughout. Overall charming heartfelt and very likable Studio Ghibli may have done better but to me seeing as I have enjoyed and most of the time loved their films I don't take that as a bad thing. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Tales from Earthsea I wasn't expecting much from this film although it had garnered some positive feedback. Goro Miyazaki had already shown us that he didn't share his father's magical touch creative ingenuity and ability to tell timeless stories. That being said I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Though to be fair the story was written by Hayao Miyazaki so at least part of the film's quality can be attributed to him and not his son.Still Goro Miyazaki DID direct this film and with it he proves that he actually has some promise as a film artist. This is a delightful little film about young love willingness to endure through hardship and the importance of trying even when it seems pointless. It's a story told well with beautiful animation identifiable and likable characters and many scenes that have stuck with me since then. The story of two young people in love and all the obstacles in their way is one that has been told countless times but the version of this film is one of better ones I've seen. It's not flamboyant neither is it too sweet or too clinical rather it feels real. Sure it's a bit extraordinary like a good story should be but it still feels like I could learn something from it.So yes the story and the characters are the best part of this film for which we have to thank pappa Miyazaki but I liked the contributions of the son as well. The atmosphere the mood of the film the feeling of midcentury Japan the way all the characters interacted with each other. As stated before it all felt just extraordinary enough to catch our interest but not too much so that it became unbelievable.Though in retrospect I cannot say that I felt like I had seen something groundbreaking when I walked out of the theater. It is a fine movie by all accounts and Studio Ghibli can be proud to call it one of theirs but it lacked that certain spark that all great films have. In that one singular aspect this film just wasn't all that extraordinary. It doesn't mean that you should see it though far from it. It's a film with heart feeling and passion. It has cheer humour and melodrama to spare and it will make you feel good like a family film should.".

	schema:headline " A breezy enjoyable film lacking the detail and depth of Ghibli's finest";
	schema:reviewBody "Such is the greatness of Ghibli's backlog that each new release cannot hope to escape comparison with the old favourites. It has now been a full decade since the last truly great movie from the studio 'Spirited Away' and nine years since the last purely enjoyable one 'The Cat Returns'. All movies since had their moments but their uneven quality whether it was a fullfledged fantasy like Howl's Moving Castle 2004 or more sedate affairs like last year's The Secret World of Arrietty 2010 did not make it easy for Ghibli's devoted following to love them unreservedly. Miyazaki Hayao's son Goro made his debut with Tales from Earthsea 2006 which wasn't received very well prompting some to question whether Ghibli's future would be secure after Miyazaki Senior's inevitable final retirement. From Up on Poppy Hill is Goro's second feature and while it is an accessible and enjoyable effort it lacks the kind of profound detail and nostalgia that made Only Yesterday 1991 and Whisper of the Heart 1995 so special. Set in Yokohama Japan just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics Poppy Hill tells the story of Umi a secondyear high school girl who lives and works at a tenant house run by her grandmother. Her father was a sailor who was lost at sea during the Korean War and presumed dead her mother is studying in the US and thus also an absent figure for Umi. Every morning she raises signal flags out on the garden which overlooks the ocean as a way to remember her lost father before embarking on a daily routine rigidly structured around school and the chores she must perform at her home. One day she runs into a reckless dashing senior named Shun and soon allows her life to open up to the optimism and energy of the teen idealists who occupy Quartier Latin a dilapidated school clubhouse where the more intellectuallydisposed male students have set up various headquarters for their extracurricular activities. Umi helps out Shun with his newspaper printing and ends up fighting alongside him and the occupants of the clubhouse to save Quartier Latin against the forces of change which holds sway in Japan. Meanwhile unforeseen revelations about their families' past force Umi and Shun who are increasingly drawn to each other to reconsider their feelings. The realworld setting and smallscale drama of Poppy Hill place the film in that category of the more contemplative and tranquil Ghibli animation alongside Only Yesterday and Whisper but it doesn't come close to joining the two in the pantheon of the studio's most beloved hits. What those two movies did was to depict the everyday routine and the smallest trivial action with the same affection and wonder not to mention painstaking detail as it did flying dragons and wolfgods Ghibli treated things like sharpening a pencil or coming home after school like they were the most special things in the world deserving of care and skill and attention  only we don't realize it. Only Yesterday and Whisper continue to resonate with their audience because they endeavoured to draw fantasy not from the outlandish but from the mundane the normal the everyday. They stand apart from the roleplaying wishfulfillment of countless animes and the likes of Harry Potter and The Matrix and suggest in their inimitable tender way that we should treasure the lives we lead now that they deserve the same kind of longing and wonder and hinted at worthwhile fulfillment within real means.Sadly there's no such transcendental detail and affection in Poppy Hill nor the kind of daring whimsy which so invigorated classics like My Neighbour Totoro 1988 and Kiki's Delivery Service 1989. Thematically it's cookiecutter safe despite the fact that the postwar Japan about to begin a miraculous industrial rise would seem to be a rare and ripe backdrop for a more tellingly contextual study of a time of great change in Japanese society and the place in it for the young people and their environment that are drawn so handsomely in the film. There's great energy in Miyazaki's depiction of the students fighting to save the clubhouse due to make way for a more modern building and the period detail of rural Yokohama as well as more briefly Tokyo in the throes of transformation is nicely realized and easily the best thing about the film. However Miyazaki stops well short of dealing with the teen wouldbe activists and what they really represent a poignant reminder of a lost generation of young Japanese idealists who ended up conforming to the overwhelming preponderance of materialism and political stagnation which came to define the rise of a new Japan in the Seventies and Eighties and who would never again manage to bring to bear the sort of vigilant activism displayed in Poppy Hill. Its breezy style is more reminiscent of The Cat Returns but while that film was a concentrated distillation of the usual flight of fancy the studio specialized in and was aimed to literally take the audience on a short thrilling ride 'Poppy Hill' would have benefited from a more patient and intricate approach. There's certainly enjoyable setpieces like the girls cleaning up the dungeonlike school clubhouse which hitherto had been the exclusive domain of boys or Umi going about her daily routine of grocery shopping and cooking for the students tenanting at her grandmother's house but Miyazaki doesn't seem to have the confidence or patience to linger on each scene and let us observe what implications a country in transformation have on Umi we just watch her get into one brief situation after another few of which are compelling in plot or presentation and then the film is over. Poppy Hill is certainly a diverting fare endearing in places and easy to like but it is in no way a return to form for the studio and small improvement for the wouldbe pretender to Miyazaki Senior's throne.".

Characters are very believable and follow some patterns that make us think ah I know someone just like that!. Animation is beautiful of course.

	schema:headline " Relaxing and promising";
	schema:reviewBody "This was probably the most expected anime I've ever anticipated so far. After becoming addicted to Japanese animation and Ghibli production Kokurikozaka Kara was a logical next choice. And so after a whole year of waiting it arrived on to my doorstep. Impressions? Very positive.I haven't read the original Manga on which the story was based and thus I had no idea what to expect. This was actually a good thing since the surprise would eventually be that much bigger. My first impression was the classic almost idealistic portrayal of past times which is often present in some Ghibli's movies. Though a bit exaggerated at times it is very pleasant to see and feel. I personally like better the elder days when people weren't obsessed with money technology when time and life had a different meaning. The same could be said for love  During the last three decades or so cinematic expression of love has been equaled with pornography with relationships becoming more and more rough sexual. It seems modern directors value big boos tight booties and French kisses better than the very essence of love  that plain old emotion. This applies to all film genres including animation. Well that emotion is what really matters when love between two people gets around. It's true the Japanese have come up with the very concept of modern sexual bizarreness but none the less they know very well how to distinguish that from the idea of romance.Kokurikozaka Kara tells a romantic story of two young people whose faiths become suddenly and unexpectedly intertwined. Umi a kind girl from a small coastal Japanese town carries a constant memory of her departed father. She knows he is gone for good but deep within her soul she hopes that one day he will send her a sing. The war has ended some 20 years a go Japan is still trying to change and adapt to a new way of life while Tokyo prepares for it's first Olympics. Young people the generation born after the war are in the midst of all this turbulence and it looks as they might hold the key. Umi meets a pleasant and yet mysterious boy named Shun. Their lives and feelings become closer as the two start spending more time with each other. Soon they will both discover a strange connection between faiths.You could call From Up on Poppy Hill a simple story. No big flashes and spectacles in this anime and that's exactly what makes it so pleasant to experience. It's a slice of life poured into 90 minutes of enchanting Ghibli animation. Very refreshing both for the eyes and soul. Many say that Kokurikozaka Kara isn't a classic Hayao Miyazaki tale. Indeed it isn't but I don't think that changes a thing. Old man Miyazaki has proved his talents so many times by now. This is Goro's second major accomplishment and as it seems he's gradually forming an artistic expression of his own. And yes it feels that something is missing a bit of that magic sparkle maybe but excellence as we know doesn't come over night. There is still a long road in front of Miyazaki junior and if From Up on Poppy Hill shows where such road might go I'm more than confident that many great animated flicks are yet to arrive bearing a Ghibli signature.".

After becoming addicted to Japanese animation and Ghibli production Kokurikozaka Kara was a logical next choice. And so after a whole year of waiting it arrived on to my doorstep. Impressions? Very positive.I haven't read the original Manga on which the story was based and thus I had no idea what to expect. This was actually a good thing since the surprise would eventually be that much bigger. My first impression was the classic almost idealistic portrayal of past times which is often present in some Ghibli's movies. Though a bit exaggerated at times it is very pleasant to see and feel. I personally like better the elder days when people weren't obsessed with money technology when time and life had a different meaning. The same could be said for love  During the last three decades or so cinematic expression of love has been equaled with pornography with relationships becoming more and more rough sexual. It seems modern directors value big boos tight booties and French kisses better than the very essence of love  that plain old emotion. This applies to all film genres including animation. Well that emotion is what really matters when love between two people gets around. It's true the Japanese have come up with the very concept of modern sexual bizarreness but none the less they know very well how to distinguish that from the idea of romance.Kokurikozaka Kara tells a romantic story of two young people whose faiths become suddenly and unexpectedly intertwined. Umi a kind girl from a small coastal Japanese town carries a constant memory of her departed father. She knows he is gone for good but deep within her soul she hopes that one day he will send her a sing. The war has ended some 20 years a go Japan is still trying to change and adapt to a new way of life while Tokyo prepares for it's first Olympics. Young people the generation born after the war are in the midst of all this turbulence and it looks as they might hold the key. Umi meets a pleasant and yet mysterious boy named Shun. Their lives and feelings become closer as the two start spending more time with each other. Soon they will both discover a strange connection between faiths.You could call From Up on Poppy Hill a simple story. No big flashes and spectacles in this anime and that's exactly what makes it so pleasant to experience. It's a slice of life poured into 90 minutes of enchanting Ghibli animation. Very refreshing both for the eyes and soul. Many say that Kokurikozaka Kara isn't a classic Hayao Miyazaki tale. Indeed it isn't but I don't think that changes a thing. Old man Miyazaki has proved his talents so many times by now. This is Goro's second major accomplishment and as it seems he's gradually forming an artistic expression of his own. And yes it feels that something is missing a bit of that magic sparkle maybe but excellence as we know doesn't come over night. There is still a long road in front of Miyazaki junior and if From Up on Poppy Hill shows where such road might go I'm more than confident that many great animated flicks are yet to arrive bearing a Ghibli signature.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second movie based on the manga of the same title drawn by Chizuru Takahashi and written by Tetsur Sayama in 1980 from Studio Ghibli directed by Miyazaki Goro son of the renowned animator and director Miyazaki Hayao after his debut Tales from Earthsea still interesting for me although the story is a bit confusing received mixed to negative reviews. But that was his past and as a result after he tried to prove himself that he can made the better film finally his From Up on Poppy Hill received Japan Academy Prize for the Best Animated Feature Film in 2011 and also it was the highestgrossing Japanese film in 2011.About the story Focusing on the story about youth's life experience between two high school student from Konan Academy High School Umi and Shun it takes place in a harbour town Yokohama in 1963 one year before Tokyo Olympic Event in 1964 which marks the starting point for Japan's people to rebuild their future after they lost many things because of war including their beloved peoples hopes and memories.It is presented in a more simple and understandable way compared to the another Ghibli's realistic movie with the same genre Whisper of the Heart and Only Yesterday the first story arc is about protecting the clubhouse called Quartier Latin from demolition by the student protests led by Shun and the second is about Umi and Shun's relationship and also the truth about their past. Although the emotional depth is not as much as presented in Whisper of the Heart and Only Yesterday it still provides such a nostalgic and heartwarming feeling for the audiences who watch it.About the art Nothing more to say that Ghibli's art is great. From Up on Poppy Hill is no exception. The old clubhouse Quartier Latin Coquelicot Mansion Konan Academy High School and the harbour view of Yokohama are made beautifully and detailed representing enough the situation of Japan before Tokyo Olympic Event in 1964 especially for the younger and foreigner audience. This makes a strong point for the movie.About the characterdevelopment The characterdevelopment is not as strong as Whisper of the Heart and Only Yesterday. It's a mediocre and seems forgettable but still maintained enough especially thanks for the two main characters Umi and Shun.About the music Another strong point which makes this movie is enjoyable to watch. The jazzy soundtrack composed by Takebe Satoshi mostly fits the atmosphere of the story. Teshima Aoi who previously sings Song of Therru in Tales from Earthsea once again provided her voice to sing the main theme song of this movie Sayonara no Natsu Kokurikozaka Kara which is the 2011 version of the same title without Kokurikozaka Kara words sung by Moriyama Ryoko in 1976. The famous Ue wo Muite Arukou or more commonly known as Sukiyaki outside of Japan which sung by Sakamoto Kyu also presented in this movie as the insert song and played twice in the movie.About the voicerole Wellexperienced enough and pleasant altough I feel that the voice of Kazama Shun is a bit mature for his high school appearance. Some of the seiyuus from the previous Ghibli's movie reprised their role in this movie for example Okada Jun'ichi voiced Prince Arren in Tales from Earthsea Hiiragi Rumi voiced Chihiro in Spirited Away.In the end I personally enjoy watching this movie. It creates such a nostalgic and heartwarming feeling which what I want to say that's the main strong point of this movie. If you want to look for an anime movie with those criterias From Up on Poppy Hill is the good one.".

I'm also a fan of the lessfantastical ones like Only Yesterday. So it was with great interest that I watched From Up On Poppy Hill directed by Goro Miyazaki with the help of his dad and the rest of the Ghibli family.Don't expect a film with talking animals or magic. Poppy Hill is a simple coming of age story set in a mid60s Japan that is reemerging from World War II back on to the world stage. In it is a young girl sounds familiar who attends school cares for boarders in the family boarding house and mourns a father she hardly knew. Her routine is interrupted by a handsome young man who seems more obsessed with saving the school clubhouse from ruin than with adolescent love.I can see how the gender roles in this movie can be a little jarring. The boys play sports form clubs and hold raucous debate while the girls tend to home and hearth and fawn after the handsome ones with shrill voices. The first time you see girls entering the clubhouse is to kick off a mass cleaning. Ultimately I let it go as the cultural nature of things in 1960s Japan.There are two real stars to this movie First is the clubhouse. I wish I knew more about student life in Japan so I'd have more cultural context. Suffice to say the clubhouse seems to me to be where children can learn things outside the highly regimented educational system. In it the chemistry club sets off foulsmelling reactions much to the chagrin of the journalism club and the sole member of the philosophy club and the whole building is characterized by chaotic youthful energy. At the beginning it is on the verge of collapse and scheduled for demolition as if it were saying I'm too old for this s. As the movie progresses we see it regain its former glory as a house for learning and a sanctum for its students.The second is the music. Ghibli films are frequently scored by Joe Hisaishi but Poppy Hill is scored by Satoshi Takebe. The music transitions from a lovely opener about cooking breakfast to two awkward teenagers sharing an umbrella to the wonderful cleaning sequence in the clubhouse. I don't speak Japanese so a lot of the lyrics are lost on me but I still really enjoy how it sets the mood.Poppy Hill isn't perfect and might not even crack the top half of all Ghibli films. It doesn't have the strongest plot and the surprise twist at the end seems to be some sort of relationship Deus Ex Machina than anything meaningful. The love story gets rather awkward for some of it as well but it doesn't ruin the movie. In the end though Poppy Hill is still a beautiful experience and a treat to watch. I'll be sad when Hayao Miyazaki makes his last movie but I'm excited to see what work his son can do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Compared to Miyazaki Goro's debut film Tales of Earthsea 2006 Kokurikozaka kara is a film much better made perhaps because the script is written for the film itself by Miyazaki Hayao whereas Tales of Earthsea was adopted from a novel. The story revolves around adolescent romance between a strong independent girl named Umi who takes care of her family's lodging business while her mother is away and her father having passed away from the war and Umi's upperclassman. Umi falls in love with Shun a boy admired by all the girls in school because of his audacity but just as Shun and Umi's feelings are about to blossom into something more Shun finds out a secret that prevents him from having any romantic feeling for Umi. As the secret seemed like it would turn the movie into a big melodramatic mess taken straight out of a Korean drama I was slightly disappointed half way through the film. However being Studio Ghibli of course it wouldn't end on a tragic note but also for that reason the ending felt rush and that something was missing. I find the movie still enjoyable though despite its cheesy twist because of all the period humor and the nostalgia it brings. The middle segment where everyone was involved in rebuilding the clubhouse was very enjoyable with a lot of humor and inspiration. Graphically it was beautiful and the soundtrack couldn't have been more appropriate. This is not one of Ghibli's best but given time Miyazaki Goro hopefully can continue in his father's footstep and bring us more great films to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite Japanese anime movie. It's a personal feeling that whenever I need some motivation towards the everyday life I watch this movie. What attracts me most about an anime movie is how reality is portrayed in these movies. And how the beauty of nature is shown in these. The story line of the movie is very beautiful and interesting. Even though these are just drawings the emotions portrayed by the characters reach my heart every time. It's like I am watching a liveaction movie instead only much more beautiful. For the original title I would give 10 points. However for the English dub only I have given 8. I like the movie with the Japanese language and English subtitles. The English voice overs are just so boring and dull. The lead male voice is so slow and boring as if he doesn't have any interest in anything in his life. And the female lead voice is way to faster compared to the original. The emotions thus do not reach my heart when I listen to the English dub. I wish they would have had selected better voice artists.Anyway my most favorite animation movie is From Up on Poppy Hills".

	schema:reviewBody "From Up on Poppy Hill is all about looking to the past and seeing if something is ahead in the future that will stay the same or not as case usually turns out to be. There are really two stories in what is kind of a simple story that completely lacks anything really to do with fantasy  there's one dream sequence but it would probably look the same if it were live action  though that's not any kind of negative persay. The film takes place in 1963 and is about the concurrent stories surrounding young Umi Rachel Bolger in the English version and Shun Anton Yelchin as they discover newrevealing things about their respective paternal lineages and some drama about whether their local school uh center or something full of every department imaginable like a giant complex will be torn down or not.This is also all in light of the upcoming 64 Tokyo Olympics which was a major deal at the time signifying a corner turning for the Japanese people following reconstruction in the postwar years. The film's co written by Hayao Miyazaki and directed by his son Goro and the whole tone of the film is very sweet and gentle and sometimes funny in that way that catches you off guard with Ghibli works a lot of it comes with some of the goofydopey moments inside of the giant extracurricular schoolplace and it has something to say about the nature of looking to the past and trying to hold on to a certain image. For the teens at the core  who of course fall in love because it's that time of their lives and they are both nice caring people and that's good to see genuinely no really  they sort of acknowledge that this is almost a soaplike melodrama that's unfolding regarding new news about who their fathers might be all from a picture that Umi has and knocks Shun for a loop.I wondered though if simply acknowledging it was enough the last 15 minutes of the film spins the wheels even more about who is really who and new revelations come and some suspense comes for Shun to find out news that is onetimeonly or not at all. And yet this is still more compelling all of the character stuff between Umi and Shun than the storyline involving the school and what is basically the respectable version of the save the Rec Center plot from dance flicks no really think about it if you see it. I didn't care about that story despite some colorful side characters and wanted to get back to the emotional core of this young couple that is shown very simply as becoming more attracted to one another but in a purehearted sort of way it's Ghibli so the romance is chaste  which is good considering the reveals that come around! I keep coming back to the word 'sweet' but there's no other word for it really it's nowhere as sad as the recent When Marnie Was Here but it has a similar take on the real world and how people look to the past to reconcile things that they can or cannot change. Also subtlety is the key thing with the characters how seemingly simple the reactions are at first but once you get keyed into them you see the animators doing little things to make them more endearing and heartrending. I just wish Poppy Hill had a little more meat to its other story and as it is it's so light that it's like a feather ready to blow off your finger. But since it's from one of the two or three giants in studio animation it's all the same a pleasure to watch albeit one that I see isn't necessarily a repeatviewing".

	schema:reviewBody "After having watched Jambareeqi's review for this film I was intrigued to see it. Whilst browsing the Channel 4 website I saw that this was showing on Film Four today and this was my very chance of seeing it. As I watched this film it offered me more than I expected and while the first half hour ran at a brisk pace the film started to drag on from the middle.The animation is consistent in terms of its style fitting in with that from Hayao Miyazaki's films and had sharp colouring subtle humanistic movements in particular characters cleaning cooking and raising flags and great uses of lighting and celshading but it was a little choppy and slow in places. The backgrounds were beautifully designed and reminiscent of those from 'Ponyo' with regards to the sea. Another positive about the animation is that the character's clothes hairstyles particularly Sora's and vehicles are true to the style of the 1960s. Not only did the story include its basic premise of high school students protesting against the demolition of a club house but it also included dramatic family matters such as Shun revealing he is actually Umi's adoptive brother when she suspects he doesn't love her and Umi's mother telling the moving story of how Shun got adopted. Although I'm not a fan of soap operas such as 'EastEnders' and 'Coronation Street' these family issues did remind me of a typical soap opera dilemma and it was interesting to see them in animated form. While this film has several realistic elements the most fantastical part was Umi's dream of her wandering against a sunsetlit background and crying when she was little and when she is older her father comes home. This dream sequence had the perfect balance of fantasy and reality because it was executed as a vivid dream and it nearly reduced me to tears. One weakness with regards to the story is that it has a lot of filler that slowed down the second half considerably until the announcement of the clubhouse not being demolished. Despite the filler and the uneven pace the ending was more steadily paced and was not as abrupt as I anticipated. The music was unique for the film's animation style and fitting for its setting and I especially liked the jazzy pianoled pieces. The songs were quite nice as well especially the one playing during the ending and the closing credits  it was beautifully written as well. Although the version I watched was in its original Japanese language with a hint of unrecognisable Russian as the TV announcer on Film Four stated the voice acting was expressive and a lot of the dialogue was engaging which was helped a great deal with the English subtitles. While the dialogue is mostly dramatic the funniest part of it was when Shun was referred to as a live wire then it was questioned if he was the electrician's son  that subtle joke certainly raised a chuckle. Despite the weaknesses with the pacing filler and somewhat inconsistent animation quality this is the most lifelike Studio Ghibli film I have seen to date and it makes a refreshing change from the studio's more fantastical films. I would also like to see the English dub for this to see how it compares to the original Japanese dialogue. 810.".

The leader of the protests against demolition is a boy named Shum and as the story progresses they grow closer until Shun makes a discovery that may force them to end their relationship before it has really begun.I must say I really enjoyed this film it may be true that not a huge amount happens and there is no real antagonist but to me that is part of its charm. The characters are a delight to watch and utterly believable. This is especially true of Umi in the opening scene we see that she practically runs her home doing the cooking and looking after the others while her mother is away. As one would expect from Studio Ghibli the animation is good and the backgrounds are absolutely stunning with incredible detail this was particularly true for the club house interior which felt almost real. While this is a slice of life drama there were some nicely amusing moments as well as some poignant ones. If you've enjoyed other Stidio Ghibli films especially 'Whisper of the Heart' which this most resembles I can heartily recommend this although the story might not appeal to younger viewers due to its slower pace and lack of real action.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a remote area of war time Scotland of the 1940's this is a beautiful and moving film that features an extraordinary performance from Phyllis Logan as the courageous young wife desperately looking for meaning in a barren isolated lifestyle. Her escape from a cold and uncaring life with her husband is touchingly portrayed although the illegal relationship with Italian prisoner of war Luigi always appears problematic. The scenery is incredibly vivid and raw and the story told humanely and realistically. What I loved most about this film was its lack of cheap sentimentality and the understated deep emotion of the story. All actors are excellent in their support of the undoubted star. 10 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Set in a remote area of war time Scotland of the 1940's this is a beautiful and moving film that features an extraordinary performance from Phyllis Logan as the courageous young wife desperately looking for meaning in a barren isolated lifestyle. Her escape from a cold and uncaring life with her husband is touchingly portrayed although the illegal relationship with Italian prisoner of war Luigi always appears problematic. The scenery is incredibly vivid and raw and the story told humanely and realistically. What I loved most about this film was its lack of cheap sentimentality and the understated deep emotion of the story. All actors are excellent in their support of the undoubted star. 10 out of 10.";

Set in the north of England it concerns a liaison between a local girl and an Italian prisonerofwar. The gentle romance the knowledge that she will be subjected to the disapprobation of her family and the locals adds to the buildup to the inevitable sad conclusion. It is a lovely story shot in black and white in bleak conditions capturing the impossibility of a tender relationship doomed by the circumstance of war.

I've never seen Lon look more handsome or give a more delightfully charming performance completely free of his usual heavily theatrical mannerisms and amateurish delivery.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fun bit of fluff about a group of college students and their various pursuits such as rigging the competition for 'The Joe Senior Contest' which determines the most popular boy in school attempting to win an intercollegiate athletics competition and getting the girls or boys of their dreams. Two of the stars Creighton Chaney later changed to Lon Chaney Jr and Arthur Lake went on to become respectively The Wolf Man and Dagwood from the 'Blondie' series of movies.I liked this movie a lot more than I expected to. Despite its age it's interesting to see that some things about being a college student haven't changed all that much. I chortled out loud in surprise at a scene between two pals Bobby and Spec in which they lament that Larry 'is the most popular man in class with the babes'! I didn't know they used the term 'babes' in this sense in 1936! This remark was so 'BillandTed'ish I was half expecting one of them to exclaim 'Dude!' in fact Spec and Bobby even look a bit Bill and Tedish one shaggyhaired and blonde and the other darkhaired and gormless.Includes a few corny songs around a piano which you will either love hate or merely tolerate BUT which are notable for one in which we actually get to see Lon Chaney Jr sing! The Wolf Man sings? Brill! Chaney is also at the youthful top of his condition physically and is actually quite a hunk! Recommended as an hour spent in pure escapist fun with a cast of likable characters.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a fun bit of fluff about a group of college students and their various pursuits such as rigging the competition for 'The Joe Senior Contest' which determines the most popular boy in school attempting to win an intercollegiate athletics competition and getting the girls or boys of their dreams. Two of the stars Creighton Chaney later changed to Lon Chaney Jr and Arthur Lake went on to become respectively The Wolf Man and Dagwood from the 'Blondie' series of movies.I liked this movie a lot more than I expected to. Despite its age it's interesting to see that some things about being a college student haven't changed all that much. I chortled out loud in surprise at a scene between two pals Bobby and Spec in which they lament that Larry 'is the most popular man in class with the babes'! I didn't know they used the term 'babes' in this sense in 1936! This remark was so 'BillandTed'ish I was half expecting one of them to exclaim 'Dude!' in fact Spec and Bobby even look a bit Bill and Tedish one shaggyhaired and blonde and the other darkhaired and gormless.Includes a few corny songs around a piano which you will either love hate or merely tolerate BUT which are notable for one in which we actually get to see Lon Chaney Jr sing! The Wolf Man sings? Brill! Chaney is also at the youthful top of his condition physically and is actually quite a hunk! Recommended as an hour spent in pure escapist fun with a cast of likable characters.";

While much of the cast are familiar to their roles its truly a revelation to find 28 year old Lon Chaney Jr. in what amounts to the starring role billed for the last time under his real name 'Creighton Chaney.' As Don Cooper star shot putter and discus thrower for Rawley College Chaney beats out hotshot track star Larry Haines Eddie Nugent for the title of 'Joe Senior' after which he suddenly begins to act more like Haines in his girl chasing neglecting his athletics. Will Rawley still triumph over Stanford in the thrilling competition finale? Need you ask? Sure comic performers like Sterling Holloway Arthur Lake and Tom Dugan do not disappoint though the girls apart from the Crane twins Beverly and Betty Mae are almost invisible. Brunette GiGi Parrish is Chaney's girl Mary Carlisle the blonde who uses him to make Haines jealous the twins are called 'Nip and Tuck!'. Best of all halfway in we get to actually hear Creighton Chaney sing atop a piano and not badly either. His voice isn't as deep as John Carradine's but he could have made a 'basso profundo' this basso sang a song 30 years before Spider Baby. Unfortunately the tune ends abruptly by the untimely arrival of music teacher E. Phlatt Olaf Hytten. Most incredibly the director was Raymond McCarey brother of Leo and the writer George Waggner who years later brought Lon Chaney to Universal scripting and directing his debut for the studio Man Made Monster and producing and directing his iconic classic The Wolf Man.".

What's really eyecatching however is the cast. Yes it is a young handsome muscular Lon Creighton Chaney Jr. as one of the swains and looking nothing like the dissipated alcoholic of later years. After seeing the promise here its doubly unfortunate his career went on the downslide it did.Also there's only a slightly addled Sterling Holloway playing it fairly straight for a change and Arthur Lake showing a nicely shaded comedic side that probably helped him get the Dagwood role in the longrunning Blondie series. But who is Edward Nugent. Judging from his many credits in the 1930's he nevertheless quit the business early. Whatever the case he makes a perfectly handsome swellhead who can be either obnoxious or charming. Too bad IMDb doesn't give us more of his bio.

Monogram together with Republic was one of the better of these impoverished studios  although most of their stuff still wasn't very good. It's easy to see teenagers from the 30s getting a kick out of it while they waited for the main feature.One moment that does set it apart from other films  although the significance would have been lost on all involved at the time  is that Chaney actually gets to sing a song in this one.

Before the story immediately gets underway it opens with these words From the time of Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden man has vainly sought to find solace comfort and earth pleasures in an artificial world of his own creation. Down through the ages has come that eternal heritage the urge to every man to turn his back on socalled civilization to get back to nature and reveal in the glories of freedom of a primitive paradise. Plot summary Millionaires William Belmont William Farnum Professor Carmichale Earle Browne and adventurer Steve Drexel Douglas Fairbanks are sailing together on a yacht along the South Seas bound for Sumatra to hunt tigers. As they pass an uncharted island Drexel makes a 1000 bet with Belmont that he could live in seclusion on the island for two months with nothing but a toothbrush which he soon discards along with his watch and shoes in the manner of storybook character Robinson Crusoe. While Steve feels he'll be found living the life of Riley Belmont believes he'll find him tied to the stake by hungry natives. Diving off the yacht and leaving his friends to go on ahead with their plans Steve swims ashore with his dog Rooney. He makes good with his wager by surviving on coconuts pineapple and bananas constructing a giant treehouse making wooded street signs reading Park Avenue and 52nd Street befriending wildlife that includes Googy a monkey Sooky a talking parrot whose only reply is Okay a turtle that helps pump water and a goat for the use of its milk. Although Steve isn't quite so lucky having a Robinson Crusoe's companion Friday being that of a very nervous native dubbed Friday the 13th he finds and loses Steve goes one better by acquiring a beautiful native girl he names Saturday Maria Alba who had earlier escaped a forced marriage ceremony from another island. Aside from finding solitude with Steve who finds time teaching her the English language she learns her the method of kissing by rubbing his nose against hers. As his two months comes to a close it appears that Steve now slightly bearded might win his bet after all until his friends having returned from their hunting trip arrive on the island with methods of their own to win the bet.While far from being Fairbanks' best it's the kind of entertainment expected of him an adventure comedy highlighted by his familiar acrobatics amusing scenes revolving around his animal friends slight romance climaxed by threatening dangers of a cannibal attack in the best Tarzan tradition. With its small cast and location footage filmed entirely in Tahiti Fiji Samoa and the Marquee islands this is very much a one man show for Fairbanks in a near solo performance with occasional cuts revolving around Belmont and Saturday in separate cases. Aside from his methods of survival having accomplished a lot in such a short time with his manmade contraptions and ingenious inventions thanks to his boy scout training and Dan Bear's Handy Book it's acceptable to believe Steve could make rope out of bark and setting up fishing nets but how is it possible for him putting together his own radio after acquiring radio tubes from a native's neck that miraculously picks up broadcasts from San Francisco and listening to Harry Richman vocalizing Singing a Vagabond Song from his 1930 motion picture musical PUTTIN ON THE RITZ? Regardless of situations not being true to life it's goal of vintage fun is evident throughout its 70 minutes.Having all the ingredients of an innocently made 1920s silent film it so happens that MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE was also distributed in the silent film tradition with musical score intertitles sound effects and the constant reply of Okay by the parrot and barking by Rooney. Alfred Newman's memorable underscoring of The Moon of Manakoora heard throughout proved so popular that it was used again for other South Seas stories notably Samuel Goldwyn's classic THE HURRICANE 1937 featuring Jon Hall.Virtually unknown until the 1980s when distributed on video cassette in both silent Video Yesteryear and sound Kartes Video Communications versions and airing on some local public broadcasting stations at present television revivals of MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE are rare with known broadcasts on the Christian Broadcast Network prior to 1990 and a silent print as part of Nostalgia Channel's Saturday night presentation of When Silents Was Golden in 1994. Throughout those years MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE has had the misfortune of circulating with inferior prints thus making this one of many films such as this in need of restoration.Had MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE been remade in the 1940s when South Sea stories were in vogue it would have been an interesting part of the Road series Road to Tahihi perhaps starring Bing Crosby Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. As it now stands this goodnatured adventure tale being more Fairbanks than DeFoe simply displays how excellent Fairbanks can be in a role written especially for him and what he's capable of doing when material matches his talent.

Alfred Newman's memorable underscoring of The Moon of Manakoora heard throughout proved so popular that it was used again for other South Seas stories notably Samuel Goldwyn's classic THE HURRICANE 1937 featuring Jon Hall.Virtually unknown until the 1980s when distributed on video cassette in both silent Video Yesteryear and sound Kartes Video Communications versions and airing on some local public broadcasting stations at present television revivals of MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE are rare with known broadcasts on the Christian Broadcast Network prior to 1990 and a silent print as part of Nostalgia Channel's Saturday night presentation of When Silents Was Golden in 1994. Throughout those years MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE has had the misfortune of circulating with inferior prints thus making this one of many films such as this in need of restoration.Had MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE been remade in the 1940s when South Sea stories were in vogue it would have been an interesting part of the Road series Road to Tahihi perhaps starring Bing Crosby Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. As it now stands this goodnatured adventure tale being more Fairbanks than DeFoe simply displays how excellent Fairbanks can be in a role written especially for him and what he's capable of doing when material matches his talent.

	schema:reviewBody "An enjoyably offbeat story and a fun role for Douglas Fairbanks make Mr. Robinson Crusoe an entertaining light feature. The story is kept as simple as possible because the highlights are Fairbanks' athleticism his character's wide variety of gadgets and animal companions and Maria Alba as the very endearing Saturday.The story is never intended to be taken seriously but it certainly works as entertainment. It starts with Fairbanks's character accepting a bet that he and his dog can survive on an isolated desert island. A long stretch of the movie is devoted simply to showing his numerous inventions and tricks for surviving in the wild while at the same time he makes several animal friends. This part works surprisingly well and plenty of imagination went into all the devices and such. Of the animals the monkey is particularly entertaining and is rather talented itself.Fairbanks does quite well carrying the load during the parts in which he has no human to talk to. Once the more actionoriented part begins he is of course in familiar territory and at least in this one feature he looks just about as energetic and youthful as ever.The most actionoriented sequences are interspersed with the tenderer scenes with Alba's character which makes for an interesting contrast during that part of the movie. This is the kind of movie that is very enjoyable if you are in the mood for something a little different andor for anyone who has fond memories of Fairbanks's fine silentera classics.".

It manages to scare the bejezus out of neighboring unfriendly South Sea Islanders who arrive to reclaim the pretty Maria Alba from a fate worse than smooching noses. That was probably the single most difficult story element to contend with since 'Saturday' did everything possible to be taken seriously as a romantic partner and Fairbanks just didn't get it. Oh well.Certainly Fairbanks got on with his little experiment a whole lot better than I would have in the same situation I don't think I could have come up with half of those inventions. Some were so intricate in fact that Rube Goldberg would have been proud. For audiences of the era I'm sure the movie was quite an inventive piece of work and entertaining as well with a host of charismatic animal characters. I was half expecting the monkey to do a Stan Laurel banana within a banana routine.Probably the most interesting aspect of the film was Fairbanks doing his own stunt work like the ocean dive heading for the island and that tree climb later in the story. Somewhat over zealous perhaps in his self satisfaction it was a little uncomfortable watching him jump up and down like a school boy expressing his appreciation of island life. I was also more than a little surprised to catch his rather serious looking wrestling moves they would have done Strangler Lewis proud.This was only my second viewing of a Fairbanks Sr. movie and in his second to last picture he's as athletic and agile as ever even with the additional pounds on his frame. The only other picture I've seen him in 1926's The Black Pirate also deserves a mention and a recommendation.".

	schema:headline " Easy to Take Doug Sr. Flick but keep in mind  a film of it's time";
	schema:reviewBody "After the coming of talkies in 1927 several of the leading stars of the silent film period restrained themselves from jumping into talking films for awhile. One was Douglas Fairbanks Sr. whose last films THE GAUCHO and THE IRON MASK were not made until 192829. They remain among the last good silent films and Fairbanks' performances especially in THE IRON MASK among his best. Then in 1929 he appeared with his then wife Mary Pickford in THE TAMING OF THE SHREW which was shot as a talkie. From that film onward Fairbanks Sr. only made talkie films. But he did not make many of them. His problem was similar to that of his younger contemporary sound film victim John Gilbert. Both had screen personas based on men of action fighting for their causes in the world and suddenly the action perfectly captured in silent films was slowed down for talk  which both could handle but due to the poor quality of the lines or the recording equipment undercut their screen images. Also for Fairbanks his age was catching up. He was less lean not fat but stocky now than he was at his height of popularity. It was more disastrous for Gilbert who was years younger than Fairbanks. Fairbanks was established enough to be more choosy on the subject of sound films. He'd make about five before retiring.The first film THE TAMING OF THE SHREW did not break any records. A serviceable slice of Shakespeare Fairbanks made a good Petrucchio Pickford's Katherina is too stagy as she tries to show a shrewish temper. It was also the only time the uncrowned King and Queen of Silent film Hollywood made a film together. A German film appeared afterward. Then there was REACHING FOR THE MOON where Fairbanks plays an exuberant millionaire on a voyage who falls for Bebe Daniels and learns the Stock Market Crash has wiped him out. It is best recalled because it's musical score by Irving Berlin was almost totally scrapped and Bing Crosby sang one of the remaining songs in the film. Then came this cute little film. Finally came the best of Fairbank's talkies THE PRIVATE LIFE OF DON JUAN.MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE looks almost like it was the cinematic version of publishing with a vanity press. It has this atmosphere of filming on the cuff so to speak  a rather free and easy type of filming that does not look like it was made in a studio and on a set. Yet it is a studio product complete with musical score by Alfred Newman and direction by Eddie Sutherland. The plot is really thin. While vacationing in the southseas on his yacht Doug makes a bet with William Farnum that he can be dumped with only his toothbrush on a desert island and in a year will be set up like Robinson Crusoe with all kinds of luxury devices at his beck and call. The bet made and Doug dives overboard. He soon shows his yankee ingenuity and has various contraptions taking things he needs to his extended tree house. He soon also has a young girl Maria Alba there as well. Maria is a native who fled a marriage at a neighboring island and is willing to become Doug's girl Saturday. They successfully repel an attack by the groom and his friend just as Farnum returns for the completion of the wager.The film was a product of the early 1930s so the treatment of the natives including Maria is quite racist by our standards  they are barely considered human just mindlessly brutal. Maria is not shown to be brutal but far too docile and willing to enslave herself to Doug out of gratitude a similar point about the original Friday in Defoe's ROBINSON CRUSOE could be made. While we never see Doug doing anything outlandish with Maria we figure that at night...well he is the only man about and she is the only woman about. Certainly the concluding moment of the film suggests Doug was aware of how she could shake it!Keeping in mind that it is a product of it's time does not lessen it's racist and sexist attitude. But it does allow the viewer to concentrate on the film as a whole. As such it was not a bad escapist fare for the early talkies. Fortunately it would not be Doug's last sound film. His performance in THE PRIVATE LIFE OF DON JUAN was first rate and in a first rate film and suggests that a bit better digging for material and Doug might have had more deserving sound film credits.".

At times though it seems like a bit of personal vanity from an aging star.A good case could be made for Douglas Fairbanks being the movies first actionadventure star. Stunts and athletic ability were always emphasized in Fairbanks films than acting was though if the occasion called for it Fairbanks could give a good performance. At the time this film was made Fairbanks was 49 years old looking fit mind you but still looking 49.Like MGM did with Trader Horn filming it on location in Africa. Most of Mr. Robinson Crusoe was shot in the South Seas in Fiji and in Tahiti. There's not much of a cast to Mr. Robinson Crusoe just William Farnum and Earle Browne who Fairbanks makes a bet on a whim that he couldn't survive on this tropical paradise as did Robinson Crusoe and of course Maria Alba who plays the native girl Fairbanks takes up with and names Saturday.There is a man Friday in the story and unfortunately it's part of one of the most racist aspects I've ever seen in a film. The ironic thing is that I don't think Fairbanks who wrote the script appreciated how it looked. Since he decides to imitate the fictional Crusoe there must be a man Friday in the story. But in Daniel Defoe's novel Friday is rescued by Crusoe and becomes devoted to him. Here Fairbanks comes upon some head hunters and tries to kidnap him for the purpose of essentially making him a slave. I'm not sure what else you could call it. The whole sequence is done for laughs with Fairbanks using all kinds of wrestling moves on the poor native doubtless to show off his athletic ability which his fans paid to see. Still for today's audience I find it shocking.It's why sad to say I can't give the film any higher a rating. Fairbanks and the cast are fine and the location cinematography in the South Seas would not be seen for another 20 years until I believe Gary Cooper's Return to Paradise was shot in some of the same area.Sad to say I think a lot of people will be offended by watching Mr. Robinson Crusoe.".

We catch a few glimpses of her completely topless mostly through the reflection in the moving water as she's prepared for marriage. Doug and Maria Alba took up together during the filming of this movie and one wonders if he sat in the audience elbowing his buddies as they watched this scene whispering Look at what I got! She escapes and paddles over to Doug's island but she's quickly caught in one of his animal traps. He hurries to her rescue and she's conveniently knocked out so he carries her to his bungalow. She awakens and thinks nothing of the fact that he's built this very western abode filled with devices she no doubt has no knowledge of. So what catches her attention? This must be a bachelor's apartment as there are dirty dishes in the sink. What is a woman to do when she sees such disarray? Wash them of course! The ridiculousness of the plot keeps coming as the natives that Doug's girl Saturday escaped from find their way to the island and try to kill Doug. But he foils them alright. He snatches bunches of bananas from the trees and splays the peels out over their path and down they go! Cinevent 2014 screened silent version of this film which is rarer than the dubbed over talkie but it is full of sound effects.

Right at the start of the movie Fairbanks jumps off the boat. It is the most perfect getting off a boat jump I have ever seen. It is beautiful. And the final shots of the movie when our 'Hero' has pimped his native girlie onto the stage to do native dancing he is sat in the audience and they blow kisses to each other. Except they don't blow kisses because as was established earlier in the movie the natives don't kiss. They rub noses. So what Fairbanks and native girlie do is blow nose rubs to one another. I've never seen it done before or since. It's almost funny. It's certainly very odd.".

Doug as usual is the man's Man and he displays his athletic skills to the utmost. The plot is simple but the characters are not. It speaks to us today of the role of men  women in society and the desperate need of each and everyone of us to know love and respect. Doug's ingenuity in creating a home on a tropical island filled with many of the luxuries we today take for granted shows that where there's a will there's a way. Absurd at times? Of course...but it IS a movie! Ultimately the movie reveals the kindness of humanity despite all odds and has plenty of laughs and thrills. It is a tale set in another time and another place.

But of course having watched it as a kid growing up in USSR you get engrossed with the actual fairytales aspects of having strong friendships being honest etc.. Yes in Soviet films they always made girls' dresses short but in schools you would be kicked out if your dress was shorter than kneelength. Part of that was to project a young naive perfect little Pioneer girls who were completely asexual. But you have to remember that during Soviet times we youngsters played outside by ourselves past midnight and never even wondered if we would get kidnapped. It was safer for kids there in that respect. Otherwise it was a straightforward propaganda tale that also taught kids good moral qualities without all the superjunkysugar coat freakiness of Disney cartoons. It is reminiscent of the cartoon Three Fatsos where there is also a commentary against imperialist enslavement of people via classism and basically call for unity of proletariats. Or even an Italian story of Adventures of Chipollino. Again everyone it is not alike to Alice in Wonderland how irritating and presumptuous! It is a great Soviet classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "A very knowledgeable online acquaintance recommended this film two years ago. A friend immediately watched it and has been for the past two years trying to convince me to watch it as well.Receiving a seal of enthusiastic approval from two opinions I value and trust it's something of an enigma as to why I've been so hesitant to watch the film. Especially when one considers my love for surrealism and general weirdness. Considering some of the films I've seen in the past two years and in doing so put ahead in priority over Kingdom Hostel? Intolerable Cruelty? it's downright disgusting of me. But I've looked at myself in the mirror as Grandma asks at the end of this precious Russian gem and decided to break my bad habits.I loved this film. As soon as it was over unfortunately after only around 70 minutes I excitedly started this article and was ready to learn about the film. Unfortunately things don't always go the way you'd like.There is sadly little discussion or evaluation of this strange Russian family film on the internet and the DVD itself offers only one special feature of note a 5 minute talk by an actor in the film Andrei Stapran who spends 4 minutes bragging about the films he himself made none of which are on IMDb unfortunately and the other minute making general statements like Aleksandr Rou was a marvelous director! No kidding.So I'm alone on this one and as a freshmen in the high school of serious film consideration and criticism I can only offer small observations of a questionable nature. But even Ebert has had to retract statements he made about films in his foolish youth. Such is life they say.Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors bears unavoidable similarities to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a little girl suddenly finds herself in a strange world with ruthless royalty who aren't shy when it comes to executions. There's also a cat but it functions more like Alice's cat Dinah than the Cheshire Cat.And though it may be due to the fact I saw a theatre screening of it just two days before watching this Kingdom also seems to bear resemblance to Victor Fleming's The Wizard of Oz. While Kingdom lacks the production values of Hollywood's masterpiece of surreal family entertainment it's as creative in concepts and the limitations in set and costume design only stamp it with the strange and unexplainable vibes I get when watching the films of Jan Svankmajer as well as my only experience with Jaromil Jires Valerie and Her Week of Wonderswhich is likely the kind of film that children raised on this will turn to when they are adults. Interestingly watching the film today even the most politically apathetic persons like myself can't help but notice how much it functions like a criticism of the fella in charge. Well you be the judge the king in the kingdom of crooked mirrors is incredibly stupid and everyone in the kingdom knows it. He's also not really in charge  he does what the rich citizens of the kingdom tell him to do. Yeah.That is one of the reasons I was excited in researching this film to uncover some knowledge of the Russian leadership at the time a figure who I had to assume was like the George W. Bush of his time  being the butt of a seemingly neverending line of jokes about his intellectual shortcomings by the Jay Lenos and Saturday Night Lives of the time.Unfortunately I uncovered nothing. Perhaps it is all the better. I've never been impressed by Bush jokes presidents are too easy a target for interchangeable jokes be it about sex or stupidity. So to uncover that King Torrap parrot spelled backwardsbecause this is a world of mirrors is in fact a direct criticism of one person instead of a more universal questioning of anyone in charge or  what the hell  just an opportunity to have a farcical character with a parrotesquire beak for a nose would have only let me down ultimately.I should also point out his cowering when facing meanfaced people he fears reminded me of the king of Wonderland in the Disney production who seems terrified of his wife who indeed wears the pants in that kingdom.But to get to a more typical plot breakdown of the film finally you say a little girl named Olya returning from peaking into a film which children under 16 are not allowed to see comes home to her grandma realizing she has lost the key to their flat. The grandma scorns her carelessness and sets out to fetch her a replacement key. Meanwhile Olya breaks into the jam cabinet and splits a jar with her cat while her overlooking parrot threatens to tell on her unless she shares the goods  which she does not do.When she accidentally drops the jar the mirror in her house begins to talk to her perhaps this was grandma's special jar of jam with a few extra ingredients and she follows her cat into the mirror where she meets her reflection Aylo.From there the two embark on a strange journey after witnessing a youth being sent to the aptly named Death Tower for rebelling and making straight mirrors so that people can see the truth instead of being fooled into believing the lies of the crooked mirrors he has been enslaved to make which make the old look young and vice versa.They encounter several strange characters with names like Daot toad spelled backwards the character himself looks like a toad and so on as they attempt to free their friend named Dneirf of course! As Watson Pritchard at Something Weird Video put it this film at times resembles a liveaction cartoon from hell. That simple statement couldn't be truer.".

	schema:headline " Surreal Russian children's fantasy";
	schema:reviewBody "As some other reviewers have noted WORLD OF CROOKED MIRRORS is a delightfully oldfashioned Russian fairy tale put on film. It's a children's fantasy heavily indebted to the likes of ALICE IN WONDERLAND telling of a young and innocent girl who climbs through a mirror and finds herself transported to a fantastic world that has been corrupted by evil reflections. Most of the film concentrates on having fun with backwards characters and names.The dated nature of this production gives it the quality of an old pantomime and that's not helped by the garish costumes and oversaturated colours of the production. However at the same time these things are strengths when it comes to WORLD OF CROOKED MIRRORS. The film has a distinctive and surreal look with some parts that would be more than frightening for a watching child spoonfed on the safe world of Disney. The special effects are quaint rather than elaborate and lovers of the bizarre will be in their element.".

	schema:headline " What happens exactly when you crack a can of grandma's jam.";
	schema:reviewBody "Well I watched this movie many times so I think I can better explain what it is all about. Olya the girl in the beginning of the movie features her personal weaknesses or bad habits or let's call it sins. She is craving for grandma's jam so much that she discards grandma's word no to touch the jam and breaks the can as she tries to eat some. Also Olya is recreant lazy irresponsible sweettooth to the extent of forgetting about more important things. In other words Olya features a number of bad habits typical for children of her age. And through possession of these bad habits she becomes attracted to the fairytale surreal world of Kingdom of crooked mirrors which in fact is some kind of antiworld where all inhabitants bear reversed names to be read backwards to understand the true nature of the character. The kingdom is ruled by bizarre and evil characters featuring different animals like Parrot Adder Falcon Toad all shall be read backwards and in fact represent a fake and gullish monarch Parrot and three ruthless cunning and power loathing tycoons Toad Adder and Falcon who really rule the Kingdom. Played by people dressed and made up accordingly. In order to cement their power over the Kingdom they lean upon what probably should be described as total and systematic lying or people's mass misinformation by producing and disseminating only crooked mirrors. For this end they arrested the mirrormaker Friend who refused to produce crooked mirrors. So the CMK world represents where do Olya's weaknesses or bad habits would finally take her if not eradicated timely and properly. During her trip in the Kingdom Olya is accompanied by her mirror twin Yalio who has no bad habits but acts accordingly to her age. The main goal is to free the mirrormaker Friend from the Death Tower which means the end of the Kingdom of Crooked mirrors. Olya has to overcome her own weaknesses and bad habits on her way to the goal otherwise the ruling of Adder Falcon and Toad will never end. It is important to understand that in the USSR production of movies was controlled by Art councils so the final product is kinda a balance between the movie director and Art council therefore something resembling propaganda can sometimes be expected. But if you understand the entire story and the plot you will see that Kingdom is a materialization of one's bad habits taken to the logical absolute to show to kids how important is to take an active and firm position in life and to stick to the truth that in adult life you will have to take an active position you will have to distinguish your friends from enemies and you will have to act accordingly. Well from the point of view of Adder Falcon and Toad this must be a very dangerous propaganda.".

The horror influence is clearly evident here when an escaped band of drooling lunatics runs around grunting and killing everyone in sight. It's a real hoot to see spaghetti western regular Eduardo Fajardo playing the part of a giggling homicidal idiot. This alone makes it worthwhile to seek out this film.John Ireland is great as the gunslinging preacher and Piero Lulli makes a great villain as usual. The acting from the rest of the cast is not exactly topnotch but that just adds to the flavor of this film. It's quite funny in parts perhaps unintentionally but one can never be sure.There are also some really funny lines in the movie which I will not spoil by mentioning here. The way everyone overreacts to the fact that the hero likes to drink water is especially hilarious.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys both spaghetti westerns and strange funny cult movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Slade is sentenced to forced labor since he refused to kill somebody in war due to his religious conscience. After the war he returns home and finds his parents murdered. He chases the murderers and kills most of them  and everything I told you now just happens in the first 15 minutes of the film! After this rushed beginning the real story unfolds. Bandits are trying to rob a bank  but there is no money in that bank because a transport with 200000 dollars did not arrive yet.

Eduardo Fajardo has only a small appearance as one among a bunch of madmen breaking from their cage. Piero Lulli though is at his best in the role of the leader of the bandits. Peter Lee Lawrence plays Slade as good as possible under the circumstances  it is a hero poorly developed by the screenplay who makes him a pacifist in the beginning and a gunman later on but for a man who's never touched a gun before he seems to learn effortlessly how to become the most dangerous man in town within a day or two. Also he first was ready to go to prison for his religious belief  and then he kicks that over board without a single regret later on. It would have been possible to make Slade a character torn between duty and desire but instead the makers of the movie simply settle for a fast gun. Thus Una pistola per cento bare became just one average movie among many.".

What makes it further odd is that there's material that could have easily been edited out without harming the narrative from the band of lunatics to the hero's Jehovah Witness beliefs.

	schema:headline " A Grim Gunslinging BulletBlasting Spaghetti Western from Umberto Lenzi!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "There is an amusing line in Americanmade western parody Rustler's Rhapsody that all Spaghetti westerns had great music. Composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino spices up Umberto Lenzi's violent horse opera about revenge and robbery with a haunting orchestral score that lingered with me long after I'd watched Pistol for a Hundred Coffins with Spaghetti western stalwart Peter Lee Lawrence and Red River alum John Ireland. Although this 84minute oater is ostensibly about revengeas are all EurowesternsLenzi and coscenarist Marco Leto of Dead Men Don't Count and Vittorio Salerno of Twenty Thousand Dollars for Seven adapting Eduardo Manzanos' story have slipped in some interesting characters that you rarely see in horse operas. Peter Lee Lawrence's protagonist Jim Slade is a Jehovah's Witness as well as a conscientious objector who lands himself in a Confederate hard labor camp because he refuses to bear arms. Similarly John Ireland plays a swiftshooting gunslinger who quotes scripture from the Bible at every opportunity despite not being an ordained preacher. Twists such as these and some surprises in this otherwise formulaic sagebrusher marks Pistol for a Hundred Coffins as an aboveaverage shoot'em up with a body count. Interestingly Lenzi appears to have redressed the same western movie set town that Sergio Leone lensed A Fistful of Dollars in and the villain is played with gusto here by another Spaghetti western regular Piero Lulli. No the hero doesn't endure the brutal beating that the bad guys gave Clint Eastwood in A Fistful of Dollars. Primarily this western takes place in the frontier town of Galveston nothing like the reallife Galveston and it concerns a prolonged effort by Corbett Piero Lulli and his triggerhappy pistoleros to rob the local bank of 200thousand dollars that has been set aside from farmers to buy seeds for planting. The loot is delayed and Corbett and his men hover over the town on its arid mountainous outskirts while Slade Peter Lee Lawrence of For A Few Bullets More continues his manhunt for the dastards that killed his family. Most good stories concern characters that change over the course of the narrative and Jim Slade changes from a man who refuses to kill to one who does kill. Principally this change is prompted because his blood kin have been massacred. Nevertheless during this stage of his life he remains steadfast in his refusal to drink whiskey.Mind you Umberto Lenzi wasn't the consummate stylist that Sergio Leone was but Lenzi was prolific in his output and ventured into horror epics World War 2 actioneers cannibal movies police procedurals etc. with sixtyfive films to his credit under his own name and pseudonyms. Pistol for a Hundred Coffins doesn't dawdle and the film isn't without comic relief when everybody seems to be spun around by a bullet shrieking through them. Franco Pesce has a blast playing an old codger who embalms and buries the scores of corpses that pile up after each gunfight. One of the more curious subplots that Pistol for a Hundred Coffins contains is one that you don't see often see a bunch of lunatics held in the city jail after their asylum has burned to the ground. At one point this maniacs among one who is Spaghetti western regular Eduardo Fajardo break out and launch an uncoordinated assault on the townspeople with anything they can get their hands on to kill them. Sadly I haven't seen the letterboxed version of this bloodsplattered Spaghetti western but it ranks as an aboveaverage entry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Who would have thought that Zhang Yimou once art house darling and for trying too hard at the martial arts genre could be capable of pulling off an allout slapstick black comedy with A Woman A Gun and A Noodle Shop? It certainly took my by surprise and showed that he's more than willing and capable of stepping outside his comfort zone to remake what's essentially The Coen Brother's Blood Simple albeit set in a period Chinese era and in context as well with the bar in an unnamed Texas town becoming a noodle shop out in a desert.And paying homage to The Coens isn't just the only one here. Curiously the finale sequence was very similar to how Danny Boyle decided to end Slumdog Millionaire with an out of place song and dance sequence that became more absurd as the clip ticked by. Serving little purpose other than to get everyone lip sync dance spin some dough break the 4th fall and essentially telling us that everyone had a swell time making the film I thought this could be done without since the end was quite pitch perfect.Beginning with an introduction to the important plot element of introducing a gun into the story a group of Persian merchants come into Wang's Ni Dahong noodle shop to sell some wares and ultimately Wang's Wife Yan Ni decides to buy a threebarrelled gun. Nobody knows what for and a cannon demonstration brings forth the local police whose chief investigator Zhang Sun Honglei gets engaged in an expensive scheme by Wang to finish off his adulterous wife and her lover employee Li Xiao ShenYang. But of course things never go according to plan especially when everyone has their own agenda and it becomes one heck of a comedic blood bath with motivations questioned and you the audience left wondering just how everyone will get out of this mess.Zhang Yimou once again goes for very saturated colour schemes for his films from the rich blues of the skies to the orangebrown sands of the desert land and this time too keeping his characters in singletoned striking colours. If anyone doubts the director in being able to helm a comedy the opening scene itself will allay those fears and indeed much of the physical comedy come thanks to the wonderful casting especially that of the two bumbling shop assistants caught up in the complicated events only because they're looking toward settling their back pay.It highlights how men become easily tempted by money the root of all evil when faced with bucketloads of them and how coincidences play a huge part in getting the characters where they end up with each unfortunate moment ending in becoming a corpse yes there will be blood and death in a seemingly convoluted narrative that has to be seen to be believed the kind of rich writing which can pull it off. But what I enjoyed more is how modern day devices are given the old fashioned treatment such as the police siren  horse mounted and windgenerated  and a combination lock designed with an abacus no less!A Woman A Gun and A Noodle Shop may seem like a less than epic film from Zhang Yimou but it sure is a lot of fun delivered by its outstanding casting who seem all too comfortable in dishing out black and physical humour. Recommended just so you know that the director has the bandwidth to do a lot more than what his filmography thus far has pigeonholed him into.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's my first review on IMDb because I was riled by cheeky Chinese media. For the sake of their own investment movie shi yue wei chen they criticized San Qiang was dirty depraved and evil rubbish. It's ridiculous. Although wrapped in absurd comedy the movie is serious and tragedy fable in essence.

If you are immersed in the movie you would be find more fun.The visual effect of the movie is stunning and created a absurd drama world. I was impressed by the amazing feeling and become a fan of director.Perhaps the movie is not perfect but it is so precious for an old man of good reputation to try a new style at his 60s' so I gave it 1010.".

	schema:headline " A remake worth checking out!";
	schema:reviewBody "'A WOMAN A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five Chinese remake of the Coen brothers first film 'BLOOD SIMPLE' this one is set in 19th century China as opposed to 1980's Texas. The film is directed by Yimou Zhang who directed such popular and critical acclaimed films as 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS' 'HERO' and 'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER' and it's quite a departure from his older work. Zhang says 'BLOOD SIMPLE' is one of his favorite films and claims the Coens wrote to him after seeing his version and expressed how much they loved it. It's written by Jianquan Shi and Jing Shang and stars Ni Yan Honglei Sun Xiao ShenYang and Dahong Ni.The original Chinese title of the film is 'A SIMPLE NOODLE STORY' it was changed to 'A WOMAN A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP' for it's international release. It's set in a small desert town where a man named Wang Ni runs a successful noodle shop. He purchased his young beautiful wife Yan several years earlier and beats her every night. His wife is having an affair with a servant at the noodle shop named Li ShenYang and when Wang finds out about the affair things get ugly. Wang enlists the help of a local police detective Sun to help him carry out a plan of revenge. Things of course become complicated and bloody.The film is an odd mix of dark action thriller and screwball comedy. The slapstick jokes aren't exactly my taste in humor but the action scenes are cool and the suspense is intense. It does drag on a little here and there but for the most part the action  crime drama aspect of the film is effective. It's also often visually stunning with plenty of beautiful scenery and elaborate effects. It's not nearly as epic and breathtaking as Zhang's other films but I think it's a nice surprise change for him. By no means is it great or as classic as the original of course but it's still a remake worth checking out.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vRDzuEsuogc".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhang's latest is a remake of the Coen Brothers' debut film Blood Simple. It's a slightly more comic adaptation set in the distant past in the beautiful Gobi ? desert. It opens wonderfully with the beautiful colors and impeccable cinematography that have always been a trademark of Zhang Yimou. Unfortunately when it gets into the Blood Simple plot it becomes very mechanical. I'd say that it lacks suspense because I know the story but I've seen Blood Simple half a dozen times and it holds up every time. Every time the tautness of the plot works. There's just something a little bland about this adaptation. I'd still moderately recommend it for the visuals and the vibrant opening sequence where the titular woman Ni Yan who is pretty good though she can be annoying at times too buys the titular gun from a wacky Persian salesman.".

I don't think it is fair to write something like that but it's always how a viewer will watch this movie. With what expectation one goes into a movie. If you let yourself see through the comedic set pieces and the absurdity of most of them you could call it slapstick a movie that would be considered a master piece in another era of movie making you can see a very human drama.Not only that but many human flaws that are on display here that are hiding behind the comedy. What is not hiding though is the phenomenal cinematography. The colors the set pieces designs and the choreographed action is all in place here. There's even symbolism here that I didn't catch read some of the other reviews for that the ones with a spoiler tag.

But at least there is Riding alone 2005 in which he tries to bring the audience a human story although the style has a faint trace of Hollywood. Noodle Story is yet another welcome attempt from Zhang a mixed bag of outlandish farce black humour dark tragedy and tense thriller.The opening credit clearly announces this movie as an adaptation from the Coen Brother's Blood simple 1984. In this adaptation a solitary noodle shop in a forsaken wilderness on the Silk Road provides the theatre. The characters though simple folks are varied and not quite onedimensional. The foxy cheating wife of the owner turns out to be sympathyworthy as one who has suffered for ten years under a sadistic Scrooge of a husband. Her sissy sheepish young lover one of the employees later rises to the occasion when things get serious. The other two employees are more along the line of caricatures but still caricatures with lives and characters of their own. There's also a villain with a menacing dark aura.Those who have seen Blood Simple will know that the plot is not complicated but sufficient to generate scenes of various moods. This movie brings these scenes together without making the whole works look awkward. The casting is excellent. An extra bonus is the grotesque yet beautiful landscape that doesn't seem to belong to this Earth. The song and dance number during the end credit which should not be missed is probably inspired by Kitano's Zatoichi which is probably inspired in turn by Bollywood.".

When you remake a merely twentyyearold cult classic by filmmakers with an enormous cult following a story everybody knows it's one thing to tell the story in a different style or to change certain things but anachronizing everything to an arbitrarily different time period culture and characters we are only really looking for all the anachronisms waiting for them being let down occasionally being gratified.The time period is never specified but what I expected was going to lead to interesting dramatic twists on the Coens' plot was that it begins with the sale of a gun which the cheating wife and the ridiculous slapstick moron noodlemakers find foreign and unheardof. The gun is apparently a pretty new invention. But Yimou who normally cares profoundly about his characters loses his passionate emotional dominion over his actors. He dries out the original's sultriness trades humid night for arid day and strains for slapstick. That would be perfectly fine if he traded those elements in for something just as or hopefully more effective but he does not.The Coens' original Gothic film noir fanged and toxic like snake venom dwindles here to the point of amateur slapstick. Though the exterior shots make almost psychedelically atmospheric use of red and orange sandstone day for night sunrise and sunset the characters are never more than ugly overwrought cartoons. I'll admit that Blood Simple was not the quintessence of character arc. Nobody really seemed to change in that film despite having a wryly farcical lack of conception as to what's happening. So at the outset of A Woman a Gun and a Noodle Shop when the adulterous lover originally played by John Getz is a redefining coward I was pleased because knowing what this character must later do I felt I was in for a true character transformation. To describe the outcome without spoilers No such luck.Aside from its inevitable comparisonone of the reasons in hindsight it's fated to be a letdownNoodle Shop is simultaneously frantic and dull with no hint of the restraint or meticulous concern with form exhibited in Yimou's own earlier blockbusters. Like Hero House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower and even as early as Ju Dou the stars of the show are ultimately Zhao Xiaoding's mostly gorgeous cinematography Tao Jing's evocative sound design and Yimou's choice of otherworldly locations. But all its visual brightness and tonal goofiness are far from either the literal or conceptual darkness of the fundamental story. Most damning is that the effort to recreate the remarkable final shot of Blood Simple is so tacky and clumsy that I reflexively sighed in revulsion. Zhang needs to reconnect with the fierce principled humanistic sensibility that made him one of China's finest film artists.So the result of this uneasy mix of ironic screwball affectation particularly evident in the big comic closeups and Zhang's majestic but mostly showoffy imagery is triteness artifice unevenness and pretension so immoderate and pointless as to have defiantly stylish interest. If the cast were comprised of John Waters Elvira PeeWee Herman and RuPaul it would be less kitschy.".

The actors give a solid performance but can't lift the movie to higher heights its just an average movie for a boring Sunday to me.I must say i did get a few very good laughs out of it although sometimes in between the funny bits it seemed to turn into a drama which didn't really help it at all.Zhang perhaps could have focused on just the comedy or drama instead of trying to mix which didn't work out in the end.

Elements of traditional Chinese film comedy the slapstick including the bumpkin assistant Zhao with the buck teeth the hapless Li who finally finds his gumption the remarkable acrobatics shots with the noodle preparation the spunky little ingnue.The whole extended mime sequence near the end is pure Coen.

A Civil War era tale of a New England family's joys and tribulations centers on the March household  mother Marmee and her four daughters Meg Amy Beth and Jo. The screenplay centers on each girl's commitment to showing her father proud father being a minister gone of f to war to meet the spiritual needs of the Yankee soldiers. Buoyed by their mother  the ever perfect Spring Byington  the girls learn the meaning of giving and sacrifice with a jollity that may be offputting to 21st century viewers but stick with it for what this picture offers is nothing less than real life at its most joyful and painful. After a series of seemingly inconsequential events the girls' placid lives are disrupted when a sibling takes ill. This section of the movie is riveting due to the superb direction of George Cukor and Katherine Hepburn as the tomboyish Jo. The scene where Jo retreats to the attic worried sick over the fate of her ill sister is gut wrenching. Hepburn was just hitting her stride as a movie actress when this film came out. Not the typical glamour girl of the time her odd beauty and diction translated into a strange alchemy when projected on a movie screen  she is unforgettable. The other actresses acquit themselves beautifully but the picture belongs to Hepburn. Lest you think all is dour and dull this movie offers so much that is truly entertaining  a heartwarming homecoming scene the March girls presenting a play in their living room to the consternation and delight of invited neighbors and several moments involving a cantankerous but lovable aunt  the ubiquitous Edna May Oliver . The movie is properly accoutered with lovely interiors and authentic production design and costumes  gabled houses and ivy covered porches hoop skirts and muffs . The entire production is like a gift wrapped edition of the novel turned to celluloid! The icing on the cake so to speak is Max Steiner's spare evocative music score employing Beth's piano playing for family get togethers parties etc. and orchestral commentary for dramatic comic and action sequences. Only six years had passed since sound recording had revolutionized the film industry but this early talkie uses the new technology very adeptly although camera movement is minimal the editing is very fluid. The sound courtesy of old Western Electric is fine especially on the recent DVD release where both aural and visual elements have been restored assuring a great presentation. When a movie has the power to reach out over a span of seven decades and touch jaded hearts in another century that is a sign of a classic. LITTLE WOMEN is a great American film.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful film with a glorious performance from Hepburn";
	schema:reviewBody "LITTLE WOMEN is quite possibly the one book written postShakespeare that has the most number of film adaptations to its credit. Louisa May Alcott's novel after all offers a fine host of roles particularly for womenof the March girls alone there's the eldest sister Meg the frail but saintly Beth spoilt baby of the family Amy and last but most certainly not least spunky tomboy Jo. This is not to forget the smaller but still integral supporting roles of Laurie Mr Lawrence Professor Bhaer and of course Marmee March. The story is an engaging one too following the lives of the March sistersin particular Joas they grow and deal with change with love and even with death. Even though the story itself is tied to a particular setting in the 1860s and even then the historical setting is almost peripheral the characters and their relationships with one anothersiblings parentchildren friends and loversare simply timeless. That's probably why the novel has seen as many attempts to have it committed to film as it has.I hate to make a snap judgement having not seen any more versions of Little Women than the 1994 one but I believe that this version made by RKO studios and starring a delightful Katharine Hepburn as Jo March has every right to be considered the definitive film version of the Alcott novel. The writing for one thing is exceptional. Although never quite the novel's substitute it condenses the book marvellously sketching the characters and relationships of the girls quickly and efficiently and never skipping over the best parts of the book for example Laurie's profession of love for Jo. Of course the screenplay will never measure up to the bookit is rare that a film could surpass the wealth of detail and beauty of description available from the written word. But nothing's perfect and this screenplay by Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman is as close as an adaptation can get while retaining its own distinct flavour as a film. As for the casting I have very few complaints about it since Hepburnall angles and attitude all loudvoiced and tomboyishis perfect as Jo and is ably supported by Frances Dee as Meg Henry Stephenson as the sweetly paternal Mr. Laurence and Douglass Montgomery as Laurie though he plays the role a tad too fey for my liking. Special praise must be reserved for both Jean Parker Beth March and Paul Lukas Professor Fritz Bhaer Parker for bringing an impossibly sweet and lovely character to life and making the audience genuinely grieve for Beth when she takes her leave of her family Lukas for managing to avoid making Professor Bhaer a hard frightening man with whom the audience simply cannot imagine Jo being in love as is my impression from the book. I was rather disappointed with Joan Bennett as Amy and that is of course partly attributable to the fact that the character isn't particularly sympathetic in the novel either so it isn't really fair to expect a miracle from Bennett. Still Bennett seemed to me to be the most lifeless of the sistersone might think this an unfair judgement since anyone acting opposite the powder keg that is Katharine Hepburn could easily be deemed lifeless if he or she weren't able to hold hisher own against her. Still the arguably less wellknown Frances Dee and Jean Parker had no problem with it. In the final analysis though there is no doubt that this film however 'ensemble' the cast belongs only to Hepburn. Her performance although somewhat mannered and brassy at times not necessarily simultaneously thank goodness! is nothing short of brilliant. She's sad she's funny she's touching and as she does in her best roles she transcends her own pretty formidable! character to breathe life into Jo as only she can. Witness the simple scene in which Jo breaks down alone at night after having sold her hair for her mother's travel expenses... or the scene when Jo truly believes that scarlet fever is going to take Beth from her and she trudges up into her own attic the weight of the world on her shoulders and collapses into tears. There is also nothing more charming than Hepburn as she gallops down the stairs in a frock which she burnt by leaning against the fireplace or when she runs like a free untamed spirit through the woods when chased by Laurie. Strange sweet funny Jothis complex combination of jealous child and strong woman stubbornly refusing to relinquish the familiar while adamantly placing her family above her own interests always... it really is a role that seems to have been written for Hepburn just as she seems to have been born to play it. It is perhaps for LITTLE WOMEN as much as for MORNING GLORY released in the same year that Hepburn won her first Oscar in 1933. Nobody photographs Hepburn as flatteringly as her good friend and director George Cukor either so some of the closeup shots of her in LITTLE WOMEN are simply breathtaking in having managed to capture her beauty her youth and her personality all at once.Nothing about this film is perfect after all perfection is too high a standard to be applied to adaptations and most other films!. But LITTLE WOMEN really does have a little something to offer everybodya sweet timeless story about love and growing up and family. It's something that everyone can relate to and that's probably more than enough.".

The novel offers welldefined characters and many situations that bring out worthwhile insights into the characters and into life in general. While neither this nor the other movie versions of the story have the same thematic depth this version effectively presents enough of the material in a thoughtful and entertaining way.Katherine Hepburn heads the cast and gives plenty of life to Jo.

Henry Stephenson and Douglas Montgomery get a number of good scenes as the March family's neighbors. Edna May Oliver is well cast and it's only too bad that she did not get a couple more scenes. Paul Lukas makes Professor Baer come alive. By no means least are Jean Parker Frances Dee and Joan Bennett as Beth Meg and Amy.It is often easy to tell when the movie was made most especially because of the sound. But actually the production is better technically and artistically than are most movies of the early 1930s. Several of the sets are particularly well done creating just the right atmosphere for their scenes. Director George Cukor puts it all together nicely.This is the kind of movie that is generally out of style at present because it lacks the kind of selfindulgent material and the selfabsorbed style that so unduly impress many of today's movie fans. But the only genuine weakness is that it has a few technical limitations most of which are common to many films of its era.What this adaptation does offer is a sympathetic and sometimes insightful look at the lives of some ordinary but strong persons who are brought to life by a good cast and a director who seemed himself to care about the characters.".

It's my favorite performance of hers and that's saying something. The screenplay is firstrate winning the Oscar that year and most of the actors are just fine with Spring Byington a notable exception as Marmee. Director George Cukor did not want her in the film and he knew what he was talking about. But the wistful gentle Beth of Jean Parker and Edna May Oliver's crotchety Aunt March are awfully good . I've always been especially taken by the performance of Professor Bhaer in this version. Portrayed by an utterly charming Paul Lukas he embodies the professor with a threedimensionality that Louisa May Alcott didn't seem to want to bother with. His scene where he is criticizing the writings of Hepburn's Jo is extraordinary in how subtly it changes tonefrom critic  to wouldbe suitor. It ends with a look of longing from Lukas that only a director like Cukor would hold so long. Not like the 1994 version with a far too handsome Gabriel Byrne showing none of the uncertainty that an older poor scholar should show while falling in love with a young woman. Great stuff. Great director. Just a shame that the sound quality isn't up to the rest of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "George Cukor said once that he had always assumed Louisa May Alcott's classic to be a book that little girls read like 'Elsie Dinsmore' and he was pleasantly surprised by how solid and adult its themes are.

But it's a measure of this film's overwhelming rightness that over 70 years later it can still move grown men to tears.

	schema:headline " All Hepburn in this early rendition";
	schema:reviewBody "Few would deny the powerful presence of Katherine Hepburn in any movie she ever made. In this first screen adaptation with sound of Louisa May Alcott's famous novel Hepburn IS the movie. That is to say her part her lines her camera time seem to surpass the combined times of all the rest of the cast. While that may be as one would expect for many stories  a star or hero being the focal point of a whole work this film based on this book was supposed to be about several little women. So most of the rest of the characters in the film  save a neighbor male friend really get short shrift. For that reason and a few others I'll mention I think this rendition falls short of the interesting story told in the book. I would like to have seen more development of the sisters than this film has. The later remake  1949's MGM production does flesh out all the characters more. The problem with the overly heavy emphasis on the one character in this first movie is that the audience doesn't get much of a sense of who are the rest of the members of the family. So we can't so readily experience the ups and downs the emotions the tragedy and love felt between the sisters and their mother. Hepburn does a very good Jo but not great. I think her efforts to be the tomboy were overdone in a few instances which only drew my attention to this aspect of her role. She didn't seem to come by it naturally. One example was when she spoke a couple of times acting and deliberately mimicking a deepthroated guttural voice for a man. At other times she seemed to push it a bit and overact in flamboyance of tomboyish behavior. There were no other notable performances by other cast members. Paul Lukas as Professor Bhaer and Douglas Montgomery as Laurie were good. Most of the rest were just OK or nondescript. One member was just not right for the role of Marmee. Spring Byington brought no depth or real feel to the role that the viewer could sense. But then the film just seemed to glide over the lesser roles. Little Women is a good story in the American library and this film is enjoyable to watch. But for a much more involving and endearing film be sure to see the 1949 rendition by MGM.".

Other cast standouts include Edna May Oliver as Aunt March.  Laurie is a bit of a wet fish though.

This adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott classic has real heart warmth and the right amount of sentimentality amounting to a wonderful film. Katharine Hepburn stars as the tomboyish Jo a freespirited young lady who is dying for adventure but craves the time she spends with her sisters. The one that stands out among the four is Beth a caring sweet girl with a flair for the piano. If you don't get tearyeyed about her cause you definitely pass for a curmudgeon. The only complaint I have about this gem is that the last quarter of the film doesn't seem to have the matching effervescence that the rest of the film had. It ends abruptly and offbalance. All qualms aside this is a genuine classic filled with great performances and characters you can't help but like. A true family entertainment. Rating Three stars and a half.".

The sound here is a little too tinny and the Laurie of Douglass Montgommery is too fey for my tastes. However it still looks beautiful the costumes and hairstyles are well suited to the period the sets are sumptuous and the film is very handsomely shot. There is also a stirring score from Max Steiner making it sound appropriately nostalgic the script is faithful and warmtoned it is directed with great taste by George Cukor and the story has all the warmth and poignancy of the book which is one of my favourites of all time. Apart from Montgommery I loved the acting Edna May Oliver here does what she did best more than convincingly play sharptongued spinsters and Henry Stephenson is a dear Mr Laurence. Paul Lukas is an unexceptional but romantic Professor Bhaer an improvement on the wooden and tooItalianate Rosanno Brazzi in the 1949 film and Spring Byington a Marmee of real sincerity. The four March girls Meg Jo Beth and Amyaka the Little Women of the title are what drive the story and all four really shone here. Joan Bennett is appealing as Amy and leaves room for character growth from a vain little girl to an elegant young lady. Jean Parker is a very sweet and moving Beth and Frances Dee is beautiful as Meg should be. Best of all is the Jo of Katharine Hepburn who is perfectly cast in a role she was born to play. All in all truly lovely and the best version to me. 910 Bethany Cox".

And who could be a better Marmee than Mary Astor I ask you? She perfectly embodied maternal warmth and wisdom Spring Byington isn't exactly known for playing women of intelligence! None of the other actresses in this 1933 version made an impression on me. I realize that Jo is the most beloved character but the other March sisters deserve a little more screen time. I dislike the fact that Little Women was turned into a star vehicle for Katharine Hepburn and unfortunately she dominates the proceedings. If you want a more balanced telling of the story where all the characters get a chance to shine I'd recommend the MGM version. I can't gush enough about how ideal June Allyson was as Jo  there's a reason she got more fanmail over that performance than any other! I'd even recommend the Winona Ryder version of Little Women over Hepburn's although Ryder is too pretty for the role".

However in comparison the older version is just pretty dreadful. Much of it is because the story is MUCH more subtle and believable in the newer filmand this is odd coming from me because I adore classic Hollywood films and would have expected to prefer the original as I hate remakes. But the newer one is believable and sweetwhereas the 1933 version is at times just awful. Now I know this might sound like sacrilege as it was directed by the great George Cukor and starred Katharine Hepburn. But neither was on top of their gameespecially Hepburn. There's little indication in her overly broad performance here that she'd one day be a multiple Academy award winner. Here she talks VERY fast and seems rather fake. As for the rest of the cast they are okaybut the film lacks charm and polish. Watchable but do yourself a favor and watch the more recent oneyou won't feel sorry.".

It mostly centers on Joshe's expected to get married to Laurie Douglass Montgomery but she wants a career as a writer also. Faithful to the book beautifully mounted and directed by George Cukor who was always good with large female casts and a mostly great cast.  Hepburn is exceptional no surprise there Bennett and Dee are good but Parker isn't that good.  She's not terribleit's just she's not as good as the other three.  The men are all OK but the movie isn't about themit's about the women.  I'm giving it a 9.  I can't give it a 10 because there are a few scenes that are just horrible especially one where Parker sees her father returning from the war and it goes on a bit longer than needed.  Also the sound was hard to hear at times but this WAS done over 70 years ago.  Well worth seeing.".

I am a great fan of the book and as such there were some things that irked me about this film. First off there was heaps of Amy story lines and dialogue the most apparent being how she burnt Jo's written work and books and then later nearly drowned only to live after Laurie and Jo saved her were left out which made me slightly mad. Also the fact that the actress was too old to play the younger Amy but nonetheless played her very very well was also slightly distracting though didn't nearly as bother me as much as the missing 'book burning scene'. Secondly some things were hastily rushed into andor not really explained or came out of nowhere like how Amy and Laurie were suddenly married with out much back story to it. Katherine Hepburn one of the most talented actresses of all time shines as Jo in her tom boyish ways. She literally stole the show with her acting and it was truly a joy to watch her scenes with Laurie were the most wonderful as you could really sense their 'fun and childlike' plays. She picked up Jo's character in a way no other actress could. It seemed like the character 'Jo' and 'Katherine Hepburn' were made for each other. It's rare to find that. When I first heard Frances Dee was playing Meg I thought 'What?? She's more of a Beth!' but nevertheless she surprised me and was absolutely wonderful in her role. The actress who played Beth was astounding her scenes were so well done she was such a dear and you really care for her while you're watching. I loved Douglass Montgomery as Laurie he played Laurie very well and very true to the character. Not the most perfect adaption a lot has been changed and left out but one of the best most beautiful films you'll ever see in your life time. Heart warming and lovable a real classic.".

Kate becomes the quintessential Jo March in this film and CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS she does a bang up job.I can't see George Cukor doing this with anyone else. In a sense Kate isn't acting she really is a 20th century version of Jo March. Like Louisa May Alcott and her family Kate comes from that Puritan New England background and in the 19th century she could have been Jo March. It would not surprise me in the slightest if back in the day Kate's grandparents from either or both sides hobnobbed with the Alcott clan.Little Women is set during the Civil War and it was a time for sacrifice on the battlefield as well as the home front. The March family patriarch Samuel S. Hinds is now engaged in the 'irrepressible conflict' answering to a higher law than the Constitution. That was a day when people put themselves on the line for their country and what they believed in.Spring Byington made her screen debut as the mother of four girls who in real life were not too much younger than the woman they called Marmee in this film. Hepburn Joan Bennett Frances Dee and Jean Parker bring to life the distinct personalities of all the March girls under the careful guidance of George Cukor.Like Louisa May Alcott in life Jo March loves her dad not just as her father but also for what he stands for. Alcott's father Bronson Alcott was a noted abolitionist and so was Louisa May. She leaves no room for doubt that the Union and the abolition of slavery is a righteous cause in Little Women. Alcott was a feminist and a suffragette as well she wanted to do more for what she believed than provide warm home and hearth for some man who happened to believe as she did. Hepburn as Jo is developing as a human being and she realizes she wants the same thing and she also knows there's more out there than New England and its mores. Small wonder that visiting scholar Paul Lukas is who eventually wins her affections.By the way one ought to either read the further Alcott novels on these characters andor see the film Little Men with Kay Francis and Francis Lederer as older versions of these same characters to see how they've developed.Besides Lukas and Hinds the three other prominent male characters are Douglass Montgomery as the dashing young neighbor next door who first sparks Hepburn's attention and later Bennett's John Davis Lodge who pairs off with Frances Dee and Henry Stephenson Montgomery's stern father with a broad eye twinkle.And of course we can't forget the ever imperious Edna May Oliver as Aunt March who rules the roost whenever she makes one of her visits to the household. Oliver like Hepburn also had a New England background she's as New England as Paul Revere and the Boston Red Sox. With an excellent recreation of New England both in look and style George Cukor created an enduring masterpiece in Little Women. And probably even more than Morning Glory it's the film that young Katharine Hepburn is most identified with.".

It stars Katharine Hepburn in one of her early defining roles as Josephine 'Jo' March the central protagonist. She's very much a defiant tomboy in petticoats defying her Aunt March played to perfection by the crotchety Edna May Oliver cutting off her long tresses to pay for her father's train ticket and always 'always' usurping any and all interest to fall into the trap of becoming some man's noble wifeat least for a while. Despite the fact that Alcott's novel is very much an ensemble piece about four girls growing up this film is very much the story of Jo. Other roles are rounded out by Joan Bennett as the vane and snooty Amy Paul Lukas Prof. Baer Jean Parker in the thankless role of Beth and Francis Dee as the impetuous Meg.Clearly with the goal of generating star interest in Kate Hepburn director George Cukor uses up the bulk of his running time to extol the idiosyncratic quirks that make Jo March tick. He delights for example showing us Jo sliding down the banister at her Aunt March's home or throwing snowballs at the young master of the adjoining maison Theodore Lawrence Douglas Montgomery. Cukor known throughout the industry as a woman's director side steps Alcott's novel on more than one occasion to satisfy his own artistic vision. That said overall then the film is faithful to Alcott and a veritable lush and lovely cinematic experience in the vein of golden Hollywood film making.The transfer from Warner Bros. has been considerably cleaned up for this DVD presentation. The BW picture elements from RKO were in very poor shape. While certain scenes continue to attest to this lack of initial preservation most look quite marvelous and will surely please. There is a bit of digital edge enhancement that crops up now and then and distracts one from the otherwise sterling picture but these are fleeting moments of distraction at best. Blacks are generally solid. Whites are generally clean. Contrast and fine details are as they should be and film grain with minor exceptions is kept in check. Extras include a music only selection of score that has been nicely remastered as well as extensive notes on both Hepburn and Cukor good stuff for both the heart and the mind. Bottom line this is a great golden oldie that will surely warm the heart. But it's not definitive Alcott. For that one has to jump seventy years into the future for Gillian Armstrong's masterful remake starring Winona Ryder.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Our Katherine had already been a success in one prior film and only 5 years into the era of talkies they retooled Alcott's story to suit her personality. It worked but was her last success until the intense reengineering of the Philadelphia story.That reengineering was a massive change Hepburn recast as richly eccentric rather than charmingly brash. For her entire life she was amazingly incomplete as an actress but knew how to play the personality game she overtly derided. But this was all before that.Here she moves with exaggerated movements and a severe phrasing of her lines. That specific style was consciously adopted from Shirley Temple and long after Hepburn had abandoned it popularized by Judy Garland. It features short phrases with a rising lilt but short of the questioning tone that submissive girls use today.Cukor stages this much like a play with some extraordinarily long takes. The stagey nature of the production is as far from life and realistic movies as Jo's parlor play was from the world of the story. The sound is murky and the lighting muddy.The film was popular because it sweetens the book in absurd ways. Louisa May was an important writer one that really did change the world in a way. Her tone was one of disciplined selfreinvention orthogonal to all the false romanticism of the age. The notable feature of Little Women' was that Jo unexpectedly escaped the form of the Austen novel and thereby the strictures of society that Austen emphasized. This was not a matter of brattish tomboy energy as Hepburn would have it but a matter of a woman transcending the narrow channels available to her sisters.Just as Hepburn gets this exactly the opposite of what Jo is about so does the whole film spit in Alcott's eye. The very essence of the book is to escape the formula of syrupy romanticism. The target of this film is to be thoroughly syrupy all the way to the repellent sweetness of the score.Winona's Women' was flawed in different ways but more true to Bronson Alcott's vision. Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.".

The stagey nature of the production is as far from life and realistic movies as Jo's parlor play was from the world of the story. The sound is murky and the lighting muddy.The film was popular because it sweetens the book in absurd ways. Louisa May was an important writer one that really did change the world in a way. Her tone was one of disciplined selfreinvention orthogonal to all the false romanticism of the age. The notable feature of Little Women' was that Jo unexpectedly escaped the form of the Austen novel and thereby the strictures of society that Austen emphasized. This was not a matter of brattish tomboy energy as Hepburn would have it but a matter of a woman transcending the narrow channels available to her sisters.Just as Hepburn gets this exactly the opposite of what Jo is about so does the whole film spit in Alcott's eye. The very essence of the book is to escape the formula of syrupy romanticism. The target of this film is to be thoroughly syrupy all the way to the repellent sweetness of the score.Winona's Women' was flawed in different ways but more true to Bronson Alcott's vision. Ted's Evaluation  1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.";

Joan Bennett is sulky and kittenish as the selfish Amy filling the part but she really wasn't to come into her own as a presence that registered on the screen for about five more years when she switched from blonde ingnue to brunette woman of mystery and usually danger. The great Edna May Oliver scores as the salty Aunt March and Spring Byington is strong as Marmee although her role is somewhat diminished from the book. It's interesting still to see her here as a tower of strength and rectitude considering her long career as a chic but usually addlepated society woman. The men however are a totally different matter. Douglass Montgomery as Laurie is simpering and bland. Also while it isn't his fault his makeup is so heavy that it is completely distracting whenever he is on screen. John Davis Lodge who plays Meg's husband Mr. Brooke suffers the same fate. Cukor as always directs well.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps Mickey Rourkes' final great performance BARFLY sees him as prolific writerpoet Henry Chinaski who rejects conformity in every day society and believes it to be frustratingly fake. As a result he is a drunk and prefers to hang out with 'all his friends' in a regular bar by getting into fights whilst the crowd pays the winner no guesses as to what he spends his money on until he meets a 'strange girl' at a bar Wanda Faye Dunway. The two instantly click both are intelligent indivuals who reject over regularity in every day passive conversation Dunaway 'I hate people don't you? Rourke 'I don't mind them but I seem to feel better when they're not around'. The two form an instant freindshiprelationship because of one major primary function that can keep them together drink. A researcher who picks up talented writers like Henry enters the frame and falls for him due to his prolific writing and offers him a place in 'the good life' with her but Henry rejects this when she tells him he will 'grow into it' Rourke growing is for plants I hate roots.BARFLY manages to do something profound that so many films fail to do in showing us that conformity isn't suited to intelligent open minded creative individuals like Henry. Rourke excels himself in this role it's as good a performance but a completely different one from his role in ANGEL HEART starring in 3 great films including RUMBLE FISH really doesn't do him justice he was the best of his generation in the 80's. He plays Henry not unlike how Jeff Bridges plays Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski in THE BIG LEBOWSKI I'd be very surprised if the Coens didn't take inspiration from this film and fans of that particular film should also check this out as some one who you would consider to be an every day loser but is probably a darn sight more smarter than you believe them to be as well as having a self serving purpose for the life they have chosen to live. Faye Dunaway as usual is uniformly excellent as Henrys loverdrinking partner managing to convey an aura of sassiness and casual sophistication and who has also chosen to take this particular path in life for a reason the same as Henry's. The chemistry between these two leads is astounding and the script is pitch perfect with dozens of memorable lines Dunway 'Whatever happens don't expect me to fall in love with you' Rourke 'That's ok nobody has ever fallen in love with me anyway'. To me at least Rourke's performance as Henry is the single most likeable character created in any film and it stays with you long after the film is over. Touching funny and profound a minor masterpiece a 'nice' film I RECOMMEND IT!".

	schema:reviewBody "What can we say about Barfly? A great picture. That's what we can say. A friend of mine recommended Barfly to me. I watched the start and it said Some people never go crazy what truly horrible lives they must live! After that I was hooked I knew this guy Bukowski wrote from the gut. I bought as many Bukowski books as possible. Pulp Hollywood and Women my favourite!. I like his novels and short stories more than the poetry. But some of the poems are intense! The movie is also excellent. The two leads are greatFaye Dunaway is in high acting form here. So is Mickey Roarke who seems to have gotten under Bukowski's skin for the role......a side note he did the movie sober! This movie is directed by Barbet Schroeder who also did Reversal of Fortune. He also made the 4 hour Charles Bukowski Tapes which I own and it is good but way too long! Bukowski drinks and reads poems. Back to the filmgood supporting actors in this one. The beautiful Alice Krige from Haunted Summer is in this as well as David Lynch regular Jack Nance. Lynch was actually on set one day. Bukowski has a funny cameo a barfly in the bar where Mickey meets Faye. I heard that Dennis Hopper wanted to direct this and have Sean Penn star. Schroeder fought hard for it though. Hopper states Schroeder couldn't direct traffic! I guess he proved him wrong. Schroeder went into a production office with a power saw and threatened to cut off his pinky finger if they didn't put more funding into the film. Obviously a labour of love. So check it out if you can the writing is top notch stuff.......Highly recommended. Thanx.".

As a matter of a fact I often find it the downfall of some biopics where the physicality may be captured but the meat and potatoes of the character's are often left by the wayside. Not so in the instance of Barfly. Rourke nailed BukowskiChinaski's crazy alcoholic free spiritedness brilliantly I felt. There was a humor a tenderness a coldness a twisted romanticism and a bleakness all wrapped into a greasy overweight Rourke pulled a De Niro gaining weight and not bathing months before the film's shooting package you could almost smell from the theater seats.Faye Dunaway as the aging sad beautiful barfly Wanda gives a performance that yet again reminds us why she is a cinematic legend in her own time! She plays the subtleties and intricacies of Wanda with such aplomb offering even this  the most pathetic of her roles  a dignity and a sad beauty that not many actresses can pull off.The casting of this film deserves a round of applause! I've tended bar and worked in the sorts of joints where these all too real people can be found and I felt as if I was right there again pouring shots of bourbon polishing glasses and making certain that the brawls boiling in the bar get taken to the streets. Frank Stallone's swaggering bullyofabar tender machoman Eddie is hilarious! Gloria LeRoy as Grandma Moses the ancient prostitute infamous for her ability to swallow paste is priceless. I could go on and on but I won't! Bukowski's male character counterpart is a macho beer swilling bare knuckle fighting farting kind of man who some may not appreciate considering that outside of the seedier bars in North America these types of fellas are a dying breed. With males being forcefed the oversensitive turn the other cheek annoyingly metro sexual kinds of roles models and ideals these days it must be a strange look back over the evolutionary shoulder for some men to see the realities of people like Bukowski! Don't get me wrong  I'm not applauding all of the Chinaski character's behaviors but I think that some guys could learn a thing or two about themselves from the worst example of the diametric opposite of what they've been told they should be. Sometimes a fight has to be  sometimes it's just plain pathetic and both examples can be found in Barfly.Bukowski has always dared to put to page whatever entered his head and did so with a twisted lovely flourish.Barbet Schroeder the man behind such brilliant and critically acclaimed films such as More 1969 his work with director as JeanLuc Godard his contribution to French Nouvelle Vague or New Wave cinema and his more mainstream flicks such as Single White Female places him in a category above many directors working in North America today.With Barfly Schroeder captures the gritty realities of lives given over to the excesses of substances and circumstances in a truetolife way as he did with his first film More a flick about heroin addiction done at a time when the subject was still considered very taboo. The musical score for Barfly supports this film perfectly too with the Hammond organ whirling out Booker T. Jones' Hip Hug Her as we P.O.V. our way through the film's first scene past the bar sign to the bar's door and into the world of Henry Chinaski. This is all counterpointed wonderfully by the use of Mozart and Beethoven under Rourke's voiceovers of Chinaski's writing.To sum it all up  as much as I dig and respect Bukowski I have to say that even though he wasn't a fan of the flick long after its release I may add and he was on set as an adviser and unaccredited cast member  why didn't he say something at the time? I look at this movie as a wee gem and as a masterpiece daring enough to capture life's underbelly with an acuteness and accuracy many wouldn't dare to put to screen.T.Paulwww.tpaul.com".

And you can't help but do a mental double take on many of the lines of dialogue Rourke's character with a sort of beat hipness really makes you think about your own life and your own values. The only flaw I could find was that considering the incredible amount of drinking that is depicted I felt it would have been more realistic to show Henry and Wanda having more horrible hangovers maybe even with frequent vomiting attacks. But then again maybe these are two people who really know how to hold their liquor. See it and decide for yourself!P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "Barfly is not a comedy in the unoriginal meaning of the word this one really takes you by surprise and writes your laughs in bold and capital letters. Experiencing Barfly is like finding a jewel in a trash can or meeting Scarlett Johansen alone in a cheap motel room...Mickey Rourke portrays Henry Chinaski a barfly buzzing around from a waterhole A to a waterhole B. For the bartenders among them Eddy the one he fights every night Henry is a real pain in the ass how ironic that he also walks as if he had one. And with his Brandolike eyes Henry seems to look at both nowhere and everywhere ignoring but understanding the real world with real as the derogatory synonym of obviousness dullness hypocrisy ... and when he meets Faye Dunaway no wire hangers this time but some priceless hangovers I guarantee it's the perfect cocktail of cynical poetry and endearing trashiness served to you on the rocks. Still this is the only alcoholic experience that doesn't leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth for the film is so wasted you wish you could have wasted more time watching it.The movie is written by Charles Bukowski one of the most original authors of the last century a man who gave to the trashiest and lowest life of American streets the letters of an inner nobility that no one could see except the unfortunate or were they? misfits who belonged to that gripping underworld. I wish I could have said that from my readings of some Bukowski's poems or novels but it's been my whole life since I just knew about this man and if one thing Barfly is my first immersion in the world of this poet who stinks the sweet perfume of truth and not the one that awakens some repressed suicidal tendencies through a solemn voice over. In Barfly truth is delivered through Henry's nasal voice with a musicality singing that life is too serious to be taken seriously  and the genius of the script is how unpretentiously but seriously hilarious it is.You literally savor the script like a sweet red and juicy appetizer starting with the most significant quote the film's tagline Some people never go crazy  what truly horrible lives they must live! Henry is not right because it's naturally better to be crazy his sentence exceeds his own personal comprehension of craziness the point is not to be crazy like Henry but the way we'd love to be every once in a while. The taste of life differs from one person to another. Henry's nonsense speaks true statements about human nature with the same lucidity that governs our hearts when we've just taken one drop too much. Realization is the first step in the road for wisdom while most of us resist to the blinding flash of realization Henry can't think of what he wants to be because he's already too tired of thinking of what he doesn't want to be. Henry subtly mirrors our condition as people who not only know but actually ARE what they don't want to be.Henry can do nothing but drink sleep fight and write... still he's not a loser hell how can you be a loser if you've got nothing to lose? The rest of his life consists on a bunch of can't but aware he is and care he doesn't while our masochistic registration to a mediocre formula of life deprived us from the same kind of freespirited awareness. We try to forget our condition by reassuring ourselves with an ersatz of normality just to be accepted by the boring majority. Anyone can get a job. It takes a man to make it without working. Henry's eternal drunkenness injected in his brains an extraordinary view on life so insightful and pertinent he's the kind of modern prophet you'd constantly wonder what he'd think about anything. And one thing for sure you'd trade the three quarters of your Facebook friends for one night where you could cheer with Henry while he raises his glass of scotch and shouts To my friends! And that's the true spirit of Barfly it doesn't trash your life and talks to you in a patronizing way it doesn't tease your brains again it doesn't take itself seriously. That's what cruelly lacks in today's films I'd rather watch a movie where a bunch of true losers are having a good time than a bunch of dangerous losers creating a sort of fascist 'fighting' group to show the world they exist. What's so important in today's world anyway to seek the pride of being part of something of belonging networking socializing? Why the need to collect friends and masturbating over an artificial popularity when all you can have are ephemeral but sincere moments of fun with authentic human beings.Barfly doesn't take itself seriously but doesn't lie either the ways of truth are impenetrable and often choose the least likely avenues. And Barfly works like a reverse fantasy attracting us to the bottom finding the inner beauty of life in the freedom of action of spirit and more than anything belonging to nothing but a true community of ephemeral friends for ephemeral pleasures. No class no social category no people no bourgeois being an outcast and even a disgrace is a luxury providing the most honest vision on the world not diluted by personal or political bias. You can't be an artist if you're not an outcast and on that level Chinasky is more than an artist he's a genuine genius  So if only for Rourke's spectacular performance for the witty script for the so enjoyably cheerful mood and its gallery of colorful and likable characters not to mention the beautiful shots on Dunaway's sexy legs  this movie deserves to be consumed without moderation. Cheers!".

In his drunken haze he can write poems poems that come from somewhere in his pickled brain that are the stuff of genius. When a private detective learns of this he is sent to capture Henrys work in an attempt give evidence of his talent.

Welcome to the world of Henry Chinaski the alter ego of social realist writer Charles Bukowski. If you're a Bukowski fan this is the ultimate picture for you!Barfly is a love story in the light drama genre. It follows the trials and tribulations of a true drunken barfly as he floats from place to place in the streets of East Hollywood. Chinaski is played by Mickey Rourke The Wrestler Angel Heart. Back in the '80s Mickey Rourke was like a poor man's Bogart and he shines as the alcoholic writer. He's a flop and a loser starving artist type but despite all this he has two women in his life. One is a high class publisher the other is a depressed lush. They represent the two sides of Chinaski and his two lives. He would define himself by his habits drinking and writing but the world would remember him for his voice. The story behind the story is told in the pages of Hollywood Bukowski's recounting of the making of Barfly. Legend has it director Barbet Shroeder Single White Female Murder by Numbers threatened to cut off his own finger to make this picture. It was hard to get funding for what was considered to be an art house picture. One of the producers was Francis Ford Coppola The Godfather Apocalypse Now. Barfly tells a small story. The plot is thin but it is more of a character study. Barfly has style. It's based on the eponymous book by Bukowski. If you can't get enough of Chinaski he's back in Factotum as well as many of the novels of Charles Bukowskithe real life Barfly.".

If you can't get enough of Chinaski he's back in Factotum as well as many of the novels of Charles Bukowskithe real life Barfly.";

On the third call Schroeder manages to say a little bit more Will you write a screenplay for 22000.00? This time Bukowski stays on the line.In a film that has countless problems I think this is the most outstanding. The script fails to capture the same unrefined vigor and beat of Bukowski's writing. The stylized verse is there but the foundation is not. Watching the film I wondered if Bukowski really wrote it the film feels more like someone attempting to write a Bukowskiesque character study.Barbet Schroeder claims that Bukowski is his favorite author but his film seems to entirely miss that nail in favor of the clichd and asinine. The true potential of this disjointed narrative can only be glimpsed at in shortlived scenes The bookend opening and closing sequence Wanda placing a crucifix under her pillow and Chinaski cleaning his wounds with Scotch. These sequences play out wonderfully but scenes with similar potential are squandered by Schroeder's unambiguous attempts to make certain the audience gets it. The scene with the Pegasus is destroyed in this fashion.Faye Dunaway and Mickey Rourke turn in inconsistent mediocre performances. Rourke's interpretation of Bukowski is below par and superficial and Dunaway Wanda comes off like a stock character.The Biggest disappointment for me was Robby Mller. Films like Breaking the Waves 1996 Dead Man 1995 Mystery Train 1989 and Paris Texas 1984 are just a small sample of Mller's cinematography. Barfly is a visual failure compared to the level of work Mller is capable of delivering.I don't know if the shortcomings of this film can be credited to Bukowski's sellingout or if the blame should be placed on Schroeder. Either way the result was a secondrate filmic voyage into the world of cheap bars lonesomeness and alcoholism.".

	schema:reviewBody "A sports caris a sign of man's virility. You should get two maybe.  Peter Sellers to Woody Allen'What's New Pussycat?' is not a great movie. There isn't much in the way of a plot it's constructed haphazardly and parts of it don't make a lot of sense. That's part of its charm. 'The Pink Panther' from the same era also has a large recognizable hugely talented cast and it's a much more coherent technically proficient film. It is also less funny. Just in case you've never seen anything about the movie before Peter O'Toole plays Michael a magazine writer and philanderer in mid1960's Paris. His dilemma dramatic conflict if you will is Carol Romy Schneider a woman he loves so much he wants to be faithful to her if indeed he can give up all other women and marry her. Other women include Paula Prentiss Capucine and Ursula Andress Woody Allen is the friend with the not so secret crush on Carol. Michael's psychoanalyst is played by Peter Sellers which should tell you about as much as you need to know. WNP? has a mood created in large part by the Bacharach score that I don't want to call innocent because it tries so hard to be naughty but there it is. The drug culture hadn't yet picked up the cultural grip released by post50's paranoia and a sloppy silly picture like this seemed to be a good idea. And that's enough of that a movie that contains the line 'it's my wife  the creature that ate Europe' shouldn't be overanalyzed. Enjoy it for what it is.".

	onyx:emotionText "A sports caris a sign of man's virility. You should get two maybe.  Peter Sellers to Woody Allen'What's New Pussycat?' is not a great movie. There isn't much in the way of a plot it's constructed haphazardly and parts of it don't make a lot of sense. That's part of its charm. 'The Pink Panther' from the same era also has a large recognizable hugely talented cast and it's a much more coherent technically proficient film. It is also less funny. Just in case you've never seen anything about the movie before Peter O'Toole plays Michael a magazine writer and philanderer in mid1960's Paris. His dilemma dramatic conflict if you will is Carol Romy Schneider a woman he loves so much he wants to be faithful to her if indeed he can give up all other women and marry her. Other women include Paula Prentiss Capucine and Ursula Andress Woody Allen is the friend with the not so secret crush on Carol. Michael's psychoanalyst is played by Peter Sellers which should tell you about as much as you need to know. WNP? has a mood created in large part by the Bacharach score that I don't want to call innocent because it tries so hard to be naughty but there it is. The drug culture hadn't yet picked up the cultural grip released by post50's paranoia and a sloppy silly picture like this seemed to be a good idea. And that's enough of that a movie that contains the line 'it's my wife  the creature that ate Europe' shouldn't be overanalyzed. Enjoy it for what it is.";

	schema:reviewBody "Is it significant that the demographic group who most likes What's New Pussycat? are males under the age of 18 and the group who likes it the least are females over the age of 45? I have to admit that as a male although far closer to over 45 than under 18 What's New Pussycat? somewhat resembles my fantasies of utopia which would involve a lot of wanton polyamory. But I can't judge a film just on how much I like its freewheeling ethics and its regular presentation of beautiful women. What's New Pussycat? is often funny and occasionally hilarious but it also has a lot of plot and direction problems enough so that by the time the big climax arrives it feels more like just another random sequence instead of the climax it should feel like subtextual fuel for the antipolyamory crowd's fire? The story turns out to be centered on a handsome man Michael James Peter O'Toole who attracts women even more than he's attracted to them. He calls them all pussycat and that's about all he needs to do to have them ready to jump into bed with him. He's most in love with Carole Werner Romy Schneider who keeps pressuring him to get married but he isn't ready to ditch his polyamorous ways and he doesn't want to cheat on her after they're married. Michael's psychoanalyst Dr. Fritz Fassbender Peter Sellers is also something of a womanizer but women don't seem to like him near as much. Michael is also an acquaintance of Victor Shakapopulis Woody Allen who is moderately successful with women but most importantly he is also in love with Carole. The plot involves various sticky situations so to speak between these characters and various ancillary characters.In addition to appearing as a costar Woody Allen wrote the script. This was his first real film. He had done a short called The Laughmaker in 1962 and a lot of television prior to What's New Pussycat? and of course he had done a lot of standup. The script is good at least on the trees level as opposed to the forest level and Allen's performance in his first film makes it easy to see how he became such a big star. He steals the film whenever he appears. O'Toole who I've never been a very big fan of tends to come across with an odd combination of stiffness and pretentiousness despite Allen's good writing. Sellers seems as if director Clive Donner kept him in check a bit too much and subsequently can seem lost. But Allen's now famous stock film personality shines through in his scenes. Performing his own comedy even though he didn't direct Allen's scenes flow seem natural have perfect timing and are very funny.Still it might be difficult to not blame Allen for some of the overall messiness of the storyon the forest level. Donner starts with a scene that may be attractive visuallyit features Sellers and his Wagnerian Viking wife bickering in their unusual home shot from a wide angle so we can see the entire front of the house while they run around to from room to room stairway to stairwaybut the unusualness doesn't seem to have much point dramatically. That's indicative of problems to come. Donner too frequently blocks and shoots scenes at unfortunate angles. And there are far too many scenes that seem to be there just to be groovy or unusual but they drag down the plot sometimes almost grinding it to a halt.As the film progresses the complex relationships involving many different parties can become confusing. It doesn't help that some actors change their looksuch as cutting their hairas the film unfolds. Ancillary characters can come and go without warning and with little explanation. The climax depends on a large number of people heading to the same location but for half of them it's not at all clear why they head there they just announce that they're going. The climax is still a bit funny and it's one of the better and more complexly staged sequences but it doesn't have anything like the impact it should. Storywise the film feels over before the climax even arrives.As I just mentioned in my more favorable review of the same year's Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine the 1960s because of a number of factors including the near nonexistent application of the dreaded Hays Production Code at this point and a general social atmosphere of experimentation resulted in films that tended to be sprawling and experimental in their approach to such basics as plot. What's New Pussycat? is a prime example. It often becomes clear that plot is being played with in a way that leads to occasional abandonment. In a way What's New Pussycat? is more just a collection of skits or scenarios with a loosely related theme. While I'm a fan of experimentation and I admire the looseygoosey streamofconsciousness attitude suggested and Allen certainly satisfies my taste for absurdism in some of his scenarios such as his birthday dinner the fact remains that in this case the plot experimentation just doesn't quite work.The final judgment however is that I slightly recommend What's New Pussycat? but primarily to see Allen's scenes and enjoy the writing of his scenarios. There are other attractors and interesting aspects including the fact that Ursula Andress has probably never looked better than she does here although she's looked as good but like an unfortunate many of these 1960s madcap comedies What's New Pussycat? should be approached with a bit of caution.".

It takes place in Paris  and it is almost as much mess as Casino...  is  silly naive and often simply ridiculous but somehow it works after all these years. One of the reasons I believe is Allen's script the dialogs and oneliners that are hilarious. This time Allen received more screen time that in Casino.... and he made his scenes very funny.

In the '60s most of what was done was big  big historical dramas big western dramas big international comedies and done on a smaller scale the sex comedies like Sex and the Single Girl.What's New Pussycat was an international sex comedy with the usual huge well known cast Peter Sellers Romy Schneider Peter O'Toole Ursula Andress Paula Prentiss Capucine with a cameo by Richard Burton. This was Woody Allen's first produced film script and his first film role. It wasn't a happy experience.Peter O'Toole plays Michael James the British editor of a Paris magazine He is in love with Carole Schneider. She wants to get married but he can't commit to her. Women are constantly after him and he is constantly giving in.He sees one Dr. Fritz Fassbender Sellers who wants Michael's life particularly one of his patient Renee Capucine. Carole meanwhile is friendly with Michael's friend Victor Allen who is crazy about her and also wants Michael's life. The whole thing converges at the Chteau Chantel one weekend. This film is purportedly based on the love life of Warren Beatty and the title taken from the way he answered the phone. He obviously did not wind up making the film. Peter Sellers adlibbed through a great deal of the movie and took all of Woody Allen's funny lines diminishing Allen's part. The two of them loathed one another.What's New Pussycat started out hilariously with funny dialogue and situations. As it went on it became more and more of an annoying mess and went out of control culminating in a Keystone Kops type scene that was very funny. However what preceded it was disorganized insanity.There definitely are funny scenes and good performances. Paula Prentiss is especially good as is Allen. Sellers is great until he seems to veer off of the script. I'm not sure if Peter O'Toole did his own stunts but some of what he did was fantastic  the role called for him to be very physical. He was quite funny. Romy Schneider as usual was the straight man to this chicanery.Watch in the bar scene where Peter O'Toole and a man talk and O'Toole says give my best to what'shername  it's Richard Burton and the what'shername is guess who. Very cute. I like slapstick I like madcap but I like it structured so I'm not the best judge of this. I prefer the MGM Marx Brothers to the Paramount ones for instance. This was hard to take after a while.".

As it went on it became more and more of an annoying mess and went out of control culminating in a Keystone Kops type scene that was very funny. However what preceded it was disorganized insanity.There definitely are funny scenes and good performances. Paula Prentiss is especially good as is Allen. Sellers is great until he seems to veer off of the script. I'm not sure if Peter O'Toole did his own stunts but some of what he did was fantastic  the role called for him to be very physical. He was quite funny. Romy Schneider as usual was the straight man to this chicanery.Watch in the bar scene where Peter O'Toole and a man talk and O'Toole says give my best to what'shername  it's Richard Burton and the what'shername is guess who. Very cute. I like slapstick I like madcap but I like it structured so I'm not the best judge of this. I prefer the MGM Marx Brothers to the Paramount ones for instance. This was hard to take after a while.";

	schema:reviewBody "WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT? was a popular ticket in 1965but when seen outside the context of its era it emerges as a slightly choppy slightly slapdash film long on froth and short on actual amusement.Originally written by Woody Allen as a vehicle for Warren Beatty both script and cast underwent a mighty change before it reached the screen so much so that the experience prompted Allen to swear he'd never allow any one but himself to direct one of his scripts in the future. The story revolves around Michael James Peter O'Toole a handsome man who wants to marry Carol Romy Schneider but can't stop sleeping around long enough to make a commitment. He accordingly goes to psychiatrist Dr. Fritz Fassbender Peter Sellerswho is a sexcrazed nut in pursuit of patient Renee Capucine. Before the dust settles Woody Allen Paula Prentiss Ursla Andress and Edra Gale are added to the mix.O'Toole and Sellers are hardly challenged by the material and Allen introduces his I'm a New York neurotic screen persona for the first timebut it is really the abundance of supporting actresses that give the film what little zing it still retains. Romy Schnieder was among Europe's greatest stars and finest actresses of her era although the script offers her little she is charming indeed. Much the same can be said of the legendary Capucine in the role of a worldweary nymphomaniac Ursula Andress who arrives in the film via parachute and bovine Edra Gale who runs riot in Wagnerian attire. But the real scene stealer is Paula Prentiss.Although extremely attractive Prentiss was originally typed as a second lead of the Eve Arden typebut she quickly graduated to neurotic comedy roles for which she had a truly unique flair. WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT? finds her at the top of her form as the interestinglynamed Liz Bien who writes bad poetry has a tendency to overdose on pills every time she goes to the bathroom and who attaches herself to the muchharassed Peter O'Toole. It really is a performance that transcends the material and which lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.The DVD release is third rate with mediocre visual elements and sound so uneven that I constantly adjusted the volume as I watched. When all is said and done this is really a film for hardcore fans of its various starsand especially for Paula Prentiss. If for no other reason the film is worth watching for her alone.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

His analyst Dr. Fassbender Sellers and friend Victor Allen watch in jealous rage.Sellers was just coming off a nearfatal heart attack and maybe trying too hard to show he still had game. As Fassbender he leaps shrieks rolls on the carpet yet still seems half the man he was in films like Waltz Of The Toreadors and The Millionairess. He's amusing but underrealized with lines that stretch for laughs he doesn't always get. You're a monster and a monster in that order he bellows at his heavyset wife. Huh?O'Toole was a sensation at this time from more serious roles seeing him cut up like this slamming his skull against doors and slipping off stairs was a revelation and a marker for later comic turns in better films. Here he struggles with a role conceived for Warren Beatty looking almost constipated as one lovely after another drapes herself over him. Women have always overcome my basic shyness he explains.Allen was the new guy here and for that you almost want to cut him some slack. He could have done worse for a first script like say Stardust Memories or Hollywood Ending. But watching Woody trying to be funny can be almost as painful as watching him try to be serious. This can't work he has one early conquest tell Michael. I'm 34 and you're 12.A more central problem than the three mentioned above were two others behind the camera. Director Clive Donner kills some of the funnier bits with lame blocking an opening featuring Fassbinder and his wife arguing in a series of dizzying zoom shots sets the chaotic tone and allows O'Toole to be lit so green at times he appears malarial.Producer Charles K. Feldman seemed more interested in creating happenings than films throwing together talents at random and letting whatever they came up with dictate the final product. In one scene we watch a badly overacting Allen try to kill O'Toole in a sauna yet the next scene has O'Toole alive and dry in an unrelated grouppsychoanalysis scene. I can't write about the ending not because it would be a spoiler but because I have no idea what it was about. Neither will you.There's a handful of witty lines in Pussycat sometimes even two in a row. That BacharachHal David music is tremendous listening. Tom Jones scored the hit title song but the songs Here I Am Dionne Warwick and My Little Red Book Manfred Mann are even better the latter especially when danced to by the gorgeous Paula Prentiss.Prentiss is the most beautiful woman I've seen in movies  until she opens her mouth. You could say that Pussycat suffers from a similar issue pretty from a distance annoying closeup. It has so much sex appeal it's almost angering how casually it disappoints.".

Paula Prentiss feather dress and her culottes big in 1965are really nice to see. I'm glad that there are others here who do truly love this movie as this film just reeks of the Sixties and the Sixties was my favourite decade of all time.  This is a movie which could have only been made in the Sixties and as such stands as a good testament of what a truly amazing and anarchic period of time that it was. However I wish that this film had been a lot better than what it was. It's not as funny as it should have been not withstanding some great one liners is she prettier than you? I'M prettier than you! and it seems to lose it's way sometimes. Still worth seeing once just to see what all the fuss was about.".

This is a movie which could have only been made in the Sixties and as such stands as a good testament of what a truly amazing and anarchic period of time that it was. However I wish that this film had been a lot better than what it was. It's not as funny as it should have been not withstanding some great one liners is she prettier than you? I'M prettier than you! and it seems to lose it's way sometimes. Still worth seeing once just to see what all the fuss was about.";

	schema:reviewBody "What's New Pussycat? is the world's first Woody Allen film. Although Woody didn't direct it he wrote the script and acted in it in his big screen debut. It is a typical product of the swinging sixties frequently being described as a sex comedy a genre which first saw the light of day during that decade although it is less erotic than that description might suggest. After all the Production Code was officially still in force in 1965 it was not finally abandoned until 1968 and the permissive society was still in its infancy so there is a lot of talk about sex but no nudity and no explicit bedroom scenes. Even so it is difficult to imagine a film like this being made in 1955 or even 1960.The main character is a young man named Michael James a Britishborn fashion magazine editor working in Paris. Michael is a notorious womaniser but has fallen in love with a girl named Carole with whom he wants to settle down. Although Michael and Carole are engaged he finds that he is still irresistible to women and finds that he is unable to resist their attentions when they throw themselves at him. Michael turns to his psychiatrist Fritz Fassbender but Fassbender proves to be no help largely because he himself is far madder than any of his patients. There is also a subplot about Michael's friend Victor who is also in love with Carole and who unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her.Rumour has it that the character of Michael was based on the love life of Warren Beatty the title was supposedly Beatty's favourite greeting to his girlfriends. Michael addresses every girl he meets as pussycat. Beatty was originally to have played the role but withdrew owing to creative differences with Woody Allen and was replaced by Peter O'Toole. Presumably Michael was an American in the original version of the script. When Woody appears in one of his own films he normally takes the leading role but here he appears in a supporting one that of Victor. Although Victor is only a secondary character he is nevertheless a typical Woody creation a wisecracking angstridden selfdoubting neurotic who is clearly the spiritual ancestor of most of the characters Woody was to play over the next few years such as Fielding Mellish in Bananas Boris Grushenko in Love and Death and Alvy Singer in Annie Hall.Despite this spiritual relationship however What's New Pussycat? is not in the same class as most of the films Woody was to make over the next few years. To me Peter O'Toole never really seems really comfortable with comedy but Woody and Peter Sellers could at their best be two of the greatest comic actors in cinema history. Unfortunately neither is at their best here. Woody's performance as Victor is not too bad if not in the same class as some of his later roles but Sellers is here at his selfindulgent worst assuming that a foreign accent and a silly wig are all that is needed to make his character funny. By 1965 Sellers was a major international star having created Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther and three great characters in Dr Strangelove but in this film he seems to have been resting on his laurels.The female side of the cast have little to do beyond looking glamorous and portraying onedimensional caricatures sweet young thing Romy Schneider formidable battleaxe Edra Gale manhungry nympho Capucine and Ursula Andress and suicidal depressive Paula Prentiss.The script is not particularly funny either. Michael handsome successful selfconfident is very different from the average Woody Allen hero and Woody does not seem to have been very inspired by the idea of writing a story centred upon him. The main cause of Woody's dispute with Beatty was apparently that Woody kept rewriting the script to make Victor's part more prominent. In most of Woody's successful films he manages to combine humour with other more serious elements such as philosophical explorations or analysis of human relationships. Even early films like Bananas and Sleeper sometimes regarded as pure comedies contain some sharp political satire. There is nothing like that in What's New Pussycat? which suffers from a defect common to a lot of sixties sex comedies the assumption that because references to sex are daring and permissive they must also be witty. Clive Donner was to direct another film like this Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush two years later. In 1965 you could perhaps get away with an assumption like this. Fortyfive years later you can't. The best thing about the film is Tom Jones' title song the rest of it looks so dated that it should be renamed What's Old Pussycat? 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Why perfect? Well it's not the editing the chase scene at the end looks like Edward Scissorhands did the cutting. It's not the acting  with everyone from Diana Dors to Ursula Andress performing the most outlandish caricatures you could ever imagine. It's also not the effects nor the story  as both are simple almost too a fault. So why is this film perfect? Here's why. Firstly the film allows truly great performers to perform. Scenes between Peter Sellers and either Peter O'Toole or Woody Allen highlight just how funny truly gifted comedians can be when a camera is on them. There are parts when obviously the script just said do something insane and funny and of course they obliged. Secondly it's the setting. Paris of the sixties is shown as sexy and yet innocent beautiful women in beautiful locations without the connotations that this brings now. It is a Europe of memory  free and swinging and yet chic and fabulous. O'Toole is charming and ultimately suspends disbelief as a foppish playboy desperately trying to use an psychoanalysis to get over his gift of seducing women so he can settle down with his girlfriend. Allen plays the same guy that I love in Play it Again Sam albeit a youthful version and Seller's is at his best. Thirdly it is the nostalgia it brings where comedies had ample slapstick. Seller's is in pure Clouseau mode and the wonderful scenes in his group therapy again poke fun at mental illness in a way that could not be done now. The support from Capucine and Paula Prentiss is wonderful. They are so wonderfully politically incorrect a nymphomaniac and a serial suicide attempter. They play pure sexobjects that are never pure sex objects if that contradiction makes sense and deliver and heighten the comedy of the movie. This film is perfect because it could never be made again now. It is a piece of perfect art of a happier time delivered to us by funny great actors. Enjoy it for what it is.".

	schema:headline " The sex kittens of Paris cancan  and do!";
	schema:reviewBody "During the '60's the late Clive Donner made several modish comedies of which 'What's New Pussycat' is probably the best known because it marked the actingwriting debut of Woody Allen. Its theme  20th century Man's neverending preoccupation with sex  is one Allen returned to in later films. Peter O'Toole plays 'Michael James' editor of Parisian fashion magazine 'Chic'. Everywhere he goes incredibly beautiful women are willing to leap into his bed. He wants to marry the lovely Carole  Romy Schneider  but cannot bring himself to propose because he faces too much temptation. He goes to psychiatrist Dr.Fritz Fassbinder  Peter Sellers . The good doctor is madder than many of his patients. Envious of Michael's way with women he begs him to help him bed a patient called Renee Lefebvre  Capucine ...Anyone familiar with Woody's later movies might be startled on viewing 'Pussycat' for the first time. It is a film Woody later came to despise mainly because his script was altered by the stars particularly O'Toole and Sellers. As well as exploiting the myth of Paris as the 'sex capital of the world' there is a 'Goon Show' flavour to some of the humour at a strip club Michael finds Fassbinder in the audience. Embarrassed the doctor says he followed him there. When Michael points out that he was there already Fassbinder says I followed you fast'..

	onyx:emotionText "During the '60's the late Clive Donner made several modish comedies of which 'What's New Pussycat' is probably the best known because it marked the actingwriting debut of Woody Allen. Its theme  20th century Man's neverending preoccupation with sex  is one Allen returned to in later films. Peter O'Toole plays 'Michael James' editor of Parisian fashion magazine 'Chic'. Everywhere he goes incredibly beautiful women are willing to leap into his bed. He wants to marry the lovely Carole  Romy Schneider  but cannot bring himself to propose because he faces too much temptation. He goes to psychiatrist Dr.Fritz Fassbinder  Peter Sellers . The good doctor is madder than many of his patients. Envious of Michael's way with women he begs him to help him bed a patient called Renee Lefebvre  Capucine ...Anyone familiar with Woody's later movies might be startled on viewing 'Pussycat' for the first time. It is a film Woody later came to despise mainly because his script was altered by the stars particularly O'Toole and Sellers. As well as exploiting the myth of Paris as the 'sex capital of the world' there is a 'Goon Show' flavour to some of the humour at a strip club Michael finds Fassbinder in the audience. Embarrassed the doctor says he followed him there. When Michael points out that he was there already Fassbinder says I followed you fast'..

Like his first three efforts at the helm What's Up Tiger Lily? Take the Money and Run and Bananas What's New Pussycat? is a prime example of the swinging '60s vogue but whereas in Take the Money and Run for instance his cinematic approach hearkens back to early documentaries and silent comedies this romp is under the much more generic direction of Clive Donner who had before been an assistant director.But even as an especially commercial production with a then modern pop soundtrack which absorbed the movie lots of success though the most memorable use a Dionne Warwick track was much overlooked and a slapdash editing job it has some impressive elements not limited to the wit and inspired silliness contributed by Woody. Peter O'Toole had already done Lawrence of Arabia Becket and Lord Jim before this silly little farce which was a cool and slick showcase of his range. He plays a strapping earnest young man who struggles to remain faithful to his fianc but cannot seem to avoid women who want to sleep with him. Peter Sellers plays his analyst a Deutsche pervert who hates his nagging brutish wife and proposes to follow his patient O'Toole and study his behavior. Sellers provides one of his most hilarious performances making it seem so easy to alternately embellish and subdue his Germanic caricature while completely inhabiting his ridiculous '60s swinger getup.So this is a classic screwball sex comedy of its time and captures the era not in the material or even in production value but in sight and sound. The movie was a boxoffice success appealing of course to date moviegoers and mainstream audiences who saw the names Peter O'Toole Peter Sellers Capucine Ursula Andress Tom Jones and Burt Bacharach but also surely to those who were cynical of the gender doublestandard as well as Sellers' Teutonic psychiatrist. But yeah definitely well worth a look full of laughs.".

I remembered that Peter Sellers played the role of a psychoanalyst and that the content of the movie had vaguelly to do with human relationships between the sexes but not much more. When I rented it from the videoclub and watched it I was amazed because it is a movie that while it appears silly is in fact quite multilayered. First of all it unmistakably carries the zeitgeist of the time it was made that is the sixties and the culture of sexual liberation. While the philosophy of relations the movie portrays is libertarian great care has been taken to avoid sexual explicitness which is something that contrasts those times with the present even if the message of a modern movie may be more conservative as such despite having stronger sex scenes.The cast is also stellar at least for someone who is of a different age and therefore tends to idealize the actors of a bygone if emblematic era. Some scenes as the attempt to woe the girl by Sellers and O'Toole down from the window which resulted in the intervention of the police or the dream with Sellers appearing as Richard the 3rd or the mess in the hotel and even Sellers mock attempt at suicide while Allen had his birthday solofeast are classic having theatrical surreal and farcical elements.Another point to make is the sheer attractiveness of the female protagonists without ever boarding towards vulgarity which is something admirable to achieve in the movie. A constellation of very classy people appear on screen to use that trite but apt expression.The essence and feel of the city Paris comes out very well at least the impression of it one has formed from films photographs and books although I have been in Paris and certain things I saw in the movie are still there at least to the time of my last visit.A very positive impression has been created to me by this film which portrays the 60's Paris and the human relationships formed there as hedonistic lighthearted paradise full of consumers of pleasure and and beautiful things with personalities larger than life and weak superegos living in a panacea of gratification and only ineffectually harassed by ridiculous figures of authority and repression such as the police.

Eventually Bow and March fall into each other's arms which threatens their student and teacher status at the college.Bow's first talkie was not unsuccessful although it is sometimes recalled as a failure. Perhaps detractors are recalling Bow's subsequent talking features. Strangely she became more unnatural hesitant and uneven in later films. Possibly she was rattled by negative reviews. However by 1931 Bow's performances became more assured. By then unfortunately it was too late for the huge audiences attending The Wild Party to appreciate her efforts.The Wild Party is a more than respectable talking film debut while undeniably silly it was a fun college youth film. Bow wasn't going to be young forever obviously but she could still carry out the college hijinks. March and the supporting cast perform well.

As it turns out Mr. March is the school's new Professor of Anthropology. Bow and her housemates see the goodlooking teacher arrive and immediately become interested in anthropological matters. Eventually Bow and March fall into each other's arms which threatens their student and teacher status at the college.Bow's first talkie was not unsuccessful although it is sometimes recalled as a failure. Perhaps detractors are recalling Bow's subsequent talking features. Strangely she became more unnatural hesitant and uneven in later films. Possibly she was rattled by negative reviews. However by 1931 Bow's performances became more assured. By then unfortunately it was too late for the huge audiences attending The Wild Party to appreciate her efforts.The Wild Party is a more than respectable talking film debut while undeniably silly it was a fun college youth film. Bow wasn't going to be young forever obviously but she could still carry out the college hijinks. March and the supporting cast perform well. And Paramount assigned a woman Dorothy Arzner to direct the film.Watch for one notably silent word mouthed the film. When Bow and the women are in the back seat of the car they see March walking in the street and Bow exclaims !  The Wild Party 4629 Dorothy Arzner  Clara Bow Fredric March Joyce Compton";

Clara need have no fear  her voice was successful critics praised her and when cinemas played the movie business skyrocketed  everyone wanted to hear her talk.Sizzling with vivacity Clara plays Stella Ames the most madcap and popular girl at college. She is eager to tell of an adventure that happened to her on a train  she gets into the wrong sleeping compartment and comes face to face with Fredric March  who just happens to be the new Professor of Anthropology James Gilmore!!!After being ejected from a college costume party for being skimpily dressed Stella and her pals end up at a roadhouse where they meet a group of rowdy drunks. Things get out of hand and Stella finds herself in real trouble when she becomes a decoy so her friends can escape. She is rescued by Gil who then lectures her on the merits of hard work and diligence Vs her wild ways and bringing the college into disrepute. Things go from bad to worse when an essay that Stella has worked on all night is held up to ridicule and worse  plagiarism!!! by Gil to the entire class!! Stella plunges into a round of parties but in the meantime Gil is shot by those same drunken rowdies who return looking for vengeance. There is never a dull moment as Stella visits a recuperating Gil but Evie Joyce Compton the college snitch finds Stella's shoe buckle in the bushes. She also finds some love letters written by Helen the good girl of college who is hoping to take out the top prize but if the letters are revealed she won't stand a chance. Stella comes to Helen's aid and claims the letters are her own and as the movie draws to a close she and Gil are on a train planning their future in the Malayan jungle!!!The plot was jammed pack with action  what I suppose the picture going public really thought college was like in those times. The movie also introduced a couple of likely lads  Phillips Holmes as Stella's wild party date and Jack Oakie as a drunken college bore. There was Marceline Day as prim and proper Faith Adrienne Dore who seemed most at ease in front of the camera as Babs and Shirley O'Hara who as Helen had a reasonable part and proved to be a natural actress  this was her last film!!Highly Recommended.".

You can tell its a early talkie and that all of the actresses are trying very hard to make the transition. Clara Bow was a sensational actress but she had a very hard time with sound. Its a cute film if you don't over analyze it too much. And its fun to hear what Clara sounded like. You can kind of hear her Brooklyn accent if you listen really hard. It is cheesy but its 1929! You weren't allowed to do anything in 1929! Clara is great and its unfortunate that she retired by the time she was 27. The Wild Party is about girls who don't take college seriously until Clara who's kinda like the queen bee meets Frederic March who is her professor. Its fun to see what life may have been like in the early years of sound. Clara was so talented and beautiful.".

	schema:headline " Clara marches to her own bow.";
	schema:reviewBody "This notorious early talkie dismisses the often believed falsehood that Clara Bow's voice ruined her sound film career. While it's obvious that she is not from the best finishing schools Bow's voice is fine and her acting talent suited to talking pictures. As one of the most vibrant of party girls at an all girl's college Bow knows how to make an entrance knows how to attract a man and knows how to deal with the jealous girls who don't have it. There's very little plot here other than her immediate attraction to an anthropology professor the handsome but dull Frederic March and the scandal that it causes the university. This is more worthy for the lengthy party sequence at the beginning a costume ball where overly dressed college girls jazzing it up are all of a sudden upstaged by the chorus girl outfits worn by Bow and her entourage. The sexual misunderstandings of the basic plot are rather innocently portrayed and Bow ultimately comes out to be a decent girl who like Jessica Rabbit was simply drawn that way.March's performance isn't so much bad as it is just dull when compared to Bow's effervescent acting. His character is written as stuffy and nearly sexless so when the romantic clinch does happen between the two it is eye rolling and completely unbelievable. The writing for Bow's character is much more character driven with various elements revealed about her even early on to indicate the decent girl behind all the rahrah'ing and booboobedoing that she does. I'd love to see a college dorm room like the one they apparently have the party in here It looks like something out of an early movie musical rather than something you'd see at any Ivy league school let alone some prim and proper all girls's school. The performances of the basically forgotten actresses as the other female students are believable with a combination of types thrown in to show that not every female college freshman was there simply to land a man. Had March been directed to give his character more soul or even smiled once or twice just to give a little wink to the audience I would have given this a higher rating but as it stands I have to call this a fascinating relic that stands up on some merits but mostly falls on the part of its dull leading man who would go on to much more fascinating roles over the next 40 something years.".

I found Clara very boisterous rebellious I did not like her voice or manner or personality. I found the clothing styles in this film hilarious!! Did people actually wear that kind of stuff??? And it surprised me how Clara looked like she could be a modern person a person of now I think because her hairstyle was so differentmore frizzy and loose.This is not a film that leaves you sighing at the wonderful acting or story...it left me just thinking that was interesting... It is in no way Fredric's best. For that see him in The Eagle and the Hawk The Best Years of Our Lives Smilin' Through Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde We Live Again...there are many others out there besides this one.

This is a movie for actors and there are many terrific performances in this wonderful ensemble piece about the residents of a home for aging musicians which we saw at our movie preview club.But the warmth of the story  the vibrancy of the seniors playing string quartets and practicing their cellos and clarinets their friendships annoyances disappointments and even loves  marks this film as something very special.Hoffman has taken a beautiful English estate and turned it into a world of music filled with welldrawn and compelling characters the woman with advancing dementia who relishes the CD of her performing Rigoletto 40 years ago the flirtatious Wilf whose advances towards the women on staff are never offensive and always charming the aging diva  the always wonderful Maggie Smith  who is horrified by the thought that by moving in her life is over.The best drawn and in my mind played character is Wilf's best friend Reggie who doesn't get Wilf's preferential treatment but has a quiet dignity and love of his life and his art that quietly shines through. His scene teaching students by comparing opera and rap may be this film's best. Reggie is played by one of the most underrated and powerful British actors of his time the estimable Tom Courtenay. It's hard to believe it's been 50 years since he starred as a 25yearold in The Loneliness of the LongDistance Runner. In a performance of grace nuance and elegance Courtenay outshines even Maggie Smith. Perhaps he's inspired by working again from a Harwood screenplay it was Harwood who wrote The Dresser an excellent 1983 vehicle for Courtenay and Albert Finney.One more note Finney was apparently supposed to play the Wilf role but unfortunately was not up to it healthwise. But comedian Billy Connolly's performance is just splendid.See this movie!".

It's not often that I feel out of place at a cinema but I on this occasion I did.Quartet as you probably know features a stellar cast of older actors Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay playing the reunited divorces with a history Billy Connolly as a pottering and senile old tenor cracking doubleentendres at every opportunity and Pauline Collins who in my opinion steals the show as the ditzy exopera singer. What follows is an unashamedly predictable but nevertheless solidly crafted and amusing drama that wouldn't look out of place on a Sunday afternoon TV slot. Minus the fwords of course. Yes you can see its development from a mile off and it rarely addresses the more serious and harrowing aspects of oldage as Haneke's 'Amour' did but it's good natured well scripted and amusing fun.It's all through the typical rosetinted Downtonesque portrayal of Britain that we're all accustomed to but with a cast like that and a gentle sweet story it's hard not to be eventually won over by its charm.

	schema:headline " Veteran actors are the stars of this film";
	schema:reviewBody "After years of acting and two Oscars under his belt Dustin Hoffman finally takes a turn behind the camera in his directorial debut for Quartet. Based on Ronald Harwood's play of the same name the film takes place at Beecham House a home where retired opera singers Cissy Pauline Collins Reginald Tom Courtenay and Wilf Billy Connolly live. Formally part of a quartet every year the three take part in a concert to celebrate composer Giuseppe Verdi's birthday. But when Jean Maggie Smith the fourth member of their group arrives at the seniors' home things get complicated.

Based on Ronald Harwood's play of the same name the film takes place at Beecham House a home where retired opera singers Cissy Pauline Collins Reginald Tom Courtenay and Wilf Billy Connolly live. Formally part of a quartet every year the three take part in a concert to celebrate composer Giuseppe Verdi's birthday. But when Jean Maggie Smith the fourth member of their group arrives at the seniors' home things get complicated.

Ha the devil is in the details and these details set the entire story on a different plane of reality this home is exclusively for retired concert musicians both orchestral and operatic. The level of professional attainment means that the audience for this end of year finale can attract people that will pay Covent Garden prices to attend such a stellar concert. The movie's casting is remarkable because the person that carries the show is Billy Connelly who enlivens the interaction with staff and residents to a degree that only his repartee can produce. Suffice it to say that his banter means that for an old guy like me there is never a dull spot in the movie. The drama is interjected by Maggie Smith who does it with the aplomb for which she is known. I also think that Dustin Hoffman did a remarkable job in this his first outing as a director. Diane and I both believe that this is a hugely enjoyable movie and should be seen by any person interested in the art of film making.".

The Big Yin Billy Connolly of course. I dote on the man all it takes is an imitation and I believe that every single British comedian of either gender has one to make me smile. So aye I knew at some point I was going to have to see this and I am happy enough to have seen it on the big screen there I just did one. The acting from the entire cast is of course first rate how not when the cast is headed by Maggie Smith Michael Gambon Pauline Collins and the great Tom Courtenay? With all respect to my main man Billy Connolly Courtenay's performance is what drives the picture I'm old and this man has been appearing on screen since before I was even born. We are talking some serious actor's chops here.As for the story it's just one of those will they get the Gala on stage and save this wonderful home where they can be themselves and inspire future generations? What do you think? I can't say that I noticed the direction one way or the other I suppose you would have to categorize Dustin Hoffman as an actors' director which is what's called for in a film like this. For me the best part of the film was the end credits where the actors' names were accompanied by head shots from when they appeared in opera companies and symphony orchestras way back in the day.".

And it's a really nice film too! A nursing home for retired musicians situated in the lush landscape of rural England forms the refined stage for this adapted play. The financial future of said home depends on the success of the yearly gala concert to honor Verdi's birthday and if you think you can guess the script from this description you're probably right since the story unfolds in a pretty formulaic way no thank you no risk with my tea today. A lovegonewrong a little jealousy health problems are thrown at our wrinkled protagonists but nothing can avert the happy outcome! Though formulaic I'll recommend this film The acting is very fine the comedy is welltimed and the music is very good. Plus it manages to stay on the healthy side of sentimental it's absolutely no tearjerker. And stay for the end credits!A note on the actors Michael Gambon and Billy Connolly carry the comedic parts and do so with obvious joy.Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay are Jean and Reggie a couple with a past on whom the plot centers. Maggie Smith's performance is flawless Tom Courtenay looks a bit wooden opposite her or is it the role?.Since the couple's love story is a bit dry and shallow the key role in Quartet though falls to Pauline Collins as Cissy  the emotional heart of the film. It's not a fine line but rather a very wide area between sane and demented and Pauline Collins boldly explores the expanse of this terrifying region and hits every single note be it unwitting comedy or devastating fear and disorientation or childlike trust. Often actors impersonating disabled persons limit themselves to a few ticks Mr. Hoffman himself has some experience here I believe with Collins' versatile performance you're never sure how here or there she is at the moment as is true with reallife demented persons.".

This diva Maggie Smith is completely selfabsorbed but what's worse she's the exwife of one of the people who planned on performing at this event. Much of the film is a character study of this woman as well as the influence she has on everyone. Much of the film also is a study of life for the agingtheir ups and downs.While this plot is quite simple the film manages to work very well because the acting is so darned nice. The four leads from the quartet Smith Tom Courtnay Billy Connolly and Pauline Collins are just marvelous. Much of this is due to their fine acting and the writing and much must be the result of the direction by firsttime director Dustin Hoffman yes THAT one. He seemed to have a real deft eye. Plus the music really helpedboth seeing operatic songs sung by actual retired opera stars and the incidental music. I don't even like opera but found myself pulled into the story by the music.

The quartet of actors along with Michael Gambon are fantastic as is the glorious soundtrack.Opera lovers and those who appreciate great acting will love this film. Director Hoffman keeps the story from being mawkish or sentimental mining the humor and the real emotion of the film. Beautifully done.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Quartet' marks the directing debut for Dustin Hoffman who is now five years shy of 80 and the two make a great pairing just like a good wine and cheese. Hoffman took his cues from Ronald Harwood's play and from a documentary from the 80s that showcased a retirement home for famous musicians and singers. With its stellar cast charming characters witty dialogue and amazing music ranging from The Mikado to the Rigoletto 'Quartet' is not to be missed.The cast is mostly made up of actual musicians and singers and with the help of a few veteran actors this story of aging and music should play to not only older audiences but to younger ones as well. The film takes place at the luxurious Beecham House which is in the beautiful countryside of England and looks like it's from a fairy tale from its lavish rooms and fabrics to the many gazebos ponds and trails throughout the entire place. Hell I'd want to live there. Here music is life and for it's residents who are all above 75 spend their days and nights playing music and singing still. You see this is a retirement center for famous opera singers and musicians which include a famous tenor named Reginald Paget Tom Courtenay who still sings and teaches a class to young kids every week on opera. He even mixes in rap to keep his young audience listening all the while he feels young too as he can be found listening to various rap songs in his room alone.As Hoffman's camera moves through the fancy house we meet Sissy Pauline Collins a forgetful yet lovable singer who tries to make everybody's day brighter. Then there is Wilf Bond Billy Connolly who was once a singer but now roams the hallways cracking jokes and trying to get laid whenever he can but has no success ever. These two characters are so genuine and funny that you can't help but fall instantly in love with them.A bit of of excitement fills the Beecham House as the annual Verdi Gala is coming up where most of the fund raising for the year is held to keep the home open and functioning. This is also where all of the tenants of the home get to put on their fancy dresses get in full costume and make up and put on a show just like they did when they were younger all under the direction of Cedric Michael Gambon who might be the biggest diva in the room. The other bit of anticipation is that everyone in the house knows that a new tenant will be staying with them and the rumor is that it is a big star.Well that star finally arrives and it is the famed opera singer Jean Horton Maggie Smith who is reluctant to at first to talk with her former colleagues or participate in any programs let alone lunch or dinner. It is also much to Reginald's dismay that Jean is there as they were once married but divorced due to Jean having an affair. However as they say the show must go on and Cedric wants the original 'Quartet' to sing the Rigoletto once more for the Gala which consists of Sissy Reginald Wilf and Jean. Everybody has agreed with the exception of Jean and the other three hope they can convince her in time before the Gala to perform once again.I really enjoyed the fact that Hoffman doesn't mess with the usual stories in telling a tale about retirement homes. There was no talk of the tenants being sad about family members not visiting or even family visiting for that fact. Everything is about the music here and is on a light note which I loved. As for the performances Smith and Courtenay are phenomenal. They both prove they still have what it takes to captivate an entire audience and their emotions when they first see each other for the first time in many years you can literally see the heartache in their eyes and mannerisms. It was amazing. Connolly is my favorite character as he is the most light hearted and funniest characters in the film. he takes everything in stride and just steals the show. Hoffman's direction is mostly bythebooks but captures each performance with grace. And stay for the end credit sequence as it shows the actors paired with an old photo of themselves in their youthful prime. I can't wait to see this again.".

This can sound like a very boring and dull idea at first but watching Quartet will prove you that there isn't actually more lively environment than a retirement house. The plot is really good and creative I mean a retirement house specially for old opera singers? who would've thought of that? and Dustin Hoffman entirely deserves the award he got for Breakthrough Directing. The choice of actors was incredibly good. Dame Maggie Smith Jean Horton is really one of those actresses that'd be the right choice to play anything. I wouldn't even be bothered if she had to play Batman and I'm convinced she'd be the right choice. Paulie Collins Cissy Robinson is absolutely adorable in her slightlygoingnuts rendition of an old opera performer. She's adorable and will her innocence will probably make you go awww a couple of times. And the idea of using actual retired opera performers as extras? Jesus that deserves all the credit in the world plus you get to see what they looked like while performing in their career another good reason to stick to the end. But actors aren't just what makes this movie awesome. Some shots are just magnificent. The way some scenes are filmed is mesmerizing. The setting is beautiful typically British and it will dazzle your eyes. Overall Quartet is one of those movies that doesn't even remotely look interesting at first sight but truly once watched your opinion won't be the same.".

	schema:headline " A pleasant light comedy good and safe debut for director Dustin Hoffman";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the two time Oscar winning actor Dustin Hoffman's debut as director and he played it safe if that's what he was going for by picking a successful play by fame writer Ronald Harwood who also wrote the screen adaptation. Hoffman who is well known for his meticulous and focused approach to acting no doubt approached this new project with the same diligence and who better to have in one's cast than well established and consummate professionals like the key players if you're aiming for outstanding results. Well he succeeded there is little we can fault 'Quartet' with except one detail which I'll mention a little further down. So bravo director Hoffman.I thoroughly enjoy British comedies whether they be the outrageous kind or the light variety this one is of the light variety and thus we get to watch some solid acting in the scenes that are more for character development than for humour. Leading the pack are Maggie Smith Billy Connolly Pauline Collins Tom Courtenay and Michael Gambon that's what I meant by established and consummate professionals. The supporting cast was also up to the task.The storyline is straightforward we are introduced to four of the five key players at the beginning of the film as they are rehearsing for an annual gala at the retirement home for musicians called Beechum House but that also includes singers and of course fame director Cedric Livingston played by Michael Gambon. Livingston is a pompous and egotistical character with a slight short term memory handicap so the rest of the residents are not at all intimidated by Cedric starting with singer Wilf Bond played by Billy Connolly who only refers to Livingston as Sid something that tends only momentarily of course to get under the director's skin. Connolly's character gets away with flirting he does mention he thinks of sex every seven seconds as if that was another art he enjoys like nobody's business. Cissy and Reginald played respectively by Pauline Collins and Tom Courtenay are two other members of a quartet that was supposed to perform at the gala until the fourth member became unavailable. That vacant spot becomes the central focus of the group when a new arrival at the home shows up. By the way home is such an understatement for the wonderful domain that is Beechum an ideal setting where I could only hope to end up myself a stately manor with sprawling greens and wooded trails nestled in the English countryside. That new arrival is diva Jean Horton played by Maggie Smith she and Reggie were once married. The plot thickened just right. The four singers once sang as a quartet a performance unsurpassed by any other since however Jean was never to perform again in her retirement. The plot thickened some more.Maggie Smith's presence could not stop me from realizing there is a movie genre in that a bunch of talented and aged professionals actors the Brits in particular when grouped for a movie project are what one would call grey cinema she did such good work in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel I looked forward to seeing Quartet even more.Now about the detail that brings the only blemish to this whole thing as I wrote earlier is that the annual gala this one in particular is suppose to be a make or break fundraiser without its financial success Beechum faces closure. There is nothing throughout the movie that even hints at why they are facing such a predicament and if that wasn't enough the audience we see at the gala in the end could hardly explain how the home could possibly be saved or have expected it by such a diminutive venue. Nevertheless I enjoyed the movie enough and those who like light comedy should as well.".

The find is Pauline Collins until recently an anonymous national treasure who is quite brilliant as the scatty Cissy. Her every appearance is a source of good humour without descending into facile comedy.Inevitably it's a patchy debut behind the camera. The opening ensemble sequence is a case in point of Hoffmann's vignetted style which can often leave the narrative a bit patchy. I kept watching largely because of the galvanising presence of Maggie Smith and the joy of Collins. I also found myself transfixed by the less fictional members of the cast real former musicians. A roll call in the credits tie these obscurities to the more recognisable faces with powerful economy. An awkward if rewarding film 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Only the BBC and Great Britain could produce such a film on retired musical artists mostly musicians and opera singers. They are not guaranteed a long slow and inactive aging period leading to their eventual dismissal but they are expected to go on practicing their arts singing and playing together if possible? and performing a few times a year to remain active and hence not simply survive but still create produce and enrich their collective lot not out of pity or from charity from the public but because they provide that public with all kinds of real services classes lectures concerts etc.This film is exceptional since the average age of the actors is 178 or is it 198 years so says one of them but they are escaping depression and selfabandonment because they perform together for themselves and for a public that they invite that come to learn from them. That film is a beautiful gospel of hope for the aging population in our countries. They must not be dependent even and especially on the state but they must keep the control of their life and their economic resources. A man can only be a man if he produces added value and that does not stop when you retire. Retiring is a humane solution for those who don't have their physical and mental health or enough of these physical and mental means to still be able to create to teach to bring something to other people younger people or not so young people. In international humanitarian NGOs one can volunteer up to the age of NINETYNINE years. So this film produced and directed by the aging Dustin Hoffman he is seventyfive years old since he was a child of the New Deal is the proof that life and the show must go on no matter what. The film is full of empathy humor living power and force constant and permanent energy what am I going to do today? Of course I am going to play some music do some singing read a book but also meet the others here and do these things with them with passion with emotion with sympathy and at times compassion. I will share my emotions and passions with the others who will share their passions and emotions with me. I may take a walk and sit in the garden go down town and enjoy looking at the cars going by the children getting out of school the salespeople in the stores where I will buy a trinket or a ballpoint pen just to be able to speak to the salesperson there. I may flirt or simply be nice and friendly with the unknown people I meet at the bus stop or in the streetcar on the train or anywhere indeed. Most of them will either shrug me off silently or just answer nicely I have the age that brings respect and even help if I need some and a few words often are all the help I need. People around me are just like elephants in the jungle. If I don't block the way they may go by without noticing me or smile at me for no reason whatsoever except that I am old enough to be smiled at or even provided with a few words and a hand to hold a door to help me up or down some stairs.This film is just showing this macrocosmic reality of aging in a society that does not seem to age at all along with the microcosmic reality of everyday tensions emotions feelings happiness or satisfaction. And the film shows how you must not overdo it. That's when you really get senile you don't see others at all and you escape into an invisible reality that is only material in your mind or you invade the people around you with your own sentiments feelings and obsessions without seeing that it is not an exchange but a drone from your mind onto the people around you.And when that balance is kept between these two extremes you can have some very pleasant moments of real sharing that will enlighten your life and their life till the end of the trip. Yes indeed the objective is to get married again with the people of your generation and also with people from younger generations and marriage is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

Retiring is a humane solution for those who don't have their physical and mental health or enough of these physical and mental means to still be able to create to teach to bring something to other people younger people or not so young people. In international humanitarian NGOs one can volunteer up to the age of NINETYNINE years. So this film produced and directed by the aging Dustin Hoffman he is seventyfive years old since he was a child of the New Deal is the proof that life and the show must go on no matter what. The film is full of empathy humor living power and force constant and permanent energy what am I going to do today? Of course I am going to play some music do some singing read a book but also meet the others here and do these things with them with passion with emotion with sympathy and at times compassion. I will share my emotions and passions with the others who will share their passions and emotions with me. I may take a walk and sit in the garden go down town and enjoy looking at the cars going by the children getting out of school the salespeople in the stores where I will buy a trinket or a ballpoint pen just to be able to speak to the salesperson there. I may flirt or simply be nice and friendly with the unknown people I meet at the bus stop or in the streetcar on the train or anywhere indeed. Most of them will either shrug me off silently or just answer nicely I have the age that brings respect and even help if I need some and a few words often are all the help I need. People around me are just like elephants in the jungle. If I don't block the way they may go by without noticing me or smile at me for no reason whatsoever except that I am old enough to be smiled at or even provided with a few words and a hand to hold a door to help me up or down some stairs.This film is just showing this macrocosmic reality of aging in a society that does not seem to age at all along with the microcosmic reality of everyday tensions emotions feelings happiness or satisfaction. And the film shows how you must not overdo it. That's when you really get senile you don't see others at all and you escape into an invisible reality that is only material in your mind or you invade the people around you with your own sentiments feelings and obsessions without seeing that it is not an exchange but a drone from your mind onto the people around you.And when that balance is kept between these two extremes you can have some very pleasant moments of real sharing that will enlighten your life and their life till the end of the trip. Yes indeed the objective is to get married again with the people of your generation and also with people from younger generations and marriage is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU";

The acting is fine not only from the main stars but also many of the supporting and smaller roles all veteran performers of stage and screen.Smith plays a retired star who is adjusting to life in the home she is a new arrival and she has history with Courtney's character as they were once married. The trouble is we saw Smith play a new arrival in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel as well although she was less posh in and more embittered in that one.Connolly plays his part with relish as the randy retiree Collins character is suffering from dementia as she has frequent lapses. Its enjoyable but very unrealistic. They all seem to be too energetic to live in a retirement home as well as the home being very luxurious. I have stayed at 5 star hotels that is less luxurious than this retirement home.".

As a whole it is not so bad as it can seem especially against a background of lots of new films mostly very bad ones which our TV shows everyday on every channel.Some expressions about History. The plot is fantastic. 1. Poor Xenia Godunova! If she knew what she would do in the director's imagination 400 years later she would die of shame  Her travel with some hetman is a nonsense  just see any source about Xenia she was one of the unhappiest women of the Time of Troubles. Also she never betrayed her country or used to live with a Polish robber. Actually she was not able to because she had been in a monastery for about 7 or 8 years by the time of the movie action. 2. Fedor II Godunov was killed by Russian supporters of the Impostor not by Poles! 3. Strangely enough but the leather cannon is not a fantasm of the movie creators. Such cannons did really exist even though it is unlikely that they were used by Russians during the Time of Troubles. 4. Another at least strange thing is Kuzma Minin's absence in the action. Probably he was just cut off as not wanted  Actors. It's impossible to understand the reasons Porechenkov was set as Prince Pozharsky. Porechenkov is no actor. If no actor tries to play such a great person you can imagine the result. Almost the same about the girl who played Xenia. She really tried and really did not manage. Zolotuhin is no doubt the great actor but his character looks and behaves like Gandalf but not an Orthodox Elder at all. Guys you live in traditionally Orthodox country is it really too hard to take a little care of your work? The actor who is absolutely excellent is Micha ebrowski. Brilliant! Maybe he saves the whole movie.Picture. Nice. Battle scenes especially storm of the fortress are quite good.Action. Not bad not too slowly.The End. It is disappointing because it's a pure propaganda. They write November 4th 1612 Russians liberated Moscow. Haha they are as stupid as Duma of Russian Federation both don't even know the difference between Julian and Gregorian calendars. Bad promotion for new holiday.And one more thing. Positive. The movie is kind and that's fine for such kind of film I think.As a result my rate is 6 maybe 7. This movie is watchable but definitely not a masterpiece.".

And I don't remember too many complaints about the Mel Gibson's anachronistic kilt.That having been said this is certainly second rate cinema but its pretty to look at and its fairly engaging which is an improvement for Russian entries in the blockbuster category. So 1612 gets 3 stars for execution 2 stars for story and 1 star for the unicorn. It also gets a firm handshake for keeping me entertained and for giving me hope of a slight upward trend in runofthemill Russian film making. In the words of Arthur Hoggett That'll do.".

And I don't remember too many complaints about the Mel Gibson's anachronistic kilt.That having been said this is certainly second rate cinema but its pretty to look at and its fairly engaging which is an improvement for Russian entries in the blockbuster category. So 1612 gets 3 stars for execution 2 stars for story and 1 star for the unicorn. It also gets a firm handshake for keeping me entertained and for giving me hope of a slight upward trend in runofthemill Russian film making. In the words of Arthur Hoggett That'll do.";

This movie is a great show I personally loved it way better than all the rest recent Russian movies. I believe that if it gets translated to English it'll become a huge box office hit in US and Canada. Great costumes Good enough acting and excellent special effects alone make this movie worth watching. The only historical seriesmovie till now that i put above all other is the Rome series. It delivered spirit of the era along with quite accurate general facts and an imaginative interpretation from different more simple point of view. Now if we look at the famous historical movies like Gladiator or Braveheart besides the fact that the actors are much more talented in Hollywood interpretation of talent and charismatic they are exactly as real as this one. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 and definitely advice to see it just to relax and enjoy.".

I am in a historical reenactment society read quite a lot about the European history etc. This was wrote to point that I do treat history as an important part of my life. I also like fiction and fantasy literature and I like when there is a solid border between fiction and historical scenariosbooksetc. I particularly despise productions where historical costume is used only as an excuse to tell quite presentday politically correct stories about love and patriotism. And I was really worried this could be such a production especially since it was made by the order of Kremlin. But it was not. On the contrary  there is love there is patriotism there is pride of being a part of Russian nation and even some political correctness a little but all of it is served in the funny warm and definitely not serious way and not the standard pathetic Hollywoodstyle. As for the history in the picture it is treated similarly I mean not to serious. There are historical figures and historical events but they are mixed with fiction and fantasy. To do such a thing without losing the spirit of the period requires a great deal of talent and is almost impossible. But they have done it and they have done it great! But when I wrote that they treat history not too serious I did not mean without respect since there is a great deal of such respect that shows in costumes characterisation armament and in the commentaries throughout the movie. Well  there are some mistakes especially in polish cavalry especially for me  this is the part I am interested the most J but one can live with that. Treat it as a half historical half fantasyadventure one and you will have a great time. The actor playing main character adds a lot to this adventurous mood  I think he has a potential for being next Johny Dep! His young and some times it shows that he need practice but he definitely has a talent. Small warning  movie might be a fantasyadventure one but hen people die there they die well realistic enough so this is not a family movie. In my opinion its 9 out of 10 since there are some minor imperfections like the beginning is a little to slow and to mystic sometimes there are some mistakes in costumes or armament I have mentioned above and some wooden background dialogs. Also this is another movie where the heavy cavalry really do not know what the charge should look like. But the movie is definitely a must see especially if you like historical andor adventure shows.".

Of course  the Poles are presented as the bad guys now I know how the Germans must feel after watching any Polish or Russian war movie made during the last 70 years.The movie is almost EXCELLENT. There are little too many unicorns for my taste and the main character of Andrei looks too soft for the role he's playing. I would have preferred if Andrei was played by someone harder tougher. And it's not his physicality or corrupted faulty character that make him soft but rather his good looks. His face is just  too pretty. He looks too much like Johny Depp in Don Juan DeMarco and he should look like ...I don't know  harder tougher like Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry  And yes Andrei ages about 10 years during the first 15 minutes of the movie while the Tsarina retains her youthfulness despite passage of time.The movie is not a portrayal of historical events but a fantasy merely set in a historical period. It entertains  it entertains like hell! and prompts one to get online and look up the real elements of that period.The story the plot twists the battle scenes  are just incredible  Hollywood could learn a lesson or two from these Russians.I'm glad I saw this movie and would recommend it to anyone willing to go for a ride on the back of a panting snorting stallion. I'm also getting online right now looking for more films from the director Vladimir Khotinenko.".

If someone decides to spend serious amount of money on costumes special effects on employing the best Russian actors... well one would assume the producer got also at least semidecent scenario. It was definitely not the case here.Without giving out too many details the main plot of 1612 is a little similar to that of Patriot. Just move the action to the early 17th century in Russia and replace British troops with those from PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. The problem is that Patriot was somewhat realistic even if one might have some doubts if all Brits are really brutal sadists and 1612 is not. Frankly I have not seen such BS story since I quit watching American Bgrade action movies and it was so bad even the best actors could not help it.Do you know who would be able to build a cannon from leather and then use it with marksman accuracy? Maybe MacGyver? Well no but if you want to know the answer for this and many other but equally absurd question just watch 1612. Otherwise do something else. I still give it 4 of 10  mainly for decent historical costumes great cavalry charges and other secondary details.".

As a modern action movie it stands at par with other similar stuff that even Hollywood manages to produce see 300.Not so much for special visual effects of which there are virtually none except for the occasional battle scene but rather for the silliness in language and story development.It is a simple fun movie. One for popcorn chewing moviegoers.Unpretentious and yet captivating in its silliness.At times while watching it I was reminded of movies of yesteryear such as Errol Flynn's escapades in The Black Hawk or more recently Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow's shenanigans in Pirates of the Caribbean.Costumes and settings are gorgeous though and even the music is pleasant and appropriate for a movie of this type. But let's face it it's just another cape and dagger movie not really Russian history as it pretends to be.Sure there are hints to that and many but then again distributed freely throughout without an actual chronology. All we get to know is that after Czar Boris Godunov's demise and that of his entire family but one surviving Princess there is a period of anarchy in Russia.Add to this the everlasting bad Polish invader riding in with very fanciful armor which sports applied feather wings actually an accurate depiction but just reserved for the Royal Polish Guards of that time and only worn during parades never in battle  for obvious reasons.True to history is the fact that after the fall of Czar Boris Russia had been literally invaded by opportunistic tradesmen from everywhere in Europe. This has been simplified and centered around a central Hispanic figure represented by a mercenary and apparently former Conquistador. The reality though was different and the socalled invasion was far less pervasive and intrusive. Europe simply needed new trade routes through Russia and did indeed send out emissaries for this purpose.Yet then the entire story goes through a mystic development even involving unicorns and a mysterious Hermit chained on a pole in the midst of a forest. It may be significant for Russians but for a foreign audience who may not know all the symbolic significances of this it still remains a puzzle to the end of the movie.As said as an entertainment movie not too bad but as a pretense in historic fact it really leaks all over.The actors probably all unknown to the Western world are all competent especially in secondary roles and do their job quite convincingly. The action scenes battles swordplay fights etc. are all very well choreographed and at times even spectacular.But does this mishmash stand for something?Not really.Not even as other reviewers have stated as a propaganda movie for the Medvevev  Putin duo.If it is true that this movie was pushed by the Kremlin itself then the taste of this entity has considerably diminished since Stalin's times. It has become so very simplistic and populist mind you not popular that I question whether they are still able to read Pushkin Dostoevsky or even just Tolstoy or whether they too have slumped into just reading pulp fiction if not bad cartoon strips.Not wanting the invasion of Western culture in their Country in that sense at least is utterly wasted effort since this movie proves without a doubt that they have already been contaminated by this bad taste kind of trendy movie.What next? Japanese Animes to entertain the masses in Russia too?At least Stalin had Eisenstein to propagate his views and those movies have become true Classics.But 1612? Forgettable at best.Being of Russian descent myself I regret this popularization in Russian history. Why can't we have true historic if not epic movies about the true history of Russia?The theme alone Boris Godunov already made famous by a wellknown Opera should entice any filmmaker deserving this definition to make an extra effort and develop a true biopic around this figure. But not just limited to this period.All we have are just excerpts from Russian history. We never get the whole picture. What about the first Viking invasion of Russia when it was still unknown under that name? In fact Russia takes the name from the first Conquerors of the land which the native population named Rus after their reddish scalps and beards.What ever happened between Boris and Peter the Great. Who were the various successors what did they do what have they achieved how long did they all rule? These are all still unanswered questions that no one ever bothered to tackle with in any serious form.My simple question is why?Russians of today want to be respected from Westerners and be considered as equals. Well then help us understand your history in its fullness and allow us to penetrate your culture more thoroughly. Not just through literature or through music but also producing movies that open a window upon a respectable or even not so respectable span of time and allow us to penetrate this world of the past to better understand your recent past and even the present.1612 is not it. It deserves only 5 stars out of ten just and I have decided to be particularly generous for the effort of all those involved who nevertheless did their job. But none of these stars are referred to the story nor the quality of the picture which in my own opinion is below the average level of moviemaking which I know to be otherwise excellent.Go back to film school and watch some true classics and you will see what I mean...".

	schema:reviewBody "1612 KHRONIKI SMUTNOGO VREMENI is a strange Russian epic seemingly composed of pasted together bits of history myth and fiction by writer Arif Aliyev and directed with a complete lack of continuity by Vladimir Khotinenko. Why these production choices were made in what is apparently supposed to be a critical turn of events in the history of Russia is unclear but the reason for making the film seems to be to outHollywood Hollywood without the benefit of CGI that serve as Hollywood's main 'character' in epics of this sort. Apparently from the title we are to accept this tale as a recreation of the death of Boris Fyodorovich Godunov 1551  1605  de facto regent of Russia from 1584 to 1598 and then the first nonRurikid tsar from 1598 to 1605. The end of his reign and the murder of his son saw Russia descend into the Time of Troubles. There was a witness to these murders one Andrei Pytor Kislov who fell into serfdom and then into being a mercenary with his friend Kostka Artur Smolyaninov for the Polish hetman Michal Zebrowsski. Apparently one Godonov remained the Tsarina Kseniya Violetta Davydovskaya and was loved by both the Polish hetman and by Andrei. The entire film is an extended battle between the Polish and the Russians for the control of Moscow and the dream of the Polish hetman to marry Kseniya and ascend the throne as the new Tsar. The referenced year 1612 is the year of the Battle for Moscow when the Poles were successfully defeated making way for the rise of the Romanovs as the royal family of Russia. Somewhere well hidden in this collage of decapitations and other examples of battlefield mayhem are the identities of the characters who populate this story but the tale is so chopped up by amazingly bad editing to the point that the film feels like there are large gaps missing as the screen simply goes dark frequently by flights of fantasy that focus on a unicorn moments when the past is recalled through the use of pixels of supposedly previously viewed material and just plain lapses in plot details that the movie appears like a richly colorful blood bath with some unintentional ? comedic moments. The machinations of the battle between the winged Poles and the ohsoinventive Russians fighting against all odds border on absurd. But then perhaps that is the point of the film war is madness and kingdoms are built by serendipity. It is a long song and tedious but if you know the realities of Russian history it may be a very entertaining movie! Grady Harp".

Somewhere well hidden in this collage of decapitations and other examples of battlefield mayhem are the identities of the characters who populate this story but the tale is so chopped up by amazingly bad editing to the point that the film feels like there are large gaps missing as the screen simply goes dark frequently by flights of fantasy that focus on a unicorn moments when the past is recalled through the use of pixels of supposedly previously viewed material and just plain lapses in plot details that the movie appears like a richly colorful blood bath with some unintentional ? comedic moments. The machinations of the battle between the winged Poles and the ohsoinventive Russians fighting against all odds border on absurd. But then perhaps that is the point of the film war is madness and kingdoms are built by serendipity. It is a long song and tedious but if you know the realities of Russian history it may be a very entertaining movie! Grady Harp";

Neither of these elements are dominant but the elements are well done and they add weight and a touch of meaning to an otherwise light film without desecrating religion or the folk traditions of Russia. If I was a person who normally watched this sort of film I would rate it higher but as a matter of taste I am simply giving it a 6 meaning that I think it is objectively a bit better than average.The crucial point about whether you should watch this film is really whether or not you like fairly light entertainment of this sort.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Masculin Feminin in a class last year and like with most of JeanLuc Godard's films I was taken aback by how much the film doesn't stick to anything expected for the audience. This is Godard at the peak of his powers as a director for what has become a line associated forever with Godard the Marx and CocaCola generation of people or those born in the 1940's. Like My Life to Live the film is broken up into specific acts but this time it isn't as discernible and even plays on when a new segment should start or end sometimes it changes quite quickly. And the spontaneous feel that goes with many of the better Godard films is in full swing here as Godard according to the interviews on the DVD sometimes just feeds the actors lines or just questions to get true if more documentarylike answers from the actors. It's really one of the best films from the period that made Godard known all over the world anyone seeing his later more obscured semantic essay films need only to see a film like this or Band of Outsiders to see the filmmaker dealing with real characters and convincing dialog.JeanPierre Leaud is actually just as good here as he is in the 400 Blows only in a slightly different way. The youth of this actor is still ever present but here it's changed to be a little more of a radical guy. The uncertainty of the character of Paul his interest in the opposite sex and having an intelligent but aimless walk of life is very in tune with the other Truffaut creation. He becomes along with his costars like the young beautiful Chantal Goya as Madeline and Marlene Jobert as Elisabeth if not really a direct representation of all the French youth at the time something of a reflection of youth is like in general is present. These characters don't know what they want for their lives but they do know that things like sex rock and roll protesting the oppression of governments and keeping an interest in parts of life are what make up their daytoday existences. What might seem very casual styling in following these characters particularly Paul is a bit more calculated than expected. Everything that unfolds goes from being very funny to philosophical to flyonthewall to even the poetic. That the cinematography and visual style is more often than not exciting in where the camera may move or not or where the length of the shot will hold.Individual moments make up some of the best that Godard's ever received and from actors who being caught offguard is not a negative. I loved the dialog between Paul and Madeline early in the film as simple questions have some deeper contexts. Or when Paul is just walking along a rock song starts and a guy whips out a knife only to something very unexpected with a great ironic payoff. Or the movie within the movie a parody on Bergman's The Silence that isn't disrespectful and at the same time captures a cool attitude that these characters are looking at even if it's a bit above their own sexual attitude. But most striking both times I watched the film even in its sort of unreality and very 'movie' kind of way is when Madeline says a very poetic bit of wording in bed in the dark. Even in the moments when Godard's offkilter filming isn't as appealing as in other points as one who is apart of this age group the characters are in I got enveloped in their loose tragiccomic conversations and observations not as preachy or didactic as in other works of the filmmaker. The ending too is perfectly shocking and puts a fine dramatic cap on what is really a bittersweet view of these people. And along with getting these characters right this time and place the places and people they encounter little poetic notes of their own as on the subway or in the coffee shops add to its overall effect. One of the best films of 1966.".

	schema:headline " An ironic examination into the youth of 60's Paris captured in Godard's typically subversive approach";
	schema:reviewBody "ACTION In many respects Masculin  Fminin 1966 is a precursor to Godard's subsequent film the radical and highly satirical La Chinoise 1967 with the spirit of political unrest reaction and revolution suggested through a series of random and disconnected acts of violence that are contrasted throughout by a series of dialogues and discussions on the nature of everything from music and movies to the battle of the sexes. It came from a period in Godard's career when he was moving further away from the ironic referentialism and playful subversion of American genre conventions that had featured so heavily in his earlier and more iconic works  from establishing films such as  bout de souffl 1960 and Une Femme est une femme 1961  and more towards the deconstructive essaybased cinema of reaction that would follow on from the creative yearzero of the difficult masterpiece Week End 1967. As ever it is a film about ideas and a satirical look into the notion of youth within the context of mid 1960's Paris  with the hopes dreams and aspirations of the characters cast against a backdrop of Dylan and The Beatles and the war in Vietnam  presented in such as a way as to question the integrity of this generation without ever drawing any obvious conclusions.REVOLUTION In the hands of any other filmmaker Masculin  Fminin could have easily descended into your average run of the mill teenage love story focusing on two characters from the opposite ends of the social spectrum thrown together in a courtship that is continually threatened by a number of external concerns from political differences career ambitions jealousies and social divergence and all devised within the environment of swinging 60's Paris again postBeatlespostDylan. Nevertheless the ever iconoclastic Godard does deliver these elements but in his typically subversive approach in which every element becomes a comment on the ideas and interpretations behind it. ...THE CHILDREN OF MARX AND COCA COLA Even the subtitle of the film  which doesn't appear until right towards the very end  is a perfect summation of Godard's approach here with his comment on the contemporary youth of 60's France being both celebratory but also critical in the way that he renders these characters as buffoons that spout and pontificate  as characters in Godard's films often do  to illustrate that behind the ideas and the ambitions there's an emptiness that is simply cosmetic.VRIT As with Godard's 1967 trilogy  comprising of the aforementioned La Chinoise 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her and Week End  Masculin  Fminin invites us to spend time with these characters to think about the things they say and do and then to cast judgement on them. Once again I think the problem that many people have with this film and with many of Godard's work in particular is that they assume the director is sympathising with his characters presenting them as people that we should care about or identify with when in actuality he seems to be showing them up as the fools that they clearly are. Again recalling the presentation of Guillaume in La Chinoise young actor JeanPierre Laud portrays Paul as a likable enough young man though one whose pretence of political action and Marxist belief is eventually revealed to be nothing more than pseudointellectual pontification and playful theatricality. Unlike his more motivated friend Robert Paul is simply playing at political activism like he plays at being a lover throwing out carefully rehearsed slogans and ruminating on segregation and Vietnam while his true thoughts and feelings are wrapped up in idealised notions of marriage and romantic fulfilment represented as sex.POLITICAL FILM You could perhaps argue that it isn't one of Godard's clearest of sociopolitical statements with the film often going around in circles suggesting questions that are never answered  or giving answers to questions that were never asked  as the director continually conspires to satirise and critique his subjects in a manner that goes against the usual preconceived conventions of narrative based cinema. DEFIANCE If you're familiar with Godard then you'll expect such presentation though even then the end of the film which wraps things up with a cruel joke might seem contrary to the point of flippancy by many viewers who have taken the time to view the film and invest some thought into Godard's uncompromising ruminations. However it's completely typical of the director to end his film in such a way mocking his characters as shallow chancers ready to shrug off any situation no matter how horrific while never once leading the audience in their opinions. As the film ends we're allowed to think about the actions that these characters have taken throughout the film and make up our own mind as to whether or not these are negative attributes or positive ones.CINEMA The presentation is familiar with Godard shooting in lowquality black and white with the early new wave reliance on disarming jumpcuts and Godard's continual interest in ironic intertitles still used throughout. The camera is mostly stationary or we have Godard using the tracking shots that his colour films were famous for while a number of scenes are presented with documentarylike elements in the way that characters address the camera or are framed in order to undercut the action ironically. The machinegun sound effects that punctuate the intertitles would be used again in the more entertaining Made in USA 1966 while there's that similar feeling of rehearsed spontaneity familiar from all Godard's 60's films giving us the impression of improvisation when we now know how carefully planned the project actually was. GODAR' If you're already an admirer of Godard's cinema then Masculin  Fminin is an essential if not entirely successful work from his most interesting cinematic period even although it could be argued that it lacks the finesse or ingenuity of his more iconic films it is still worthy of experiencing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kill one man and you're a murderer. Kill thousands and you're a conqueror. Kill everyone and you're a god. This is one of the many intriguing lines spoken in JeanLuc Godard's 1966 film Masculine Feminine a French film that examines what Godard calls The children of Marx  CocaCola. Paul Leaud is a 21 yearold man who has just completed his mandatory national service in the French army and disillusioned with life finds himself writing in a caf. At one caf in particular he meets Madeleine Goya a beautiful young woman who is an aspiring pop singer and is able to get Paul a job at the magazine she occasionally works for. Soon after she seemingly almost reluctantly succumbs to Paul's advances and they embark on a relationship. Along the way they spend time with his friend Robert Debord and her two friendsroommates Elisabeth Jobert and Catherine Duport. During their time together Paul who is becoming an increasingly vociferous political activist struggles with Madeleine's apparent apathy and bursts of affection as well as her complete indifference to social and economic issues plaguing France and the world at large.I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at a local theater that shows art and classic films and the experience was wonderful. I have read about this film for years but short of catching it in a film class or at a retrospective of Godard's work which is not very likely in Milwaukee WI it was unavailable until now since it has not yet been released on DVD and isn't readily available on VHS. As clich as it sounds MasculineFeminine ended up being so incredibly good that it was more than worth the wait. Therefore I am pretty much breaking one of my regular traditions of letting a film kind of settle in my head before writing about it since it was so thoughtprovoking and excellent it's like I wanted to prolong the experience.With raw and grainy black and white cinematography by Willy Kurant Masculine Feminine at times feels like a documentary which is perhaps Godard's intended perception. The camera lingers on the young actors examining their faces as they wax philosophic on everything from Vietnam to birth control to Bob Dylan. While the film is extremely talky at certain points there was not one moment where I was not captivated. Part of this was the unconventional style with which Godard blocked several of the scenes particularly the scenes between two characters who are discussing various topics to an extent where they are practically interviewing one another. Normally the camera switches back and forth between the actors but Godard chooses instead to keep the camera trained on the person who is being asked the questions perhaps in an effort to gain a more natural reaction. Another interesting component of the film is its various philosophical points about men and women posted between scenes and accompanied with the sound of a gun shot. Counting down 15 philosophies about relationships and life in general this at least I'm assuming for the time unconventional style of filmmaking was surely an inspiration for stylish filmmakers of the future like Danny Boyle Guy Ritchie and especially Quentin Tarantino.Leaud whose most famous role is probably the young Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows may be about 10 years older but he looks exactly the same. His rumpled academic look and sincerely intense and intellectual demeanor are intriguing and his strong emotional self is prevalent and endears the audience to his character as with The Four Hundred Blows I really cared about his character's fate. Goya is also good as the vapid Madeleine a woman who takes great care in her appearance to make it appear that she doesn't take care. Other than really not having anything philosophical or intellectual to bring to the table she also is content to steal the interests of those around her to give her the appearance of depth. For example after making fun of Paul for becoming worked up over Bach she has no problem telling a reporter she encounters toward the end of the film that he is one of her favorites. The rest of the cast serve as great supports particularly the semideep and fully charming Catherine Duport.I mentioned earlier that it was particularly a treat to see this film simply because it is so rare. Apparently if all goes as planned the incredibly wonderful Criterion Collection will be releasing this film on DVD September 2005. I personally plan to pick it up when it is released because I feel like I will gather either more information regarding the characters andor the story or could possibly come up with a completely different perspective. When the film does become available I would highly recommend Masculine Feminine to artcinema lovers or anyone who appreciates the French New Wave. And if you have never seen a film of this type or by Godard himself and are looking for something to get your feet wet this would be a good one to start with because it is avant garde without sacrificing a coherent story and tangible characters. Mostly I would recommend seeing this film with someone who appreciates good cinema because I regret not having done so myself I was so in need of discussion immediately after walking out of the theater. 810 Shelly".

Along the way they spend time with his friend Robert Debord and her two friendsroommates Elisabeth Jobert and Catherine Duport. During their time together Paul who is becoming an increasingly vociferous political activist struggles with Madeleine's apparent apathy and bursts of affection as well as her complete indifference to social and economic issues plaguing France and the world at large.I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at a local theater that shows art and classic films and the experience was wonderful. I have read about this film for years but short of catching it in a film class or at a retrospective of Godard's work which is not very likely in Milwaukee WI it was unavailable until now since it has not yet been released on DVD and isn't readily available on VHS. As clich as it sounds MasculineFeminine ended up being so incredibly good that it was more than worth the wait. Therefore I am pretty much breaking one of my regular traditions of letting a film kind of settle in my head before writing about it since it was so thoughtprovoking and excellent it's like I wanted to prolong the experience.With raw and grainy black and white cinematography by Willy Kurant Masculine Feminine at times feels like a documentary which is perhaps Godard's intended perception. The camera lingers on the young actors examining their faces as they wax philosophic on everything from Vietnam to birth control to Bob Dylan. While the film is extremely talky at certain points there was not one moment where I was not captivated. Part of this was the unconventional style with which Godard blocked several of the scenes particularly the scenes between two characters who are discussing various topics to an extent where they are practically interviewing one another. Normally the camera switches back and forth between the actors but Godard chooses instead to keep the camera trained on the person who is being asked the questions perhaps in an effort to gain a more natural reaction. Another interesting component of the film is its various philosophical points about men and women posted between scenes and accompanied with the sound of a gun shot. Counting down 15 philosophies about relationships and life in general this at least I'm assuming for the time unconventional style of filmmaking was surely an inspiration for stylish filmmakers of the future like Danny Boyle Guy Ritchie and especially Quentin Tarantino.Leaud whose most famous role is probably the young Antoine Doinel in Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows may be about 10 years older but he looks exactly the same. His rumpled academic look and sincerely intense and intellectual demeanor are intriguing and his strong emotional self is prevalent and endears the audience to his character as with The Four Hundred Blows I really cared about his character's fate. Goya is also good as the vapid Madeleine a woman who takes great care in her appearance to make it appear that she doesn't take care. Other than really not having anything philosophical or intellectual to bring to the table she also is content to steal the interests of those around her to give her the appearance of depth. For example after making fun of Paul for becoming worked up over Bach she has no problem telling a reporter she encounters toward the end of the film that he is one of her favorites. The rest of the cast serve as great supports particularly the semideep and fully charming Catherine Duport.I mentioned earlier that it was particularly a treat to see this film simply because it is so rare. Apparently if all goes as planned the incredibly wonderful Criterion Collection will be releasing this film on DVD September 2005. I personally plan to pick it up when it is released because I feel like I will gather either more information regarding the characters andor the story or could possibly come up with a completely different perspective. When the film does become available I would highly recommend Masculine Feminine to artcinema lovers or anyone who appreciates the French New Wave. And if you have never seen a film of this type or by Godard himself and are looking for something to get your feet wet this would be a good one to start with because it is avant garde without sacrificing a coherent story and tangible characters. Mostly I would recommend seeing this film with someone who appreciates good cinema because I regret not having done so myself I was so in need of discussion immediately after walking out of the theater. 810 Shelly";

	schema:reviewBody "Masculin Fminin has been called one of Godard's most challenging films by critics and scholars alike. However having seen both Film Socialisme and La Chinoise I think this one isn't nearly his worst in terms of extractable ideas and themes. It's ambiguous often difficult to watch and grasp and very disjointed yet it is also one of the best presentations of pop art pop culture and timespecific culture I have yet to see. It's Easy Rider and TwoLane Blacktop for the 1960's France.The aforementioned criticisms of Masculin Fminin are to be expected with a Godard film he is a man not easily defined and one who defies all narrow stereotypes of filmmakers and freethinkers. He is a man who had the unbelievable audacity to go against popular French cinematic customs during the tumultuous times of 1960's making films that defied convention critiqued western culture and valued experimentation over traditionalist practices. Consistently with the lone exceptions probably being Pierrot Le Fou and Weekend Godard's films are usually more fun to contemplate analyze write about and discuss than they are to watch. They're meals and things you don't appreciate until they're over and done with even though one doesn't necessarily want to revisit it any time soon watch two in an evening especially his political works and I fear for your mental wellbeing.Masculin Fminin centers around Paul JeanPierre Laud a young France idealist who falls in love with a pop star named Madeleine Chantal Goya completely ignoring their polar opposite views of the world music politics etc. Paul and Madeline among Madeline's close circle of friends begin having intimate and inspirational conversations about those topics often reciting poetry or reading political text in order to communicate their point. In the meantime Godard structures the film like he so often does with quickcuts and interjecting title cards bearing often disconnected and unclear text that we the audience member have to try to connect to the film in some way.One of the Godard's most famous title cards appears in this picture around the third act of the film and reads This film could be called The Children of Marx and CocaCola. Here Godard seems to be stating that the characters we center on in this film and perhaps he himself a Marxist intellectual are only impacted by two budding forces of the time they are Marxism the political ideology coined by the teachings of Karl Marx that addresses issues of class struggle and conflict between people of differing socioeconomic lifestyles by critiquing capitalism and emphasizing a more communistic approach to governing and CocaCola the globallyrecognized soft drink brand that could easily be dubbed a corporate empire. Now I think the generation today could be called The Children of Income Inequality and Apple.Another great quote that pops in the film this time it's uttered aloud is stated by Paul when he is discussing the roles of a philosopher and a filmmaker. He states very simply a philosopher and filmmaker share an outlook on life that embodies a generation. I like this quote almost as much as the above quote because this one compares two ostensibly different people and makes them come together in hopes that people see they achieve the same goal. This could also come full circle to reference Godard himself as Godard is very much a Marxist philosopher and thinker as well as a radical experimental filmmaker and he damnsure embodies the mindset and opinions of the sixties French students and youngadults.With that Masculin Fminin is a dialogheavy film where the dialog can be increasingly alienating and very often dry and unappealing. Background knowledge of the French New Wave movement mild understanding of Marxism as well as a high tolerance for complex political readings is almost essential here. In theory the film shouldn't work  it's far too disjointed punctuated by interjecting title cards that still do little other than muddle the narrative and has little character development outside of rather basic descriptions. However scarcely has a film been this more focused and successful at developing the motivations and thoughts of a specific generation.Starring JeanPierre Laud and Chantal Goya. Directed by JeanLuc Godard.".

It's actually a good title. Politics and pop culture mix in odd ways in the film and the characters are uncertain about both of those aspects of their lives. Truth be told Masculin Feminin is a lesser work by JeanLuc Godard. It was made during a difficult period in his life his relationship with Anna Karina his wife and favorite actress star of many of his early films such as Le petit soldat Une femme est une femme and especially Vivre sa vie was falling apart. Therefore this particular film is very bitter and hopeless. Godard is also unsure of where he's going. The film stars JeanPierre Leaud who is most famous for playing Antoine Doinel in such Truffaut films as The 400 Blows. His girlfriend is played by Chantal Goya who was a pop star at the time and she plays an upandcoming pop singer in the film. The film loses track of its supporting players. They are omnipresent but when they have scenes without Leaud or Goya the film gets tedious. Godard doesn't know what he's doing with them. This is especially true of a long scene where Leaud's best friend tries to court Goya's best friend in a kitchen. He asks her many questions but they are all very trite ones about her sex life. I swear he asks the same three questions a dozen times each. It gets old fast and the scene lasts forever. There are several good sequences but nothing that really equals the best of JeanLuc Godard. Perhaps its real value is in its editing. Godard's editing is always interesting and Masculin Feminin shows us his skill with long takes. Also there are a couple of great tracking shots. 710.".

In 1966 MASCULINE FEMININE seemed to sum up our feelings our interest in radical politics our passion for forms of pop culture especially pop music our friendships. Godard was the filmmaker who seemed to be making films in the now just as soon as events happened. Protests over the Vietnam War raged everywhere and Godard puts those in the film. On a personal level the birth control pill was just starting to make its way on the market and this was also shown.But it wasn't just the immediacy that marked Godard's films as special it was the sense of love that envelopes the film. The closeups of JeanPierre Leaud Chantal Goya Marlene Jobert and all the others seem to catch these young people at their most vulnerable their most charming and their loveliest. Godard seemed genuinely concerned fascinated and enthralled by these young people. Of course there are some difficulties the ending is like a punch in the stomach in the interview with Chantal Goya which is an extra on the Criterion Collection DVD Goya reveals that the Godard insisted on the ending because he wanted the contrast between Goya's childlike beauty and the horror of what she's saying but it is a film which still maintains its hold on the affections of so many who loved the film in their youth. And i think the film is like a time capsule and has much to show new audiences about a special time in the 20th Century.".

Of course there are some difficulties the ending is like a punch in the stomach in the interview with Chantal Goya which is an extra on the Criterion Collection DVD Goya reveals that the Godard insisted on the ending because he wanted the contrast between Goya's childlike beauty and the horror of what she's saying but it is a film which still maintains its hold on the affections of so many who loved the film in their youth. And i think the film is like a time capsule and has much to show new audiences about a special time in the 20th Century.";

Honored with Silver Berlin Bear for his influential leading part JeanPierre Leaud symbolizes French New Wave with playing a captious character by means of critical attitudes. So wisely Godard doesn't force the story to describe this leading character. Instead he let his leading actor become the viewer. Of every moment at all the scenes Godard puts us in his shoes. When we start laughing at an ironic situation he became the one who is making fun of the person in the irony. When we start feeling bored of a conversation he became the one disturbing the talkers. When we start getting confused of the happenings he came to create his own scene.Not only leading the script the story and the other actors Jean Pierre Leaud also leads us to be part of his daily life to realize his ambitions. Step by step he charms Madeleine with asking deadend questions and helping her finding the impossible answers. Even though Madeleine ideally never liked him she found herself pregnant and realized he has become the one that will share her fate in a little while. You would be impressed how fabulously Paul convinces Madeleine and her roommate to share the same house same room and to sleep in the same bed altogether. If this has been Bernardo Bertolucci's The Dreamers you wouldn't be amazed that much.Masculin Feminin is a conversationbased movie of philosophy and youth sociology and has the governing idea that even with the feminism women still are under the sway of masculinity. It's centering on masculinity. There is also a hidden analogy here that as socialism being nothing but a rebellion to the eyes of democracy so is feminism being nothing but a rebellion to the eyes of a man's selfknowledge. The character profiles are very well sculptured. It inspires confidence over the impossibletounderstand woman characteristics. Yet for me the best issue is that the storytelling is very confusing outoforder so that it's not really downtoearth at all.".

Not only is there 5 unexplained deaths including that of the protagonist but in 4 cases the audience has no clue as to why they happen what happens in each case afterward or if the protagonists are actually sociopath's enough to ignore the deaths happening before their eyes. Throughout the film I got the impression that the two lovers actually disliked one another what with all the talk of breaking it off over little things wanting to be with others and the like. In the end however what bothered me the most was the sheer amount of contrived dialogue that was packed into each scene. Real people do not spout off pithy observations of the nature of society at every opportunity. Overall not a good film.".

They have an improbable romance at one point a woman tell Leud that Chantal isn't his kind of woman and that he'll be unhappy which is the wisest thing anyone says in the movie although they seem to spend most of their time being annoyed with each other. Now and then the masculinefeminine rift is seen wide there's a lot of scenes of Leud asking women really pretty sillystupid questions like Do you know what wars are being fought today? and the like. I'm reminded of the preacher's wife in The Simpsons But what about the children?! I didn't buy the romance really although on the other hand I've seen all sorts of improbable couples and you probably have too. I think the movie is more than a little misogynistic I've read reviews of it which argue that Goddard is equally tough on both sides but I don't buy that one bit. While his revolutionaries are often shrill they're shrill because their women drive 'em to it. And while Goddard tries to paint a world where violence is omnipresent a lot of it is pretty silly really. There's a scene where a guy threatens Leud and then stabs himself I found it ridiculous although I don't think it's meant as such.On the other hand.....I don't know. Leud and Goya are unappealing characters but I've known people like them they're pretty true to life. The sort of earnest questions they ask themselves are typical of people at that age. I think Goddard's division between marx and cocacola is pretty simplistic and flawed at best but it's clear that he unquestioningly believes it and that goes a good way here. One could even argue that their love affair is meant as a kind of commentary on Western culture more generally their revolutionaries want to rid themselves of the trash of Western culture and yet are enmeshed within it. Leud's ultimate fate seemed kind of ridiculous as I watched it but it reverberates in my mind in odd ways.I don't know.

Although the film briefly explores the differences between women and men Godard spends more time exploring the social problems of the 1960's and the difference between Capitalism and Communism not to mention his endorsement against the Vietnam War.Violence plays a role here but a detached one.  Two suicides two homicides and an accidental death occur but the characters act matter a fact about these occurrences.  In fact the characters react more strongly to events in a movie.  It's almost as if the filmmaker is saying that people react emotionally to characters in movies but remain detached at real life events.On one hand the pop vocalist character proclaims that she is a member of the Pepsi Generation but her boyfriend Paul who is a bit of a revolutionary makes the statement that if a person murders someone it's a crime but if an army kills 1000's of people they're heroes.  These two characters get along because they both live in his or her own world and neither tries to pursuade the other to see his or her views. So there is no outer conflict between the two characters.What's most interesting about Masculine Feminine is the way the director shot his actors in single shots creating a documentary style as the characters interview each other about their views on sex love and politics. Unfortunately only the men had interesting comments about politics while the women leaned towards Capitalism and materialism.  I find this a bit sexist.This film was part of the French New Wave and so it is respected for it's innovative departure from films that actually tell stories.  However by taking the camera and sound equipment to the streets interesting ideas are presented here.I respect Godard for making the films that he wanted to make and for leading the French New Wave Movement but I wish that I knew the point to this film. I expected a more profound film.".

The actors are interesting not because of the quality of their acting or what they are saying but because the camera lingers on their features and makes use of the fact that peoplewatching is an activity of universal fascination. It certainly doesn't hurt that one of the people we get to watch is the adorable Chantal Goya. I also felt some empathy for the Masculin character. He is such a pathetic twerp trying to woo Feminin with his silly Marxist drivel you can't help feeling a little sorry for him. She isn't any more interested in this stuff than we are. I imagine Katie Holmes must feel the same way about Tom Cruise when he drones on and on about Scientology. On the downside are the inane pointless and pretentious dialogue the juvenile sound effects and the disjointedness of the work as a whole. Imagine a featurelength black and white Monty Python film without any humour. Maybe I exaggerate. There is some humour...but it isn't funny. In summary if you turn off the subtitles and turn down the sound you will enjoy most of the good parts of the film and avoid most of the bad.

	schema:reviewBody "MASCULIN FEMININ 15 faits prcisJean Luc Godard was never a man of too many words but upon being asked about the philosophy behind his new film the French director simply shook his head and responded It is a sociological study. That very fact distinguishes Masculin Femin from Godard's other masterpieces where the main characters like in Breathless are designed to represent unique people in uncommon situations. Masculin Femin unlike was meant to embody a much larger trend the conflict is the sexual revolution and the characters are suppose to be a representation of the French youth.The film is told through the eyes of Paul Jean Pierre Leaud an inexperienced lover and restless activist and tells the story of his group of friends and their constant search for self definition. Godard's prime concern when directing this film was the natural tone of the piece and to achieve it he used many means. Most of the actors in the film were unknown many were real people playing themselves Chantal Goya the female star of the film was a singer and had never acted before. It is also important to remember that roles for young actors were uncommon at the time. Godard kept many of his actors in the dark Goya for instance was never given a script and would only be prepped before the scenes. Godard even used earpieces to feed the actors the lines he desired. A lot of it was improvisation. The photography was the first collaboration between Godard and cinematographer Willy Kurant Godard's longtime cinematographer Raoul Coutard wasn't available for the project. Kurant shot the film with a new Kodak stock eliminating all the greys for a high contrast black and white image. The cinematography is unorthodox to say the least. It is very simplistic the camera is rarely on wheels and the framing is often broken like a Degas painting where it was not rare to see parts of the subject cut off or out of frame. Godard divides his film in 15 precise facts where he explores the essential differences between men and women. It's a study on sexuality and love is it true that men want sex and women want love? Throughout the narrative many questions are asked and range from topics like birth control to rules of attraction. The film is meant to be casual but at the same time emphatic the dialogue is part of a wide spectrum that shifts from humorous to serious accordingly. The plot is filled with mini conflicts that come together to form a sociological picture uncorresponded love jealousy insecurity and the war on Vietnam all become part of this larger frame.Godard has always been described as love him or hate him and Masculin Femin is that type of film. Many can't get past the rough editing and strange cinematography but those who can appreciate the film for what it is the nuance and subtleties a look or a phrase a place or a person. The beauty of this film really comes from delicacy of relationships and the veracity of the plot. Times were changing interactions were changing love and sex were changing and Masculin Feminin offers a beautiful account of this transition.  Thomaz Marcondes".

	schema:reviewBody "We are the children of Marx and CocaCola a character remarks in Masculin Fminin. This isn't the character's sentiment per se it is in actuality the sentiment of JeanLuc Godard and he doesn't want to mention it passively. It is as though he wants the quote to be stamped on his grave to be lauded as a visionary for generations to come. So who woulda thought that nearly fifty years later the children of those children's children would be the children of Tumblr and Starbucks more likely to wonder aloud who the hell Marx is and why one should drink CocaCola when a fivedollar coffee awaits a few blocks down the road.Godard's attitudes have of course dated over the course of a halfcentury  but the way he expresses them the way he captures 1960s youth have not. To be a successful Godard film is certainly not an easy thing. A director who can hardly suppress his love for bizarre sound manipulations Masculin Fminin itself is often soundtracked by a single cartoonish gun shot that seemingly comes out of nowhere and teleprompterready intellectual speak it doesn't take much for a Godard film to go from zero to insufferably pretentious milesperhour in an instant.But most of the time Godard keeps the politicallyintellectually minded atmosphere humorous and engaging even if you can't quite put your finger on why watching Jean Pierre Laud dive into a radically liberal speech is entrancing. The kiddos of Masculin Fminin all in their lateteensearly 20s spend most of their time smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee in stylish cafs around the city delighting each other in their ohsoadult conversations and escaping in movies they know they're smarter than. All attractive all high in their hopes all avantgarde they regard sex as a breezy pastime responsibilities as a chore they can save for later. They act worldly namedropping Sartre whenever the time comes but heaven knows they would be much more content swimming in each other's cerebral coolness than actually do something with their lives. Leading lady Chantal Goya who portrays the ambitious Madeline Zimmer wants to become a yy singer  but does she know that Sylvie Vartan and Franoise Hardy were oneinamillion chanteuses hard to recreate? Masculin Fminin is about everything while also being about nothing. It covers just about every topic found in the mind of a '60s dwelling youth but it knows that these are just fleeting thoughts especially when considering most of the stuff happening internationally is the responsibility of the leader of the free world whoever that is a character might accidentally grunt. A caf is perched just a block down the street and last time I checked I wasn't the leader of the free world.The film doesn't take itself seriously and its actors are likable New Wave staple Laud is always so fascinating to watch don't ask me why and Goya looking like a typical Anna Karinatype enchants with her childlike smile and jetblack Anna Wintour reminiscent bob. Masculin Fminin is Godard at his most focused his most audience oriented  it is a pleasure from start to finish even if we don't quite have a grip on what we just watched.".

But still it is interesting that this revolutionary talk among the young precedes the May 1968 studentworker riots in France by over two years.The most lasting part of the movie I think is the sexual politics that is on display throughout the film. Jean Pierre Leaud is good as he so often was at playing the unsure yet cocky young male. And Chantal Goya as Madeline is certainly a poster child for the selfcentered hip youth of the 60s.But the filming of sexual politics has been done so much now in movies particularly in Independent filmthat watching Masculine Feminine now for the first time can make it seem fairly clichd. Everything from Sex Lies and Videotape to many of the films of Whit Stillman such as Metropolitan and Barcelona cover the same territory is a much more accessible way in my opinion.But it is an early display of how the Coca Cola generation was relating to each otherand it was filmed at the moment that it was happeningit has the feel of a documentary.My own favorite scene is when Madeline's friend Catherine is standing in her kitchen eating an apple while verbally fencing with Paul's friend Robert. There are other moments in Masculine Feminine which have the same recognition of reality of testing and tension between the sexes but this is the longest such scene and it was a delight to watch.".

He presents a callow and unsophisticated collection of characters and they are portrayed against the backdrop of sweeping cultural change. The film is an attempt to draw attention and elucidate the selfish desires of Capitalism and the communal spirit of Cultural Marxism as they converged upon the nascent Youth Movement of the mid 60's. Although the political dichotomy is ever present Godard almost playfully delineates the aspirations dreams and ambitions of this group of young people on the cusp of adulthood. Although rooted in the Paris scene of 1965 this is a film which would resonate in any era. It is filmed in breathtakingly beautiful black and white and is a real visual treat.".

There is an indie impromptu feeling to the film which is told in chapters and includes beautiful Parisian street scenes thoughtprovoking quotes and great performances from JeanPierre Laud and Chantal Goya as well as the supporting cast.

That doesn't necessarily mean that it's good just that I like watching it.I highly recommend this movie to anyone searching for a good fantasy title from the 80's. I would put Krull right up there with Ladyhawke both Conan's Willow and the Dark Crystal. What separates this fantasy film from the others is a plot involving a more science fiction type element. Visitors from somewhere in space have landed on a planet named Krull to wreak havoc. After they snag up our hero Prince Colwyn's bridetobe he goes on a quest to save her with the help of a starshaped boomerang with knives called the Glaive and a band of strange characters including a cyclops and a goofy guy who can change into animals.Good time fun worth the rental price.

It probably isn't.Set on a faraway world known as Krull the film opens with the oncoming invasion of the Slayers a fearsome planetconquering army led by the Beast whose lair is a spacecraft shaped like a large mountain called the Black Fortress. They've clearly got the swordwielding residents of Krull outmatched as the Slayers are armed with laser though they curiously still use horses as a means of transportation.Knowing the only way to stave off the invaders is to unite the planet's two warring kingdoms set aside their differences so that Prince Colwyn Ken Marshall and Princess Lyssa Lysette Anthony may be wed. In the middle of the wedding ceremony the Slayers storm the palace killing everyone except for Colwyn and they take Lyssa back to the Fortress as a gift to the Beast. If this was really the extent of both kingdoms' armies then I don't see how they could have stood even the slightest chance in a fullon war with the Slayers.Anyway the Beast has apparently chosen Lyssa to be his bride because he's aware of the prophecy that whomever she chooses to be her husband and consequently the king their eventual son will become ruler of the galaxy. Logically I could only see this working if she chose the Beast considering Colwyn has no means of interplanetary travel which would make galaxyruling a bit of a tough task.Determined to save his bride Colwyn retrieves the fivebladed throwing star think Alien vs. Predator called the Glaive and recruits loyal followers during his journey namely a band of criminals including Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane. Hindering their quest is the fact that the Fortress automatically transports to a new location during every sunrise. This does beg the question why the Beast doesn't just blast off the planet with his bridetobe than risk the slightest chance of Colwyn finding her...but I digress.For all the moments of cheese no moment unintentionally funnier than when Colwyn is able to recognize one of his men by a blood trail unconvincing bluescreens and occasional subpar effects Krull still works dandily as a rollicking adventure. The cast is much better than usual for this kind of material with Ken Marshall making for a charismatic and likable hero and lovable rogues like Neeson Coltrane and Alun Armstrong whom I'll always remember as the traitorous Mornay in Braveheart providing solid support. Lysette Anthony radiates beauty as Lyssa she's easily one of the most dropdead gorgeous princesses in cinema history. There's no question I'd go through the same trouble to rescue her as well.Despite running a little over two hours Krull moves at a consistently excellent pace delivering good production values loved the exterior and interior sets of the Black Fortress beautiful locations and thus some lovely cinematography and a number of exciting action sequences. The battle scenes are surprisingly wellchoreographed whatever the sword fights may lack in gritty violence is made up for by pure swashbuckling fun. Other terrific scenes include Colwyn's solo rockclimbing the trek through the swamps the adventurous ride on the Firemares and the battlechase within the Fortress. The action and adventure is given a great boost from James Horner's rousing score one of the composer's personal best. Director Peter Yates strictly adheres to fantasy formula so there are no surprises to be found. The plot is occasionally baffling essentially making up a lot of its own rules as it goes along the old mentor telling Colwyn he can't use the Glaive until the right moment a character staying behind because his time is up only to come to the rescue later etc.. But it's all in good fun and the movie is pieced together with moderate coherency and consistent momentum. Recommended to fans of 80s fantasy Krull delivers the goods for those into this sort of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Krull recently on the HBO family channel Comcast 304 of all channels.  What's really funny is that Krull is rated PG for adult content! I believe the content of Krull wouldn't interest most adults and diehard fantasy fans like myself aren't adults in the proper sense of the word anyway.Krull offers the sheer pleasure of watching medieval men Englishmen? armed mostly with swords and spears fighting seemingly unstoppable alien warriors with laser guns.  The guns appear to have only one or two shots apiece though because most of the aliens turn their weapons over in combat to reveal blades for closequarters fighting.  If the aliens had infinite shots that would be just too unfair for the hardpressed good guys.There is a story linking the action sequences together which clearly draws its inspiration from Tolkien Star Wars and the Arthurian Legends.  I can understand why someone wouldn't like Krull because its similarities to Star Wars are so obvious that the movie seems derivative and formulaic even though it deserves credit for presenting its familiar fantasy elements in a somewhat unique manner. The Krull plot concerns a young hero no not Luke Skywalker with an old mentor not ObiWan Kenobi who must rescue a princess not Leia from an impregnable fortress which is not the Death Star otherwise however Krull bears no resemblance to Star Wars.  Except for the massive spaceshipfortress that glides slowly by during the opening credits of course.One reason I like Krull is that the whole production has a distinctly British flavor yes the cast and the scenery are obviously British even if some of it was filmed in Italy but the movie is unmistakably British in more subtle ways.  The movie has bleak moments when all the good guys seem to be dying at once and their cause appears hopeless but it also doesn't hesitate to be silly and poke fun at itself in quintessentially British fashion.  The Ergo character provides comic relief with his transformations into various animals which are all the more amusing because they are consistently unintentional.  His fussiness and insistence upon his dignity are reminiscent of C3PO from the Star Wars movies except that C3PO never expressed a desire for gooseberry pie.The hero his mentor and Ergo are waylaid by thieves but rather than robbing them the criminals agree to join their quest in an enjoyable Robin Hoodtype scene not only do the thieves respect the hero when they learn that he's the future king but at least one of them Alun Armstrong refuses to have his old shackles removed until the quest is complete.  Armstrong's character is my favorite of the movie because I can't help liking a criminal who wants to redeem himself with heroism...like Han Solo sorry yet another Star Wars parallel.Some comments have complained that Ken Marshall lacks charisma as the hero but since he looks like Errol Flynn with a beard he certainly has the perfect appearance for a fantasy swashbuckler.  He also runs the gamut of emotions well bursting with youthful arrogance in the early scenes and seeming near the movie's end like someone who has actually been changed by experience and may grow into a great leader.  At least one comment complained that Marshall doesn't display enough grief for the deaths of his men but since the good guys drop like flies in this movie dying words are reserved for the developed characters I don't blame him for not stopping to cry while alien laser beams fly past his head.At least two subplots add mythological or religious connotations to the story first the Cyclops Yes there's a Cyclops in this movie and it doesn't look believable at all.  But who can hate a movie with a Cyclops? whose ancestors made a bargain with the Beast for the gift of foresight but were cheated so that they could only see their own deaths.  Interesting. I think the Cyclops character was well developed in the movie and his actions offer an interesting exploration of the issue of free will versus destiny.Second and my favorite sequence of the movie is the visit to the Widow of the Web because nothing could be more symbolic of a person consumed by hate and despair than someone who allows everyone who approaches to be ensnared in a web and devoured by a giant spider the scene in which one character dares to approach the widow has the power of real myth. Even if the spider's cheesy stopmotion animation renders it less than believably real the sequence is so effectively creepy that it couldn't be improved today except by updating the special effects perhaps the Shelob sequence in the third Lord of the Rings movie for which the Krull sequence will provide an interesting precursor will be better.Peter Yates' direction is competent though it's hardly the equal of Bullitt the only other work of his that I've seen.  The supporting cast is also more noteworthy than the leads since it includes not only Freddie Jones and Francesca Annis from Dune but Robbie Coltrane the aforementioned Alun Armstrong AND Liam Neeson!  Any film that brings such a cast together deserves some credit.  I'm a huge Tolkien fan and fantasy fan overall so I'm sure that I like this movie more than the typical viewer does.  It has its fair share of problems such as the fact that it goes on too long and doesn't go out of its way to engage an emotional response from the viewer but I definitely believe that its sense of fun compensates for its flaws.  When a movie shows me Errol Flynn killing alien warriors with a mystical boomerang I cease to be a critic because serious film analysis has no place here!At the very least Krull is the kind of movie that will give you and your friends plenty to talk about afterward supposing that they're willing to watch it with you.Rating 7 A good fantasyadventure.".

I remember thinking KRULL wanted to be a STAR WARS but it wasnt very good at it.Then as the years passed i got to watch KRULL on video and somehow i started realy to like this movie. By this time i had read a couple of fantasy books and i started to appreciate the attention to details in KRULL and the way the whole concept was organized as a movie.Since then each time i see it i realy enjoy it more. Ok its not the perfect fantasy movie but compared to the usual more recent unimaginative excuses for movies that come out of Hollywood see Neverending Story III or Warriors of Virtue this movie KRULL is a brilliant fantasy masterpiece.KRULL has an excelent and different atmosphere a much much better script than WILLOW excellent characters a fantastic magic weapon a good set design and it follows the Dungeon and Dragons formula in a very imaginative way compared to the more recent movies.The actors do their jobs well try to spot Leam Neeson the situations are imaginative and the soundtrack is realy good and very atmospheric also.The only minor fault in this production is the way in wich we can immediately tell when the outdoor scenes are filmed in indoor studios because there is immediately a big contrast between the natural magnificent landscapes and the ones that are built in the studio. Which is a shame because sometimes it spoils the movie atmosphere. Anyway who cares! KRULL is an excellent fantasy movie and someone should make a directors cut from it and rerelease it because it might teach many hollywood executives how a good fantasy movie should be made. Even with its flaws !A fantastic High Fantasy movie ! Go see it. Its a shame this movie is so forgotten. Excelent stuff.".

The fighting family theme doesn't last long. The slayers delay the wedding by kidnapping the bride Lyssa and taking her to the black fortress. The black fortress appears in new locations every 24 hours and finding it will take the groom Colwyn on many different paths. I won't spoil the film but the adventure that unfolds as Colwyn tries to rescue her was incredible and at times scary.

	schema:reviewBody "In the wake of Star Wars fantasy films about brave heroes trying to rescue kidnapped princesses were suddenly in demand. Krull was one such film to jump aboard the bandwagon. There are also elements here of Robin Hood the costumes look like they've been borrowed from natives of Sherwood Forest and the hero is aided by a rogue's gallery of merry men and Perseus and Andromeda the hero has to complete several minitasks before he can get on with his main quest. Prince Colwyn Ken Marshall has just married the beautiful Princess Lyssa Lysette Anthony when their city is raided and the princess is kidnapped. She is taken away to a heavily defended citadel. Colwyn sets off to rescue her and during the course of his quest he picks up additional companions including a bumbling magician David Battley a courageous cyclops Bernard Bresslaw and a gang of honourable bandits which includes Alun Armstrong Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane. Krull is highly derivative but reasonably entertaining. The special effects are decent for the time but probably look a little primitive to overspoilt modern eyes. Marshall's leading performance is extraordinarily bland but his unashamed earnestness actually becomes part of the fun once you get used to the fact that he's trying desperately to play it seriously without a shred of success! The supporting characters are more interesting and are fairly wellplayed despite the hopelessly hokey dialogue they have to contend with. In general Krull is a likable movie which tries to keep up its lively pace and manages to provide a fair number of thrills for youngsters and scifi afficianados. If you don't expect too much from it you'll come away satisfied.".

You get whisked away and there is enough background and adventure to substantiate the film and you aren't left wondering if there could have been more to it but rather you are immersed in the film and finish watching it with a sentimental 'Aww.. that was brilliant is that it?

But I keep finding more great contributions and Krull is most certainly one of them.The storyline sounds very familiar even clich  a great evil scourge is upon the land and it's up to the descendant of a royal and honorable line to destroy the villains. Fortunately that's where the similarities with so many other of these films ends.The villains in particular are fairly original although as many other reviewers have noted the inspiration is clearly from Star Wars. They are certainly more menacing and effective i.e. much better shots than Stormtroopers. BEGIN SPOILER And in one particularly tense and poignant scene we find that the villains are not all onesided when an assassin an alien no less sent to kill the hero claims she could not complete her task because she had fallen in love with him. END SPOILER The acting is well done with the cast consisting primarily of unknown British actors. It's always easier for me to buy a fantastic story when the actors are not familiar. And the comic relief actor is not only excellent but does not truly distract from the storyline or completely lighten the rather dark mood of the film.The only reason I did not give this a perfect score is because of the somewhat disappointing ending. I felt it was a little anticlimatic especially considering the tremendous build up to the final showdown. It seemed almost like the budget was running out and they needed something to wrap it up more quickly.The flaw was minor and did not detract from what was an otherwise spectacular adventure. This sort of film is hard to find nowadays and should please any seeking a grand epic story. Highly recommended.".

Sadly his bad acting is hampered by a dodgy facial prosthetic which hides half his face. So we are not treated to his usual silliness and clownlike mugging. Instead we have to endure the presence of his cyclop's prosthetic throughout the movie. And trust me it ain't very convincing. Imagine a oneeyed giant whose face has been frozen through Botox abuse and you'll get the idea.And there's the evil Beast which the cast are trying to destroy.

At the wedding the forces of The Beast attack kidnapping the princess and massacring everyone else. Sole survivor Colwyn joins with a band of disparate characters on a quest to kill The Beast and rescue the princess.This is a very simple good versus evil storyline. It's a quest road movie. David Battley is especially funny as the incompetent magician Ergo. All the iconic characters are there including the great Alun Armstrong as the bandit leader Torquil. And sharp eyes will see a younger Liam Neeson.This along with Dragonslayer is my favorite British fantasy of that era. The stories are original and yet comfortably familiar. It had the FX but CG would soon make the miniature models and real sets old school. It didn't help that Return of the Jedi came out right before this. This movie has great cheese appeal but is outclassed in production value by Jedi.".

At the wedding the forces of The Beast attack kidnapping the princess and massacring everyone else. Sole survivor Colwyn joins with a band of disparate characters on a quest to kill The Beast and rescue the princess.This is a very simple good versus evil storyline. It's a quest road movie. David Battley is especially funny as the incompetent magician Ergo. All the iconic characters are there including the great Alun Armstrong as the bandit leader Torquil. And sharp eyes will see a younger Liam Neeson.This along with Dragonslayer is my favorite British fantasy of that era. The stories are original and yet comfortably familiar. It had the FX but CG would soon make the miniature models and real sets old school. It didn't help that Return of the Jedi came out right before this. This movie has great cheese appeal but is outclassed in production value by Jedi.";

Music of course and the general air of fantasy help to make the viewer think they are somewhere off this world. DVD is fantastic with a great commentary and extras.Minus side The two main characters are completely anonymous  if they weren't there you wouldn't miss them. There are continuity issues too the enemy are space traveler's and teleportation specialists yet are incredibly crude in their combat methods and the main weapon is underused and doesn't work in the end anyway and the ending is twee.OK it's blown out of the water by 21st century films such as Lord of the Rings but it is great fun  worthy of a repeat watch.".

I remember reading the Maltin review on this he slam's it as a Star Wars clone and I was thinking Gee it was probably only good cos I was a stupid kid... I must take that back however because I watched last night on digital cable and it was MUCH cooler then I remembered!!.. it's been 15years.. The score was so powerful I was actually getting goosebump's watching it! the last movie to give me goosebumps was watching the 5th Element in theatres. Yes the plot is a little cliched but the characters and their chemistry is great. It's an over the top movie that never fails. I really love the special effects I'll take it over CGI any day! and it truly is a visually stunning piece.. People complain about the mountain climbing scenes and horseback scenes but damn.. Those are really cool scenes. Probably the coolest mountain climbing scene's ever filmed. I mean come on they have awesome visuals of Ken Marshall or stuntman just dangling on those awesome huge mountains. I could watch 5 hours of that cos it is really thrilling. The horseback scenes are great and really add tenfold to the fantasy element. Every shot and scene of this movie is tantalizing and this is one of the few movies that your eyes will wander around the entire screen in awe. This is not a bad movie in any sense come on now Pearl HarborArmageddonMission to MarsCharlies Angels those are bad movies.. This is one of the great 80's adventure movies!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great movie which stands the test of time. Well written and with an array of well known actors such as Alun Armstrong Bernard Bresslaw and Todd Carty not to mention Liam Neeson and Francesca Annis. The story centres around the pending marriage of two opposing families on a planet much like our own that is to be invaded not by men from another land but by a fearful creature from another world dark and hard His home is much more than his castle. He abducts the princess and her consort must find his beloved and so goes on a quest picking up an assortment of men on his journey that are considered outlaws but are strong faithful and true. Something we could all aspire to. The slayers are scary but not too scary to limit its sociability. I have watched this very often since its release and will continue to do so maybe even wearing out my second tape must buy the DVD lol. It is a classic and far outweighs some of the stuff churned out today. Marvel at the magical cobs the kindly Ergo the Magnificent and the puppy. Enjoy the atmosphere and allow the web of intrigue wrap you in this tale for the telling".

Well written and with an array of well known actors such as Alun Armstrong Bernard Bresslaw and Todd Carty not to mention Liam Neeson and Francesca Annis. The story centres around the pending marriage of two opposing families on a planet much like our own that is to be invaded not by men from another land but by a fearful creature from another world dark and hard His home is much more than his castle. He abducts the princess and her consort must find his beloved and so goes on a quest picking up an assortment of men on his journey that are considered outlaws but are strong faithful and true. Something we could all aspire to. The slayers are scary but not too scary to limit its sociability. I have watched this very often since its release and will continue to do so maybe even wearing out my second tape must buy the DVD lol. It is a classic and far outweighs some of the stuff churned out today. Marvel at the magical cobs the kindly Ergo the Magnificent and the puppy. Enjoy the atmosphere and allow the web of intrigue wrap you in this tale for the telling";

They aren't supposed to be twisted and complicated. I have enjoyed this movie for years and it isn't slick with Matrix garbage although The Matrix is good for what it is. Krull just oozes personality which The Matrix couldn't do because the actors are too busy with their Dick Tracy dialogue and harness belts.My favorite scene is when Ynyr confronts the Widow of the Web and we find a deep and dark story within a story briefly told.

A darker train would have made for a more sinister film. Even so there's plenty of excitement.The crackling dialogue between Charles McGraw and Marie Windsor is consistently sharp. Seriously you will have a hard time finding anything more bitter than those two. I'm not sure any other malefemale could have made the dialogue which in a 1950's way is almost corny come off so terse as they continuously bark at each other.

This is one of those rare cases in which the old and the new versions both are topnotch.In fact it's interesting to compare the two versions. In this film there is a very unique twist as the end concerning the woman being brought to Los Angeles. It was clever.That woman in this 1952 version also is played by perhaps the First Lady Of Noir Marie Windsor. She had the best lines in the film and is outstanding at playing the toughtalking moll of this genre. See Stanley Kubrick's The Killing to fully appreciate more of Windsor's work.The film noir toughguy male equivalent of her also stars in this film Charles McGraw. Few guys ever looked and sounded better in noirs than McGraw. He and Windor were born to play in 'B' crime movies!The short length of this film makes it a good one to watch anytime although to be frank if I could only own one of the two Narrow Margin films I'd have to take the latterday version with Gene Hackman and Anne Archer but it would a tough decision. Both have a lot to offer.".

In a story which is full of intrigue danger and mistaken identities the pace is absolutely relentless and the characters are tough and uncompromising. The atmosphere is consistently tense and the blistering dialogue is sensational. Despite its short running time and its low budget Bmovie status this is a remarkably entertaining film which is also directed with aboveaverage skill and flair.Detective Sergeant Walter Brown Charles McGraw and Detective Sergeant Gus Forbes Don Beddoeare assigned to pick up a mobster's wife called Mrs Frankie Neale Marie Windsor from her apartment in Chicago and escort her to Los Angeles where she is due to testify before a grand jury. Mrs Neale is in possession of her husband's payoff list and this makes her a target for the mob who are intent on ensuring that she doesn't reach L.A. alive.Brown has nothing but contempt for Mrs Neale so when his friend Gus is shot and killed by a mob hitman as they're leaving her apartment building his hostility towards her becomes even deeper and he also becomes totally disgusted by her complete lack of concern about the incident. Despite his personal feelings and the obvious dangers involved Brown decides to go ahead and complete his mission as planned.Detective Brown and Mrs Neale travel by train to L.A. and have adjoining compartments. During their journey there is a continual sense that danger lurks everywhere as both are fully aware that their lives are under threat and it's not always possible to identify which of the suspicious looking passengers are killers employed by the mob. A fat man and a little boy who are on the train are not who they first appear to be and Brown is very wary of a grimlooking character called Joseph Kemp David Clarke. Another man attempts unsuccessfully to bribe him and Brown also gets to know an attractive blonde called Ann Sinclair Jacqueline White who turns out to be friendly and goodhumoured. Further killings surprises and twists then follow before the train eventually reaches its destination.Charles McGraw as the tough cop who's permanently onedge and Marie Windsor as the feisty selfcentred star witness are brilliant as two people who despise each other with a passion and some of the verbal exchanges between them are great. For example when he says to her You make me sick to my stomach she replies Well use your own sink and let me know when the target practice starts.In common with many other stories where the action takes place on a train the space within which the characters function seems to become increasingly cramped as the story proceeds and the tension grows accordingly. A variety of interesting camera angles are used to emphasise this feeling and the use of extreme closeups and images on reflective surfaces are also used to good effect.The Narrow Margin is a great piece of hardboiled entertainment which is incredibly intense very fastmoving and definitely not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Narrow Margin is directed by Richard Fleischer and has a screenplay by Earl Felton. The film stars Charles McGraw Marie Windsor Paul Maxey Jacqueline White and Don Beddoe.This film has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster one of the best Noir films ever made I think. McGraw's character is one of the most cynical you'll ever see in a film. Marie Windsor steals every scene she is in as the tough dame who sprays quips around like bullets.Detectives Walter Brown Charles McGrawand Gus ForbesDon Beddoeare assigned to protect Mrs.NeallMarie Windsorand escort her to court. Neall is a mobsters wife who has agreed to testify in court. People are trying to kill her before she can talk. Brown is tough cynical and hates the fact that he and his partner are risking their lives for somebody like Mrs. Neall. Even though she is testifying he doesn't think she's a good person.As they escort her to the train they've booked tickets on Forbes is killed. Brown manages to get Mrs.Neall on the train and locks her in the empty compartment next to his. The killers have boarded the train too and there's very few places to hide. Can Brown protect her? This is a tense film and the train setting gives it extra suspense. The antagonistic relationship between Mrs.Neall and Brown is very interesting to watch they loath one another and their verbal sparring is a treat to listen to.There is a big twist concerning a main character and it makes you see them in a different light. When this twist is revealed we also realise there are two different investigations being run each as important and dangerous as the other.McGraw gives one of his best performances as the Detective who hates his current assignment but will work hard to protect Mrs.Neall no matter what.It's a real shame that Marie Windsor didn't appear in more Noir films because she is one of the best Noir actresses. Tough sexy and a natural with the dialogue. Paul Maxey is memorable as an overweight train passenger who gets in the way of Brown a few times.If there's a downside to this film it's that the murder of a main character later on in the film is only referred to once. When you realise the risk that person was taking and how brave they were it's a shame that more time isn't devoted to acknowledging their sacrifice. That issue aside though this is one of the best Noir films and is filled with superb performances.".

The director Richard Fleischer is less famous than some of his films however including the cult favorite Soylent Green and the courtroom drama with an ending where Orson Welles bursts on the scene Compulsion. So this early one is clearly Fleischer's baby and he gets clear believable performances from a small ensemble cast.Yes it's a kind of ensemble film where half a dozen people hold their own. Central is Charles McGraw as a detective guarding a witness en route from Chicago to L.A. McGraw has the benefit of being just a plain old detective not an actor filled with character and presence and he's great. The witness is played by Marie Windsor and she's cutting and commanding a terrific female lead that should have had a bigger career. The two or three bad guys are not quite caricatures and the other castseemingly innocent passengersare spot on perfect too. All of this might be enough but the cinematography is so virtuosic without showing off it lifts the whole experience higher. George Diskant never became one of Hollywood's big names but he had just shot two legendary films for Nicholas Ray and was clearly poetic and tactile with his camera and lights. You sometimes won't even noticeas when the detective and the blonde walk on the platform at a station stop the camera following them and pivoting and keeping the moving turning couple in perfect focus. Other times the shots are just sensational as with the fistfight in the tight confines of a cabin. The railroad car scenes are shot with palpable claustrophobia things getting in the way in the foreground people having to nudge and move around each other.There are almost two parts to the movie. The first is a more classic night in the city with a noir feel and this is the most gorgeous and vivid. You get sucked into the problem and are surprised right away by a couple of twists. Eventually the main characters end up on the train and another kind of movie a cat and mouse mixedup identity kind of scenario takes over. Equally interesting and with more twists than you would think plausible.But they are plausible. and Fleischer pulls of a real gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "The narrow margin is a remarkable filmnoir with great merits unfortunately marred by an implausible story. There is a policeman Charles McGraw committed to protect a key witness Marie Windsor in severe danger of life along a train journey. The only reasonable and likely behavior for the cop is to take some sandwiches lock in the cabin with the witness and sit down with a machinegun on his lap. Of course that would be the end of the film. So to get a story McGraw goes everywhere and does everything on the train but staying with and protecting the witness. There is also a big surprise at the end. That is really unexpected. But if we think back to the previous events this big twist makes the behavior of some characters wholly illogical.Well enough with the faults of the movie. The merits of this lowbudgeted Bmovie overcome its defects. The stylish cinematography is firstrate and the camerawork is outstanding. The few action scenes are brilliant and filmed in a very original way. See for instance the play of mirrors in the finale. Marie Windsor is sensational and every scene with her is a treat. What a gangster moll gutsy tough gal she is! In my opinion she is even better here than in The killing. Her lines are a perfect instance of cynical wisecracking. McGraw and the rest of the cast make a good job as well. There is a good amount of suspense and no moments of bore.Let me conclude with a somehow daring comparison. Independently by the composers classic music of the 18th century is always beautiful. In a similar way I think that American movies of the 1940s and early 1950s are all good that is just a question of style and how I love this style!I recommend The narrow margin for its intrinsic merits and to pay homage to a great season of cinema.".

	schema:headline " No New York nor Los Angeles  just the claustrophobic halls of a train";
	schema:reviewBody "The milieus landscapes and aesthetics of filmnoir were often related to big cities and cold streets. In The Narrow Margin directed by Richard Fleischer the story is taken to train and the narrow halls of it which perfectly furthers the compact feeling of the film. The film is very well directed and the exquisite cinematography of it reminded me of the classic The Lady Vanishes 1938 by Alfred Hitchcock which also takes place in a train. This brief 75minute long ride offers some really sharp noirdialog and exciting twists till the last minute. When a mob boss dies a police officer gets a job to escort the boss' wife from Chicago to LA to a trial. The task gets a little harder when a suspicious group of crooks join the train and are willing to do anything with regards to prevent the arrival of the woman to the trial.Los Angeles and New York were often the big cities of filmnoir but even if big cities had a lot to do with the aesthetics of filmnoir it doesn't mean that anyone didn't have the guts to try something else. Many tried to transfer the pattern of filmnoir to new milieus. Nicholas Ray tried a snowy small town village in On Dangerous Ground 1953 and Ida Lupino brought filmnoir to the seats of a car and deserts of Mexico in The HitchHicker 1953 just to mention a few. The claustrophobic space Richard Fleischer chose in The Narrow Margin works brilliantly and the thrilling scenes are directed with care.Many have realized what a great place a train is for excitement murder and paranoia. As mentioned before Alfred Hitchcock made The Lady Vanishes but he also used train as a place of suspense in Shadow of a Doubt 1943 North by Northwest 1959 and Strangers on a Train 1951. Of course when talking about trains and cinema one cannot forget the Buster Keaton masterpiece The General 1926. Train means both getting away and letting go which is highlighted in the masterful melodrama Brief Encounter 1945 by David Lean where the motive is taken of a superior level when trains and railways turn into symbolism. The narrow margin of a train is of course quite metaphorical to the story in The Narrow Margin but also in all the thrillers mentioned by Alfred Hitchcock. In The Narrow Margin the police officer faces challenges so tough that he is not sure can he make it through. His margin is getting more narrow and narrow inch by inch.The name of Richard Fleischer might not ring a bell for all of the readers so I think it's quite alright to reminds you for some of his works. He started as a bclass director but with the help of The Narrow Margin he rose to the Aclass and the film even got an Oscar nomination for best writing. Before it he had already made a few filmnoir such as Bodyguard 1948 and Armored Car Robbery 1950 which unfortunately are part of his 'bclass era'. But on the other hand they're still quite interesting and excellent in their on league. Nowdays Fleischer is probably more known for directing the two fantasy action movies Red Sonja 1985 and Conan The Destroyer 1984.The Narrow Margin has its unintentional humor and clumsiness but overall it stands out as a fine piece of filmnoir. It offers some excellent dialog and twists that will keep the interest of the audience till the last minute. I think the power of The Narrow Margin is in its story charged with compact emotion the lack of filmnoir clichs the cinematography and the construction of state in the narrow halls of the train.".

The policemen have to take the night train which poses a risk. There are a lot of people that are interested in not letting this happen. In fact just as they are about to leave the building a man in a fur collared coat is waiting for them and he kills Forbes.Thus begins a film that packs so much in it seventy minutes running time with so little effort something that speaks volumes for what director Richard Fleischer was able to create in The Narrow Margin. Written by Earl Felton for the screen this B type picture has so much going for it that one can heartedly recommend it for viewers of the genre whenever it shows on cable next. We once heard that William Friedkin was an admirer of Mr. Fleischer when he was a teenager.George Diskant its cinematographer deserves a lot of credit for the enjoyment of the film. He did wonders with the way he was able to shoot the movie in such close quarters as in the train to make the viewer feel cramped while watching it unfold. The scenes shot using the windows of the train with the car that is seen in the distance running at the same speed are amazing. The camera is made to work intelligently by this great artist. The best thing in the picture is Charles McGraw whose work as Det. Brown is amazing. Mr. McGraw epitomized the tough guys he always played with an economy of gestures while projecting a virile image of those people he gave life to on the screen. Marie Windsor who appears as Mrs. Neall shows up as a hard woman hiding something that is a key element in the narrative. The scenes between Mr. McGraw and Ms. Windsor in addition are amazing because of the heat they generate. Also in supporting roles Jacqueline White Paul Maxey Peter Brocco David Clarke and Peter Virgo doing an ensemble work for the director.Highly recommended for fans of Richard Fleischer's work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Fleischer's 1952 The Narrow Margin takes classic Film Noir elements unusual camera angles and lighting deep shadows ambiguous characters in jeopardy and moves everything into the tight confines of a train creating a cramped suspense classic that never 'lets up'. While the film is unabashedly a 'B' movie few films could match it's unrelenting tension visual style and surprising plottwists...in a feature only 71 minutes long! The basic plot is simple L.A. cops Charles McGraw and Don Beddoe arrive in Chicago to escort crime boss widow Marie Windsor holding essential evidence for a Grand Jury investigation back to L.A. When Beddoe is shot and killed at her apartment building McGraw must protect her alone against the contract killers on board their L.A.bound train...But this is Noir so nothing is necessarily as it seems! Director Fleischer made some brilliant choices in making the film beginning with his decision not to use a musical score by relying on the 'natural' sounds of trains and stations he gives the film a sense of urgency and forces the viewer to 'pay attention' without the crutch of musical climaxes to single out 'important' moments. Also his decision to cast McGraw as the lead was inspired the gravellyvoiced character actor was as familiar to audiences playing a villain as a hero and his hardboiled persona in the 'traditional' Noir 'look' of a fedora and trench coat with a cigarette in his mouth offers an ambiguity that holds viewers' attention.The train is as important a character in the story as the heroes and villains with narrow passageways tiny compartments large windows offering dramatic reflections and it's isolation from outside communication each moment on board increases the potential for disaster.Needless to say The Narrow Margin is among my favorite films one that I've watched dozens of times and still get a kick out of! It has a legion of fans and has influenced two generations of film directors and if you've never seen it you have a real treat ahead of you! This movie is a 'keeper'!".

	schema:headline " Dangerous Train Ride";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those Bfeature film gems that are frequently more lasting and popular than Afeatures that were overproduced. It is about a woman a witness to the murder of her husband a gangster by several more important gangsters. She has been found in Chicago and she has to be brought back to Los Angelas. Two Police Detectives are sent but meet danger along the way one of them is killed. The other manages to get the witness to the train but it is two days before they reach Los Angeles and anything can happen.It's unlike most of the other classic train mystery films. THE LADY VANISHES deals with proving that a woman who has disappeared on a train actually existed and how it endangers a carload of British travelers. NIGHT TRAIN a.k.a. NIGHT TRAIN TO MUNICH deals with rescuing a kidnapped scientist back from Germany just before the start of World War II. SLEEPING CAR TO TRIESTE deals with two agents tracking down a doublecrossing partner and the stolen diary they sought for their political cause. MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS deals with a great detective Hercule Poirot trying to figure out who among the passengers on the train murdered a singularly unpleasant man. Here it is just getting a government witness an unpleasant one by the way past criminal agents.The cast of THE NARROW MARGIN has no major stars in it Marie Windsor as the witness is probably the best known name although Charles McGraw appeared in many Bfeatures as either a cop or a hood. The variety of characters in particular a young boy who may be too sharp for his own good is interesting. But best is Paul Maxey. Mr. Maxey may have been the fattest looking man in movies. He normally was a businessman or a politico or anyone in the background of the films he appeared in. He is the producer of Dolores Grey's television show in IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER who has to calm her down when she is reminded she can't have the huge meals she wants to eat because it will ruin her peoplepopular figure. Well why can you eat what you want to?! she asks Maxey. Well they don't want to watch me! he explains. Here he actually had a .... err meaty role. He is one of the film surprises. At first he is just a seemingly funny fat guy then he seems like a potential assistant for the criminals. It turns out quite differently at the end. In many ways it was Paul Maxey's best role in movies.A good twisty plot a topnotch cast and direction and a decent set of production values. The original THE NARROW MARGIN is first rate entertainment which I recommend if you can see it.".

But as it turns out this was a very clever plot gimmick and there's a good reason why.McGraw and Windsor are at their best here.

	schema:reviewBody "The big spoiler is in the last paragraph.My first reaction was that this was a really nice piece of filmmaking from the era when you could produce a 70minute film. Imagine anyone trying to do that today! I suppose they put it on double bills with a big lobby intermission in the middle.Anyway without much in the way of sets except a railroad car and no special effects they packed the 70 minutes with story and suspense and plot twists that caught me completely off guard for one. Marie Windsor did a great job portraying a cynical brassy mob moll whom Charles McGraw is trying to keep from getting bumped off by a gang of crooks on the train from Chicago to L.A. Some of the frames with her in closeup are just works of art.There are a few oldtime clichs like the fearless little kid lemme see your gun mister! who turned up in a lot of movies of the day but there is a lot of good stuff too like heavyduty character actor Paul Maxey who starts off blocking a corridor in a comic bit but then does some other stuff.So when the disc finished up on the VCR I was pretty satisfied and ready to give this movie a 7 maybe even an 8. But when I started mentally planning this review going over the plot in my mind when I had some leisure  and bear in mind that I had a lot more time to think about the plot afterward than I did during the movie  I started brooding about some of the big plot holes and so on. Not everyone will do this of course.But to start off just for example five or ten minutes into the film after one murder attempt the cop reports that the killer saw his face but not Mrs. Neal so they don't know what she looks like. And he turns out to be right. But how can that actually be true? She's the widow of a big mobster but none of the other mobconnected people have seen her? They have limitless resources for bribery and interstate criminal teams that outnumber and outgun the police but they can't manage to get a photograph of Mrs. Neal or even find out from any source even the most vague description of her? That was the beginning and after that all I could do was ask myself why didn't this person do that and why did those people do this and why did the police act this way etc. and eventually the whole story unraveled in my hand like a badly knitted sweater. But I didn't realize this at the time because I had been just carried along by the action and the performances! So maybe I should stop complaining!But there is one other story point which left a bad taste in my mouth which has to do with the big plot twist and the denouement. Here's where the big spoiler is.Brown is a good cop who demands a lot of himself and blames himself when his partner gets killed five minutes in even when it wasn't really his fault that I could see. But later on after the woman he has been guarding gets killed he doesn't seem to have a second to spend on remorse or regrets. He and the film dismiss it instantly. It's true that by the time he finds out she is dead he has already found out that she wasn't the real Mrs. Neal but a Chicago policewoman. But so?? Is he are we? supposed to care only for mob widows not for women on the force? And it's true that she dies because of her unaccountable stupidity  Lady you aren't REALLY an impulsive mob moll and nobody is around so why do you have to play the part and listen to that stupid phonograph? Are you that addicted to jazz music? But Brown doesn't know that. If Brown were portrayed as a rotten misogynistic guy at least it would be in character for him to dismiss the faux Mrs. Neal from his mind completely while he squires the real one off the train at the end but he hasn't been. So it's worse than bad behavior it's out of character. And it's just to manipulate the audience to make us think that Oh no! They killed Mrs. Neal! and then tell us a few seconds later that Mrs. Neal is really still alive  Whew! so the train is still on the track. And maybe they could have thought it out better with more time or money for script production but then it would be a better movie but they didn't and it's not. Although it looks a lot like a better movie if you don't look too close.".

Not only did Bob Flanagan engage in BDSM as a performance artist but he also engaged in it as part of his lifestyle.  Viewers should be advised that there are some very extreme presentations of Consensual SadoMasochism in this film.Throughout the documentary we see very revealing interactions between him and his Dominant Mistress Rose and we are shown a very healthy and loving relationship which is centered around a BDSM lifestyle.While I would assert that Bob's lifestyle was healthy it's very clear that as a sufferer of Cystic Fibrosis his health was never good.  Even though a diagnosis of CF usually means a death sentence by the time a person reaches their early 20's Bob Flanagan lived an amazing and eccentric life until his 40's.This documentary can go from absolute joy to utter sadness in a few seconds. Despite his sickness and his impending death Bob Flanagan lived with an incredible zest for life love and Masochism.".

Viewers should be advised that there are some very extreme presentations of Consensual SadoMasochism in this film.Throughout the documentary we see very revealing interactions between him and his Dominant Mistress Rose and we are shown a very healthy and loving relationship which is centered around a BDSM lifestyle.While I would assert that Bob's lifestyle was healthy it's very clear that as a sufferer of Cystic Fibrosis his health was never good.  Even though a diagnosis of CF usually means a death sentence by the time a person reaches their early 20's Bob Flanagan lived an amazing and eccentric life until his 40's.This documentary can go from absolute joy to utter sadness in a few seconds. Despite his sickness and his impending death Bob Flanagan lived with an incredible zest for life love and Masochism.";

	schema:reviewBody "That's not only a theme of this movie it's part of the lyrics that  selfproclaimed and with good reasonsupermasochist Bob Flanagan  cheerfully sings at a lectureperformancehe did a pretty witty  reworking of the Supercalafraga...etc song from Mary Poppins. Did I  mention he's wearing a little costume including a cape when he performs  it?  Yep Bob Flanagan had a pretty good sense of humor. That was one of the  pleasant surprises of this movie. When I first heard about this movie  all I heard about was the hammer scene. I also had skimmed the  REsearch book and looking at some of the really extreme mutilations  to areas of his body I would rather not name I actually figured he was  slightly disturbed. I'm pretty liberal and am of the opinion that what  2 consenting adults do as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else against  their will is their own business. I thought because of his CF  combined with this serious torture that he either was suicidal or hated  himself. I also wondered about his relationship with his  dominantloverpartner of 15 years Sheree Rose hoping that it was  loving and she wasn't just using him.  I was glad that this movie proved my preconceived notions wrong. This  is a very intelligent sane witty talented likable and above all  VERY brave guy who happened to enjoy being beaten and tortured  sexually. The movie explainswithout preaching that he actually gained  strength from his activities. according to statistics most CF  sufferers die in their 20's. He lived till his early 40's actually a  recordand says his sex life kept him going. He figured for one thing  he had nothing to lose. For another thing CF is a very painful  disease and he chose to use SM as a way to take control of his pain  and disease. If you find this a hard idea to understand or are  curious I highly recommend this movie. This has been said before but  I don't recommend it if you're squeamish. I'm jaded but I had to look  away a few times. Interestingly enough what I found harder to watch  than the notorious Hammer of Love was seeing BF racked with pain  coughing his lungs out and I don't think I'm spoiling anything here  as the movie opens with Bob goodnaturedly writing his own obituary  finally losing his battle with CF.  I also didn't think this movie would be so touching. Before the end I  realized he had a very loving relationship with Sheree. Not only are  they sexually a perfect match she is his best friend soulmate and  caregiver which is no mean feat. Face it if you don't love someone  you're not going to be sticking around and helping them expel mucus  from their lungs on a regular basis. When he starts losing his fight  and finally goes to the hospital to die the scenes of them together  with her gently telling him it's OK to leave her are some of the most  heartbreaking I've ever seen. This is one brave woman. Also when  she's not in her SM gear she could easily pass for an kindly  elementary school teacher. It's a great contrast to see her tying him  up and sticking needles in his groin in one scene and later to see her  rocking and knitting. I was also haunted by the scenes of him dying  the way he looked and what he said things that I've heard are very  common last words such as I never thought this would really  happen...this is so weird.   Is this a hard movie to watch? Even if graphic depictions of very  sensitive areas of the body being nailed pounded and pierced don't  faze you I cannot imagine anyone who wouldn't be shaken or at least  moved watching the later scenes of this man really literally dying in  front of the camera and your eyes. But I'm glad I saw it. My husband  however loves documentaries and even talked about seeing the movie  when it was in limited release. I made the mistake of telling him about  one of the more extreme demonstrations and now he refuses to see it  no matter how good it is and he's sat through some pretty nasty  stuff. If you're brave and feeling up to it though I highly  recommend this movie. If you're easily or even notsoeasily  grossedout but have an interest in the life and death of this man  then just cover your eyes during the graphic parts. And when you hear  Hammer of Love start playing you may want to take a little stroll  out of the room for a minute or two.".

But that doesn't mean the film aims to offend or make the audience vomit.  What's at the heart of this film is one mans lifelong struggle with a painfully fatal illness CF.  It's only through his embrace of the pain that he was able to live such a long and successful life poet comedian and performance artist and his ability to inspire and live his life to the fullest is something several many 'able bodied' people could only dream of.Most touching is the scene where Bob is visited by a young Toronto girl with CF who wanted to meet him as part of the 'Make a Wish' Foundation yes you read correctly.  When the film was screened at the Toronto Film Fest that same young girl was present and a few years older and attributed her prolonged life to the example set by Bob Flanagan.Nails and blocks of wood aside this film is NOT for everyone.  In fact it's for a small few.  It is very real and very powerful.  But if you can stomach it you'll see what a great documentary should look like.".

It is not only the film that I consider to be the best documentary of all time tied with Bowling for Columbine but also one of the best movies of all time.Bob Flanagan was an interesting person whom I only wish I could have had the pleasure to meet before he died hey I was only around 7 years old when he died.  He was a poet artist performance artist counselor at a CF summer camp and of course a masochist.It's sad that people refuse to see this film just because it involves SM or because they think they couldn't handle it.  In all honesty the scenes of SM aren't hard to watch at all.  It's understandable if you have trouble watching the penis nailing scene I didn't by the way but you can just look away and still come away from the film with the same effect.  Those scenes aren't what make this movie so effective.What made the film so effective was showing how friendly and funny Bob was. He wasn't evil or sadistic.  He wasn't the kind of guy who kidnaps children and tortures them.  He was an average guy a very talented one at that who just happened to have a different way of controlling his disease and pain. But the thing that made this film so moving was the fact that you basically watch Bob dying.  You see all of the things he did throughout the film and then when you see him getting into his car for the final journey to the hospital you really start to feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.  No lie this was the only movie to ever make me cry.  I'll admit it.  It really made me sad to see him in his hospital bed struggling for air and stuff.  Not to mention the beautiful final sequence which shows assorted home movies with a voiceover of Bob reading a poem he wrote called 'Why?'So all in all this movie was excellent.  Extremely moving yet very funny and compelling to watch at the same time.  A must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into this flick I really didn't know much about Mr. Flanagan. I knew he was obviously a supermasochist thanks to the DVD cover and I knew that he was involved in a Nine Inch Nails video. But that's it. When the credits began to roll you end up with a fantastic idea on who he was and how he lived his life. It's one of the most intimate and best documentaries I've seen.Sick The Life  Death of Bob Flanagan is a perfect title for this documentary. You discover that Mr. Flanagan does indeed have a hobby that most would consider sick but also that Mr. Flanagan suffers from Cystic Fybrosis. A lung disease where the death rate is high and the people who do suffer from it usually die at a very young age. Truthfully for me the masochism and the torture play a second fiddle to his life long struggle with cystic fibrosis. Sure seeing his unbelievable sexual performances are truly stunning but what is more stunning is how he lives his life. Going into this movie I really wasn't expecting such an intimate and touching piece of film. There are some incredibly graphic scenes mixed with fantastic humor and then there are scenes that display some of the most powerful moments of emotion I've seen on film or in real life.In a perfect world Sick The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan would be a movie widely seen. It's definitely one of the best documentaries I've ever seen and a movie I'll be recommending for years and years to come.".

The movie delves not only into Bob performance art but also into his personal life and an interesting life indeed. This movie is definately not for the squeemish and does deliver some very bizzarre stuff and yes it graphically up close shows the nailing th penis in the board. But it's so much more than that. Bob Flanagan was definitely one of the most interesting individuals I can think of and this movie I think captures that quality perfectly!Check it out if you can find it.".

Besides the fact that Bob Flanagan shows incredible strength in dealing with the cards he has been dealt with and chose to conquer his constant state of pain through SM this movie didn't give me anything. I don't get SM and therefor most of the performance stuff was pretty uninteresting to me. I wasn't even disgusted with most of this... maybe I am desensitized due to watching to many sick movies. But my problem is that the Art of Bob and Sheree is most of the time pretty nonexistent and ridiculous. Taping a bunch of facial expressions to the wall stacking alphabet spelling cubes or doing monitor installations reminds me of cheap school projects and is as uninteresting as the penis nailing and genitalia close ups could shock anyone who is into being shocked anyway.I never heard of Bob Flanagan before seeing this movie and I have deepest respect for him trying to live a sexually fulfilled life and expressing himself in his state. But as for the documentary ... there is a bonus on the DVD about Sarahs a girl who meets Bob through the make a wish foundation and suffers of a similar illness fate after the documentary. I think that one is extremely exploitative and voyeuristic and kind of made me ashamed to have watched the documentary itself even more than the appalling discussion between Bob and Sheree after Sarah left. It just gave me two insights... I too felt that the deathbed scenes were the hardest to take in this movie and as much as everyone talked about an ugly penis being nailed I really wonder if its me or most of the other people here being desensitized. And secondly Sarahs Husband pretty much sums it up when he says Don't watch sick... I don't get it. Honestly the bonus gave me the impression that everyone involved in the piece was as disappointed with it as myself because even Sarah didn't appear natural.".

	schema:reviewBody "11127035I think that despite the fact that this film gives an indepth look at all the really gruesome stuff Flanagan willingly puts himself through the toughest thing to watch was his death. Some of the bits where he and his girlfriend are acting out scenes or he's hammering nails into himself are fairly difficult to watch but you know when those are over that everyone is going to walk away from that maybe even a little bit more satisfied than they previously were. The scenes leading up to his death are emotionally draining on the viewer. You see him becoming despondent in the hotel rooms and you really see his frustration that his own body is doing this to him and he's really helpless. When he's in the hospital and he starts becoming catatonic is when it really starts getting tough to watch. The nurse telling him that it's okay if it's his time to die his girlfriend crying and asking him to still be alive when she comes back from some unmentioned errand and him being surprised at what dying is like and even stating that he doesn't want to die are much more difficult to stomach than anything else that happens. Despite the fact that for the most part people are mostly desensitized to violence and death it's one thing to watch a movie and recognize the loss that is a character's death and another to watch disease take the life of a nonfictional individual. It is not quick it is not clean and it is not dignified. While the actions he took to get his rocks off may not be something many people would find enticing and some would find depraved they are nothing in significance compared to the event that is the end of a life.".

	schema:reviewBody "SICK THE LIFE  DEATH OF BOB FLANAGAN SUPERMASOCHIST is the most real documentary that I've ever seen. I'm not a huge documentary watcher so that may not be saying much but I can't imagine another film that is so absolutely honest and moving.SICK focuses on the life of Bob Flanagan a performance artist comedian and extreme SM practitioner who suffered from the terminal illness cystic fibrosis. Through the media of film we learn about Flanagan and all the aspects of his life from artist to son to lover to freak and everything in between. The audience is allowed to witness Flanagan as he speaks to other SM enthusiasts. We see him in and out of hospitals battling his illness. We watch as he makes another CF sufferer's dream of meeting him come true. We get glimpses into the REAL relationship between himself and his lover Sheree through private home videos. We play voyeur as we witness scenes of Flanagan involved in extreme SM play including nailing the head of his dick to a wooden board. And we watch him die...SICK is one of those films that a mere synopsis will not do justice to. I knew very little about the man except what I remember reading years ago in publications like RESearch or Modern Primitives or maybe both  I don't really recall...  and I knew absolutely nothing about cystic fibrosis and it's effects. So if nothing else this film made me aware of a disease that I had no prior knowledge of. But on top of that SICK chronicles the struggles of a dying man who is constantly waiting for the axe to fall. Cysitic Fibrosis is a disease that often takes it's victim very young  most sufferers not lasting into their 20s and many dying MUCH younger  yet Flanagan despite or maybe because of his extreme lifestyle lived to be 43 years old. I personally can't imagine feeling like you are constantly living on borrowedtime. It's one thing to know that you're going to die eventually  it's quite another to be born with a deathsentence.As other reviewers have noted  SICK is not a film for everyone. Some simply will not be able to stomach the graphic SM play on display or will not be able to be openminded enough to look past what they consider to be aberrant behavior to see what the point of this film really is  to celebrate the hard but joyful life and painful but courageous death of a unique and truly strong individual. I also don't feel that the film's intention is to repulse the viewer  I think that it takes a lot of courage both from the subject and the filmmaker to allow things to be shown in such a graphic manner so as to get a wellrounded feel for who this person really was. There is no sugarcoating and there is no apologizing  THAT is something that I can really respect. Flanagan made no excuses for whatwho he was  he was someone that believed in himself and his actions with no compromises  another trait that I can admire.As another reviewer stated  I have to rate this film a 10 based on the fact that I just can't find any fault with it. Everything about it rings true and sincere and that's a rarity in ANY film. And just when I thought that I was going to be disappointed by not hearing in Flanagan's own words why he thinks that SM became the focalpoint of his life  there comes a spokenword type poem during the last 10 or so minutes of the film that sums his whole outlook up better than I could have hoped for. What works the most is that SICK is funny when the time is right and serious when it needs to be. The last few minutes where we basically witness Flanagan dying on film is some of the most harrowing and emotionstirring that I've ever seen committed to film.I don't admire Flanagan for being an SM practitioner. I admire him for being a true outspoken individual who lived life on his terms right up to his death. Though this film may not be for everyone I think that his story is inspirational and this film should be sought out by anyone with an open enough mind to appreciate the underlying messages behind all the SM hype...1010".

	schema:reviewBody "11131246We watched this film in our Human Sexuality summer class. Somehow despite the prewarnings this film still caught me off guard and made me feel well out of my element. There were scenes where I felt as if I would be sick and scenes that I myself could relate to. Despite me not being a BDSM practitioner I understood his need to control how he experienced pain. It brought insight into how BDSM can be used as an art form such as performance art and also as a way of therapy. Bob Flannigan referred to himself as a supermasochist and allowed the viewers to see how the impact of both cystic fibrosis and BDSM affected not only his lifestyle but also his body. Although there were many scenes I found slightly disturbing the final scene when he was dying made me emotionally uncomfortable. His blankdistant stare as Sheree sat by his bedside upset and frustrated made me feel as though I knew him. The documentary allows you to take a step into his life and understand why and how he perceived the world his disease how he perceives love and life. He then turned this documented therapy into a beautiful yet sort of dark open and honest art. At the end of the film upon reflection Bob started dying the moment he was born and he somehow found a way to make a mark and his life something memorable for a lot people including Sarah another cystic fibrosis patient. To me he bled to feel alive and although that may not be the case for everyone it gave him hope and something to live for knowing that it was in his control. To sum up my overall feeling about the film the words beautiful disaster come to mind. Bob was such a kind submissive man that knew nothing but pain. In the end I feel that he finally found the peace and satisfaction he strived his whole life to find. Through this documentary though not for everyone his story will live on in hope to inspire move and touch others.".

What made this documentary so wonderful is how straight forward and natural Bob is about his BDSM practises and his struggle with Cystic Fibrosis. Although the practises are very extreme and perhaps these are not acts that all BDSM practitioners would engage in Bob does call himself a SUPERmasochist one can get a real fix of what living out this lifestyle involves. Also a raw and in depth portrayal of a sadomasochist relationship that contains both joys and struggles is examined. There are extremely graphic scenes which are definitely not for the faint of heart. It was clear to see that Bob needed masochism in his life to focus on as well he claims it had prolonged his life. Because he knew he was going to die at a sooner time than most others he was not afraid and had the mind set to use his body to the fullest while he could. I believe the pain that Bob experienced while engaging in BDSM allowed him to view his disease as more minor or feel as though he had some control over what his body went through.The scene that depicts Bob's death is extremely moving and the depth of the relationship and love between him and his partner is clearly seen. Although this is tough to watch it goes to show that sadomasochistic relationship can be deeply rooted in love and not just based on the premise of getting off by harming another person. Overall Sick is a wonderful and eye opening documentary on the life of BDSM practitioners worth watching.".

Examples of Bob's compassion are when he grants Sara's wish she gets to meet a man who she looks up to. Sara and Bob also stayed in contact with one another because a year later he goes with her to get her nipples pierced. As well Bob worked at a summer camp for children with Cystic Fibrosis for twentytwo years where he sings and provides confidence in these children. In the background you can hear the children enjoying Bob's company and guidance. Although the next scene following the camp is when Bob goes into description and then shows himself putting a nail through the head of his penis. Many people find this disturbing and unbearable to watch this is how Bob was able to prolong his life through his BDSM practices. The pain and suffering caused by his CF is uncontrollable and practicing BDSM with his wife allows him to control pain and enjoy it. I think the documentary placing the scenes of Bob's compassion and BDSM probably one of the more disturbing BDSM practices shows how different roles can be played and used for strength and healing and just how separate people can make their personal life from the outside world. Although disturbing for many reasons the documentary is a very powerful film. Without seeing this I would not have acquired a more in depth meaning to why people practice and use BDSM.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sick was overall an incredibly powerful documentary. Through the very real portrayal of Bob Flanagan's life while dealing with his sickness one can gain a more in depth understanding of someone who engages in the lifestyle of BDSM. Before watching this documentary many questions as to why a person would participate in BDSM arise however through this documentary many questions can be answered. Bob Flanagan's idea that S and M saved his life is quite fascinating because many people would view S and M as a dangerous or harmful lifestyle but yet he views it as a lifeline. In the film even his father talked about how watching the practices he partakes in was difficult and similar to watching a trapeze artist while worrying they'll fall and die but then seeing him land on his feet made him proud of his son. Another interesting aspect of this documentary was the portrayal of the relationship between Sheree and Bob. The relationship between the two appears to be very loving which is not what the average person would expect from a couple who practices BDSM. This relationship helps to challenge the stereotype of people who practice BDSM being cold and unloving. There were some incredibly graphic image in this film however they were definitely necessary to help the viewer gain an understanding of Bob Flanagan's life. Although many of the S and M images were graphic and at times difficult to watch the most difficult and powerful part of the documentary was the ending in which the viewer watches Bob's last moments and his death. The ending of the film gives it an even more real and heart wrenching feeling. Overall this documentary was incredibly powerful and informative.11049540".

In his song at the beginning of the film Bob sings The CF would have killed him if it weren't for S and M. It makes me wonder whether SM practice did lengthen his life. Although it's easy to say that Cystic Fibrosis is a disease which is completely ruled by biology it is impossible to explain how someone who should have died as a child or teenager could have lived as long as he did. Perhaps the answer is that his SM and subsequent art performance gave him something for which to life and that affected his life span. They do say emotion affects health. But maybe his SM did not affect his lifespan but the practice made his life better. You know the saying It's not the years in your life it's the life in your years? Bob found something he was passionate about and he used that to create art. I don't think that Bob would have left behind the same legacy without his BDSM practice. So no maybe his practice did not actually elongate his life but it sure as hell gave him something to care about. And that is a reason to watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely there is a movie that can in equal measures make you want to cry and embrace the power of love while at the same time reach for the sick bag. Yet Sick Kirby Dick's powerful documentary of sadomasochistic performance artist and poet Bob Flanagan achieves this to a quite startling effect taking us through his art career his often bizarre sexual practices his relationship with partnerdominator Sheree Rose and his battle with cystic fibrosis. Dick juxtaposes Flanagan's lust for pain and humiliation alongside his crippling disease which often left him hospitalised for days on end and what eventually killed him.Personally I'm all for people doing whatever makes them tick as long as it's legal and if someone gets turned on by someone inserted a large silver ball up their arse then crack on. But for us with 'normal' sexual preferences sadomasochism can seem a strange act especially for someone suffering from an incurable disease. What is remarkable about Sick is the sensitivity in which Dick handles the subject never patronising and misportraying Flanagan yet showing his acts for what they are  squirminducing but undeniably fascinating  and above all else it is clearly a tower of strength for Flanagan a way to control his body while his disease slowly destroys it.Admittedly his somewhat simplistic art left a lot to be desired but it is in his writing where he comes alive. Seen in archive clips playing guitar and singing Flanagan is so endearing due to his sense of humour. He knows the world saw him as a freak but he embraced it turned it into art and is still one of the longestliving sufferers of CF. But beneath all the chains scars and piercings lay a warm human being and as his disease overwhelms him we have to witness his slow death in front of his partner Sheree. The 'Hammer of Love' scene in which Flanagan hammers a nail into the end of his penis will have you covering your eyes in horror but it is Bob's final moments that will linger in the memory as he stares up at his love taking his harsh final breathes. Simply amazing heartbreaking documentary filmmaking.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:headline " Keep Your Friends Close...And Your Enemies Closer";
	schema:reviewBody "To be accurate I haven't seen this film per se. What I saw was a videotape that Sheree brought to show friends right after Bob died. I'm assuming it was edited into a final version for sale. From the reviews I've read it has all of what I remember except I don't remember seeing anything about Bob's mother.I knew Bob and Sheree from 1983 until his death. As things developed in the underground sex community Bob and I were on opposite sides. Everything has political factions. Some groups want to join together some want to split up. We ended up leading opposite sides. Which puts me in the rare position to tell about Bob's petty side. But that's not important. What's important is being willing to be radically different sexually in order to be mentally healthier and live a longer happier life.That's a position I share with Bob. I had occasion to discuss the subject with him shortly before his death. His perspective was a bit different from mine. No one seems to mention the terrible wracking pain of CF. It's interesting the degree to which major illnesses turn out to conceal symptoms from the public. And if I was to discuss some of Bob's symptoms and coping methods this review wouldn't see the light of day. Hammer of Love is a trivial little entry point to give the public something it can deal with. I'm suddenly hearing Tom Cruise shouting at Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.Sorry about drifting into what weaklings you healthy people are. Back to Bob's viewpoint. He said that the recreational pain was for him a way of showing that he not his illness was in control. Bob I hope I got that right. I asked him if he was the oldest person with CF. He said there were maybe three or so older than him. But in considering that you need to know that CF can attack the lungs or the dozens of feet of the GI tract. Bob had it in both and as bad as you can have in both. And he still almost made it longer than any of the other people with CF.My explanation goes deeper. It's that if you have to do something reviled by society to stay alive e.g. be beaten every day of your life you have two choices. One take your beating from a health care professional hired for the job and endure the pain. Or two the smarter more heroic choice. Find another person to share the experience with and revel in the sensations. Frankly if it's that intense it's going to be unavoidable that it takes on a sexual aspect. Now you're really on society's st list.If you are as lucky as Bob and myself you may find someone who can be more than a partner of the moment. Someone brave enough to be your partner in this life and beyond. With that combination of luck...and a lot of hard work what would be trauma to both the body and soul can be turned into a celebration of life. An act of love. So it not only keeps you alive another day but serves to strengthen you..and your partner. And that's why some of the sexual underground is about people trying to survive. Some don't even know that what they think of as sexual urges what society condemns as perversions is actually their body and spirit trying to tell them what they need to live a longer happier life.Hopefully that message even though not how Bob described his own view will come through the film. Some of you might wonder what's killing me. My personal research strongly indicates it's a gaseous neurotransmitter disorder. But they've only just been discovered in the last generation. So I'm hoping to interest a researcher a top hematologist in taking my case. If I told you what it took for me to last as long as I have you would suddenly consider Bob and Sheree Rose's film a Walt Disney production. Just please remember the next time you're thinking of condemning a pervert or stopping a kid from doing something sexual maybe even your own kid it is some part of them trying to survive. Even if it looks wrong to you. Try to not think about social wrong or unhealthy but strictly what is really healthy. And that mostly has to do with cleanliness. Fecal matter is always a bad idea. Unless the person has been eating a lot of yogurt.Love to all you good people out there and especially to Karen the reason I'm still alive.P.S.To any old timers that remember me set Donnie up in the Violet Wand business etc.. In the words of the Monty Python skit I'm not dead yet! But I'm mostly bedridden and have been doing a distressing amount of screaming from the pain lately. I do have good medical care. I'm just maxing out what can be done. Luckily one way or another I won't have to keep doing this. But if a researcher does come up with counter to my neurotoxin having all those dead nerves come back to life will be quite a ride.".

	onyx:emotionText "To be accurate I haven't seen this film per se. What I saw was a videotape that Sheree brought to show friends right after Bob died. I'm assuming it was edited into a final version for sale. From the reviews I've read it has all of what I remember except I don't remember seeing anything about Bob's mother.I knew Bob and Sheree from 1983 until his death. As things developed in the underground sex community Bob and I were on opposite sides. Everything has political factions. Some groups want to join together some want to split up. We ended up leading opposite sides. Which puts me in the rare position to tell about Bob's petty side. But that's not important. What's important is being willing to be radically different sexually in order to be mentally healthier and live a longer happier life.That's a position I share with Bob. I had occasion to discuss the subject with him shortly before his death. His perspective was a bit different from mine. No one seems to mention the terrible wracking pain of CF. It's interesting the degree to which major illnesses turn out to conceal symptoms from the public. And if I was to discuss some of Bob's symptoms and coping methods this review wouldn't see the light of day. Hammer of Love is a trivial little entry point to give the public something it can deal with. I'm suddenly hearing Tom Cruise shouting at Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men.Sorry about drifting into what weaklings you healthy people are. Back to Bob's viewpoint. He said that the recreational pain was for him a way of showing that he not his illness was in control. Bob I hope I got that right. I asked him if he was the oldest person with CF. He said there were maybe three or so older than him. But in considering that you need to know that CF can attack the lungs or the dozens of feet of the GI tract. Bob had it in both and as bad as you can have in both. And he still almost made it longer than any of the other people with CF.My explanation goes deeper. It's that if you have to do something reviled by society to stay alive e.g. be beaten every day of your life you have two choices. One take your beating from a health care professional hired for the job and endure the pain. Or two the smarter more heroic choice. Find another person to share the experience with and revel in the sensations. Frankly if it's that intense it's going to be unavoidable that it takes on a sexual aspect. Now you're really on society's st list.If you are as lucky as Bob and myself you may find someone who can be more than a partner of the moment. Someone brave enough to be your partner in this life and beyond. With that combination of luck...and a lot of hard work what would be trauma to both the body and soul can be turned into a celebration of life. An act of love. So it not only keeps you alive another day but serves to strengthen you..and your partner. And that's why some of the sexual underground is about people trying to survive. Some don't even know that what they think of as sexual urges what society condemns as perversions is actually their body and spirit trying to tell them what they need to live a longer happier life.Hopefully that message even though not how Bob described his own view will come through the film.

As an opening enscripted frame makes clear the episodes depicted in this film are fictional but in some instances they parallel occurrences of the young author's stay in the Yukon as we watch Jack played earnestly by Jeff East disembark at Skagway Alaska rescue a dog from harsh treatment overcome many natural obstacles to reach the minefields woo dance hall girls compete in a dogsled race and make friends and enemies along the way.  A rather substantial budget for a Canadianmade film is in place and a good deal of footage is shot leading to postproduction difficulties of editing and sound mixing problems of asynchronism appear but the product is never boring and there are solid contributions from the crew unfortunately the work disappeared after a two week run.  East has a narrow acting range but Peter Carter directs him well with London's early commitment to Socialism being subtly addressed while Angie Dickinson as owner of a saloon walks through her part but Rod Steiger employing his Method methods as principal villain of the piece Lorne Greene as supervising Mountie in Dawson and Gordon Pinsent as an inveterate gambling man each controls his scenes.  Credit must be given to those who make the work visually agreeable notably Seamus Flannery for production design and Patti Unger for accurate costumes a pleasing score is contributed by Hagood Hardy all in all in spite of its flaws this film was worthy of being produced and is worthwhile to see.".

The card sharp whom London outplays for 500 25000 in today's money! is at first suitably sullen and angry and yet next thing you know and for the rest of the movie he's a happy go lucky friendly fellow adventurer!The bad guys are baby kicking bad well dog kicking with no apparent other purpose or goal than to be bad guys. Soapy Smith is presented as just evil and venal hardly historically accurate nor fair and I almost laughed when Soapy's right hand man in malfeasance the dog handler was introduced and he is made up to look just like Popeye's nemesis Brutus!

Or the remarkable scene where the women are stranded on shore and call out for rescue to London and his partner in their passing boat? They say the gambler has taken off down river on foot to look for help as their boat was stolen! if he can hike down river then why on earth was it necessary for all those travelers to build boats? Once the Jack London boat has negotiated the swift water with the women on board that the gambler had evidently skirted on foot there he appears and somehow he has the boat again!In fact a great deal of the movie Klondike Fever requires suspension of disbelief and while this is not an unusual requirement in movie watching circles too much of it detracts from the experience and the production starts to appear cartoonish.

But this isn't about Middle School children it is about the substitute teacher in the 6th grade class.The students know right away that something isn't right but it isn't until later that they discover just what is wrong. Of course their parents don't believe them and it is up to the kids one in particular Carl Jonas Wandschneider to save the others. Of course Carl is the least likely student to save the day as he lost his mother in a car accident and has not gotten past it.The film has first rate acting by Paprika Steen as the substitute teacher outstanding cinematography lots of black humor a slam on psychology and parents who don't trust in their children and some really fascinating special effects.I am really impressed with Ole Bornedal who wrote and directed this film and look forward to his new films.".

	onyx:emotionText "One might be ready to believe a film about Middle School children to be a Ghost House movie. But this isn't about Middle School children it is about the substitute teacher in the 6th grade class.The students know right away that something isn't right but it isn't until later that they discover just what is wrong. Of course their parents don't believe them and it is up to the kids one in particular Carl Jonas Wandschneider to save the others. Of course Carl is the least likely student to save the day as he lost his mother in a car accident and has not gotten past it.The film has first rate acting by Paprika Steen as the substitute teacher outstanding cinematography lots of black humor a slam on psychology and parents who don't trust in their children and some really fascinating special effects.I am really impressed with Ole Bornedal who wrote and directed this film and look forward to his new films.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer for this film I knew it was something I had to watch. I can't remember any Danish scifi movies off the top of my head and I knew that a director like Bornedal would never just tack on such a genre for no reason. It also seemed wonderfully crazy and Danish black humour does work very well on film. When you actually go see the film you realise that the fantastic elements of the story are only cosmetic and that the film isn't about aliens with strange powers but rather about what our society is changing into.The film's acting is spot on the kids have been cast very well their characters seeming genuine. The main character Carl is particularly well portrayed and his emotions all seem perfectly sincere and authentic. You can't put a finger on the acting of any of the supporting roles either Ulrich Thomsen does a very effective father and Ulf Pilgaard seems delightfully mechanical in his portrayal of the education minister. But in the end with all due respect to all the other actors Paprika Steen really outshines everyone else. She is frighteningly effective in her role as Ulla Harms the Substitute. Constantly condescending towards the students in an effort to turn them into the best children possible so they can compete in Paris with other students from various parts of Europe Ulla Harms is a fantastic villain. The way she doesn't show any remorse at all towards the students she insults the way she'll stop at nothing in her quest to discover what love is which she of course tries to do in totally psychopathic manner.One of the few flaws the movie has is that it doesn't really flesh out certain characters who while not actually very important to the plot still get a lot of screen time and thus should be made more clear than they were. This makes some of the characters seem a bit shallow. The important characters are dealt with as they should though so it's not a very big problem.Another thing I can complain about is the ending. The final scene starts out very calmly with a bit of narration from what I think is Ole Bornedal himself and then suddenly explodes into a loud and very energetic series of credits. It didn't really fit in and it seemed fairly pointless.All in all the Substitute is a very entertaining movie part social commentary part black comedy part horror. With stunning performances by virtually all the actors and a very effective script the Substitute delivered everything I thought it would and much much more. I can recommend it to all fans of Danish filmmaking.".

Steen's trademark Dogmetrained nuanced natural acting this time only serves as a masquerade for a flatout overthetop monster and you can see how much wicked fun she has switching between those two faces proving her impressive emotional outbursts and character quirks to be nothing but a cold calculated lie within the blink of an eye.The other actors do fine too as only Danish actors can. The kids are not annoying even if they have to scream and be cute occasionally. Our hero Carl manages to be a sympathetic if troubled young man my only nitpicking being that he might be a bit too selfconsciously handsome to really convince as the class weirdo and outsider. Also his love story with the new girl remains a bit underdeveloped. But hey they're teenagers love comes and goes quickly at that age I guess.The film is a great fun romp from start to finish never buried under the weight of its kidfriendly message and comes highly recommended. As stated before Paprika Steen deserves prizes and kudos for what she does. And Ole Bornedal keeps the promise he made with Nightwatch. Mainstream family cinema doesn't get much better than this.P.S. The only real letdown right at the beginning of the end credits there is a high school prom dance scene that is totally out of tune with the rest of the film. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to be 'cool' with the young audience in a way the film otherwise thankfully doesn't feel the need to be.".

Yet this film isn't restricted to children as adults can easily enjoy it. Ole Bornedal and Henrik Prip have written a superb screenplay meshing it with both humour irony and horror while telling a linear story. The washed out colours and score bring that horror movie feel. The cinematography and special effects are topnotch. Then there's the outstanding performance of Paprika Steen as Ulla Harms. The use of a lesser actress could have easily ruined the film. Steen beautifully carries the role very naturally and with an amazing balance between restraint and overthetop acting she just proves what a masterful actress she is. The child actors also do a good job. 'Vikaren' is sheer fun and one of the best examples of family entertainment. It doesn't go over the top in delivering its message while maintaining a fine gradient such that both adults and children could enjoy it to the full.".

One of the more enjoyable aspects here is the fact that this one features a rather simple premise that gains a lot of credibility because of how it goes about keeping that a secret from those that matter. How this one builds up her identity with the fake name the strange photograph where objects keep appearing based on the revelations made by the group and the strange mindcontrol properties and the connection to the chickens make for great fun and when it gets to the confirmation sequence it's unbelievably suspenseful and generates a great shock as well as the sciencefiction centered finale that ends this one with some fun times. There's some mild flaws here mainly in the fact that the target of this one being centered on kids and middleschool children even there's going to be no deaths or even gore opportunities involved which is fine but definitely keeps this far more tamed than it should. The bigger one though is that this one gets revealed so early on that the amount of time taken to convince others and spread the warning to the disbelieving parents feels more like a plot device to keep the movie going rather than any sort of truthful realness had this happened in reallife but this is still a rather fun effort.Rated R Graphic Language Violence and childreninjeopardy.".

In attempt to do just that they send a sphere that lands on a deserted chicken farm. They take over the body of a farmers wife who reports to work as a grade six school teacher. Paprika Steen who plays the teacher is fantastic. She plays the wickedly nasty teacher with over the top enthusiasm and absolutely nails it. It is one of the most amusing and entertaining characters I have seen in a horror film in some time. The kids figure out almost immediately that there is something not quite right about their new teacher. She taunts and humiliates the children with insults and appears to have the answer to every question. The more they learn about their new teacher the more horrified they become. The first half of this film is rock solid. A real masterpiece. Unfortunately the films conclusion is a complete and utter crapout. The ending seemed hurried and the finale was anticlimatic to say the least. It is intended to be more amusing than horrifying but it would have been appropriate to add a little more suspense particularly for the final scene. There is no gore in this film and no scares at all. There are only a few isolated moments of suspense. This being said this film is still extremely watchable and I think that people who aren't generally fans of the horror genre will also enjoy it. More PG than our regular fair but some really good clean fun!".

Soon after being elected to the United States Congress under a slogan painting him as a politician out to change the world God Morgan Freeman commissions Baxter to build an ark in the midst of one of the worst droughts in the history of the area.In a predictable move the area townspeople antagonize Baxter as he begins the construction of the ark. Baxter's reputation is further soiled by the fact that his political career is being looked as a joke when he starts wearing sack cloth on a regular basis and animals of all kinds are following him around in pairs. Baxter's boss Congressman Long who once supported him quickly becomes the antagonist as the people begin to turn against Baxter.Evan Almighty is predictable on every turn and has enough humor to satisfy. The animals do their part to provide a fair share of fecal humor. Morgan Freeman offers up plenty of wisdom in the role of God. Steve Carell does an exceptionally adequate job of delivering very humorous dialogue which in his style is sure to be adlibbed in great part. The sheer amounts of animals in this film are overwhelming and a treat to behold. Overall the storyline and humor feel very clich. Evan Almighty was a mild success but just does not offer anything special apart from a few good laughs. Parents with children will get their money's worth out of this but for everyone else it is a worthwhile rental.".

But it is a really good family film.This film had a lot of potential for comedy. It delivered at times but not consistently. It also had two very crude toilet humour jokes involving male genitalia just the word though nothing beyond that. I will freely admit this isn't nearly as hilarious a comedy as the original. But it's good in its own right.Morgan Freeman's scenes as God were excellently written and performed! One scene in particular in a restaurant was really touching and moving. Freeman is really a terrific actor I'm glad they cast him as God. The performances in this movie were overall great.

Of course Carell was up and coming then but as his boxoffice success shows the character responsible for arguably the only really funny scene in 'Bruce Almighty' deserves a film of his own. Shadayac and co. have approached it with a novel if potentially expensive idea to make God Morgan Freeman appear this time to instruct Baxter to build an Arc and as Noah did before him load it full of animals to protect them from an for an oncoming flood. It's an idea that's very entertaining even if the jokes are less easy than the previous premise. Evan's transformation of appearance and being pursued by eager animals are the main areas of humour here which means at times the film is thin on the ground. Sentiment comes in the form of Evan's neglect of his family the audience will know exactly where this will be going but fortunately the sentiment isn't as annoying as you might believe. It's also very much a family affair the humour and the language very much for family audiences. Disappointingly Shadayac responsible for bringing out two of Jim Carrey's worst performances namely 'Liar Liar' and 'Bruce Almighty' by letting Carrey overdo it by seemingly telling him to do the whole thing as an impression of William Shatner mistakenly this time opts to take Carell down a notch. Carell's trademark hysteria and bizarre reactions are in short supply and we have an all together calmer 'Little Miss Sunshine'esquire turn which also means the film loses some of it's potential in this instance. Wanda Sykes and co. are merely stock characters needing better dialogue. Does this make it a bad film? Not at all. It's religious tieins if rushed are quite smart and it's very well directed visually with a great use of music and keeping a steady pace. It is what's on the label but with a jawdroppingly impressive final act which will really take you by surprise and could be up there as one of the sights of the summer! You could do a lot worse than enjoy 100 minutes of easygoing fun but if it's a laughoutloud rollercoaster you want you will leave shortchanged!".

With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving into a house the size of the Acropolis the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family.

And in true mischievous deity style he also forces Evan to grow a beard long hair and wear worn and tatty robes. Now back in the day I'm sure razors were hard to come by so the beard was somewhat of an inevitability for Noah but I'm almost certain it had nothing to do with spirituality. Same with the robes a massive construction job is surely made all the more difficult by such impractical clothing. Couldn't God have conjured up a pair of steel toed boots and a hard hat for the poor guy? Apparently not.To paraphrase Bill Hicks I find the idea that God is messing with us somewhat unsettling and so does Evan who fights him every step of the way. And who wouldn't? God essentially gets him fired drives away his loved ones makes him a laughing stock and at one point actually threatens him. Of course God turns out to be right and the rational hard working family man who was getting on fine by himself is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet humble pie. It's almost as if to be left alone by God Evan had to tolerate and humour him. What kind of message is that? Evan Almighty does have a highly commendable environmental slant with the underlying theme being that the Federal Government is blind to the damage being done to the world around us. It is also the first film ever to offset its carbon emissions and this should surely be considered a landmark achievement by a Hollywood studio. Were it not for the trite condescending banner of American Christianity flying high above it Evan Almighty could have been an inoffensive family movie with a praiseworthy environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and relentless 'blind faith' message it ranks as one of the most repugnant movies of all time.".

	schema:headline " Passion of the Christ the bloodfree version";
	schema:reviewBody "One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter Carrell moving up the ladder into the main player slot. The story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic sons slightly weird primary school moppet spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager. Evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when God Morgan Freeman appears and asks him to build an Ark.In other words it's an updating of the old Genesis story with Evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. Unfortunately while the premise is reasonably promising it sadly does not provide many laughs. There's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where Evan's straightlaced MP tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it but as soon as he accepts his divine mission the film takes a nosedive.From this point on it turns into a message movie. Evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance though the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animalfeces jokes and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's exasperated righthand man. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in Arrested Development but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel especially seeing as Carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the backburner.In some respects it's slightly similar to the Passion of the Christ but unlike Mel Gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood letting and guilt tripping Evan Almighty tries a more gentle approach. The movie simply tells us that we should have faith in God because He has faith in us. Unfortunately this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as the Passion is. Carrell is on autopilot the jokes don't exist and Wanda Sykes makes a bid to become the most annoying person on the planet. It might be sweet but somebody just tossed 175 000 000 overboard.".

	onyx:emotionText "One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.A sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty this film sees former supporting character Evan Baxter Carrell moving up the ladder into the main player slot. The story opens with him leaving the news desk to become a public official and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic sons slightly weird primary school moppet spirited middle schooler and sulky teenager. Evan's bid to change the world through politics however gets a spanner in the works when God Morgan Freeman appears and asks him to build an Ark.In other words it's an updating of the old Genesis story with Evan fighting off cynicism and naysayers to build the immense boat. Unfortunately while the premise is reasonably promising it sadly does not provide many laughs. There's a bit of fun to be had in the early going where Evan's straightlaced MP tries to juggle the demands of public service with the unwelcome packs of animals that follow him around and a beard that resists all attempts to shave it but as soon as he accepts his divine mission the film takes a nosedive.From this point on it turns into a message movie. Evan begins preaching with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps turning up to offer kind wisdom while gently prodding his chosen in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance though the only trace of comedy left comes in the form of a few rubbish animalfeces jokes and John Michael Higgin's role as Evan's exasperated righthand man. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential that he did previously in Arrested Development but his enthusiasm cannot save the sinking vessel especially seeing as Carrell has all but placed his formidable improv skills on the backburner.In some respects it's slightly similar to the Passion of the Christ but unlike Mel Gibson's movie which encouraged everyone to believe in God through blood letting and guilt tripping Evan Almighty tries a more gentle approach.

Sadly Shadyac's 'Evan Almighty' only provides a few such moments. There just isn't enough comedy and at times it's a little too dramatic. Throughout the films there are only but a very few dialogues that are funny as a result of which actors like Sykes and Graham don't have enough comedy to work with. Carell reprises his role from the prequel 'Bruce Almighty' but this time he's a little more of a nicer guy. Overall Carell does a good job but he's more in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' mode which brings 'Evan Almighty' down a notch because that kind of character doesn't fully work for this kind of film and it is Shadyac to be blamed for not making something better of something decent. Yet Carell's the only one who provides comic relief even though it's with limited quantity. His interaction with the animals are awesome to watch. Morgan Freeman is more cheerful and more annoying in this one. Lauren Graham plays the typical housewife and mother well and her reaction to Carell's transformation is excellent. In spite of all it's flaws it is the last half hour that lifts the film. It builds up the drama and suspense very well and sort of has an adventurous feel. This entire sequence is very well executed. The soundtrack is well used and the songs are nice too. Thus despite its shortcomings it's still entertaining but don't expect a laugh riot.".

I find Steve Carell annoying and Bruce Almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. Somehow this film was even lower than my expectations even when I didn't have any. Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well let's just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. Actually Evan Almighty was had the EXACT same plot outline as Noah with the exception of a few technicalities it was nothing but a carbon copy of a farsuperior movie that was actually FUNNY. Another thing did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes' stupid unfunny redundant oneliners that were literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. Despite the fact that I basically had already seen the film ten years earlierNoah Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I've ever seen. I figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off Noah left and right. In conclusion if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty and are already sick of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in liked Bruce Almighty and don't want to see a predictable dry unfunny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey then please don't see this piece of garbage.".

The very idea of it was lame  take a minor character from a mediocre PG13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a PGrated family movie. I wasn't the least bit interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie and I'm not exaggerating  every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3minute Cliff's Notes version of the flick. So obviously I wasn't gonna pay to see it but once it hit DVD I thought sure I'll watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it.Nope.I'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this. He must have owed someone a favor. The jokes were all so flat and obvious and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrey. But it's just not funny. The studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40YearOld Virgin complete with several of Carell's past costars a reference to the flick on a theater marquee and another musical closing credits sequence. But even the talented Carrell can't save this. His costars don't fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted. Wanda Sykes isn't wasted she's just a waste in anything she does and her horrible oneliners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.The story itself is just predictable and lazy. It pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing like Evan's disregard for the environment drives a gasguzzling Humvee opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house hates animals... and by the end it's just overthetop preachy on both faith and the environment.Why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough but I really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever. The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work I've ever seen. Maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure. But hey it wasn't the worst film of the year by far. There's still plenty of worse duds like Norbit and Death Proof.".

I really liked Bruce Almighty part one. I also thought the idea of having the sequel being centered around the Noah story was a strong idea. I felt you bring back Steve Carrell and bring back Morgan Freeman. That is was an interesting way to get by without Jim Carrey. Afterall Steve Carrell is a rising Hollywood starthe next Jim Carrey or Will Farrell. I saw the clips of Steve with his beard and Noah get upthe visual looked funny to me. I thought there was room for some funny scenes with Animals.Honestly I was wrong dead wrong. The only animal getting really any valuable screen time were the Baboonsthe animals were hardy in it. I think most were just stage dressing done with CGI. Honestly the script for this movie needed a total overhaul. You will watch this movie and think you are being treated like you are some kind of moron. The worse thing about this movie though is it is not funnyprobably the directors fault because everything that should be funny just isn't.Again as for the script weird things start happening to Evan. And Evan rather than try to convince people that something strange is going on.just seems fine with everyone thinking he is crazy. A good example is one morning Evan wakes up with a beard. He tries to shave the beard. In second the beard grows right back. So rather than show his wife family and friends this.he simply lets them think he is crazy. I mean seriously if some man you knew grew a full beard overnight or really in one second would you not think something strange is happeninginstead people think Evan is crazy. Then animals following Evan around everywhere he goesin pairs. But rather than thinking something strange is going oneveryone thinks Evan is crazy.look people you can see the animals follow Evan aroundhe does not have a leash on. It is one thing after another that leaves you going  HELLO SCRIPT WRITERS ARE YOU FIVE YEARS OLD! So again this movie was painfully bad. I really feel I needed to write a review. About 30 minutes into this I was going.wow I am so bummed.I looked forward to this movie..and unfortunately it was total crap. Don't waste your time on it. This movie was rumored to cost like 200 Million to makelet them lose money on it because the people deserve better than to be treated like total morons. I could not be more disappointed.".

It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message but the message was a clich hopeless mess to begin with.

The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent cringeworthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty Evan Almighty blows its whole recordbreaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan's ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes God was trying to influence politics.".

Plain and simple. The only somewhat chuckleinducing moments come from Wanda Sykes' oneliners Steve Carell does not have a single funny thing to say the whole movie. I almost felt bad for him stumbling through this poorlywritten and ridiculously implausible script with a goofy look of frustration the whole time about how the world didn't believe him and God expected too much of him.

The denouement was a wild and crazy surprise that literally sailed right to the heart of what it takes to make a difference. Morgan Freeman was great at maintaining his aloof yet omnipresent character. It is a fun and inspirational family film. I think it is sure to be a blockbuster so enjoy it. F.Y.I.

And what more dramatic material to bring up to date than the story of Noah and the worldwide flood?Well I guess if Billy Bob Thornton can singlehandedly build a fully functioning rocket in his own barn then Steve Carell can certainly construct a fullscale floatable ark in his backyard  although in fairness to Thornton it should be pointed out that his character doesn't have God Himself in the person of a gaptoothed Morgan Freeman providing him with the resources and knowhow necessary to get the job done.Evan Almighty is an innameonly sequel to the hit comedy Bruce Almighty from a few years back. In the lead role Jim Carrey has been replaced by Steve Carell who played the manipulative sarcastic Buffalo weatherman Evan Baxter in the previous film. Somehow Baxter seems to have undergone a complete personality transformation over the course of several years since now he is a puppydog idealist who has just been elected to the U.S. Congress on the eversotrite slogan  Change the World. However no sooner does he move his family from upstate New York to suburban Virginia than he begins receiving visitations from a strange man claiming to be God and commanding Evan to build an ark on the lot next door. Naturally his family and coworkers believe the poor man has gone off the deep end although here the movie betrays its lack of internal consistency since the miracles that are occurring to him  being followed all over town by pairs of exotic animals being unable to shave his newly grown beard and whiskers etc.  are there for all to see thus making the disbelief of the populace either a monument to their own stupidity or more likely an implausible heavyhanded plot device. And speaking of plot devices why do all these nonindigenous creatures like giraffes elephants and lions  let alone all the birds  show up to this location when the flood itself turns out to be a mere local event? Exactly what are they fleeing from unless there's a zoo with very flimsy cages nearby which we know nothing about? And of course to smooth things over for modern audiences who might be made a trifle uncomfortable by all the wanton death and destruction in the original story the Steve Oedekerk script is quick to point out that THIS flood is no act of wrath on the part of God and that even the first one was actually a tale about commitment and love. Is there nothing Hollywood can't reduce to sheer dreck and utter pablum?Directed by Tim Shadyac Evan Almighty is said to be the most expensive comedy ever made. Well the expense we can see what will all the CGI effects and animalcontrol needed to make the concept come to life on screen. The comedy on the other hand is a trifle more difficult to discern. Even though the movie gets its requisite dogpoop joke out of the way in the first five minutes this is a decidedly more tame familyfriendly movie than the often raunchy Bruce Almighty. That would be fine if the jokes in Evan Almighty happened to be funny. Instead of humor however we're given a God who smiles smugly and delivers sappy little homilies about belief and faith in terms so simpering and blithe they make your average Sunday School lesson seem edgy and dark in comparison.Carell does what he can with a poorly written part but Freeman's arch condescension wears thin very early on. Wanda Sykes as one of Baxter's Congressional aides repeats her trick from the wretched Monsterinlaw of hijacking all the movie's best lines and one wishes she could at least have been assigned the role of Mrs. Noah as a means of garnering her a bit more time on screen.Here's hoping that God comes up with new and better material  or at least a better ghostwriter  the next time around.".

The film does not mention which party he belongs to but it's probably the GOP.Evan resigns his lucrative news job and heads to Washington. There he immediately settles into a huge mansion I mean HUGE and jumps into his first day on the Hill. There we meet his staff chief Marty John Michael Higgins The BreakUp executive secretary Rita Wanda Sykes and fat creepy intern Eugene Jonah Hill Accepted Knocked Up.He is also bamboozled into supporting a colleague's John Goodman bill to allow private development in national parks that's why I assume he's a Republican since Hollywood naturally believes that party wants to allow private development in national parks .... With all of this new work he like most movie fathers begins to complete ignore his family.Meanwhile he begins to receive bizarre items in the mail such as a set of archaic hand tools and deliveries of tons of wood and other materials. Finally the longawaited appearance of God Freeman takes place and Evan is instructed to build an ark.At first of course he scoffs at the idea but as more and more items are delivered eight adjacent neighborhood lots are purchased in his name and animals of all kinds begin to follow him he begins to take things seriously. Also God performs a few little miracles and Evan grows facial hair slightly faster than a woodland gorilla or Robin Williams to get the point across.Now a bearded robewearing hippy outcast Evan loses his family job and status yet remains true even working to finish the project by himself. God convinces him to undertake this seemingly impossible task by tossing about a few platitudes and performing some more miracles.Purported to be one of the most expensive comedies ever made estimated between 140200 million the word comedy is loosely tossed about here. Sure Carell who made his film debut in Bruce then parlayed that into key roles in Anchorman The 40Year Old Virgin and the hit NBC series The Office is funny in spots but very rarely here.He's either the selfish idealistic congressman or the idiotic idealistic latterday Noah with little development of either character. The laughs in this one come from Sykes who adlibbed 90 percent of her dialog and Hill who knows more about Evan than Evan.Carell spends most of his time pratfalling while trying to construct the massive boat or crying in the wilderness with a staff in his hand like a demented Charleton Heston. The only thing missing is his The End Is Near sign.The situation of a politician turning into a crazed Old Testament prophet is certainly ripe for yucks but director Tom Shadyac Bruce Almighty I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry chooses the heavyhanded approach substituting hilarity for a stifling environmental message.Yeah we KNOW saving the Earth is good we KNOW developing in national parks is BAD. In an attempt to create a modern version of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington Shadyac spreads the sentiment too thick with a heaping helping of maudlin on the side then applies it with a sledgehammer.Much of the budget here was wasted on the animals sequences. Evidently photos of each beast were taken separately and then incorporated digitally into the final product. They should have just CGI'ed everything since that's what the outcome looks like anyway.And Sykes and Hill while very funny in their short screen times are not enough to bail the onrushing water out of this sinking vessel. Also what was with the closing credits? Just various actors as well as other personnel involved in the movie gyrating to C.C. and the Music Company's Everybody Dance Now. You'll leave the theaters probably two by two feeling like a biblical curse has been placed upon you after this flood of nonsense.Talk about original sin.".

But when someone has the audacity to do an all out liveaction family film with of all things religiousChristian overtones the paid critic sharks come out eating it to bits. Case in point is Evan Almighty. A film that isn't trying to be a slap in the face like the Shrek movies and the clones that have followed. It isn't trying to teeter on the PG13R fence to court kids but also give mom  dad something to smile about. It is a straight out PG film done in the same spirit as family films used to be done back in the 50's through the 70's when Disney was producing quality G and PG liveaction films. Thank God we finally get one in the form of Evan Almighty.Unlike the previous Almighty this film is a straight out PG family film. It is predictable it is sweet it has a message. That seems to be a sin in today's movie market or so the cynical critics think. But the charm of Evan is that we are given a film that takes a stand early sticks to it and doesn't resort to PG13 fare to keep us entertained.Steve Carell steps into the annointed ones shoes this go around. He does an excellent job of being you and me. How would you react to being told by God that He wanted an Ark created? We would react just like Evan does dismissing nonbelieving. Yet over time God wears him down and he submits to His will Sunday school lesson there big time. Morgan Freeman returns as THE Almighty and again gives God a charm and cool that we would hope God would be. Wanda Sykes puts in another hilarious supporting performance as does the creepy but funny Jonah Hill. Lauren Graham though looking a little too young to be Evan's wife is solid. The film is filled with themes of loyalty faith and family. It does set out to preach so what! Other opinions other believes are given the same ample thrust in movies today and are readily accepted so why not a straight forward love message? Those who haven't seen the film have wondered why God is flooding again after promising not to. Rest assured it isn't what you think. For a changego so see the movie before you try and use that as a critical measure of the film. There are elements of the film that are fantastical but you don't worry too much about that. Just like with the Disney liveaction films in their golden day you accept and carry on.I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. THAT is what the movie wants to give you and nothing else. Sure we live in a world that is far more cruel and cynical. It doesn't mean all our movies always have to be to entertain us.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't expect much when I bought this film actually I never even heard there was a sequel to the wonderful Bruce Almighty until I noticed the similar names while browsing in a shop and I remembered the name Evan. How could anyone forget Evan Baxter from the first movie? His performance although short was fantastic and the scene where Bruce was messing with him was very memorable.I found Evan Almighty to be quite good in contrast to some of the reviews here. I was very surprised to see this movie scoring at only 5.7 at the time of this review. Sure there were some cheesy scenes Wanda Sykes' lines were hit and miss Jonah Hill as Eugene was just... weird.... but those things don't detract from what is a solid movie with lots of laughter. The only thing I can think of is that Carrey fans would probably be disappointed as there's less slapstick action but more subtle humor. This is because Steve Carell has a different style so it's extremely unfair to compare him to Jim Carrey.This is a family comedy with excellent morals. It should definitely be viewed with the entire family. I enjoyed the humor from Carell I thought the character for him was spoton and really gave him an opportunity to shine on the stage. Lauren Graham was decent I thought she played a deeper character than in Bad Santa but she was okay as the wife. Morgan Freeman was great as usual. The other characters all did well including John Goodman but Carell carried this movie. There are some surprises that some may find cheesy or too predictable but the final scene was immense. It was definitely more powerful than any scene from Bruce Almighty.So give Evan Almighty a chance rent it at least. It's a nice movie that I really can't find any glaring faults that would turn someone off.".

It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works such as Pulp Fiction  Reservoir Dogs but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50ish minutes left the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable gore fest vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films so I still enjoyed the movie but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself and in parts saves the film.810  Watch with an open mind.".

	onyx:emotionText "I enjoyed this film but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.It starts off as a very Tarantinoesquire film it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works such as Pulp Fiction  Reservoir Dogs but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50ish minutes left the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable gore fest vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films so I still enjoyed the movie but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself and in parts saves the film.810  Watch with an open mind.";

	schema:reviewBody "'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant brutal bloody Tarantino horror silly and funny. It is brilliant brutal bloody horror silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'series is all those things the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody sometimes a little funny in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth George Clooney and Richie Gecko Quentin Tarantino. They are bank robbers although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob Harvey Keitel used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott Ernest Liu and his daughter Kate Juliette Lewis.So we have the first hour filled with Tarantinostuff in its dialogue and references and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine Tom Savini and a guy named Frost Fred Williamson. Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy really in the Sam Raimi way to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes not too serious there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance the fitting soundtrack some hilarious moments Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original quite bloody vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.".

From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boysNot Geico played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parodyfarce however once the the whole gangthe two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and sonreach a strip clubbar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here to the uninformed viewer will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree however the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film for many reasons. For one the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me it was a simple crime thriller the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However the switch was such a shock and so fast that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney while Tarantino is in the back paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you. and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established with Clooney as the 'gentleman' well not really crook Tarantino as his psychotic brother who strangely I found difficult not to warm to and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance.  While this film was never made out of blockbuster material it is still very understated taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead well perhaps not THAT bad.For once this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before without any knowledge of the movie you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 810 for it's script thanks to Tarantino and the actors who while not trying too hard make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.".

All of this can and will given the right attitude on the part of the viewers read as a loving highfive to 70s zombie flicks a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout the gore level is astounding and we see via Kate the preacher's daughter played by Juliette Lewis that sometimes a pedoff virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own.

	schema:reviewBody "Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his westerninspired action movie El Mariachi while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in Reservoir Dogs. Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with Four Rooms but together with makeup masters Kurtzman Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s From Dusk Till Dawn.The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers Seth George Clooney and Richard Gecko Tarantino himself and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faithless preacher named Jacob Fuller Harvey Keitel who was traveling with his daughter Kate Juliette Lewis and his son Scott Ernest Liu. In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story by Kurtzman is a very good mix of action western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a DriveIn spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers in a typical Tarantino style crimedrama fashion on the other hand the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences the RodriguezTarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective with George Clooney carrying the film as the coolheaded older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and makeup virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead. All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are topnotch but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic makeup employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoonlike than what it was supposed to be but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers Tarantino included. His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 810".

More than a basic horror movie it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there but for thrill seeking teens it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers George Clooney and Tarantino who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family Harvey Keitel Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis and bring them to a bar called the Ty twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless from dusk till dawn.  Great fun terrific violence if not disgusting and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T.  Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.  A".

	schema:reviewBody "I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise and therefore all the more enjoyable. It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience. Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant which I thought was a great idea. Usually you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself but at a more meta level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first bookfilm.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately though the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without payoff and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories as well as a proper resolution. Still it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a mustsee cult classic.".

Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character and the film's biggest star thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in From Dusk Till Dawn although the two films are nothing alike. For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty hardboiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point the film suddenly switches to become an ultragory ultraviolent vampire movie almost a hyperactive homage to Night Of The Living Dead! It is a jarring switch the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and builtup logically. But both halves are undeniably wellmade and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth George Clooney and Richard Quentin Tarantino Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones so they seize a family travelling in a RV  expreacher Jacob Fuller Harvey Keitel and his kids Scott Ernest Liu and Kate Juliette Lewis. After a palmsweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point a raunchy bikertrucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hellbent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of superstrong bloodsucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An allout gorefest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar tongueincheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his reallife pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wishfulfilment fantasies of tough kids adding heaps of bad language gore nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited starmaking performance while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simpleminded violent action with panache. From Dusk Till Dawn is a raucous selfindulgent actioncomedyroad moviehorror flick  crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1986 there was a small low budget horror movie called 'Vamp' starring Grace Jones as a supreme vampiress Goddess and owner of a seedy strip joint full of seedy hookeresque strippers...it was spanklicious! Then along came Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and they basically completely ripped off the entire idea thus we have this heavily Mexican influenced horror splatter fest.I saw this film on release in the cinema back in the day and I thoroughly enjoyed it this hasn't changed. I think the fun fact with this film is that it works on two levels as we all know the film is basically one story that Uturns into another but both work really well. The first half of the film which focuses on the 'Gecko Brothers' is a violent unapologetic crime spree road trip following the duo on the lamb. Its a strange combination of ice cool badassery and actual nastiness leaving you unsure whether you should be rooting for these two guys. Lets face it Clooney is the slightly charming good looking cool headed leader of the pair sporting a horribly dated tribal tattoo. This guy makes you think its fun and sexy to be a criminal on the run from the law...in a cool car to boot. Then you have Tarantino who is a scrawny whiny bespectacled creep who lies and kills people for no reason he also appears to be a sexual predator and kills possibly raping women. Now together this pair do make a fun fast talking duo of deperados admittedly their bickering is amusing and well performed visually they look quite unique in their appearance and attire and they are badass motherfckers. The thing is they do commit some really quite nasty crimes along the way which is played for dark laughs but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. You can't help but feel they get what they deserve in the end and I personally find it hard to feel any emotion or sympathy for either character. Its like...oh yeah its sad for 'Seth' when 'Richie' gets killed...but wait didn't he kill an innocent female by putting a pillow over her head and shooting her in the face?! Oh and didn't Seth burn that innocent and cooperative liquor store worker to death??!!The main crux of this film is of course the second part of the story when the duo reach the 'Titty Twister' in the middle of nowhere Mexico. From a dark graphic novel style violent crime thriller to an over the top balls to the wall in your face soft porn vampire slaughter. What I like about this section of the film is the fact they use handson effects the whole gamut of traditional methods from models and puppets to bucket loads of goo and gore. I think there is a small amount of CGI for the bats and face morphing but mostly all the death and destruction is utilising classic live action gore effects and some lovely makeup work that I'm sure Savini had a hand in. Even though the Titty Twister is an obvious set it still looks the business both inside and out with clever use of props and camera angles. You know there aren't that many vampires you know the bar set isn't that big you know the outside is restricted for space etc...but with the odd lorry parked in the right position good editing some clever tricks and even an old fashioned matte painting Rodriguez is able to present a much bigger universe on a tight budget.I think this part of the film has its ups and downs honestly. Its definitely a rip roaring brutal cadaver fest which is great fun but as the film progresses towards the finale it does become so over the top with the gore and action it loses its grip and edge. The effects seem to get a little weaker towards the end as though they were running out of cash and time. The makeup is still great but some of the creatures looked pretty ropy truth be told what was that huge rat monster Clooney fights?! kudos for trying but the rod puppet animation used for that thing was hokey looking. I also always wondered why Hayek's character seems to turn into a humanoid reptile that's what it looked like didn't it? not very vampirelike. The various exploding melting head close ups rock but most of the body suits and large vampire bats look very rubbery and fake right at the end.There is no doubt this is another great example of Rodriguez's visual style and somewhat over selfindulgent obsession with the Mexican theme. The added bonus of a solid cast of Tarantino regulars and aging cult stars really gives the adventure a shot in the arm too had this been cast with any standard Hollywood stars it may not have been as appealing. I mean lets face it this film introduced us to Hayek Trejo and to a degree Marin for some folk...loved how he plays multiple characters and pulls it off!A true popcorn flick harking back to the good old days of 80's splatter comedy horror. What's more it makes you wanna see more of the Gecko Brothers with a prequel and easily a sequel following Seth. I won't deny the first half of the film felt vicious and a tad unpleasant could almost say a fail for what they were clearly going for but what horroraction fan can say they didn't get a solid kick out of the biker mayhem that followed. Easily my fave film involving and starring Tarantino I just loved how they did his vampire makeup too did you notice how his skull had a massive chin?7.510".

There's no surprise element with the film you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging B horror movie gore fest.The plot for what's it's worth sees two criminal brothers Seth George Clooney  Richie Gecko Tarantino on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal for others hiccups the brothers in need of a vehicle kidnap faithless minister Jacob Harvey Keitel his daughter Kate Juliette Lewis and adopted son Scott Ernest Liu . From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico a bar called the Titty Twister where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is is that the Titty Twister isn't no ordinary bar it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko'sand there newly acquired captives are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour? Swearing blood limbs severed nudity violence sexual references guns more violence more blood other weapons lots of teeth bats a snake more violence. On it goes really yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that From Dusk Till Dawn is a dam funny film as well something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means but failure to understand is genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie. Thrice. It's bonkers and silly as hell but once a fan of From Dusk Till Dawn you are a fan for life.

Her mother June Bailey Rosario Dawson is an addict and prostitute is verbally and physically abusive and is grooming her daughter to follow in her footsteps. Apple knows the streets alleys and motels like the back of her hand but wants more from her life. She possesses a tenacious tough indomitable spirit and will not surrender to fate. Apple runs away from her mother and tracks down her father whom she has never known as he was only 19 when he got Apple's mother pregnant. Apple begs her now Wall Street Broker father Tom Fitzpatrick Brendan Fraser to take her in. In the few days under her father's care she learns she's become pregnant by a kid from the streets she met on the train who now wants nothing to do with her. She is forced to leave her father's home because of her choice to give birth to the baby she is carrying. Apple runs away again and is eventually taken under the wing of Father ...";

It was a heart wrenching storyline which delivered by these amazing and strong actors just empowered me I guess. I was really looking forward to watching this as I thought the story line was unique and not clich and unlike anything I've watched before. Also the fact that it was based in a true story just interested me all the more to watch it and I can honestly say that I was not disappointed! I would highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch it! It's a brilliant story with a brilliant cast but Vanessa easily outshines the rest of the cast this is her film.".

After she finds him things don't go as planned. Neither him or his wife think Apple should have the baby so they bring her to a clinic. Knowing that isn't what she wants Apple runs from there and winds up homeless living on the streets and out of garbage until she is taken to a shelter for young pregnant women. Finding that place changes her entire life. After watching the trailer for this I thought I was prepared for how heavy the movie was gonna be. I wasn't. The movie is hard to watch in some parts and knowing that this is based on a true story makes it that much more powerful. The best part and the reason to watch though is Vanessa Hudgens. She so inhabits this character that you forget it's her. She is in a movie with Rosario Dawson Brendan Fraser and James Earl Jones and they all struggle to keep up with her. The movie does have the feel of Precious and movies like that so it's not one you can watch over and over but it should be viewed at least once if for no other reason then to see Vanessa Hudgens' performance. Overall a good and powerful movie with a career making performance by Vanessa Hudgens. I give this a B.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is quite believable and Hudgens does a great job having actually lived in a real shelter prior to playing the part. I think she gained a great deal of understanding doing that and it shows in her part. There are some folks reviewing the movie here who referred to her going through Clinton's Village subsidized programs which misses the point of Clinton's Village. Her theory was not based on subsidized govt programs rather the need for community and all of us to take an interest in helping our neighbors our schools and to be aware of the folks around us who are either lost or having a tough time. I found that review a slap in the face of the movie and hate to see how you preach in your church as a pastor. Another review mentioned that women and girls should see this. EVERYONE not least of all MEN should watch this movie. This Wallstreet dad might have behaved differently had he known what his daughter went through until she sought out a better life by finding him. Who knows? Sorry for the rants but needed to call folks out on some attitudes. perhaps the mother would not have turned to prostitution to survive. Many prostitutes are so desperate to support their kids and it is the only thing they feel they can make it on because of a lack of Village help and support of two parents. Then they turn to drugs in order to tolerate the abuse and exploitation of prostitution. It is a vicious cycle and one that mostly affects teen moms and kids with low selfesteem. The system does not sufficiently push dad's role and if more men saw this movie perhaps they would think twice about abandoning the needs of their children whether planned or unplanned. I find the sexist attitude of folks so absurd. Take responsibility and stop giving the dads a pass!".

She proves that she has completely left her amateur puppy Disney HSM acting and moved on to bigger future roles that will certainly give her a lot of career options maybe an Oscar too. And why not? In Gimme Shelter Vanessa Hudgens as an actress portrays all the emotions and characteristics that the Academy of Arts want to see. I wont be surprised if I see Hudgens taking at least a nomination for her stunning breath taking performance. Gimme shelter in general is an indie film that captures all the phases of a difficult life in the streets of a city. Maybe a little bit of 8 Mile or Precious Gimme shelter reminds a bit of these films but the motion picture still keeps its originality of story and of course performances.".

The movie grabbed me within the first ten minuets never leaving me with a dull moment. I would like to see more true stories like this and I am looking forward to Vanessa's next film.";

The subject matter may sound less than interesting but it was done excellently morally inspiring and has a happy ending to this true story about a girl who was or wasn't raised by a druggie mother and Clinton's village of government subsidized foster homes. The acting was superb. The story starts out with the cynical toughgirl jaded pregnant 16 year old runaway finding her biological father and eventually leads to a happy ending inspiring the audience to be morally upright. Women in the audience cried. Go yourself and take your loved ones. And as a pastor I do recommend this to children 6 years old and up as a great teaching opportunity for parents. I also recommend Gimme Shelter for churches political groups and action groups.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tired of her life of abuse and constant foster care Agnes Vanessa Hudgens sets out to find a new place to call home. But she soon comes to realize that home is the place where you least expect to find it.Gimme Shelter is a powerfully emotional film that chronicles the life of a young girl who just wants to find a place where she belongs in the world. We watch as Agnes encounters people from her dark past to people in her present who may just lead her on the path to salvation. Some of the situations are dark and heartbreaking but the moments when Agnes finds and feels the love she's been looking for will move you to tears. While many may compare it to the film Precious Gimme Shelter is based on a true story. The film moves at a quickpace but not too quick to where you don't find yourself emotionally evolved in the story and the characters.While many remember her for role in High School Musical or even most recently for her devilishly trashy performance in Spring Breakers Vanessa Hudgens gives the performance of her career. It's powerful heartbreaking and moving at the same time. Hudgens gets so lost in her role. We really believe her as this lost and broken girl who yearns to be loved. For anyone who doubts that Hudgens can't act which honestly I thought this at first once you see this film you can see the great potential Hudgens inhabits. Very few young actresses could have pulled this role off but Hudgens nails it through and through and carries the film on her own. In very much supporting roles are Rosario Dawson who gives a dark and pure evil performance as Agnes' drug addicted and abusive mother whom she tries to escape. Dawson really delivers in this role and every time she's on screen you're digested and you absolutely HATE her. Brenden Fraser stars as Agnes' biological and wealthy father. When we first meet his character Fraser comes off as very bland in the role but during the course of the film he eases into it more and gives a decent enough performance.Gimme Shelter is a deep and emotional film that will touch you and leave you in tears and full of hope. All of this definitely wouldn't have been possible without the powerhouse performance given by Vanessa Hudgens.My Rating 1010".

The girl and her mother although finding themselves in the same situation both handle it very differently. The story focuses on the girl but it is clear her mother handled it very differently and appears not to care for the girl simply the money she would gain from the baby and her daughter living with her. Selfishness is not apparent in the young girl although trust is clearly an issue. The film also highlights the value of friendship and sisterly bond. This is highlighted by the fact the girls father who at first seems to be torn between his two lives that of a precollege mistake with a young woman who we get to know by the fathers reaction to her later on in the movie was similar to her daughter at one stage with regards to her being very contumacious and having a factious attitude towards everyone. But it is clear the daughter having seen the results of her mothers mistakes strives to change this and does not want this for her daughter. The father was very young and his parents wanted him to go to college although it is clear he was sad about not being even able to hold his daughter again due to the mother being stubborn and the pressure to succeed from his parents. We see his reaction to the mother as almost hesitant and has to ask her mother if it is her from his reaction we see her mother was clearly very beautiful and very different. The movie finishes on a good note. Although her father has bought everything for the child despite wanting her to abort the child at an earlier stage. He appears to be concerned for her even his wife who in one part of the movie left her in the hospital after the scan then lied. about it. It is realised early on that the father regrets not being there for her but at the time he didn't full understand he mentions not even being able to hold her.Despite being offered shelter at her fathers house in the newly built house on the grounds she has him stop the car and explains that she felt she had a family at the shelter with all the other pregnant girls. She heads back on foot and is greeted with open arms she tells her father she needs more time and that she will be a daughter for him someday. She clearly feels she has the support at the shelter although in real life the shelter would have most like wanted her to leave once her father had claimed her. One thing that may have been incorrect was the fact that it was acceptable that she should go back with her mother and that the shelter cannot keep her there until her mother signs. What is strange is the father clearly wanted to help and be a part of her life why did the shelter not say they needed the bed for another needy mother due to the fact the father has more than the financial means to help her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Ronald Krausse Gimme Shelter proves that good intentions and earnestness alone can't guarantee the quality of a film.The screenplay is based on the true story of a 16yearold girl who goes by the name Apple the talented Vanessa Hudgens whose life could easily have served as the basis for a Dickens novel had it been set a century andahalf in the past. Born to an abusive drugaddicted single mother an ugliedup Rosario Dawson who wants her daughter around only for the welfare checks she brings in Apple has been kicked around from one foster home to the next when she isn't trying to reconnect with her uberrich biological father Brendan Fraser or living on the streets that is.Krausse sure pours on the pathos and the suffering but the movie as a whole isn't as compelling as it should be partly because while there is a certain grittiness in the look and feel of the picture the episodic nature of the tale doesn't allow for any real development of the secondary characters leaving them stereotypical and flat. They simply remain offscreen for too long a time to register much of an impact on the audience. Apple's absurdly callous stepmother Stephanie Szostak and a kindly priest James Earl Jones who offers the hand of friendship to Apple in her time of greatest need feel particularly twodimensional and underdeveloped. Moreover the dialogue frequently undercuts the naturalism of the piece by having the characters spell out in words rather than through indirection and action what it is we're supposed to be taking away with us from the movie. All those who made Gimme Shelter definitely had their hearts in the right place but I think this is one of those instances where a little less fidelity to the actual story and a little more focus might have resulted in a more effective drama.".

I'd give it 0 stars if I could but I can't so I guess 1 will suffice. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I really don't see how it got so many good reviews on here.

	schema:reviewBody "Gimme Shelter is a clunkilymade bat crazy parable that hammers you over the head with its Christian antiabortion message. An afterschool special blown up on the big screen it stridently aims to inspire you. More likely it'll make you cringe. Vanessa Hudgens does deserve credit though for further shedding her Disney Channel packaging. Following increasingly daring roles in films including Sucker Punch and Spring Breakers Hudgens continues to bludgeon her goodgirl image. Here she plays an abused pregnant teen who runs away from her volatile drugaddicted mother a feral Rosario Dawson. Covered in tats piercings and 15 pounds of extra body weight with shorn locks and smudges of dark eyeliner Hudgens is unrecognizable. Just look at the picture up there If you didn't know that was the adorably perky star of the High School Musical movies who would you think it was? It's hard not to admire the intention the dedication the almost animalistic demeanor she's achieved. But then she opens her mouth and her stiff line readings of awkward dialog make it impossible to become emotionally engaged by her character's journey. Clearly writerdirector Ronald Krauss means well too. He spent a great deal of time with reallife pregnant teens in hopes of infusing his film with a feeling of authenticity. But the total lack of artistry nuance and sometimes even basic competence is so distracting as to be destructive. He's also preaching to the choir  sometimes literally given the crucial role the church has in his film. Gimme Shelter finds no room for debate it reaffirms what like minded viewers already believe about a divisive and emotional topic. In that regard it actually does a disservice to young women who might find themselves in the same difficult state. At the film's start Hudgens' Agnes Bailey  who prefers to be called Apple  dares to flee the clutches of her junkie welfareleeching mom to find the biological father she never knew. Turns out that the man who fathered her in a youthful fit of unprotected sex Tom Fitzpatrick Brendan Fraser is now a wealthy Wall Street financier living in a McMansion in leafy New Jersey. His prim thin wife Stephanie Szostak and their two perfect children are appalled at the sight of her gruff and grimy appearance. But soon it become obvious that Apple is pregnant although the identity of the father and the circumstances surrounding her conception are strangely irrelevant here. While the uptight stepmom makes the logical suggestion that perhaps Apple is not prepared to become a mother under these circumstances at age 16 Apple has made up her mind  she's keeping her baby  likely out of an innate sense of rebellion rather than any maternal instinct. Tom and his wife are depicted as moneyed distant and soulless for arranging an appointment for her at a local clinic no one actually says the word abortion by the way but it doesn't matter. Once again Apple dashes back out onto the streets alone. Eventually she ends up crossing paths with a kindly but firm priest played by James Earl Jones. When James Earl Jones tells you to go to church you go to church. When James Earl Jones tells you to pray you pray. And when he arranges a bed for you a nearby shelter for pregnant teens that's clearly where you must go. While Apple is at the core of Gimme Shelter the fundamental story is about Kathy DiFiore the reallife shelter founder who was once homeless herself. She's played by Ann Dowd who gave such a startling performance as a fastfood manager in Compliance. Now THERE'S a film that sparks debate. Apple's interactions with the other young mothers at DiFiore's home  which is cluttered with photographs of Ronald Reagan and Mother Teresa and posters of inspirational religious messages  feel uncomfortably forced. Her eventual softening into a proper young lady  complete with flowered sundresses cardigan sweaters and clean pretty air  comes out of nowhere. And the stunning 180degree turn on the part of key characters that's not really a spoiler now is it? is thoroughly unconvincing. The emotional catharsis the film strives for is unearned rendering its ultimate uplift not just hollow but laughable.".

So you see the cheater with a wife with cancer a few names of political figures in USA come to mind the gay who tries to fight his gayness the mother who does not love the daughter the man who still mourns his loss and does not pay attention to what he has the son who wants to please the distant father and so on. In a way a very sad gutwrenching movie. Now in this humanheart exploration the director I think threw in also the visual difference between a gray Copenhagen and a very colorful beautiful Sorrento this might be the way to suggest the difference between reality and want we WANT to believe. The only predictable part of the movie is the ending ... and may be even this it's Mrs Bier's way to tell us that in spite of all the terrible things we saw there is always hope for all of us! I enjoyed very much this great movie. The only thing I did not like is the Englis translated title. The original title The Bald Hairdresser is much better in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Arrow Films presents a Danish feature directed by Susanne Bier that brings together Trine Dyrholm and Pierce Brosnan as Ida a woman battling with a cheating husband and the aftermath of chemotherapy and widower Philip protagonists in a romance that begins as they meet at their children's wedding.The encounter takes place in Sorrento Italy where Brosnan's character met his first wife who died several years before. The beauty and warmth of the setting naturally inspires a feeling of romance but it all has a slight Mamma Mia air to it  minus the singing.That aside Bier instills a tenderness in Ida whose struggle with cancer functions as a sub plot the focus being on her beauty and delicate intelligent nature. Dyrholm is astonishing to look at on screen and the grace that she brings to Ida is moving. Brosnan's Philip begins as a wounded uptight businessman recognisable from previous films like Remember Me but he gently and gradually weaves a vulnerability that proves his fine technique as an actor.There are some glorious moments for Philip's desperate sisterinlaw Benedikte Paprika Steen as she is batted away in her attempts to woo Philip. Ida's husband Leif Kim Bodnia brings his new woman Tilde Christiane SchaumburgMuller to the wedding unannounced with both characters lending a comic naivety to the film. The reaction from Ida's children is a dream particularly Kenneth Micky Skeel Hansen with his biting tongue and later brilliantly wellplaced left hook.The focus of Love Is All You Need is of course on love in a romcom that is naturally charming and relatable. It doesn't sicken and the story is plausible and raw. It explores sexuality sensuality and the nature of love in a way that is considerate and inquisitive. Susanne Bier has a clear vision with her directorial story admitting that she is very romantic herself but insisting you can't be heavy handed in a romcom  and this very human clarity works in the film's favour.Emotionally engaging and a relatively easy watch Love Is All You Need is subtitled but not noticeably with fluid scenes in English interjected throughout our leading man understands Danish but never speaks it. It's gorgeously shot and a very open appreciative film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2012. Usually I've little interest in feelgood movies and particularly not when wedding festivities are an integral element. But the synopsis in the filmfestival brochure had that little something that made me book tickets and I'm not disappointed. That does not mean that important questions of life and death are discussed but rather that it proves solid entertainment for the whole duration nearly 2 hours no more no less. You will forget about the movie later on to remember only that it was pleasant and amusing throughout.The story line develops steadily and all important characters get time to be introduced to the audience. In other words we really get the chance to know them. These introductions are spread evenly and luckily not condensed in the first quarter.Center of the proceedings is hairdresser Ida who just returned from hospital after a cancer treatment. She is wearing a wig as a result hence the original title The bald hairdresser possibly for commercial reasons translated to Love is all you need. Still not certain about the ultimate success of the cancer treatment she returns home. There she finds her husband Leif with the much younger Tilde from accounting doing it on the couch. Ida does not take it lightly and a divorce seems imminent.As her daughter Astrid will be getting married in Italy within a few days she travels alone to the airport. In her nerves to park the car in order to catch her flight she collides with the car of a business man in vegetables Philip. He happens to be the father of the groom Patrick and on his way to the same marriage. This coincidence seems a bit of a stretch as well as statistically impossible. Luckily it is the only thing in this film that I consider far fetched. Combining that encounter with the fact we learn that later on that he is a widower allows us to predict the main story line from that moment on. However... It does not happen that way at least not exactly.Apart from the developments around the relationship between Ida and Philip there are ample opportunities for subplots and new characters to be introduced along the line. All this gets gradually interwoven in the story without giving us a feeling that the film makers are overdoing it. The time that the film takes much more than the average 90 minutes offers sufficient room for parallel story lines to develop and come to a sometimes happy sometimes not so happy conclusion. The script mixes all these many ingredients in an ingenious way and stays believable from start to finish aforementioned car accident being the only exception.I don't think it makes any sense to delve deeper in the scenario. Which is next to impossible anyway without revealing how the story develops and without introducing spoilers in the text. That would take away much of the surprise a definite nono since surprises are the main ingredients out of which this film is made.Apart from superb casting and acting that we are allowed to witness the story line better story lines suffice to keep the viewer interested all the time in what will happen next. I could not spot any dull moments in other words fully qualified entertainment for the whole family. Expecting no more than what the label says I scored it deservedly with a maximum 5 for the audience award when leaving the theater.".

Emotionally constricted from the start his defensiveness and wariness gradually ease to reveal a man of real depth and warmth.The photography in this film is gorgeous but there again it's only important as the backdrop to the characters' personal development.

	schema:reviewBody "Surprisingly this movie expelled all my expectations. It was a simply good movie with nice characters and places not an awesomeawesome one though. So diverse romancedrama told in the perspective of the elder people's beginning of a new relationship. It is a predictable plot so there's no surprise twists at all. From the director of 'In a Better World' this movie narrates the story of a widower and a hairdresser whose husband is cheating on her. A widower businessman in his 50s probably is preparing to attend his son's wedding in abroad. In other side of the story a woman who successfully completed her cancer treatment as well getting ready to attend her daughter's wedding in Italy. In an accident these two meet at the airport. With a little discomfortable at beginning they start to like each other. For the sake of children these two must sacrifice what they have found within them. So the lives goes on as it forced them to move along with it.Extraordinary performances by Pierce Brosnan and a woman on his counterpart character called Ida was awesome. I can't finish this review without mentioning the bride she looked so pretty. Sadly it was not her story. The seaside locations in Italy were beautiful played a crucial role in the movie's pleasant presentation. They shot it at the right season I guess because it was alluring. Everyone might not enjoy the movie because it deals about older people's romance and I am not old but I liked it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Surprisingly this movie expelled all my expectations. It was a simply good movie with nice characters and places not an awesomeawesome one though. So diverse romancedrama told in the perspective of the elder people's beginning of a new relationship. It is a predictable plot so there's no surprise twists at all. From the director of 'In a Better World' this movie narrates the story of a widower and a hairdresser whose husband is cheating on her. A widower businessman in his 50s probably is preparing to attend his son's wedding in abroad. In other side of the story a woman who successfully completed her cancer treatment as well getting ready to attend her daughter's wedding in Italy. In an accident these two meet at the airport. With a little discomfortable at beginning they start to like each other. For the sake of children these two must sacrifice what they have found within them. So the lives goes on as it forced them to move along with it.Extraordinary performances by Pierce Brosnan and a woman on his counterpart character called Ida was awesome. I can't finish this review without mentioning the bride she looked so pretty. Sadly it was not her story. The seaside locations in Italy were beautiful played a crucial role in the movie's pleasant presentation. They shot it at the right season I guess because it was alluring. Everyone might not enjoy the movie because it deals about older people's romance and I am not old but I liked it.";

	schema:reviewBody "After a whirlwind romance Astrid and Patrick are getting married in Patrick's old family villa in Italy which has remained fairly deserted after his mother died when he was small. Astrid's mother Ida Trina Dyrholm is hopefully in remission from breast cancer following a mastectomy when she walks in on husband Lief doing the horizontal mambo with bookkeeper Thilde she travels from Denmark to Italy without him having literally bumped into Patrick's father Philip Pierce Brosnan at the airport. Businessman Philip is an unhappy man having never resolved the anger he still feels at his wife's pointless accidental death. Among the other guests are Lief who has travelled the following day and insensitively brought Thilde and Philip's late wife's sister Benedikte a woman capable of staggeringly crass and damaging comments made with complete obliviousness to their effects. And Patrick has some issues which need to be resolved before the wedding can take place.Director Susanne Bier marshals her various plot threads and except for Brosnan Danish cast well as this gentle drama unfolds. There is nothing earthshattering here just real life shown to us with compassion and humour. In Lief Thilde and Benedikte there are three wonderfully funny monsters yet they too are human we squirm at what they do but we believe it at the same time and understand that what we are seeing is selfishness not malice.All the performances are good but Brosnan being gently unwound from his anger is better than he has been for a long time and Trina Dyrholm's Ida is both delightful and powerfully moving in an understated performance which shows both range and courage.The audience for this film which features a mixture of English and subtitled Danish dialogue about half and half was mostly what one might call women of a certain age who were there I suspect for Mr Brosnan whose hair colouring varies  maybe he hit the Grecian 2000 before the trip to Italy. As they filtered into the row behind me and the chicken house cackling overpowered the ads and trailers I felt ominous forebodings. Fortunately they were silent throughout the movie they enjoyed it very much and so did I.".

The character Brosnan plays is an unavailable father whose son turns out to be gay and not wanting marriage in the end. Her husband is also a loser who cheats and yet wants her back in the end just for his convenience.There are a few annoying characters such as the frivolous actress portraying Benedicta a former sister in law who continues to pursue Brosnan who lost his wife and has been a widower.It is not a straight comedy there are some very good scenes such as mother and daughter talking about marriage how things don't always work out and generally how life can throw us curve balls when we least expect it.The end is positive and hopeful and while I am not a fan I thought Pierce Brosnan was very good in this type role and had some depth we don't normally see.

When he first meets the bride's mother they instantly loathe each other but the magic of Sorrento changes all that.I love this movie! It is bilingual DanishEnglish and everyone except Brosnan switches between the two often during a single conversation. Even the credits switch languages. The subtitles are fine though and Danish is a beautiful language.Brosnan and costar Trine Dyrholm are wonderful together playing heartbroken middleagers who still want to be loved. There is a strong supporting Danish cast with welldeveloped characters and interesting story lines for all of them.The story is more romance than comedy with lots of people falling in and out of love. It's heartwarming and engrossing and the Sorrento location is incredibly picturesque. Highly recommended.".

Every good danish actor is misused the plot is so terrible that a new word should be invented to describe it.

As far as I'm concerned cinema in Denmark is best represented by Festen or Mifune aka Dogma. Every film Danish directors have made outside Denmark with American or English actors thinking of Thomas Vinterberg's It's all about love  a complete disaster... has been a complete washout. Please keep on making good films without feeling the pressure to do something else just because people have started to get interested.

One implausible incident piles upon another until the viewer has completely lost interest. The characters of Leif and Bennedikte ? are so unrealistic that they are downright ridiculous. Leif is a dufus who is so heartless and stupid that he brings his young armcandy lover to his daughter's wedding mere days after he's caught sleeping with her by his cancerstricken wife Ida. And Bennedikte the groom's aunt is a meanspirited cruel mother who publicly berates her daughter for obesity and goes so far as to try to teach the daughter to induce herself to vomit so she can lose weight.While the movie is lacking in plot and script it is not lacking in immoralityan attempt perhaps to garner viewers who might be titillated by nudity and gay lovers making out.The only reasons I give this movie a '3' instead of a '1' are because the message is a positive one and I thought the ending was nicely done. Also I believe Pierce Brosnan's wife died of cancer not long ago so this was perhaps a subject that held special meaning for him.".

	schema:reviewBody "My girlfriend talked me into seeing this... he he. Well I'm not much into Susanne Bier's movies but I think Hvnen and Brdre are pretty decent after all. So is this one. It's the typical complicated narrative which is Susanne Bier's trademark and it is not always that successful in my opinion. But where as Hvnen was quite far stretched at times this one is actually a lot better. It's hard to understand the very naive traits of the main character Ida Dyrholm as the script doesn't really let us get to know very much about her relationship with her husband and kids before she got the illness. The husband LeifBodnia is in my opinion a character way too exaggerated to be very interesting. Dyrholms performance is pretty good even though the script for the character is a bit thin. If you like what she has done previously just by her sheer looks see this one! The aunt Benedikte however a devilish snob Paprika Steen is really well played with much enthusiasm indeed. She is the black humour of the film and it's kind of ironic that her relationship with her own daughter is far far more intriguing than the relationships between any of the other parents and kids. The film is made in the bay of Naples and if I'm not mistaking many of the panoramas are of the town of Sorrento. this really does portray a very stereotypical romanticized Italy setting which would be worthy of a Hollywood movie. There are many things to be said about this area well worthy of many films but this is not the errand of this one. I think however much exaggerated and romanticized the setting of a wealthy upper class environment in the bay of Naples does works well. Especially bearing in mind that the issue of materialism IS touched upon and debated in the film. For a film depicting the conditions and horrors of southern Italy I recommend Gomorra by Matteo Garrone. A very good film! It is very obvious that much of the script writing was done to fit Pierce Brosnan's part. If he hadn't been in it none of the dialogue would have had to be in English. So why is he in it? Well this could have been such a disaster! But luckily it's not  and as much as his part may BE just because of the intention of making this a box office film an international film I actually think his role is pretty well written for him. It might not be a world class super performance worthy of an Oscar but the scenes where the sub characters speak danish to him actually do make a story of their own. It makes his appearance seem pretty natural. Philip Brosnan has had a Danish wife he has worked in Denmark for over 20 years. He understands what is said the others know that!  But he doesn't speak it unless the really has to. This makes for building the character of the reserved Englishman I believe and in terms of film narrative I think this is quite an achievement really. Brosnan IS actually very very smooth and the lingual reserve gives him the edge he needs to play the part. This way he is not ONLY in the film because all the girls liked him in Mama Mia. That being said making his appearance seem natural might have taken a lot of effort. So much so that other aspect have been played down to a degree where we might have a hard time getting under his skin and really understanding his relationship to the son Patrick and his mom who died. All in all Den skaldede frisr is a decent film. It has issues but also potential. I'd give it 6.5.".

I would recommend it to anyone in the mood to engage in a thoughtprovoking narrative about the human condition.I have to admit that when I first saw this film I did not expect it to be what it is. The basic premise involves a haunted website so when I sat down to view it I was expecting something at the same level of terrible as fear.com instead I was shocked to find a truly provocative story full of surrealism and drama that examines the concept of isolation and the deep fear that all people have of loneliness.This of course means that the fear that Kairo invokes is not typical of the horror movie genreat least not the North American horror movie genre I can't speak for the Japanesebecause it isn't really scary. It's disturbing and eerie and frankly I wouldn't watch it alone in the dark but I'll admit that I'm a bit of a coward The Grudge still terrifies me so make of that what you will. If you go into this movie wanting to see people being hacked apart or if you want to be jumping out of your seat every few minutes by fakeout scares you will probably be pretty angry by the time this one's over. Seriouslyyou'll probably be more freaked out by the original version of Dark Water and that's saying something.However I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. This film provides a very moving portrayal of people's inability to truly connect with one another. It offers a bleak examination of human nature without being heavyhanded or pretentious it doesn't come off as condescending and the creators obviously aren't trying to be snobbish or intellectual. It simply asks the question can we ever truly connect with one another or are we doomed to be alone by our very natures?".

	schema:reviewBody "I fully anticipate some hate in my direction as some people have really taken to this film but I have to say that it has just never done anything for me. I first watched it a couple of years ago and I had to force myself to finish it for the sake of finishing it but I was overwhelmingly bored. I returned to it again this afternoon with a little bit of an older head on my shoulders  and I feel I can sort of offer a little more than 'boredom' as a comment.I think you have to start off be coming to this film with the right preconceptions or at least not the wrong ones. It doesn't fit the same 'type' of JFilm as the Grudge or Ring there are deaths but it's not some vengeful sheghost hunting you for eternity this film tries to utilise a different sort of 'horror' on a more emotional or psychological level by focusing on very everyday human fears such as death the afterlife and loneliness.It's interesting to see how although much of the technology in the film is now very dated some of the comments on it  such as those about how the internet doesn't really connect people  are still quite valid. But one of the problems I came to realise that I had with the film is that its message of an isolated world with people ultimately being unable to face existing alone any more felt too forced. It was alluded to or actually stated by the characters quite repeatedly it was unmistakable what they were trying to 'say' and the more they said it the more depressed I felt.I wasn't scared by the thought I wasn't horrified or disturbed I just felt a bit blue. Watching the world become less and less populated just felt a little too unbelievable I felt I was watching a film taking place in some kind of parallel Earth I felt distanced from it and that distance just sort of numbed the impact.One of the things I did like were the two separate stories playing alongside each other and the meeting up but I felt that the male student's story was far more engaging than the coworkers they never seemed to progress in the story they just kept dropping out one by one until the requisite one was left behind.I also have to agree that some of the film is beautifully shot but to balance it there are also lots of grey scenes some of which are quite hard to see intended I think to add to the isolated cold world but it's not really enough to break up the film or to keep it visually exciting. You can only sit and watch people having conversations or wandering around unhappily for so long. The use of music is very good actually lifting up some scenes and making them quite memorable I'm thinking of the jumping woman for those who have seen it. But there seem to be quite long periods without it or where it isn't used to contribute at all.I'm not saying that this is a horrible film but I'm trying to balance out that it won't suit some people. Rent it first if possible this isn't the kind of JHorror film can we call it horror? that all films seem to be marketed as at the moment it really might work for you but it just didn't have the effect on me that it seems to have done on others here.".

What's odd is that one place it is weak in is the plot  it does somewhat tie it all up and make sense but my main point is it doesnt really matter  the director set out to make a scary ghost story and that it is! I see horror films from all over the world so I am pretty jaded when it comes to something scaring me but this film has many sequences that truly are frightening and disturbing. Some of the images have stayed with me for weeks. The lighting the art direction and the use of muted colors aside from reds used effectivelyall make up for a creepy eerie visual. I have to laugh at the arrogance of some of the comments on this and other horror films that claim since it didnt scare them the film is NOT SCARY. That is b.s. What scares one person may not scare another. You can say the piece didn't scare you but to make such a sweeping statement is vain. I personally didn't like any of the Friday of 13th movies but obviously those films work on some level for millions of people. This film is so nonAmerican in it's pace and core that that is what might turn off some viewers but that's what I loved about it. The director just sets up the camera and keeps it on a space and then has things slowly emerge from the sides  he has you start to look and scope and wonder if you are REALLY seeing something as opposed to the lazy bloated SHOCK moment of most US horror films. There are moments when people are confronted by visionsimages of ghosts that move and terrorize just like real dreams  slow movements awkward movements as the ghost approaches you. Terrifying. The film definitely doesn't know how to wrap it all up but in many ways I found this film even scarier than the original RING. Well made ghost story. Seek it out fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kario Pulse is unlike any Japanese horror I have seen. As much as I love the JuOn series the scares come from creepy ghosts that popup from unseen places. They are good movies but those scares wear off after awhile. However in Kairo the ghosts don't pop up suddenly and they aren't accompanied by loud music. They are just there and boy are they creepy. Sometimes they do nothing they just stand there staring. It creates a feeling of unease and constantly keeps the viewer on edge.It's not just the ghosts that are unique the story is incredibly interesting and intelligent. But it is not linear logical and it doesn't explain everything it doesn't have to though. It really leaves it up to us what to decide. This is what is so good about this movie it's much unlike most horror films. Forget all the recent American horror films although some are excellent they really aren't like this. This film is almost like a dream in some ways. It goes at a very slow pace clocking in just under 2 hours and there aren't a lot of scares. At times the story may seem illogical but I beg to differ.Kairo is really an apocalyptic horror much like the 2002 British horror film 28 Days Later just replace zombies with ghosts. Also like 28 Days Later this film carries a very profound social message but unlike 28 Days Later this one is about loneliness and how people become distant through the use of technology. There's also a heavy emphasis on the evils of suicide.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has created an intelligent unique horror film that doesn't quite get the attention it deserves. If your willing to experience movie that will leave your unsettled and weired out afterwards look no further than Kairo.45".

This film is almost like a dream in some ways. It goes at a very slow pace clocking in just under 2 hours and there aren't a lot of scares. At times the story may seem illogical but I beg to differ.Kairo is really an apocalyptic horror much like the 2002 British horror film 28 Days Later just replace zombies with ghosts. Also like 28 Days Later this film carries a very profound social message but unlike 28 Days Later this one is about loneliness and how people become distant through the use of technology. There's also a heavy emphasis on the evils of suicide.Kiyoshi Kurosawa has created an intelligent unique horror film that doesn't quite get the attention it deserves. If your willing to experience movie that will leave your unsettled and weired out afterwards look no further than Kairo.45";

And that just puts a big grin on my face. Not to mention the lighting and cinematography in this film is also really well done and adds a lot to the completely creepy mood throughout. While the story may be hard to follow if you don't know the history behind the film beforehand it's scary either way. I've watched it twice now and it's just as good the second time around. Even though this film is considered an older Jhorror film it's still fresh in my book.I think horror film makers that rely on cheap thrills and gore should take Kairo for a spin they'd learn a lot from it. Kairo is a truly haunting scary film that will leave your eyes wide open in terror. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "My friend let me borrow this. With my friend being a major film buff and having a refined taste in films I was expecting something really good here. And me being a graduate from film school still making short films and Japanese horror films no less I've come to realize that the Japanese horror genre is something truly gritty dark and frightening. Films like Ring Juon and Audition are completely terrifying pieces of horror. This film however is not a part of that category.While billed as a horror film it really doesn't feel like horror. There really is no tension built up because the pacing is very dream like. Also in all horror films there is a clear evil plaguing the main characters. But throughout this movie I was left wondering what the ? is going on? Are these ghosts? Whats the motivation? Even after the explanation. In this movie the explanation is trying to be logical but if you think about it the logic of it is completely ludicrous. And more importantly it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't give connections to why this is happening with the computers and why these red tape rooms are being created. Now I don't know if this lack of coherency is a result of a bad translation of the subtitles but I can speak Japanese and could understand some of the original as well. It feels like certain things were left out. For example in the tagline used for the movie on this site it talks about a webcam that is used. There is never once a mention of a webcam in the movie nor did I see one.And that is the second problem. This film is so gritty and so dark that its really difficult to see things properly. that's my one complaint about Japanese films they are all so poorly lit I grew more frustrated than intrigued because things were not clear enough the make out.And lastly the characters and situations are not really plausible. The world this story takes place is overly contrived. Everyone is lonely and has no friends. I mean not one friend. That's not normal even for someone who is lonely. The way everyone reacts also isn't very believable. It feels like the film maker had something to say but in doing so created a place and characters which aren't totally believable.I have to say that this movie was completely baffling to me. But there was a very creepy and gritty atmosphere built up. But for this viewer it is not enough. A movie is supposed to be everything coming together to tell a visual story. Here the story is lost somewhere in the murk of the atmosphere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Righto another Japanese ghost story along the lines of The Ring and  The Grudge among others.  I hadn't heard of Kairo but picked it up off the shelf after reading  some glowing blurb on the DVD cover Stupid. Stupid! STUPID!!. What I  found was a depressing disjointed and generally confusing piece of low  rent film making in search of inspiration that never came.  The basic premise of Kairo is that there simply isn't enough room for  ghosts anymore so they must find other means to be heard and are  often forced into the environment of the living.  At least that is what I am going with this thing is as confusing as  fck.  When I say other means in this case it means ghosts have gone  hightech they are more internet savvy than most teens and aren't  averse to calling the odd mobile phone for a chat. Where the title  Pulse comes in I have no idea a more catchy title would have been  Ghost Hackers would've made more sense too.  Now a bunch of stuff happens in Kairo and I'm sure if you took the time  to watch it you might initially not notice that none of it makes sense  whatsoever.  It seems that from the early stages the ghosts seem to be targeting  the employees of a Japanese plant store as one by one they are bumped  off.  So this is a summary of the first hour  Taguchi is missing and he has the disk!  Shortly after Exit Taguchi.  Oh no not you too Yabe!  Exit Yabe.  The Boss too?  No more Boss. Yay sickies for everyone!  Now Junco!  It's like an Axemurderer slaughtering horny teens flick without the  benefit of TA gore and inventive kills. You might ask What time does  the next bus leave? to which I would reply What the hell type of  question is that?. You might then more rationally ask But is it  scary do they build tension? Well now that's a better question. The  answer? Not really aside from one scene that took forever also made no  sense and then finished up by being a wannabe The Grudge outtake not  something I would aspire to.  Sure there are the subliminal things that seem to come up a lot these  days   The reflection that can magically be enhanced and magnified from a  crappy resolution image on a PC screen.  The did I just see that?  rub the eyes nothing there wait now it's back thing.  The shadow  on the edge of the screen walking behind while a whoosh sound effect  is used to highlight the sheer scariness of it all.  The dimly lit  room that when better lit shows a motionless person standing behind  you.  The one scene that is effective occurs when one of our loyal Plantco  employees visits The Forbidden Room. Now you aren't supposed to visit  the Forbidden Room. Why? Because it's forbidden that's why. The scene  plays out like it should and while you wonder what is going on tension  does build. Taking away a little is some ludicrously cheesy and  offputting Oooooohhhhh music it's really bad.  There are many more scenes that are quite randomly edited together so  as to remove all continuity and not allow the tension to build. This  frequently took me out of the movie as I was always on my heels  wondering Why are we back with this guy when 5 seconds ago we seemed  to be right in the middle of the other girl doing something?  The Ring was a great remake of a Japanese horror flick The Grudge less  so but justified a look The Uninvited mainly sucked.  I know they have made a remake of Shutter but think that the original  was good enough on its own. I know they have made remakes of many other  Asian horror flicks and I haven't bothered looking most of them up.  In the case of Kairo I think the US filmmakers had a better than normal  chance of improving on the original because it just isn't much chop in  the first place and is all over the shop.  Final Rating  5.5  10. All sloppy editing and pursuing a concept that  isn't scary in the first place makes Kairo a dull movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbojumbo about the internet i.e. if you install a program on the computer you see dead folksmuch like if you play a videotape you'll die in RINGU. Frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. What I did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existencebeing totally alone for eternity. This was sobering and fascinating.I love Japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans. However one genre that has become popular in recent years that I just can't relate to very well are these horror films. I know they are super popularespecially since they seem to be remade so often in the States. I've seen both RINGU as well as THE RING JUON and THE GRUDGE and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. About the only recent horror film I really liked from Japan was SEANCEa reworking of the great British film SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what do I think made SEANCE different? Well unlike the other films as well as KAIRO gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audienceinstead the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are a lot like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13thwith scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best. For me I want storynot cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.With a relatively high rating I know I am in the minority but I just don't find this a very satisfying film. All too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightlybut the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking. Well I think it just tries too hard and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progressionnot scare tactics.".

Well unlike the other films as well as KAIRO gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audienceinstead the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are a lot like American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13thwith scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best. For me I want storynot cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.With a relatively high rating I know I am in the minority but I just don't find this a very satisfying film. All too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightlybut the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking. Well I think it just tries too hard and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progressionnot scare tactics.";

There used to be a time when I was captured by the hype and forced myself to believe slow Japanese movies simply have to be good. Anyone who does not like them simply does not get it. Yet lately I have come to understand that many of those movies really are just boring shallow and expressionless. Japanese movies are not great in general because of their nationality just like American or German films are not. I just recently saw Dark Water and Tomie and thought they were very dull. I did not really expect this to be very different. Luckily I was positively suprised. Right at the beginning I noticed how incredibly beautifully this film was shot. Towards the middle of it though it seemed to me as if this would be just another bad Japanese movie. It developed all the signs of that. E.g. charachters that are unnaturally introverted even for a Japanese that don't talk about the things that happen to them. You can't really connect to those charachters they don't have much of a charachter development. We've got a lot of atmosphere shots but nothing really happens. Just what I feared. This kind of movie is not arty or culturaly meaningful. Its just shallow. Yet as the film went on I noticed this one is different. It seems to criticize the japanese culture for this lack of communication. What I thought would be a bad charachteristic of it is actually the central point of it. It seems like the director consiously displayed the charachters the way I described before not because this is just another boring japanese movie but because he tries to criticize this charachteristic of the Japanese society. At some point in the movie it is being said that the ghosts attempt to capture the people in their eternal loneliness. This may be a very strong hint. In the end it seems like this movie does not merely inherit the same bad aspects of other movies but analyzes them and more so the society behind it. In the end it is being said that there seem to be people alive in Latin America. Guess why because they talk! They communicate talk about the ghosts and don't let themselves become lonely that easy. None of the Japanese charachters in this movie seem to have friends. The main charachter tells the girl with the car that he had one friend who he did not really know. He also said earlier that he maybe got an internet connection to meet people. I think this does all support my theory. What do you think?".

I went into this with mediocre expectations at the least and was completely let down. The plot summary seemed like a great idea and could have probably made a good movie.It started out well enough. It seemed as if it was gearing up for a creepy climax with the first suicide and the appearance of the ghost site on the internet. However this disjointed and holeriddled plot disgorged something far worse than terror  boredom and confusion. SPOILER WARNING It all starts with a forbidden room that everyone seems to somehow know about but doesn't exactly explain how some of the characters know about it or why. They just do. For plot's sake. The room like many other rooms throughout this movie is sealed in red always red tape. Apparently it's to keep the ghosts sealed in the room. Why? Well naturally you'd think it's because the ghosts want to kill the living but if you thought that you'd be wrong.No unfortunately the answer to the problem is something much dumber than poltergeist haunting. The ghosts basically make human beings suffer depression because of loneliness it never quite explains how this happens with couples or families since the focus is pretty much on the main characters and the rest of the world simply dies somehow and because they can't resist the depression they kill themselves andor get so depressed they turn into blackened stains on the wall or floor depending on how they died unable to move or escape their misery yet somehow able to call their friends and call for help although how they expect their friends to save them I have no idea... I guess they don't know either.So here we are with ghosts depressing people so badly that they turn into lonely little stains calling for help. This is pretty bad. And it only gets worse from there. There just isn't much logic or common sense present in this movie. The plot although it does tie the whole thing together in the end still has severe plot holes bad dialog that doesn't make sense to anyone but the writers and perhaps the depressed characters themselves and is being said because they are depressed so depressed they simply aren't thinking straight and pretty much no frightening scenes to speak of.The ghosts look like people you can see through and not even remotely scary or frightening people at that. They look like normal people. The reactions of the characters that see the ghosts range from absolute mindnumbing terror where they blatantly can't think straight to outright denial. The terror is the worst part because it simply looks like a normal person is standing over them while they freak out for no reason at all. It looks cheap and the ghosts simply aren't terrifying. What happens to the characters that all die simply doesn't evoke fear or horror at all. It lacks a lot.Go watch something better. You're not likely to really miss much here.".

I was expecting Kurosawa to say something interesting about psychological terror which he did masterfully in Cure. Instead Pulse is a notsosubtle indictment of the internet and how it makes young people feel alone and alienated. Not exactly a fresh idea. Plus the acting in this movie really sucks  the kids are pretty whiny and I didn't empathize with them at all. This movie needed a stronger actor like Koji Yakusho from Cure who only makes a cameo here. Hopefully Kurosawa's next movie will be an improvement.".

	schema:reviewBody "8 Mile probably isn't what you expect.  Given the cast and premise you probably expect one of two things either a silly excuse for selfaggrandizement or an overblown caricature of hiphop culture.  You don't get either.  What you get is a brave film that is surprisingly culturally and intellectually rigorous and an aggressive film that is so emotionally intense that it seems to sometimes tear itself apart.The plot is not a biography of Martial Mathers a.k.a. Eminem but it is very much informed and guided by the experiences of his early career as a rapper in bluecollar and nocollar Detroit.  Eminem gives a compelled powerful performance that diverges just enough from his public self to inject the story with a strong sense of realism without sacrificing anything artistically.  The supporting cast also makes fine use of their considerable talents carving the Detroit of this film out of the world itself not out of fiction.  Even as they help communicate a hard unforgiving time and place they also give rise to deep and profound sympathies that don't come around in every film.The naturalistic presentation doesn't stop there most of the film is shot on location in Detroit and the gritty sometimes almost frenzied design and cinematography firmly establish that this is not just another Hollywood movie.  This is a movie that goes places movies don't generally go where for good or for ill many people do live every day.  For one 8 Mile might have the most believable most powerful representation of an automobile factory of any film in the last twenty years and it still manages to use the location for sophisticated plot driving drama.  Good stuff.Of course the film has its flaws.  It's very heavy and bleak at times it skirts the boundary of cliche a little bit and the villains a rival rap group known as the Free World are a little over the top but time and again the solid acting and daunting camerawork keep coming back to seize the eye and command attention.Oh and in case you were wondering there is rapping and plenty of it. The rapping is really topquality cutting edge stuff for the most part and it is integrated into the script so well that it is always clear that the characters choose to rap not that the script forces them to do so.  The rapping happens because it must happen to these characters at this time not because Eminem is a rapper.  In an industry where pop music movies are a dime a dozen this is particularly impressive.  This film says something about rap and the human experience that hasn't been articulated this well many times before it bridges the gap between rap and poetry in a big way and makes that gap look a lot smaller.All in all the thing that really defines 8 Mile is how committed to this idea the cast and crew must have been in order to make this film.  Every minute and every second the cast's intensity never gives up and the camera never sleeps.  The film is detailed finely crafted and has a pounding heart the size of a boxcar.  If you don't mind the obscenity and violence and there is a bunch I'd definitely say this is a movie worth seeing.".

But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language.  Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.It's surprising  admirable really  how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit's problems with his mother Stephanie Smith  Kim Basinger.  Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can't help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor.  Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in L.A. Confidential' six years ago.  Rabbit's problems with girlfriends aren't significant though he has two of them an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection.  Rabbit's closest relationships are with his emcee pal Future' played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer and his slightly retarded token white homie Cheddar Bob Evan Jones.But his closest relationship of all is with himself as is clear from the first scene where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room looking in the mirror hearing his music in his head and this is fine because it's what a young man has to do  get on friendly working terms with who he is.  The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner and he walks off by himself in the final scene.  The comparison with Shakespeare's Henry IV isn't out of place.  The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves' character in My Own Private Idaho' but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn't a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant's movie. He is close to his mates and they're always touching hands and gently hugging each other.  The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing 8 Mile.'Eminem as shown in 8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained.  He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it   to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend.  It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.  Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.  His effect is of authenticity because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene but he is always there moving with the scene and in fact creating it.8 Mile' isn't just a vehicle for Eminem.  It's too well made a movie to be that.  But without Eminem 8 Mile' wouldn't exist.  The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them and then he enters them and wins them.  You have to wonder how the rapperactors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic.  There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families their early sponsors their first big breaks and so on many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away having shown that he can be a star.  The whole focus is on his personality and in particular his stillness.  The most important moments are those when RabbitEminem stands with mike in hand silent waiting for inspiration to strike.  Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back this moment is full of power.  In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence raw potential to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.".

The presence of her character is a key plot element that sets up the film but the appearance of her character in the film by its end seems unnecessary due to the fact that it is underdeveloped.

	schema:headline " A warm reception for Eminem fans everywhere";
	schema:reviewBody "8 Mile is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr. a.k.a. Rabbit a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through battles which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend Future Mekhi Phifer is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke has no place to live he's stuck in a deadend job at a steel mill and his girlfriend Janeane Taryn Manning has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother Kim Basinger is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex Brittany Murphy an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.8 Mile certainly is a moving and very touching drama.  Eminem proves here that he really can act and in fact may have a future in motion pictures. This does not mean we will be hearing him thanking his producer Paul Rosenberg next year at the Oscars but we can expect to him to receive a lot of praise for future movie roles.  It's quite obvious that some people will not like 8 Mile just because of Eminem's controversial history.  The film also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Eminem's hit single Lose Yourself really does have a lot emotion put into it.   Eminem since he burst onto the music scene in 1999 with his criticallyacclaimedlambasted album The Slim Shady LP he has been met with a lot of controversy as well as praise.  Despite the often humorous content of his songs there are many dark under tones in them as well.  In my opinion too much has been made about his lyrics most of which revolve around topics like homophobia murder and his failed relationship with his onoff wife Kim.  Despite all of this I think that people have overlooked the fact that he said the only thing that truly matters to him is his daughter Hailie Jade.  Also if people believed Eminem really was a homophobic do you still think he would have agreed to perform Stan with Elton John?  As a longtime fan of Eminem and his music I try not to let such criticisms get to me but sometimes you just have to say What the hell?  Are they really necessary?  I don't think so.  The problem is that people today are just too biased when it comes to people like Eminem.  He's not another Vanilla Ice and 8 Mile is not an attempt to cash in on his success like Cool As Ice was.  I have a list of grievances that people need to realize about EminemFirst of all do not disrespect this man.  I feel that many of the people who hate Eminem have never actually listened to one of his songs.  In my opinion they have only listened to small clips that have been played on some discussion about his controversial lyrics.  If you actually listened to some of his songs you'll realize that he is a very distraught young person with a lot to say.Don't watch 8 Mile with a predetermined mindset.  People who have already made up their minds about Eminem's talents are less likely to enjoy themselves much more than people who believe in him.  To nonbelievers if Eminem really did not have any talent like so many people seem to think now how is it that all of his records The Slim Shady LP The Marshall Mathers LP Devils Night with group D12 and The Eminem Show together have grossed more than 12 million?  I think that it is a clear sign of TRUE TALENT.Also do you believe had Eminem been black and rapping about such controversial subject matter that he would be famous like he is now?  No because most likely no one would dare even produce him.  That said I'm AfricanAmerican and I don't care that Eminem is white and is rapping about such things.I think that too many people have made his race too big of an issue. Eminem knows that he is white and will be nothing else.  He does not display to us a thuggish image that some people think that any rapper should have. Also he does not rap about the things that some people seem to think is destroying rap music.Eminem does have quite a future in store for him.  I'm sure that we can expect to be seeing a lot more of him later on.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't care for too many dramas but 8 mile was an excellent movie. Eminem was a better actor than I could have dreamed for him to be. He put on a great show and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was Bless the Child and that was a major let down.As for the plot don't go into the movie thinking that you're going to see the life of Eminem. This is not about Eminem's life. Eminem said it himself in an interview. Mekhi Phifer even said that he didn't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star but this isn't the case. This is just as any other movie but this is Eminem's acting debut. Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem's life ex. 8 Mile Road this is certainly NOT an autobiography. If you go into 8 mile expecting to see an action film with explosions and such then you're in for a let down. 8 Mile is an amazing story about a white wannabe rapper trying to make it in the underground world of rapping. There isn't much action in this at all because it is a DRAMA not an action. I hope you go see this movie if your in for a good story with some great characters!".

	schema:reviewBody "8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself at first I found him a little stoic but given the fact that this guy has never acted before regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before. Now for what I feel made this movie not rise to the top...  First off when Kim Basinger first came on the screen and opened her mouth I thought the rest of the film was going to be destined for failure.  Not only was she weak in the role she was grossly miscast.  There are so many actresses in that age range that I find it mind boggling that Basinger was used for something in which she stood out like a fish out of water.  The film also almost lost me in the beginning due to the length of the first scene in the bathroom when Eminem is psyching himself up.  The placement of the scene wasn't a problem but it went on way too long  I would have prepared an edited down version.  If you're watching Robert DeNiro for that long looking in a mirror yes it'll probably work but to put that type of pressure on a first timer with no training especially since it's shortly followed by Basinger's first scene was a risky move and one that I think they could have found a better choice for.  The other thing that kept this film from being a totally strong film for me was the screenplay itself.  I kept finding myself asking why the hell Scott Silver had some of these extraneous scenes in the story.  There was a good story to be told here and a whole world to be explored by the general public that doesn't know that much of it and the script and film could have and should have been a good 25 minutes shorter and tighter. Anyway still an intriguing film.  And interesting insight into a different side of life and I commend Eminem for taking the risk.  It's a lot to bite off and half the country is just dying for a chance to decimate him.  If for nothing else this film is worth the last 5 minutes.  When he was up there battling I actually started clapping and cheering out loud in the theater  no matter where he stands as an actor when he's in his domain he is fantastic whether you like what he's saying or not. A 7 out of 10 for a movie that was actually worth spending a budget on. Not perfect but definitely it's own thing with some good moments.  And when they're good they're really good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was moving around IMDB just now trying to sort of fill in the blanks of some random credits that I'd missed in my movie catalog and I ran across this review of 8 Mile from this college student in NYC. Now I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the magic of a certain movie if they refuse to see it or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director writer or whatever. But after reading such lines as if you liked this film you know nothing about film and so on I simply couldn't contain myself.First off let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the culture that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or hard as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wifebeating and all around socially retarded mentality I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But after a time I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it at least to give it a chance. I popped it in and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.For those who've not yet seen the film I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up in a trailer park barely able to make rent or take care of herself. Mekhi Phifer plays Future Rabbit's best ally and in some ways his father figure playing the role of the protective guidance providing loving rolemodel. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems he starts to see his path better and more clearly.Now I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story importance of cinematic elements throughout a story i.e. not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.To close this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message and portray those with clarity and honesty which this movie accomplishes in spades.See this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was moving around IMDB just now trying to sort of fill in the blanks of some random credits that I'd missed in my movie catalog and I ran across this review of 8 Mile from this college student in NYC. Now I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the magic of a certain movie if they refuse to see it or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director writer or whatever. But after reading such lines as if you liked this film you know nothing about film and so on I simply couldn't contain myself.First off let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the culture that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or hard as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wifebeating and all around socially retarded mentality I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But after a time I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it at least to give it a chance. I popped it in and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.For those who've not yet seen the film I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up in a trailer park barely able to make rent or take care of herself. Mekhi Phifer plays Future Rabbit's best ally and in some ways his father figure playing the role of the protective guidance providing loving rolemodel. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it.

	schema:reviewBody "Jimmy Rabbit is a white kid on the poor black side of town.  Growing up with this influence he has developed rapping skills but is too intimidated to showcase in the cruel Shelter' battles.  Split from his girlfriend Jimmy returns to his Mum's trailer park home and her young boyfriend.  He keeps his job in a pressing shop while working on his rhymes and trying to work out who out of all the hopes and promises will be able to help him work his way out of Detroit.After missing preview screenings and not being able to go when friends went I eventually saw this a few nights ago.  I was maybe better prepared by this point because the hype had been watered down by a few bad or balanced reviews of the film in the media.  This helped me lower my expectations so that I wasn't let down.  The plot is well difficult to describe because there isn't really one narrative to speak of rather it is Rabbit's story. As a result it is a little rambling with things just drifting through the film.  However that it still works is to it's credit.  The film holds the attention and the story still has enough in it to follow it.The telling is what does it the best I think.  The direction is good with washed out cameras not willing to glamorise anything.  The biggest smart move was the liberal use of hiphop through the film.  Occasionally we get a beat of a song but it isn't wall to wall music like many rapper's films. Even where a Eminem track is played Em's voice is limited to a few broken up words  saving his skills for the climax.  Some of the film doesn't work  I got tired of several rap scenes in everyday situations and it didn't grasp me as reality although in fairness I don't know if this is the norm in some lives.  Also there are a few too many scenes of meaningless violence that didn't come across as normal life for Rabbit but instead felt like the film trying to show Rabbit to be tough and ready for action.It is difficult to write a fair review after seeing the climax  which his why I left it a few days before writing this.  The climax is a series of short battles in the Shelter that are pumping and exciting.  Not to spoil it but some of the rapper's lines are cool  until Em takes his turns and rips the place down.  It was so funny and funky that I wished that he had made some of his own joints that sharp in his recent Benzino disses.  This is where he shines in the role but he also does well generally  maybe not worthy of an Oscar nomination but certainly very good.  He makes his character likeable but not easily and he avoids being a sympathy figure.Phieffer is not as good and didn't convince me as well as I've seen him do. He can act but here he is not really a good character.  The support cast are all pretty good and are believable and only a few are clear stereotypical groups.  Happily the usual rapper cameos are minimal and not in your face too much.  There may be more but I only spotted Xhibit and Obi Trise and neither of them took anything away by their presence.  Murphy is pretty good  sexy yet trashy  but her character and her subplot didn't really have anywhere to go and just became another part of the wandering story. Basinger is OK but she isn't as bad as I expected her to be or felt she needed to be.  She didn't need to be like his Mum in the songs but a little less victim of circumstance' would have helped buy into it.The message is worthy but heavily made and the story part of the film just didn't totally come off for me  instead it was a bit ordinary and not well written.  However the telling makes it worth seeing  the direction is pretty good and the liberal use of music is one of the many good touches meanwhile Eminem ensures that it is always worth watching  whether doing witty disses in a car park ripping the opposition in a battle or just being understated in a good role.  Understated!  Now there's a thing I thought I'd never say again about a rapper in a lead role of a film since Pac died!Like him or loathe him Eminem prevents an average at best story being unwatchable by the sheer strength of his presence.  However those who aren't fans of hiphop or Eminem may wish to avoid this as there ain't too much else on offer.".

Comedy drama action fighting guns drugs sex and of course  Bunny Rabbit. I loved the movie. I laughed so hard I cried at times and then I just flat out cried at others. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone whether they are an Eminem fan or not. Do be careful trying to get into it though. We had to go to four different movie theaters before my 16yearold friend could get in. They're checking I.D.'s on this one BIG time. Anyway  go see the movie! You'll love it! I swear on my grave it's the best movie that I've seen in a long time!".

	schema:reviewBody "Eminem is a wonderboy' product of the whitebread underclass of outraged disenfranchised youths  from a bleak Detroit in  8 Mile.' Curtis Hanson directed Wonder Boys' with the same sense of caring about youths emerging for better or worse into their adulthood. But the star of this film is Eminem and although it is a fictional story about Jimmy Smith Jr. called Rabbit' it is a loose adaptation of Eminem's rise from the ghetto of Detroit on the dividing line of the 8mile strip separating blacks from whites.The comparison with Rocky' is inevitable and not wholly inappropriate. In sports and rap blacks have proven formidable.  When a white like Rocky or Eminem can emerge as a powerful force in either field the world has to notice and films have to record and adapt.  Eminem's astounding ability to rhyme and chant obliterates all color barriers.For a white guy like myself the joy of 8 Mile' has nothing to do with turning up my nose at the brothers with my own white hope rather it is the exhilaration of seeing and hearing young people fight with vocabulary' rather than guns.  Rhyme and reason rule. The art form is important as it comments both on culture and creativity. Director Hanson said I saw here an opportunity to make a serious movie about the emotional struggles of contemporary adolescents in this country. This captures the angst insecurity frustration and anger search for direction and identity.  That statement emphasizes the teenage universal search rather than the obvious power of hiphop to Hanson's credit. The producer Brian Grazer also made  A Beautiful Mind' another exploration of genius that transcended math in favor of the search by a gifted human being for a place to be himself.This fictional biography doesn't claim to be a definitive revelation of the difficult rise of Eminem.  It does show the inner struggle of Rabbit to break from the comfort of having a job in an auto factory similar to Bjork's bleak plant in Dancer in the Dark' or striking out into creative territory dominated by blacks but promising release from the trailer park where his mother Kim Basinger is imprisoned. Lost in this somewhat sanitized adaptation is the angry homophobia and misogyny so characteristic of Eminem in real life.  But gained is the sense that hiphop is an important cultural contribution even white boys can offer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Curtis Hanson is turning out to be one of our great directors.  LA CONFIDENTIAL was a look at LA during the 1950's that was near perfection as far as films are concerned.  WONDER BOYS was a highly entertaining look at characters who live in PITTSBURGH again the city was as much a character as any of the actors. Now Curtis brings us a look at DETROIT in 8 MILE and I was so impressed. Yes I am a fan of Eminem and yes I think he's cute that combination of bad boy and lost little boy is just irresistible but the movie is a quality drama which I think all audiences will appreciate if only they'd open their minds a little and go see it. I was so happy to be in a theater with a mostly under 25 crowd at 31 I was the oldest person in the place! and we were there to watch a quality film about a kind of life that most of us can only imagine.  The audience of young people were silent at first  the anticipation of Eminem's entrance was almost palpable.  And throughout the film the audience continued to be engrossed by the realistic characters and the story.  A whole audience entertained by drama and acting and not one special effect!  Not one! We weren't there to watch a stupid brainless action film or a grossout comedy.  8 MILE is one of those classic films that most Alist actors can only hope to appear in maybe once or twice during a long career and it's the kind Eminem makes on his first time out?  The boy has brains for sure and talent.  I don't think the John Garfield James Dean comparisons are too far off  Eminem  has charisma to spare.  I don't think I want to see him continue to do more acting because 98 of the films he could do are such crap.  How do you follow up a truly great film like this? I'm so impressed.  I just hope that older people and hiphop haters will get out and see this film too it'll open their minds.".

I've seen it time and time again and I'm going to keep seeing it until the end of time. Yes it is that good! So believe me when I say watch it dog watch it today.This movie is filled with both action and comedy brilliant music and awesome beats. It has got hot chicks drunken bastards gang wars and stupid dicks. The start ending and the rest of the movie was simply brilliant. So I won't get started and describing or saying anything else about any of that. It started at the bottom and it worked its way up until it hit the top. It has got a lot of different characters. Characters that's played by great actors. There was no bad acting in this movie not one bit! The script is brilliant because it is simply brilliant and great in every way and the fact that it's based on a story from the real world doesn't hurt either. This movie is just 2 hours of brilliancy! That is all there is to say about that.So it is filled with loads of great scenes and awesomeness. The best part though I must admit was the lyrics they came up with. When you see this movie and you really should pay attention and listen to what they rap the wordplays the rhymes the insults and the funny words that come out of their mouths. And if you have already seen it watch it again you know you won't be sorry.I could go on and on and on about how great this movie was and the fact that I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about it even though I have probable seen it 30 times or so I am not kidding. That Is not a lye or overstatement that is the truth. but there is no point in going on saying that the rapping and all the other music was great and that I know the lyrics to all the rapoffs in this movie word by word or that it is so great that it is a sin to go your entire life without watching it. There is no point to it because you already know all this. I have already said it was perfect give or take and that nothing is negative about it so going on and on about how unbelievably awesome it is it's just a waste of time. So I am going to end this right here and right now. I am giving 8 mile 1010 stars and with a perfect score I highly recommend it and expect that you see it as soon as you can get your lazy ass out of that chair and away from your computer screen and move it over into the couch in front of the TV.Rating 1010 Goodnight bonsoir guten nacht god natt and Buenos noches.Peace  love God Bless J.J.Shevy".

	schema:headline " You can lose yourself in 8Mile. It's a pretty good movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson the movie is a semiautobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy BRabbit' Smith whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way he could show the world he meets business is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit Papa Doc Anthony Mackie the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful violent and somewhat silly lyrics ranging from killing his wife homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly I don't think this movie would had work if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad Eminem took this seriously. After all after this movie his music had gotten more serious and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for Lose Yourself. It was the first time a raphiphop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem the best rapper? It's up in the air depending what you think is music. After all 2005's Encore  2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But it's still hard not to find yourself jamming to Lose Yourself when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah most of the raps were pretty funny and clever both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good all around. Eminem has never acted before this but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex Jimmy's loveinterest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. EminemMurphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the exgirlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film is the alcoholic mother Kim Basinger as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole subplot of her losing her home a bit underdeveloped as surprising near the climax she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race class and segregation in the urban lower socioeconomic environment. Indeed it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs murder and loot. You really see how economic devastation and deindustrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day because when I first saw it I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong it's R Rating for a reason but I really think the producers were going for a PG13 rating here. Yes there's a lot of harsh language but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson the movie is a semiautobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy BRabbit' Smith whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way he could show the world he meets business is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit Papa Doc Anthony Mackie the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie the movie borderlines Eminem real life.

So what's it like when you put the two of them together in a film which should have happened a long time ago and it's not one of those Expendables movies that play out like a bad fake fanmade trailer on YouTube? Actually you get a fairly decent film.I wont' play coy here Escape Plan isn't completely spectacular. The film has its problems. For example Vinnie Jones is in the film and he's just lethargically playing the same character he's been riding on since his Guy Ritchie days only he's lost the unique wit and humor he had in those days but at least he's not playing the Juggernaut in this film because that was just embarrassing for all of us. Secondly the movie shifts tones during the climax and it was slightly jarring. The film goes from a movie about guys sneaking out of an inescapable prison to guys just deciding to shoot their way out. It goes from interesting to eh let's become a generic action film very quickly. Finally the movie has some unresolved plot threads towards its end and it make a mad dash like a demon is on its tail to try and get them resolved before the credits decide to shut the whole thing down. However despite the problems the movie has its elements working for it and makes it a watchable film and something destined to be played numerous times on FX or Spike. Stallone and Schwarzenegger are terrific together and are giving performances that are probably the best they've done in the last decade. Plus it's very clear Arnold is having a blast with his role and it was sorta infectious. Finally Jim Caviezel is a decent antagonist as the film's evil warden to the high tech prisonthat is when you can hear him. Caviezel really enjoyed whispering all his lines.Escape Plan may not be the most memorable film of either Stallone's or Schwarzenegger's career but the movie is mildly entertaining and worked for what it is.Hi!

	schema:reviewBody "I was so prepared not to like Escape Plan thinking it would be another run of the mill Stallone action movie. I went in with very low expectations not knowing anything of the plot. But surprisingly this film turned out to be very engaging and fun to watch after all. I will not be putting a detailed synopsis for you to be able to enjoy this movie fully as well.Ray Breslin Sylvester Stallone is a Houdini of jails having the ability to escape even the highest of high security enclosures. He finds himself locked up in an unofficial facility whose problematic inmates are meant to disappear. In the advanced high tech and isolated prison Breslin's escape skills are put to the ultimate test. Sylvester Stallone still delivers his lines as garbled as ever but he looks good for his age and has not lost his charisma as an action star. He managed to be quite credible in playing such an incrediblyskilled individual. We are ready to suspend disbelief and accept that he can do the impossible. Hey that is Stallone on that screen!Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a German inmate named Rottmeyer who befriends Breslin. Arnie plays it light here with his acting so typically awkward and actually funny but we know and love him in this tongueincheek style of his. Jim Caviezel is intense as Hobbes the warden of this special prison as well as its proud designer. He will go to all extremes to prove that his prison is escapeproof. His career seemed to have taken a dip after Passion of the Christ and that is unbelievable after the limits he pushed with that memorably emotional performance. He is very good here despite being in a rather onedimensional antagonist role.It was very good to see Sam Neill on screen again also after what seems to be a long absence. He plays the prison physician here faced with a moral dilemma.The story telling by Swedishborn director Mikael Hfstrm is wellpaced and actually quite exciting. The set design of the prison was very high tech and well thought of. That version of solitary confinement was harsh! The escape techniques seemed logically planned and thrillingly executed. The revelation scenes are very wellstaged and that is only how far I'm going to describe them so you won't be spoiled with the many surprises this film has in store for you. Recommended for those looking for a good entertaining and unexpectedly smart action film. You may think you already know how it all ends but the road it took to get to that ending is quite an enjoyable ride despite those typically hokey gunfight scenes towards the end. I had a good time watching this. 710.".

Yes they've teamed up in the overthetop cheesy Expendables films but Escape Plan is a more satisfying and better quality film.Rambo...Terminator...Jesus...John Trent...50 Cent...yeah the cast is pretty awesome for this prison break flick. Jim Caviezel almost steals the show as the evil warden. We all know Sly and Arnie are in their mid60's but man do they still kick butt! Plus they're still literally ripped...like bulging...like veins sticking out all over the place ripped! We had a blast watching this and I recommend it to any action fan especially the 80's action crowd. There's great oneliners slow motion shoot outs explosions prison shanks and all sort of bad ass action.I really hope this does well at the box office because it is an entertaining film that's way better than The Last Stand and A Bullet To The Head. But I wouldn't be surprised if those films have turned some movie goers off. A real action fan will love this flick though. Go check it out! Get to da choppa!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was pretty decent it did try to be more clever than it was. It's not flawless. No movie is and when Stallone and Arnold are in it its worth watching. The thing that took me by surprise was Arnold's Acting he played actually good and not over thetop neither did Stallone. I saw it without subtitles and i can understand why some doesn't gets its plot because the two are pretty hard to understand sometimes. In one of the first scene Stallone greets a Warden and i swear to god i thought he said What up instead of Warden. The best scene most be with the scenes where Arnold is coacting with the bad Guy Jim Caviezel. The Bad guy here is the kind of really evil bastard your meant to hate but he is kind of funny. His death was a laugh it was cheesy and i loved it. This is not a movie with the biggest explosions its a Arnie and Sly film with a cool bad guy. The plot is predictable really there is a twist who didn't take me by surprise but i guess its a trend to have some twists and curls in action movies these days. This is not a movie i'm going to buy but if you like movies with Sly and Arnold and you want to see them together. Even now when they are old they are pretty badass in this movie. I recommend it because it's fun funny good chemistry with the two action elders. 710".

Rottmayer Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the prisoners who helps Breslin but they're on their own.I really love the first half of this movie. Sylvester Stallone really grew on me. The team and the jobs are interesting. Everything is going well. It makes sense why Hobbes wouldn't release Breslin at first. The first problem comes in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Immediately I am afraid of cheesy 80s action camp coming. For awhile Arnold did his job and the story moves on. He did his best and got a few jokes in. I actually prefer not to have the joking around. The sense of cheesy camp is always near and that's what the jokes are. Then the movie goes full on cheese. It's like a time warp into an old Arnold action movie when he takes the big machine gun.There is also the problem of why some of these prisoners aren't just killed off. Why would a drug cartel care to keep Javed alive? No idea. Why not just torture Victor Manheim out of Rottmayer? No idea. Why wouldn't Hobbes kill Breslin once he finds out who he really is? No idea. There was somebody else spoilers who should want him dead. What happened?It is so disappointing that this is not a better movie. It starts off so well but it's an obvious mistake to team up with Arnold doing serious action. That era is over and the guys are old. It may work in a jokey way in the Expendables franchise.

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying that the fact alone Schwarzenegger and Stallone are in their 60's doing a film like this is the ultimate reason to watch this. I can never understand why people claim they are too old. If anything they put people half their age to shame with their physical abilities and they should inspire people to want to stay energetic well into their senior years. This movie is absolute Gold! We finally have the two biggest movie stars of all time headlining a movie together and believe me you get what you pay for! The action and visuals were what I expected very clear and stunning. The prison was almost a character itself in making the audience feel apart of the setting. My hat goes off to the director who was able to balance the offscreen chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger and fuse it into the story. No joke these two guys were made to star in a movie together. The nostalgia is off the roof!! Every movie has its flaws and no doubt this one did but in saying that I was able to automatically ignore them here because of the story it was well paced. We see Stallone's character introduced as a prison security expert who is set up and put into the worlds most secure prison. Here he teams up with none other than Schwarzenegger who plays another prisoner pretty much the one you don't mess with. Together they plot their escape and it is done superbly! Overall I think this movie is a well made action thriller and will surprise audiences with something they haven't seen before from both Arnold and Sly. I will be surprised if this film doesn't get much attention at the box office because this movie goes back to a time when Hollywood was larger than life and gave us memorable characters and memorable action scenes. 1010".

The film reminded me a bit of and borrows elements from Fortress and THX1138. Contrary to The Expendables the film has a descent plot and is well made. The VFX are good and never look fake so generally speaking a fine production. I expected little so I was positively surprised to see that it could deliver 2 hours of solid entertainment. It was never going to be as good as T2 or Cliffhanger but it's a pity it just flopped at the box office. I hope many people give it a second chance on DVD or BD as it is certainly worth the watch.".

Stalone is imprisoned because... yeah why? He wrote a book and a prison got built including his opinions for a perfect prison. He doesn't know anything about it and than he got imprisoned there because somebody wanted him disappear? What? Why? Schwarzenegger supports him with his prison break with his worst acting ever and that guy who wrote the conversations for him should feel guilty his whole life long. Yeah and then this Oppium drug dealer. lol yeah why should some drug dealer pay money to imprison him there? A drive by would be much cheaper... oh wait of course they needed a Muslim in this movie for Stalones escape plan. And then last and least Neil. A drunken doctor haunted by guilt who tries to redeem himself with helping with the prison break.

Stalone is imprisoned because... yeah why? He wrote a book and a prison got built including his opinions for a perfect prison. He doesn't know anything about it and than he got imprisoned there because somebody wanted him disappear? What? Why? Schwarzenegger supports him with his prison break with his worst acting ever and that guy who wrote the conversations for him should feel guilty his whole life long. Yeah and then this Oppium drug dealer. lol yeah why should some drug dealer pay money to imprison him there? A drive by would be much cheaper... oh wait of course they needed a Muslim in this movie for Stalones escape plan. And then last and least Neil. A drunken doctor haunted by guilt who tries to redeem himself with helping with the prison break.

Breslin finds out that he might be on his own in this prison with no chance of escape or being rescued. He might have been double crossed by his business partner rather foreseeable and to make things worse Arnie is one of the inmates and is trying too hard to be his friend.Jim Caviezel who previously has come across as a rather bland leading man camps it up as Hobbes the sadistic prison warden who does not care whether Breslin is innocent.

It is more thoughtful although you get some gun toting action at the end.I would be the first to admit I did not understand what Arnie was doing in this type of prison although I sort of guessed his true identity.

If he is a cartel guy he should not be in this prison something the film never grapples with even though Tahir is the third hero of the film.Sly and Arnie act their parts well although there is still too much mumbling.Plot holes a plenty as no one inside the prison discovers that although they might be located deep down they are actually in a ship and no amount of stabilizers can protect you from heavy seas or even the humming of the engines in such a big cargo ship. Surely such as a ship would have to dock for supplies for the prisoners and staff change of crew and prison guards.Its fun maybe too long and has confusing plot elements.".

They may age and become slower than their younger selves but they still kickass.Well I missed the first minutes of the movie. Yeah I was embarrassingly late  I came in the cinema when the title Escape Plan came up on the screen. So what is it? Five minutes late maybe? But with the flashback I know what happened in the part I missed. Stallone's character Ray Breslin is a Houdini but in this case he is talented in finding his way out of prison. No he is not a criminal. Just to test the prison's quality in the security aspect.Then the plot moved to a lawyer from CIA Yeah Langley.. who asked Breslin to test a prison prototype's security. He agreed and nothing is wrong until Breslin realized that his evacuation code did not make any sense. Like he is being put into prison for real. Then as usual prison fight a stranger Emil Rottmayer Schwarzenegger suddenly became a best friend then planning to escape from that prison. And of course they finally escaped from that prison.The theme is not new. We all know there are lots of movies and TV series like this like Prison Break and Escape from Alcatraz. But this movie is executed perfectly and I really enjoy this movie. A bit boring the first twenty minutes but the rest of the movie did entertain me.Action is a must. Blood fight guns and mosty anything available in nearest location. And some gags humors everything hilarious add more excitement to this movie. The detail of the prison is amazing. This movie is like a Escaping Prison 101. Using available stuff and human resources to escape from a prison.This movie is highly recommended. Stallone and Schwarzenegger still kickass and also can be funny at the same time. I am sure you will not be disappointed.".

But if you neglect that need for nostalgia then all you are left with is a foul movie. I like any other welcomed the prospect of Stallone and Schwarzenegger in the same movie but then i seen the trailer....and then i read the plot....and then i watched the trailer again....and eventually i had lost interest.Yes it was obvious from the announcement that it wasn't going to be a mind blowing spectacle of acting but they could have at least came up with something original. Nevermind the fact that i almost chewed my face off at Arnie's role as the favour guy as Stallone so expertly put it....it was like a deteriorating rusted blob of waste compared to Morgan Freeman as RED from Shawshank. And i know there is basically no point in comparing their acting abilities but at the end of the day it is a film....and a film consists of actorsactresses....who are supposed to act....and unless Arnie is a machine literal or in human form then he fails. The comedy between him and Stallone was mind numbing but what do you expect from Rocky and a Terminator.The two live off of their past status so when they decide to star in a film together...all the Rocky fans and all the Terminator fans find themselves in a tizzy and choose to disregard the fact that they are both a complete tragedy when it comes to acting. Instead choosing to succumb to nostalgia. As i said it can cloud the mind.Now back to the unoriginal factor it carries. And that is not in relation to Shawshank or all prison break films....but one. Anybody remember Lock Up? Yes that starred Sylvester Stallone as well...where he was very good at breaking out of prisons....so he ends up being wrongly transferred from one prison to another a slight difference in how he gets there but still very similar.... there he is greeted with a warden who has a hidden agenda......and is mentally and physically tortured ..... ah very similar indeed. So in conclusion this film is basically Lock Up with a rubbish RED in it.Even with the two disasters aside the acting doesn't really have any saving grace i mean Vinnie Jones?....50 cent? Not exactly a strong cast. Donald Sutherland.....sorry that's Lock Up i mean Jim Caviezel plays an OK part as the wicked warden but apart from that there is nothing. The action is what would be expected exaggerated. The comedy is cheesy and the plot is placid and predictable.If you're starved for nostalgia then this is the movie to feed that hunger but for me it was and is a recipe for disaster.310".

The movie industry has thankfully moved on from the lazy dumb action movies that were so prevalent thirty years ago. That is not to say that the current crop of action flicks are works of artthey are not but they are products of their time. Escape Plan feels as if it is a product of the Eighties and it is difficult to find the appeal of such a past its sell by date product.Sylvester Stallone is apparently reluctant to face his old age. He tries to act as though he is a young man but there is no amount of cosmetics and hairpieces that will disguise the fact that he is too old for roles like this.Arnie comes across slightly better. Like his role in The Last Stand his character feels age appropriate and he is having fun in his over the top portrayal.Pacing is a problem. There is a long tedious section in the middle which seems to go on forever. The end brightens up with an okayish action sequence but the effect is spoiled by some silly moments and an incredibly lame oneliner.Wait for the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is not often that you get to see a movie that defies descriptionbut I suppose if you wait long enough anything is possible. Yes there is lots of action and yes the acting is fair but believe me when I say there is absolutely no sense whatsoever to the plot. You will spend most of your time asking yourself how did this come about how did that come about. There is absolutely no continuity in the story and no explanation for half the stuff that happens. So if you do not need a plot or for it to make sense and are happy to sit in front of a screen and watch some action and listen to sound effects without it making any sensethen this is the movie for you. You can give your brain the night off and put your eyes and ears on overtime. I think Stallone and Arnie can basically write a script during lunch and just get someone to make the movie regardless. This is nothing but money for the boys. Oh! yeahI gave it a three for the sheer barefaced audacity of making it.".

	schema:headline " Lots of action not much else";
	schema:reviewBody "This was probably one of dumbest films I've seen in a while. Stallone is a professional who goes into prison to try and figure out how to escape so that the prison can then tighten up security etc.. This job makes no sense. Why not just inspect it and make recommendations why risk death by being in the prison. Anyway he is paid to enter a particularly secure prison for the worst of the worst. When he gets there he finds out he has been double crossed. He befriends the Governator former who has tried to take down the banking system with software. The Governator is a criminal with a heart of gold or something like that and they become friends. I suppose because he's hurting the banking system the producers figure he'll be seen as a heroic criminal so its OK if he goes free. I don't want to give away too much of the story not much of a story to give away anyway but in the end Stallone escapes but surely in killing guards while escaping he is no longer an innocent professional but just a run of the mill criminal. Oh well such details are usually ignored in Hollywood films. If you like pointless action this is the film for you. If you like implausible escapes and miraculous shot outs where the hero somehow survives... then you'll love this one. If you are looking for drama good acting a rational plot or a meaningful theme then this is probably not what you are looking for.".
