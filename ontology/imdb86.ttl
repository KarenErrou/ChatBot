	schema:reviewBody "I'm finding that I like the Milkyway Image movies where Johnnie To is just a producer more than the ones where he is the director though Breaking News was pretty good. Eye in the Sky starts off with Kate Tsui on a training mission to see if she is good enough to become a cop in a special surveillance unit. She has to study Simon Yam and be able to give every detail of what he did during the day. And just like every Milkyway movie I have seen they connect a certain scene at the start of the movie with one that happens towards the end. So she gets the job but just barely. Simon Yam thinks she has potential so he decides to let her on the force. Tony Leung Ka Fei plays the leader of a gang of bank robbers. He sets everything up and the rest of the guys do the roberies. So now of course this is where Kate Tsui and Simon Yam come in and try to catch him.This is a pretty standard story but well done. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Kate Tsui does a decent enough job in her role Simon Yam is good just like he usually is and Tony Leung gives a magnificent performance. I thought the last couple of scenes were kind of disappointing but the scene towards the end with Tony Leung and Kate Tsui in the restauarant and the scene where Simon Yam struggles to finish his joke makes up for it.If you are looking for a good cop movie that has a couple of well done sudden violent moments then there is a good chance you will like this. If you are looking for an action packed or highly stylized movie look elsewhere.And one more note. This movie is a tight 90 minutes actually more like 85 if you don't include the beginning and opening credits which is one of the many reasons why I liked it. And it doesn't feel like it should have been longer. Movies to me are just getting too long these days.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Eye in the Sky";
	schema:reviewBody "First time director Yau NaiHoi's Eye in the Sky gets the two thumbs up from me. It's an excellent movie with a strong storyline that gets zoned into the moment with no room spent on unnecessarily bloating the movie beyond what it should be. Director Yau a frequent collaborator and scriptwriter for Johnny To classics brings to Eye in the Sky a taut 90 minutes coprobbers story on surveillance of the men and women who do the thankless anonymous tasks behind the scenes on following suspects and trawling the streets for them.Surveillance is never easy and trust me I know from work experience. While there are countless of CCTV cameras and various technologies nothing beats having up to date field intelligence. The opening film of the HKIFF I had hoped to have watched this on its first screening but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as I had one week to trawl the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon and being able to identify the locales used was an added thrill.Although this is a cop thriller it doesn't have the usual car chases explosions or fancy gun battles. It's quite muted in these aspects however it brings about a refreshing realism to the story a great departure from the days when action has to be stylized flying through the air shooting two guns anyone? The way the surveillance team operate with its arsenal of disguises tricks and vehicles and the skills that one must possess  keen observation alertness and an elephant memory makes it like a cross between The Recruit and Mission Impossible.Eye in the Sky tells the story of a new recruit nicknamed Piggy Kate Tsui by her mentor DogHead Simon Yam as she undergoes an onjob training of sorts in their case to track down some armed heist robbers led by Hollow Man Tony Leung Kar Fai. It becomes a tight cat and mouse game as identities are attempted to be established and the team comes up against a villain who's truly aware of his environment turning the tables as the hunter might become the prey.There are strong performances all round led by the veterans Simon Yam in a change of alignment given his outings last year as villains and Tony Leung as a chillingly observant cool and methodical sudokuplaying mastermind. In her first movie role I thought Kate Tsui did remarkably well in her role as Piggy the newbie lacking field experience yet being thrown in the deep end of the pool to sink or swim. Perhaps it is truly her being new to the scene that eased her comfortably into a role which is similar to herself but the story does allow her room to showcase some of her acting chops and she holds her own well against the veterans. Maggie Tsui too added some comedic moments as a foul mouthed police madam.Eye in the Sky is a recommended Hong Kong cop thriller time to let go of mole stories which is tight and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you follow the surveillance team through high angles akin to CCTV camera angles tight teamwork and features an incredible soundtrack as well to keep it fast paced. You must watch this when it makes it to our shores in Singapore tentatively scheduled for mid April.".

Opening sequences do bring with them fleeting glances of the delightful hitech surveillancerich spy mood the movie's promotional material sort of wanted you to buy into but that's the extent of titillation they managed here.We soon realize Eye in the Sky is nothing more than yet another cops and robbers affair and not even remotely one of the more poignant you've never seen. It does come across that director Yau Nai Hoi previously worked with Johnny To and his crew on stuff like The Mission and Expect the Unexpected but apparently on his own he can't match those classics.Instead we get a minimal story paper tiger villains who crumble all too soon and a fatherly good cop character that seemingly can't die. That last one really pooped the party which sounds mean but after building up the melodrama in an almosttouching scene having the guy come back from the dead is simply awkward.So both Simon Yam and good old Tony Leung fail to make a lasting impression here but what about the supporting cast? Well a mixed bag as usual. Kate Tsui is Little Piggy a new recruit to the HKPD's surveillance unit a gathering of people with the knack to be anyone anywhere and anyhow. They even know where you buy your saltines and soda. That aside Tsui is OK for some scenes but overall there's no raving about her output in this film.Likable soap opera Wayne Lai does his best and is impressive but gets about ten seconds on screen so what can you do? Likewise Maggie Siu PTU is cool as a constantlycussing commanding madam albeit doesn't get explored much beyond.To its credit Eye in the Sky does have numerous instances of the beloved F word and finally a classic shootoutwithvansonadesertedHong Kongoverpass type of deal between the crooks and bemasked tactical unit cops.

	schema:reviewBody "This is basically the ultimate surveillance film that revolves around the covert operations of an undercover police unit attempting to gather intelligence on a sophisticated crew of jewel robbers. So the way the film works is that you have this subdivision of the police department that has maybe a dozen or so operatives in civilian clothes who attempt to identify and gather information on suspected criminals. So let's say that there's a robbery somewhere and a street camera catches the image of a suspect. Well this subdivision will search the other street cameras in the area and see how far they can follow this guy to see where he went after the crime was committed. Eventually you're going to lose him but if you have an idea of an area that he frequently goes to whether it's near his home or work etc. then you dispatch this surveillance team into the streets to stake out the area in an attempt to find him follow him and gather information on him.So most of the film concerns the protagonist operatives as they do their jobs which is really interesting to watch. From the very first minute the cloakanddagger shadowing begins and continues right up to the final moments. This contributes a slowburn suspense that keeps the viewer on edge. Although technically this is a slow moving film the pacing still seems very brisk due to the premise. And there are also some great moments when a protagonist is in a position that may expose the entire operation.The overall quality of Eye in the Sky is impressive on all fronts. The direction is very engaging with fluid camerawork that keeps things moving while at the same time effectively showing everything that is happening. The viewer is constantly aware of the positions and locations of all of the characters which is key when you're dealing with the theme of surveillance and tailing suspects. Also the music is excellent and very catchy. It's perfectly suited given the themes of the film.Now what about the acting. It's exceptional and all of the actors have great chemistry together. We have another appearance by Simon Yam and this is one of my favorite performances from him. When I first saw this movie  years ago  I had seen a bunch of Yam's more nasty notorious films where he plays the bad guy so his turn in Eye in the Sky as a reserved intelligent extremely likable fatherfigure totally convinced me of his range as an actor. He's fantastic in this. The lead actress is Kate Tsui who is also surprisingly excellent in this. I immediately became a fan of hers after watching this film but the only other memorable role of her career subsequent to this was when she appeared in the Donnie Yen's flick 14 Blades from 2010 where she played a villain. Now I have heard that many of her best roles are in TV dramas so I definitely need to check those out if I can find them. And finally we have Tony Leung Kafai who plays the villain here in impressive fashion. This guy is paranoid and very sharp with a fantastic memory  which automatically makes him a challenge for our protagonists. As an FYI there are two Tony Leungs on the Hong Kong acting scene. The more popular actor in the west is Tony Leung ChiuWai who you've seen in films such as Hard Boiled from 1992 In the Mood for Love in 2000 Infernal Affairs from 2002 and Lust Caution from 2007. I'm a big fan of Tony Leung ChiuWai  he has a very suave slick look to him that is instantly charismatic. But I must say that Tony Leung Kafai has significantly grown on me over time and I think that his role in Eye in the Sky represents some of his best work. So that's just another reason to watch this movie.The one thing that might irritate some viewers is that there are a few improbable coincidences that are used throughout. I think that  in that case  it's a bit easier to swallow because right at the beginning of the movie the theme of coincidence is alluded to by Simon Yam's character. He specifically tells Kate Tsui's character that sometimes you just gotta get lucky to catch these guys  and it happens more often that you might think. So they introduce coincidence as an up front theme of the film so it feels less like a contivance and more like an interesting aspect.In my opinion Eye in the Sky is a contemporary classic. I could watch this movie a thousand times and not get sick of it. Fans of mostly realistic suspensedriven tailing sequences ala The French Connection will be drooling all over themselves. And it's fairly easy to find on DVD  so watch it!".

But for us familiar with Hong Kong cinema then Suet Lam is also a familiar face and name. I wasn't particularly familiar with Kate Tsui but she was rather impressive in this 2007 action thriller.The story is about a young woman Kate Tsui starring int he CIB special division of the Hong Kong police department. Under the training of her superior Simon Yam they are playing a catandmouse chase against a particularly professional gang of thieves.There are many interesting aspects to the story in Eye in the Sky and the characters are detailed and have depth and fleshed out personalities. And the acting talents were doing good jobs with their roles. Just a shame that the pace of the movie was so dreadfully slow.I will say that Eye in the Sky is a movie that appeals only to those whom are fan of the Hong Kong cinema. Otherwise you might find more enjoyment in another action thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm surprised by some of the negative comments on this film.  In my opinion it represents the best kind of literary adaptation that the cinema offers One in which the screenwriter and director clearly remained faithful to the spirit of the book without attempting to reproduce it.  How can you go wrong with a Margaret Atwood book a Harold Pinter screenplay and Volker Schlndorff's direction?  Some have suggested that the film suffered from wooden acting.  Personally I thought it was a fantastic cast Robert Duvall and Victoria Tennant at their evil best Faye Dunnaway as the defeated wife Elizabeth McGovern as saucy as ever Aidan Quinn and Natascha Richardson in the necessarily bland roles that drive the narrative. What holes here?Commercial film doesn't get any better.  The Handmaid's Tale is a dark portrait of a world unlike ours and yet so much like ours... in which a rightwing bureaucratic patriarchy dominates the land.  Women have three main functions for which their clothing is color coded Red for the handmaids who are walking wombs white for the innnocent children blue for the sterile trophy wives.  Brown is worn by the aunts a futuristic equivalent of the Sonderkomando i.e. Jews who worked on behalf of the Nazi's in the death camps evil schoolmistress types who both trainbrainwash young women for assignment and occasionally destroy them. A fifth function for which the garb is particularly interesting is working in Gilead's underground social club essentially a den of iniquity rife with prostitution and drugs.  Point is... by splitting up these functions hasn't Atwood described the basic roles that women play within our own maledominated society in various different permutations and combinations? To the patriarchy women are mothers models sluts angels and when professionals they are not to aspire to more teaching posts.  In Gilead the lines are clearer in our own society aren't most women supposed to play some combination of all of these roles?I get the feeling that most moviegoers are looking for something else in scifi.  Here's a new plot twist The rebels feed Kate some kind of medication that allows her to read the commander's mind while destroying his brain.  Wait... that's Scanners.  Oops.  Seriously two of the reviews on this site made spedific mention of Schlndorff's horrible atrocious directorial skills.  Ahem.  Perhaps before they weigh in on the auteur they ought to see Young Trless Coup de grce The Tin Drum and all of his other wonderful efforts.  As a matter of fact to insinuate that someone who could bring Grass' Tin Drum to the screen in such a stunning fashion is a lousy director is PREPOSTEROUS.  Schlndorff is a giant of the New German Cinema and it underscores the ignorance of the Hollywooders when they cast such baseless aspersions.".

	schema:headline " A Talibanlike Christian theocracy in the US";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a haunting psychologically compelling story about what the United States might be like under a right wing fundamentalist theocracy. Adapted by the acclaimed playwright Harold Pinter from the novel by Margaret Atwood this is a tale of the suppression of women by a totalitarian state called the 'Republic of Gilead.' In some respects one is reminded of Orwell's 1984 the endless war from without designed to keep the populace preoccupied and beholden to the state the paucity of basic food stuffs and consumer goods expect for the ruling class the general hopelessness etc. There is horrendous pollution so that most women are not fertile yet the state needs babies for the war effort and the economy. Consequently women's bodies are taken over by the state and those women that are fertile are made to bear children for the sterile leaders. Those who are not fertile are reduced to servitude. All overt sexual expression and any kind of activity not in keeping with the strict dictates of the fundamentalist religion is forbidden and transgressions are punishable by death sometimes in public hangings. In one ugly scene the handmaids themselves are made to pull the rope that attaches to the noose that strangles a wayward handmaid. This is followed by a man accused of rape being thrown to the handmaids who literally rip him apart with their bare hands.Natasha Richardson has the starring role as a fertile handmaid for the Commander Robert Duvall. She is not artificially inseminated presumably since that would be against the dictates of the religion which is by the way a kind of repressive fundamentalist Christianity instead there is a 'ceremony' in which the Commander's wife Faye Dunaway holds her hands as they both wear veils while the Commander with his clothes still onWell one can imagine.I read the novel some years ago and was struck not by Atwood's attack on fundamentalist Christianity as much as I was by her attack on men period. Harold Pinter's screenplay and Volker Schlondorff's direction emphasize the hypocrisy willful ignorance and antihuman aspects of fundamentalism while attributing the sexism to the patriarchal religion. What is stunningly topical viewing this in the year of Our Lord 2002 is the parallel between the repressive fundamentalist theocracy of Atwood's vision and that of the Taliban. The subjugation of women using them strictly as servants or as reproductive machines their bodies covered and their heads veiled in bright red is a striking bit of deadon foresight by Atwood Pinter and Schlondorff. This movie was perhaps made a decade ahead of its time.Richardson is very good in her characteristic way. She has a quality unlike most movie stars in that she projects primarily not her looks or charisma or even her vitality but instead her individual will a quality that is exactly right for the part. Faye Dunaway as the commander's wife acts out in contrasting blue a kind of Daughters of the American Revolution club woman mentality to a tee. Duvall is wonderfully slimy as a warlord hypocrite always claiming to act in the name of God. Seems familiar. Elizabeth McGovern is believable as a sexy lesbian handmaid a 'gender criminal' while Victoria Tennant Aunt Lydia is a kind of drill sergeant housemother to the handmaids. Aidan Quinn gets to be Richardson's heroic lover.This may not be entirely faithful to the book but it is a fine work in its own right. The direction is intelligent and focused and the script by Pinter excellent. The acting is superior all around and the story is true in a psychologically sense. This movie is also a warning that it could happen here.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

The radioactive parts are called the colonies where bad girls are sent to die of radiation poisoning. The time is the near future after the inevitable nuclear war and the breakdown of government as we know it.The society depicted in The Handmaid's Tale is a nightmare everyone is watched by the Eyes unknowable unseen government spies. Women are forbidden to have jobs. They are irrevocably assigned to classes. At the top are the chaste but morally superior Wives almost all of whom have been rendered infertile by the inevitable unclear war. At the bottom are the housekeepers or Marthas who are nonentities. In the middle are the Handmaids of the title who are fertile but tightly controlled. The term Handmaid is a Biblical term that is used in the Old Testament stories of Abraham Sarah Jacob and Rachel. In the Bible the wives gave their handmaids to their husbands in order to produce heirs.Handmaids in the film and the book are forced to have sex with the Commanders the husbands of the Wives. During this sex the Wives are intimately present to take in any love their Commanders have to give.The Handmaids are trained to remain unattached to the Commanders. They are prohibited from using makeup or doing anything to make themselves attractive. Handmaids are forced to turn their offspring over to the morally fit Wives.Robert Duvall a Commander in whose home Offred is placed gives a family Bible reading performance that will curdle the blood of true people of faith.

The one god is very strict and has His Eyes everywhere.Offred who was once known as Kate is a Handmaid who despite her training read brainwashing recalls her past her loving husband and her adored daughter. She tells with sparkling and terrifying clarity how the society came to be the way it is.This governmental aspect of the story is instructive however they are almost totally absent in the film.Offred'sKate's personal story is heartrending. It reminds one of the miseries of say the women of Darfur. When the government breaks down she and her husband and daughter attempt to flee to Canada. Unfortunately they are caught. Her daughter is confiscated. Her husband is taken away. She never sees her husband again.Offred's training is not as extensively portrayed in the film as it is in the book but her feeling of terror and helplessness are palpable in an exquisite performance by Natasha Richardson.

	schema:reviewBody "Having just finished the original book written by noted Canadian author Margaret Atwood I was eager to see this film to see the world depicted within recreated visually. Immediately I was drawn into this disturbing world.  SPOILERS The USA as we know it is gone replaced via a coup d'tat by rightwing Christian fundamentalists who establish the Republic of Gilead in it's place where literal interpretations of the Old Testament take the place of the Constitution and laws governing the land. The name Gilead comes from the Bible from an area NE of the Dead Sea why Atwood used this I do not know. As a result of nuclear waste radiation and pollution only a tenth of the population can reproduce. Women who are still fertile are brainwashed and trained as handmaids subjugated as virtual sex slaves and sent to live in the households of highranking state officials to bear their children.Does the film diverge from the book? A fair bit but not as bad as other film adaptions like Ludlum's Bourne series or Interview With the Vampire  Queen of the Damned.Again more spoilers in the book there is a great deal more emphasis on the narrator's history especially with her mother and her husband Luke who only appears in the film's beginning. In the book Luke's fate is unknown as he was taken away from her and never seen again. In the film Luke is shot and killed within the first few minutes. In the book the narrator's mother is a freethinking feminist who winds up sent to the Colonies but we never see her in the film. Moira in the book is virtually the same but she knew the narrator prior to being sent to the Red Centre  they were friends in college. The most startling change from book to film was the ending Kate in the movie slashes the throat of the Commander she is assigned to before being whisked away by the Mayday resistance group to freedom. In the book this does not happen  she is led away and the Commander is told she was secretly stealing information from him.Also in the book the narrator is not named while in the film she is given the name Kate. Following the climax there is a fictional seminar synopsis set hundreds of years after the events in the book where the characters and their possible identities are examined. In this the reader learns the Republic of Gilead eventually fell.Overall a great read and a decent adaptation to film. Definitely worth a read especially during the year of an election. It will scare the hell out of you.".

Kate the late and missed Natasha Richardson is one such servant to Serena Joy Faye Dunaway and her husband the Commander Robert Duvall. Kate wants outbut it seems there's no way.The synopsis only scratches the surface of a VERY dark and disturbing movie. It slowly shows how women are treated and used and it just gets more horrifying as it unfolds. The parallels to Hitler's Nazi Germany are fairly obvious but here we have barren women instead of Jews and gays. The good acting by everybody makes this hard to shake off. Aidan Quinn as Nick and Duvall are OK Victoria Tennant is chilling as a leader of the camps Elizabeth McGovern is just great as a fellow prisoner who befriends Kate Dunaway is also very good in her role. Best of all is Richardson. This couldn't have been an easy role but she pulls it off beautifully. She died at far too young an age. This is basically an unknown movie and it's easy to see whyit's far too dark and disturbing for a general audience. However the ending is sort of uplifting and changed from the book. Grim dark and depressing. View it at your own risk. The ceremony sequences are almost impossible to watch and shocked the hell out of me the first time I saw this.".

And this is of great significant importance the fact that we as readers or viewers never learn her name means something and to simply choose a name out of a hat is destroying a piece of the character created for us by Margaret Attwood. Also reading the plot outline makes me wonder whether whoever wrote that even saw the film especially where it says Kate is a criminal guilty of the crime of trying to escape from the US and is sentenced to become a Handmaid. when really KATE becomes a handmaid as her husband was married once before and their marriage never really existed in the eyes of the law. Also i read on to see that After ruthless group training by Serena Joy in the proper way to behave Kate is assigned as Handmaid to the Commander. Well that is not at all true as anyone who has seen this film will notice that Serena Joy is the commanders wife and not one of the Aunts and the Red Centre. Please in the future get your facts right and also thanks to director Volker Schlndorff for ruining a perfectly enjoyable book. My advice stick to the book and not the watered down version for the small minded.".

	schema:headline " Intriguing and downright scary!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film was marketed somewhat as a scifi film mainly due to the speculative nature of its society but in my opinion it's more horrific than anything from Stephen King.  Imagine a society ruled by a totalitarian theocracy and a patriarchal one at that.  Women have been reduced to subservient roles and minorities have been removed.  Environmental matters and social upheaval have left a large portion of the controlling population sterile.  To counteract this fertile women are forced to become handmaids breeding stock for those in power justified by a small passage from Genesis.  What really makes this premise scary is that it represents ideas pushed by some fundamentalist groups within this society.  Also there is enough twisted logic to almost make it seem benign but that is always the way with fascists.Spoilers Natasha Richardson plays Kate a former librarian who tries to flee this repressive state with her family.  They are caught at the border where her husband is shot and killed and she becomes separated from her daughter. She is then transported to a holding facility where she is subjected to indoctrination prior to being placed in the home of one of the society elites.  Richardson is rather low key throughout the film.  She never really seems to generate much emotion even when asking about her missing daughter. Normally this would be a problem but it works within this sterile society. Perhaps she has been so brutalized by this society she has lost touch with her emotions.  In other roles this lack of emotional range has hindered Richardson here it is an asset.Faye Dunaway is chilling as Serena Joy.  She is cold calculating and ruthless which Dunaway is an expert at portraying.  She is lost in this society where her identity entirely revolves around her role as the Commander's wife when she once held celebrity status.  She no longer has any emotional connection to her husband and thinks a child will change that.  She doesn't even care if the child is fathered by her husband just so long as it exists.Victoria Tennant is even scarier.  As Aunt Lyddia she exudes a calm demeanor as she spouts a twisted ideology.  She becomes even more terrifying as a psychotic gleam enters her eyes like when she spreads the lies that the political prisoner who is murdered by the mob of handmaids was a rapist and murderer.  Tennant conveys so much menace with a look. She is easily Dunaway's equal in the villainy department and a highly underutilized actress.Elizabeth McGovern is Moira a lesbian who befriends Kate at the indoctrination center.  She is smart and sassy and it's her intelligence not her sexuality that presents a threat to this society.  She is able to counteract their indoctrination and briefly escape her fate.  She ultimately ends up as a prostitute in a secret brothel.  The very nature of this brothel exposes the religious hypocrisy of this society.Finally Robert Duvall is the Commander one of the leaders of this state. At first he almost seems like a kind decent man.  He tries to befriend Kate and takes pleasure in her intelligence.  It's only when you see him try to justify his role in this society and the actions that were take to create it that you begin to see what a little man he is.  He is like so many figures within fascist states failures in their previous endeavors who take out their frustrations on others in weaker positions.  Despite his superior position in society the true power of the family is Serena Joy.  He lives in fear of her and probably acted initially at her urging.The other male character of consequence is Aidan Quinn as Nick the Commander's driver.  He is a more positive male figure one who loves Kate and ultimately helps her escape.  He is a rebel living undercover who is trying to tear down this society.  The question that is left open is whether he was always in league with the rebels or only sought them out after falling in love with Kate.  Quinn is fairly emotionless throughout but again it works within the context of this society.  He is probably the weakest of the cast though.I haven't read the novel although I have skimmed through it.  While the film may not be wholly faithful to the novel it does capture the spirit and themes of the book.  I saw the film first attracted by the alternate world scenario.  When I looked through the book I discovered the concept of the handmaid's names.  In the film hearing Kate being called Offred didn't register in my brain as Of Fred meaning she was his property.  It sounded like a weird name in a strange society not unlike the names slaves were given in the South or one that would be given to a pet.  That alone illustrates how chilling this society is  that they can present an evil idea in such a way as you don't connect the evil to the idea.Ultimately this is a flawed film but one that succeeds in conveying its ideas.  I shudder to think how this would have been done with an American director and a Hollywood studio production.  It clearly illustrates the dangers of fundamentalism and the stagnating force of totalitarian regimes.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film was marketed somewhat as a scifi film mainly due to the speculative nature of its society but in my opinion it's more horrific than anything from Stephen King.  Imagine a society ruled by a totalitarian theocracy and a patriarchal one at that.  Women have been reduced to subservient roles and minorities have been removed.  Environmental matters and social upheaval have left a large portion of the controlling population sterile.  To counteract this fertile women are forced to become handmaids breeding stock for those in power justified by a small passage from Genesis.  What really makes this premise scary is that it represents ideas pushed by some fundamentalist groups within this society.  Also there is enough twisted logic to almost make it seem benign but that is always the way with fascists.Spoilers Natasha Richardson plays Kate a former librarian who tries to flee this repressive state with her family.  They are caught at the border where her husband is shot and killed and she becomes separated from her daughter. She is then transported to a holding facility where she is subjected to indoctrination prior to being placed in the home of one of the society elites.  Richardson is rather low key throughout the film.  She never really seems to generate much emotion even when asking about her missing daughter. Normally this would be a problem but it works within this sterile society. Perhaps she has been so brutalized by this society she has lost touch with her emotions.  In other roles this lack of emotional range has hindered Richardson here it is an asset.Faye Dunaway is chilling as Serena Joy.  She is cold calculating and ruthless which Dunaway is an expert at portraying.  She is lost in this society where her identity entirely revolves around her role as the Commander's wife when she once held celebrity status.  She no longer has any emotional connection to her husband and thinks a child will change that.  She doesn't even care if the child is fathered by her husband just so long as it exists.Victoria Tennant is even scarier.  As Aunt Lyddia she exudes a calm demeanor as she spouts a twisted ideology.  She becomes even more terrifying as a psychotic gleam enters her eyes like when she spreads the lies that the political prisoner who is murdered by the mob of handmaids was a rapist and murderer.  Tennant conveys so much menace with a look. She is easily Dunaway's equal in the villainy department and a highly underutilized actress.Elizabeth McGovern is Moira a lesbian who befriends Kate at the indoctrination center.  She is smart and sassy and it's her intelligence not her sexuality that presents a threat to this society.  She is able to counteract their indoctrination and briefly escape her fate.  She ultimately ends up as a prostitute in a secret brothel.  The very nature of this brothel exposes the religious hypocrisy of this society.Finally Robert Duvall is the Commander one of the leaders of this state. At first he almost seems like a kind decent man.  He tries to befriend Kate and takes pleasure in her intelligence.  It's only when you see him try to justify his role in this society and the actions that were take to create it that you begin to see what a little man he is.  He is like so many figures within fascist states failures in their previous endeavors who take out their frustrations on others in weaker positions.  Despite his superior position in society the true power of the family is Serena Joy.  He lives in fear of her and probably acted initially at her urging.The other male character of consequence is Aidan Quinn as Nick the Commander's driver.  He is a more positive male figure one who loves Kate and ultimately helps her escape.  He is a rebel living undercover who is trying to tear down this society.  The question that is left open is whether he was always in league with the rebels or only sought them out after falling in love with Kate.  Quinn is fairly emotionless throughout but again it works within the context of this society.  He is probably the weakest of the cast though.I haven't read the novel although I have skimmed through it.

	schema:headline " Squalid fate for women as reproductive chattel";
	schema:reviewBody "I will only consider here the 1990 film with Faye Dunaway not the novel beyond nor of course the recent adaptation as a TV series that is not available on the DVD market.We are in the United States of America after it became the Republic of Gilead. I will not enter the Biblical meaning of this word that can be used to designate some regions of the old Biblical Israel and three characters in the Old Testament among them the father of Jephthah that crazy general who swore to have the first person coming to him after the battle if it is a victory sacrificed to God. He thus has to put his daughter to death.But that gives you the flavor of the story. In this Republic of Gilead men are absolutely dominant and they have reinstalled or reinstated the standard total submission of women to go against the total dissolution of society before due to sexual promiscuity abortion family planning contraception artificial insemination gender orientation etc. Women have to go back to their main and only function in that male dominated society to give birth to babies conceived in the normal natural good old intercourse between a man and a woman. And that's where the story becomes bizarre or even squalid. Women are like for men in Brave New World divided into clearly defined groups that have to dress in a particular color. Grey is for the plain servants. Then red is for the handmaids those whose sole function is to procreate babies with the master of the household they are attached to. White is for some kind of religious characters who participate in various rites. Maroon is for the women who are controlling the handmaids assigning them wherever they are needed and of course punishing them when necessary. Blue is for the ladies of the various households whose babies are produced by the handmaids attached to them and their husbands. All men are in black. There is a last category of women those who cannot be integrated into any category particularly as handmaids and are the girls of some parties for the masculine elite. In other words they are the escorts or working girls of the elite men of the society. The disease that is the cause of this situation is purely surreal causing the sterility of most women and those who are not sterile are used as reproductive human chattel. The film though seems to hint that the man Fred Kate the handmaid the story is centered on should provide with a child is sterile and his sterile wife Serena suggests Kate should use the services of her husband's chauffeur Nick. All that is of course sordid. During that time Fred the Commander is systematically hunting down the resistance with the clear objective of exterminating them. Today we call that genocide. Apart from Blacks and gays the concept of resisting people is rather vague and we can wonder how this elite can live if there is no proletariat even lumpenproletariat to work for them. Fred falls in love with Kate but that brings no pregnancy. Nick on the other hand falls in love with her too and she with him and that brings a pregnancy as if without equally shared love there is no pregnancy possible. When Serena learned that Fred had taken Kate to one of the elite's parties and that she had worn her own black clothing instead of her red dress she becomes furious and wants a vengeance. On the other hand Nick and Kate want to escape Gilead with their future baby.That's the dramatic knot in the thread of that story a Gordian knot actually and it will have to be cut but how and for what future?The fact that this old novel and this here old film have been remembered for a TV series has of course to do with the election of the present President of the USA. The rise of bigotry and populism in the USA today is seen as dangerous. Just the same way The Man in the High Castle an old novel stating the same type of dystopia centered on men essentially has been brought back to life by Amazon Prime this Handmaid's Tale centered as it is on women had to be brought back to life too. The present period in our globalized world is bringing up the question of refusing change and even dreaming of a full Uturn and going back to what the world was in the past the Old Testament in this case A victory of Japan and Germany in 1945 in The Man in the High Castle. The pessimist are going to say that will lead to the Third World War. The optimist will say that God or man's rational wisdom will prevail and the Singularity of Intelligent Machines will bring humanity eternal life and absolute peace with no work what so ever to do. The dream of a permanent siesta or farniente. Though it may very well be a Matrix that leads to eternal slavery and war.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU".

The point is to explain how a society like Gilead can come into being and to provide a lens for viewing that dystopia  and what a chilling view that is. The movie explores these major themes  Language as a tool of power Women's bodies as political instruments The complicity explicit and implicit of those who are oppressed in supporting totalitarianism Given the limited time of a movie A Handmaid's Tale does a remarkably good job of this exploration. As in Nazi society the oppressed are given derogatory labels Jews are referred to as Sons of Jacob AfricanAmericans are Children of Ham feminists are unwomen. These labels separate them from the rest of society thereby making it easier to persecute. The naming conventions of handmaids and the ritualized greetings they give each other reinforce their role in their society.The other two themes are intertwined. There is no way the men of Gilead could control women's reproduction unless they give some bit of privilege to a select group of women with their price for that privilege being to repress the majority of women. This strategy recalls the use of Jewish police by the Nazi Gestapo in WWII and the use of trustys in modern prisons. The Wives and Aunts serve this function in Gilead and Faye Dunaway the Wife in the household in which Offred serves gives a nuanced performance of a Wife. She is by turns indifferent and cruel to Offred but shows subtle signs of deep unhappiness with her lot. She is also covertly subversive willing to let the gardener impregnate Offred when it becomes clear that her husband cannot for the status that having a child conveys in Gilead.Robert Duvall as the Commander of the household is the only major figure allowed any individuality and he turns in a rich performance. Treating Offred like a favored slave he reveals himself as both a misogynist unableunwilling to understand the suffocation of women that his society imposes and as a lonely man a victim of the rigid roles that his society requires.Offred played by Elizabeth McGovern presented a bit of a problem for me. Portrayed as someone who is gradually surrendering to her circumstances I was surprised by the change from her as melancholy and passive to someone who is lively and passionate leading to a climactic act that seemed completely out of character. I learned that this development diverges from the source book on the which the movie is based. While I understand the desire for dramatic tension on the part of the filmmakers Offred's continued passivity in the book makes a lot more sense.Even with this flaw the movie packed an emotional punch for me given the parallels with the theocraticleaning Bush administration and Nazi Germany. I suspect that the film's cautionary messages will resonate with many Americans.".

As a result the movie does possess a certain entertainment valueproviding that the viewer chooses to regard it as a parody or spoof.

	schema:reviewBody "There are loads of excellent comments on the film by other people already here so I'll instead highlight on my opinion of its relationship with the original novel and why this causes so many problems. I feel that the film's main problem is that it's too close to the book so necessarily has to miss out lots of points because of the limited time available. That together with the fact that you're never going to get close to the imagery of the book in a naturally restricted Hollywood movie.The book while excellent with regard to its story is a slightly poor version of A Brave New World or 1984. Where the book excels is in its narrator Offred and Kate Richardson's bland stares just can't convey the horror although she was excellent in general in the film adaption  it's a lot more deeper than that.For instance would people who haven't read the book understand the significance of The Commander playing Scrabble with Offred as the book made it clear that she wasn't allowed to read so why even include the Scrabble playing scene in the film? Did we need to know Offred's real name? Why was Offred's hair crimped when she wasn't allowed face cream? The horror of the book explaining Offred's suffering and her latterly ambivalence was not achieved by stating the facts which the film did but by describing them from her perspective as the narrator the film came no way close to pulling of that difficult trick. The first time the Commander has sex with Offred was a case in point the scary part about in the original adaption was that she just didn't care  her crying in the film seemed rather cheap and much less distressing.The book was written by a Canadian first published in the UK and both nations were mentioned in the book as a safe haven for women. Also the chapter with the Japanese tourists was omitted there was a definite sense of Atwood the book's author looking down on the US which while this may not be admirable was an important factor in thinking of the story as a social commentary this wasn't conveyed at all in the film the phrase escaping to Canada from the book was replaced with crossing the border in the film. I may be wrong but Atwood as a Canadian may have been saying regarding that most Americans believe in God unlike any other AngloSaxon based' nation This is what could happen to you because you're a bit mad.' whereas the film sort of said This is what could happen if we turn into Iran' ergo the film missed the point completely meaning that Americans may thing just watching the film Yeah this is nasty but it could never happen here.'The film made it clear that it was telling a feminist story whilst the book infuriatingly but again importantly didn't make it clear. The book teased us. In the book Offred was somebody who broke up somebody's marriage had a child born out of wedlock her mother was a radical who marched for women's rights which she disagreed with so it left the question open  well isn't this what you deserve at least in the mind of some happy middle class women people who goes to church every Sunday? In fact that was the most disturbing part of the book in my opinion but of course lots of other people won't agree... that's fine!!! And the film gave us a clear disturbing and unnecessary end to Offred's story which was a bit poor the book well I won't spoil it for anyone.Basically I just didn't understand the film as it missed out all that was good from the book but included most of the boring parts which was a great pity although I concede that it wouldn't be easy adapting it properly. The film is just a throwaway Twilight Zone episode. Few film adaptions work perhaps two of the best 2001 and The Shining were good because they were so dissimilar to the book?If anyone even slightly likes the film then buy the book eh?!Sorry for ranting on for so long! Natasha Richardson was quite haunting as Offred however  she deserves top marks.Thanks!Jonathan".

Two Carthaginian sisters Lea and Esther are bought as slave girls by Roman tribune Marcus Valerius who gives them as a present to proud Julia Martia daughter of the proconsul. Ambitious greedy and vindictive Julia is betrothed to the cynical Flavius Metellus a member of the Senate but in fact she is in love with Marcus. However he prefers the simple sweetness of Lea which drives Julia to cruelty and revenge. The proconsul is murdered by Flavius Metellus who becomes his successor. Believing the Christians were responsible for her father's death Julia now the new proconsul's wife orders the persecutions to begin. Marcus is ordered to carry out the campaign but faced with the courage and faith of the Christians he realizes they are innocent. He is arrested after being betrayed by a shepherd and joins the two sisters in the dungeons. Lea is tortured and blinded after refusing to divulge the hiding place of the remaining ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the Italian epics this rarelyseen example would appear to be the most forgotten and the least acclaimed. On the face of it the film's credentials are highly impressive the story is a broad remake of Fabiola whereby a rich Roman lady is led to believe the Christians were responsible for the murder of her father. Italy's top costume villainess Gianna Maria Canale displays her customary icy exterior whilst harbouring a secret inner passion for Spanish hunk Jorge Mistral although neither probably knows what the other is talking about. Albertini's cinematography is visually stunning in rich colour which has been faithfully transferred to the Cine Epico DVD in its original 2.351 TotalScope. The sets certainly look magnificent if just a tiny bit suspiciously wooden and the costumes are top of the range. For the music score the producers have persuaded distinguished composer Enzo Masetti who also did Fabiola to return for the remake. And at the opulent palace in Tarsus we are treated to an energetic display by an African ballerina then Marisa Allasio sings or at least mimes a lovely Carthaginian aria in Italian. So with all this class around him there can surely be no way for veteran director Guido Brignone to turn out one of the turkeys of 1956? Somehow he can and he does. One could easily blame his pedestrian pace or the static camera work but the real killer blow is Brignone's failure to stamp any authority or care on the proceedings. The resulting lack of attention to detail is noticeable as early as the main title. Masetti opens with his eloquent and sombre music for the Christians labouring on the treadmill but the main title designer chooses a pretty desert sketch with palm trees which would be fine if we were watching The Road to Morocco. The heroine Lea is blinded by a whitehot sword in the dungeons and spends the rest of the picture stumbling around. However apparently thanks to some anachronistic plastic surgery in ancient Tarsus her face shows no sign of burns or scarring whatsoever. Somebody seems to have decided that Brignone's direction of one of the sword fights was too sluggish so we see it speeded up like in the old cliffhanger serials. The goofs just go on and on. Gianna Maria Canale meets her end being trampled to death by horses with earth spectacularly churning into the camera lens. But when the poor lady rolls over dead her clothes are spotless and her face has just a couple of token dabs of red paint. Towards the end Masetti runs out of time or enthusiasm or both and recycles his battle music from Attila the Hun. Ironically it's only the ending when the film really comes to life. There's a wellstaged chariot race to the beach where hero and villain fight it out to the death on the sands. Flavius Metellus up to then intelligently portrayed by fine actor Rubn Rojo elects to theatrically fall on his sword. Then against a grand choral finale the Christian lovers walk off into God's sunlight but the whole thing is ruined by the endtitle again using the HopeCrosby backdrop. One is inevitably left with the conclusion that Slave Girls of Carthage with so much talent to admire should have been a lot lot better.".

You're a nice person after all.The owner of a Danish IT company wants to sell up. There is only one problem. When he started the company he invented an imaginary boss to take the rap for unpopular decisions. So noone has ever met the 'boss of it all' until now. The Icelanders doing the buying insist on dealing with the actual boss. So he hires an actor.The actor Kristoffer or 'Svend E' knows nothing about the company and finds the buyers are not the only ones he has to bluff convincingly. Over the years he has 'sent' emails to the staff who start holding him responsible for what he has said  and of course he does not know what he's meant to have said. Ravn the real owner can't remember but there was some serious stuff going down. A hilarious screwball comedy The Boss of It All also poses provocative moral dilemmas about how a boss can use fictions to mistreat workers.Even as a comedy the film works on several levels. It starts with a basic comedy structure where we know something most of the characters don't. Kristoffer is the butt of the jokes but we want him to win. We want him to guess what he has supposed to have said and somehow turn it to his advantage. All this provides belly laughs at a gut level. Especially when he is accused of 'lousy acting' by a woman who does not know he is acting and means something else or when he 'has' to have raunchy sex with her. Even the sex scenes are convincingly real even while they are excruciatingly funny.For fans of von Trier's work there are more subtle jokes. At the start we hear von Trier's uncredited voiceover pointing out we can just about see his physical reflection. But the film he says is not worth a moment's reflection as it's comedy. It's as if someone had said Whatever you do don't think of 'x'. Immediately that's what you think about. Von Trier is the man who 'invented' Dogme95 cinema the backtobasics arbitrary rules that included 'The director must not be credited'  itself a pun on the theme of the film. Lines like Life is a Dogme film make us wonder how serious von Trier is as a philosopher or whether it's a joke at our expense. He can be a bit like the Kristoffer character who gleefully insinuates I'm better at being irritating on an intuitive level. Then there are jokes about Danes who are traditionally afraid of conflict  it is very 'unDanish to be 'bad cop' and gags that play on a historical power struggle between Denmark and Iceland. The many levels all work so fast that everyone can be laughing at something different at any one time.Structurally the movie dazzles. It gets seriously into screwball mode and then every so often the Narrator returns to inject a Brechtian distance reminding us that it is fiction making us think about how it comments on the real world or insidious office politics. We feel a tension a need to get away from serious thought and just find out what happens. The narrator bows to our desires and promises godlike to resolve the dramatic tensions. Fans of Shakespeare will recall how the Bard would use a Narrator to draw attention to what we were experiencing and so encourage us to analyse it. The Narrator in Shakespeare's plays as in The Boss of It All could be the true boss telling us what is really happening beneath the surface. And the dramatic ending will have you clinging to your seat. Hold on to your sides cos if you laugh too much you might miss something.Ever the creator of some new cinematic technique von Trier has committed the movie's cinematography to a published mathematical formula and principle called 'Automavision'. This is designed to 'limit human interference' and free the work from the force of habit and aesthetics. As with Dogme95 no doubt half the film community will ask if he is serious while another sector will go off and studiously practice it. As an added fillip Danish fans can play 'Lookey' to find hidden visual elements out of context in the movie and first winner gets to be an extra in the next film. Von Trier has also devised a new ascetic aesthetic to 'rediscover his original enthusiasm for film.' And he's tired of playing 'bad cop' in professional relationships while other people get to be 'good cop' and nice to everyone yet this master of intellectual creation has taken the experience as inspiration for the film poking fun at artsyfartsy culture.They sometimes say that if God didn't exist you'd have to invent him. Sometimes you just need to know who you are dealing with. You need The Boss of it All. At least in this film Lars von Trier credits himself as Director. Not since The Five Obstructions has the question of authorship been so seriously questioned. Even the character of the actor who wields enormous power has to consult his 'character' on how things should proceed.From such serious polemics as Dogville and Manderlay the cowboy romp of Dear Wendy the quasi philosophy of The Idiots and the serious mainstream challenges of Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves one of the most original creative forces in contemporary cinema has turned his technical genius to pure comedy. Gainsayers will still call him pretentious but they may laugh their socks off before they find out who's telling the joke.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last Sunday's cinema outing with my friends here in Rome yielded a very pleasant surprise  Von Trier's unique latest flick surprisingly enough a comedy. I've read some comments claiming that this was one of his weakest movies  I respectfully but firmly disagree. In fact I would argue that even as a comedy and thus deprived of the devices that normally make drama seem more powerful this packed a punch on a par with Dancer in the Dark or Dogville if not more. If understated power rather than human agony and melodrama layered on very thick is what you best respond to you might like Direktren for det hele more than any other Von Trier movie you've seen so far.Right from the opening shot we are made to look into the windows of a cold and desolate office building in some characterless and efficient modern suburb like hundreds of others. Meanwhile a narrator reassures us that this movie is a comedy. As such he says we are allowed not to think  to let this just be brainless entertainment. Hearing a narrator in a Von Trier movie make such an introduction you just know that what you're about to watch will be anything but mindless fun! In fact on hearing this I shifted rather uncomfortably in my seat wondering what the Master Misanthrope had in store for me this time.The basic plot When Ravn an IT company owner decides to sell his business off to a moody and irritable Icelandic businessman he hires an actor to pretend that he's the Boss of Bosses. The pally cuddly bearded Ravn vaguely reminiscent of Robin Williams explains his decision by saying that when he'd founded the company he had never felt strong and charismatic enough to take on the mantle of president. He always preferred to just blend in with the rest of the staff while actually pulling all the puppet strings. He had always told his staff that the real big boss obviously nonexistent resided in America and never came to Denmark. When Ravn eventually decides to sell the company the fussy Icelandic businessman expects the real president to sign the contact. For this reason Ravn is forced to hire Kristoffer an outofwork egocentrical actor among other things obsessed with the obscure playwright Gambini and convinced that Ibsen is a talentless hack.Naturally Kristoffer knows nothing about the company about IT and Ravn simply asks him to improvise. Cue some cringeworthy company meetings with Kristoffer talking absolute crap with one irascible employee the country bumpkin constantly lashing out at him with his fist!. Cue also some inevitable office politics involving the company's employees reacting to their newfound fleshandblood figurehead on whom they hang all their hopes and frustrations.If this sounds like a Danish version of the British TV series The Office remade also in America please think again  the movie goes well beyond milking the comic potential of a typical contemporary office environment. The wonder of this movie lies in the way in which it plays with ethical issues. I won't give anything more of the plot away as this would entail spoiling its central twists and surprises. Among other things this multilayered dark and cynical comedy which had my friends and I chatting for a solid two hours after we left the cinema is about responsibility and what it means to be truly ethical. Holding oneself accountable for one's actions  how do you deal with that when the insatiable need to feel loved and approved of takes over? The movie is also a wonderful illustration of the typical contemporary corporate environment whereby the employee is subtly demeaned in being prevented from ever putting a face to those provoking their misery on the workplace. It poses questions on what leadership really means. It shows us how a human being will become blind to the needs of others when it comes to satisfying one's vanity and emotional fragility.Naturally as a Lars Von Trier movie this is not a movie that has much faith in humanity. However unlike Dancer in the Dark it does not gang up on the viewer with its misanthropy and dramatic bullying. Unlike Dogville it doesn't present a world in which moral nihilism is the only reality. Unlike Breaking the Waves it doesn't revel in victimising its lead character. It's far more subtle and multifacetted in its arguments against human integrity not to mention that it's laughoutloud funny the whole cinema was in stitches superbly acted and truly unpredictable. I also enjoyed the cinematography strictly handheld digital camera with a purposefully rudimentary editing. Highly recommended on several different levels.".

	onyx:emotionText "Last Sunday's cinema outing with my friends here in Rome yielded a very pleasant surprise  Von Trier's unique latest flick surprisingly enough a comedy. I've read some comments claiming that this was one of his weakest movies  I respectfully but firmly disagree. In fact I would argue that even as a comedy and thus deprived of the devices that normally make drama seem more powerful this packed a punch on a par with Dancer in the Dark or Dogville if not more. If understated power rather than human agony and melodrama layered on very thick is what you best respond to you might like Direktren for det hele more than any other Von Trier movie you've seen so far.Right from the opening shot we are made to look into the windows of a cold and desolate office building in some characterless and efficient modern suburb like hundreds of others. Meanwhile a narrator reassures us that this movie is a comedy. As such he says we are allowed not to think  to let this just be brainless entertainment.

If we're going to play that way I'll take his word for it. So long overanalysis into art film let's sit back and enjoy the ride.The Boss of It All is a comedy about an actor who is hired as a proxy for any potential illwill towards the true boss of an IT company. Seems sneaky boss man can't handle being disliked and so for all this time has been telling his employees that every unpopular and bad decision is being made by the boss of it all someone he has no need to ever appear until there's interest in selling the business. The actor realizing the underhanded way the boss is mistreating all these nice people has to work out a way to set things right while not breaking any of his agreements with the true boss. Hilarity ensues.Is it funny? Actually it is and good thing too else this movie would be nothing but pure headache. Von Trier uses this process called Automavision to leave the shooting and editing to a computerized process. I've heard some say it's a comment on outsources. I say it's a bad idea. Von Trier said it himself it's escapist entertainment. If that is so then I'd like to not be distracted by the incongruous editing. And if that was just a sly joke I'd still at least like to have some good images. It is a film after all.As for the selfreflexive comedy it works a lot more when it's in the story not when it is narrated by von Trier. I think it's funny to have characters discuss literally what genre conceit or clich they should use to send the narrative in the direction they prefer. The only time it gets heavyhanded is when one character alludes to Dogme filmmakingvon Trier's preferred style that is still despite his own familiarity with it a pretty underground movement that IT workers and even method actors might not be familiar with. However nobody's going to see The Boss of It All without knowing who von Trier is and nobody's going to know who von Trier is for long without knowing what Dogme film is so I guess that's a moot point.At any rate I think this movie ends up proving an entirely different pointthat no matter what the equipment used a movie will remain interesting if it has a good story. Lucky for von Trier he has one. So by all means take his opening warning and his closing apology seriously and don't read too much into it.PolarisDiB".

The basic premise of the film is that an actor is hired on as a fictional boss conjured up by the real boss who wanted someone to hide behind. What adds a fine twist to that is that most of the employees feel that they know the boss to some degree because they have received letters and emails from him throughout the companies history leading to some very funny situations.What I love about von Trier's films is that they do not ask permission and they do not apologize for being what they are.

Von Trier is a bold artist and is the only consistently brilliant filmmaker working today.";

And it is definitely one of his least good films. If we ever find ourselves looking back at his career in the distant future this one will not be mentioned much. It's about an outofwork actor Jens Albinus who is hired by a company's CEO who is pretending only to be that company's lead lawyer Peter Gantzler to impersonate the mythical unseen boss of it all. Gantzler plans to sell off the company as well as his employee's patents to an Icelander played by Children of Nature's director Fririk r Fririksson but he doesn't want to be identified as the guilty party instead setting up this patsy to take the blame from his crazy coworkers among whom is Iben Hjejle whom you may remember from Stephen Frear's High Fidelity. The film is moderately amusing. Though many people seem to think von Trier's oeuvre consists mostly of tragedies his work is more often darkly comic. The Boss of It All isn't nearly his funniest work. The Kingdom and The Idiots are both funnier as is arguably Europa. Fririk r Fririksson actually provides most of the film's laughs as the thunderous Danehating Icelander recalling ErnstHugo Jregrd's Danehating Swede from The Kingdom. But still The Boss of It All is good even if it will eventually just be a footnote.".

Lars underlines in a voiceoff this camera mismanagement but to me it was quite annoying after a while. The second thing that makes the otherwise mainstream comedy based on a clever and very funny idea is the fact that it is oh so Danish. These northerners are very strange and funny to me I mean we are used of the American British or for me Italian or French and now also Spanish ways of making us laugh but those sad and pale faces dimly lit by the Nordic sun are so funny and different and crazy. Also the jokes between the Danish people and a raging Icelander citing sagas and verbally abusing the Danish who kept Iceland under their heel for 4 centuries are very exotic but perfectly enjoyable.

He's such a peoplepleaser he's hidden his real rank all along so the staff won't resent his more unpopular decisions. Now on the verge of selling the company out from under them he calls in a selfimportant outofwork actor Kristoffer Jens Albinus to play the role of boss of it allbe his front man by proxy to sign the papers. Lars himself pops up at the middle and end as a voice and at the beginning as a voice and a reflectionjust long enough to mock himself and us. He also makes fun of Danes for their sentimentality and giggling and chatter and because the buyers of the company are Icelandic he makes fun of Icelanders for their overreliance on their ancient sagas and their petulant rages.Americans don't take a beating this time though there's one American member of the company cadre Spencer JeanMarc Barr who's completely ineffectual around the office because he can't finish a sentence in Danish. Lars has lots of fun with actors here and of course with offices and corporate manipulations. Kristoffer has some kind of quixotic idol called Gambini whose masterpiece is a droning monologue of a chimney sweep. He puts soot on his forehead for luck when embarking on his role. As the boss previously known to staff via emails only as Svend E. Kristoffer is completely inept but the sixperson startup cadre members nonetheless react to him as if he were the real deal and are variously ready to beat up have sex with or marry him. The women act like woman with especially nice turns by Iben Hjejle and Mia Lyhne and the men act like children. They weren't even meant to see him that's just the first thing that goes wrongdue to the actor's excessive zeal he goes and introduces himself. As he gets in deeper and deeperwith zero preparationhe finds himself constantly begging Ravm for secret coaching sessions on neutral ground which includes the zoo. But these do nothing to limit his amazing ability to gum up the works for everybody especially Ravm. Things turn farcical when Finnur's lawyer shows up and turns out to be Kristoffer's exwife Kisser Sofie Grabol. Will she give away the game?This all makes a lot of sense if you've seen Von Trier's earlier film the semidocumentary The Five Obstructions 2003 in which he and his filmmaking mentor Jrgen Leth teamed up to provide indirectly a kind of skeletonkey to his mind. The Dogme filmmaking vow of chastity reflects von Trier's own masochistic Brechtian butgiven the grimness of some of his film contentsurprisingly playful need to be forever imposing new rules and limitations that challenge actor filmmaker and audience. The Five Obstructions where the director spars with mentor Leth shows that he's also an affectionate and modest tease. Although you can see my reflection this film won't be worth a moment's reflection is his personal opener to The Boss of It All.That moment's reflection von Trier says we won't need suggests on the contrary how reflexive and clever all this actually is. The film which could be seen as a sort of droll deadpan parody of The Office though von Trier says he hasn't even seen the TV series is a set of characters and premises that create their own movie just as the computer editing device does. And just as we're startled and appalled at times by the ugliness of shifting light and sound levels and pointless jump cuts the Automavision produced von Trier and his actors may have been surprised at how some of the setups turned out. Will Svend AKA Kristoffer sign over the company to the growling Icelander Finnur Fridrik Thor Fridriksson? Even he doesn't know. He has to consult his character. And that makes him like Lars a big tease. 'The Boss of It All' may be more intriguing than funnyand there will be those primed too intensely by 'Dogville' and 'Manderlay' who'll see it as merely cruel and misanthropic but it's a complete change from his recent stuff and yet utterly in character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lars Von Trier's film The Boss of It All 2006 is a successfully executed black comedy. The plot of the film revolves around an unemployed actor Kristoffer brilliantly played by Jens Albinus. The owner of an IT company Ravn Peter Gantzler has told his employers of a fictitious character who is the 'boss of it all' in order to divert any unpopular decisions made by him. When a potential buyer of his company wants to meet the owner of the company in person Ravn subsequently hires Kristoffer to act as the boss of Ravn's company. Kristoffer attempts to take on the 'boss of it all' persona in a serious manner yet he is exposed to the audience as clueless and at times idiotic. This provides much of the humour throughout the film where Kristoffer is so drawn in by the character that he and 'the boss of it all' have become one and the same. As the story unfolds the lies build and gather one after the other delving Kristoffer deeper and deeper into the continuous lies put forward by Ravn.Writerdirector Von Trier makes use of terrific dialogue through his actors. The whole cast gel together well and the way Albinus seamlessly becomes more drawn in by the charade makes for great entertainment. This film demonstrates a great example of how black comedy should be produced. The Coen Brothers surely must have taken some inspiration from Von Trier for their black comedy Burn After Reading. Both films illustrate how something so stupid and unnecessary snowballing into something taken seriously can create such great humour. The dull visuals and chopped up cutting effectively enhanced the mood of the film creating a greater sense of reality and allowing the film to not be taken so seriously. The Boss of It All is genuinely hilarious efficiently shot and well put together blackcomedic film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ravn Peter Gantzler is a Danish entrepreneur who due to an almost pathological need to be liked by everyone has trouble effectively managing the employees who work for him. To overcome this deficiency he devises an elaborate ruse one that involves hiring an outofwork actor Jens Albinus to pose as a fictitious company president whose job it will be to both bark out the orders and deflect any blowback that might come his way from the disgruntled workers. At first Kristoffer goes along with the plan convincing the staff that he is indeed the CEO of the firm and that he actually knows what it is he's talking about when it comes to implementing and enforcing company policy. Yet slowly Kristoffer comes to suspect that Ravn may not be quite as pure in heart or benign in his motives as the young actor was initially led to believe. Eventually Kristoffer has to decide just how far he's willing to go with this charade if carrying it to its completion means backstabbing the very people he's actually come to care about in the short time he's been working there.Like virtually all of Lars Van Trier's work the highly satirical The Boss of it All is an acquired taste one that demands a degree of patience from the viewer  along with a rather high threshold for pretentiousness  before it can be fully understood and appreciated. And indeed the first half of the film makes for rather rough sailing as we attempt to descry through all the verbal fog and cinematic obscurity just what it is that Van Trier is trying to accomplish. We know it has something to do with skewering the whole corporateworldmentality thing but the extreme verbosity and selfconscious filmmaking style go a long ways towards muddling the message.But damned if the whole thing doesn't somehow manage to pull itself together long about the midway point and we cruise safely to our admittedly unexpected destination. Part of the reason for the turnabout is that Van Trier is finally able to crystallize his theme once Kristoffer realizes he has a serious moral decision to make and when it starts becoming unclear which boss is really pulling the strings  i.e. who is the puppeteer and who the puppet who the scenarist and who the actor  in this oddball relationship.I've never been overly fond of Van Trier's selfconscious stylistic hallmarks  jumpcuts catawampus framing selfreferential filmwithinafilm narration  since they serve mainly to call attention to the filmmaker and to throw us out of the drama he's showing us. Still there are moments when the dark tongueincheek humor successfully hits its mark and Van Trier does a nice job dovetailing his parody of the theater into his satire on business. And the unexpected ending demonstrates that none of us is truly above selling out those we care for if the price is right for doing so.".

The operatic tragedy Dancer in the Dark would be an example. With The Boss of it All he's got somewhat of a farce on his hands. He opens the film with the selfconsciousness of a film parody and continues to interrupt in a similar fashion throughout. The story as it is follows an out of work actor into a real world setting where he is hired to play the role of the president of a company no one has ever seen. From there he's left to fend for himself with a variety of improvisation skills and kneejerk reaction.This is a challenging film from the getgo. It's arthouse to a fault. The camera framing and editing style are deliberately offputting and inconsistent the actors frequently act as though their lines have yet to arrive and the story is actually of little consequence. What Lars von Trier has assembled seems to be a statement on a business without a head honcho or more specifically what a film might look like without a director.

	schema:reviewBody "Adrien Brody will you marry me?Proposals aside once again Brody proves why he deserved his Oscar and that kiss from Halle Berry.  He gives a beautiful touching performance here as a charming rakish snakeskinjacketwearing con artist who falls in love with a girl from the right side of the tracks.  Jack Grace is no ordinary sleazeball though. He keeps a secret storage unit seperate from the apartment he shares with his partnerincrime Charlie Jon Seda where he keeps first editions of classic novels he has a penchant for Melville and works on his own novel.  In other words he's exactly the kind of bad boy that would attract intellectual Claire Charlotte Ayanna a beautiful unstable biology major at Columbia.  Claire tells him she likes movies best that make her cry and he does his best to oblige her ultimately sending her on a selfdestructive bender that makes him look like a good boy.Brody carries this film and the lovely Charlotte Ayanna is unfortunately not given nearly as much to work with. She spends most of her time alternating between trying to change him we all know how well that works and having hysterics and then finally goes on to attempt to prove that she can exist in his world and take the kinds of risks that he gets off on. The romance between the two is not welldeveloped at the beginning either so though we see plenty in him that makes us believe she loves him we don't see what has gone on between them.  Brody however makes up the slack in the script with every shot of his wonderfully expressive eyes.  He is the walking talking answer to the question Why do good girls like bad boys?Unfortunately this film only had a limited engagement at the Starz Film Center and as far as I know does not have any wider distribution.  This is a shame particularly after Brody's Oscar win this year and I hope that this will change and that more people will get to see this movie and see one of the most talented actors of his generation in action.".

There was no chemistry between the Adrien Brody and Charlotte Ayanna despite two scenes during which she sticks her naked breasts into the camera making this a horrible romance and it was also an idiot crime thriller as well. The relationship between the two main characters had no motivation. The characters most of whom just disappear after a while as if they were never important in the first place never really get developed and I'm talking even the main ones despite nearly two hours concentrating on them. Pam Grier floats around as sluggish as ever in a miscast role as a policewoman hot on their trail I guess I suppose I really don't know actually. First Claire likes Jack and he just uses her then she starts prostituting herself nearly to death and suddenly he cares then he doesn't show up one night so she slits her wrists and we think she's dead then two years later he gets out of jail and comes back to the same apartment condo squatter's crash palace or whatever the hell is still there waiting for him and they get back together. WTF? Who cares? I actually stopped watching this about two thirds through because I was so bored but then finished it the next day just out of curiosity only to my disappointment. Blah!".

	schema:reviewBody "LOVE THE HARD WAY LtHW and NOTHING TO LOSE would be an appropriate Adrien Brody doublefeature because both had me muttering Dumbass!' every time the protagonists acted like jerks. Don't blame Brody he and the cast did their best with the material they had.  LtHW was a shelved indie released to cash in on Brody's postOscar fame.  Alas this alleged romantic crime drama proves that some unreleased films should stay that way! Maybe something got lost in translation as German cowriterdirector Peter Sehr and French cowriter Marie Noelle adapted a Chinese novel into a New York story with mostly American characters.  Guess I should've sensed trouble when antihero Jack Brody wears a snakeskin jacket obviously intended to make him look cool I couldn't help thinking Nicolas Cage called from the set of WILD AT HEART he wants his jacket back!  Brody looks cute despite the cool touches which at least help make the film watchable as does LtHW's striking use of NYC locations like The Screening Room where heroine Claire Charlotte Ayanna works parttime and a former office building in the South Bronx that Jack and his partnerincrime Charlie Jon Seda call home. Jack and Charlie's world brings to mind the grimandgritty quality of 1970s NYCset thrillers or maybe it's just the DVD's dingy print . The guys support themselves with thievery and con jobs. Their female confederates play hookers luring unsuspecting foreign businessmen in posh Manhattan hotels only to have Jack and Charlie bust in posing as cops willing to accept bribes from the eagerforsecrecy businessmen.  These scams are LtHW's best bits but then I enjoy con games as long as they're only in movies!    However Jack supposedly has a poet's soul beneath his streetwise demeanor writing the Great American Pulp Fiction Novel in his spare time.  He meets cleancut Columbia University student Claire and as the apparent opposites attract the film turns schizoid.  Despite his attraction to her Jack realizes he and Claire are from different worlds  but when he dumps her angelic Claire becomes an avenging angel her words as she refuses to take no for an answer Jack's told her all along what a scoundrel he is so you'd think she'd have seen it coming  especially after catching him in bed with one of the bogus hookers! sending everyone involved on a downward spiral as I kept checking the clock to see how much longer this dreariness would go on.  The actors are fine but the script feels like a series of sample film noir scenes somebody wrote for film school not a wellrounded story with any sense of internal logic. Though Brody's acting is terrific and he looks great despite that jacket  the script and sluggish pacing defeats him rendering Jack more obnoxious and smug than sexy and charismatic.  Jack and Charlie are apparently supposed to be lovable rogues but when Claire's ex and his Columbia U. pals start a fight with Jack and Charlie at a local night spot I rooted for the collegians to mop the floor with them.  SPOILER ALERT...I cheered aloud when Detective Linda Fox finally catches the schemers redhanded and hauls 'em to the hoosegow for a 2year stretch!...END SPOILER ALERT  As Claire pretty Ayanna has a likable presence. She and Brody generate heat in their love scenes which at least perk up the dour proceedings  especially Brody's lean sexy physique!  Yum!  but screenwriters Sehr and Noelle seem unsure what she's supposed to be. Goodgirl Claire is described as complex and multifaceted but she merely comes off as erratic  first she's a jaded banterer then a sweet lovestruck babeinthewoods then a possessive selfdestructive FATAL ATTRACTION type. Then sleazeball Jack suddenly shows a sensitive side as well as literary aspirations schlepping around in a guiltridden devastated daze as Claire shoehorns herself into the hookerbusinessman scam degrading herself in every way to teach Jack a lesson.  Apart from the stupidity of degrading yourself instead of degrading the person who's done you wrong if Sehr and Noelle wanted to make a movie about such a person why didn't they foreshadow the characters' nutjob potential instead of having it happen out of nowhere?  I felt like I was switching channels between several different glum nofun movies!  Still every so often there are amusing scenes taunting us with what LtHW might've been with better writing and directing for example Jack has a tape of traffic noises with which he fools people who call him on his cell phone wondering where he is. As a writer I also enjoyed the scenes with Jack in his selfstorage space writing his novelinprogress. Pam Grier gives the film wit and style as Linda Fox the undercover detective playing catandmouse with Jack and Charlie.  When Fox catches Jack with the fauxhookers' hotel room number 1865 and tries to nail him with it the guys cover up by pretending they're history buffs Jack  1865 is the year of Lee's surrender at Appomattox.  Charlie  It was a dark day for the Confederacy ma'am.. Like Claire's loony behavior this bit of daftness comes from nowhere but at least it's funny and clever!  Another atypically breezy scene  the playful interview between Jack and future Nobel Prize winner Claire. Too bad the fun's leeched from even that scene later on when we hear a tape of it under tragic circumstances it's like LtHW hates to actually entertain its audience for long. The DVD cover screams Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody with the asterisk meaning For Best Actor in 2002's THE PIANIST.  I halfexpected to see another asterisk next to the banner 'Two BIG Thumbs UP'  Ebert  Roeper since I can't imagine why they gave this depressing mess even one little thumb up let alone 2 BIG Thumbs Up. To paraphrase Webb Wilder in HORROR HAYRIDE I gave it a finger! ".

Jack and Charlie's world brings to mind the grimandgritty quality of 1970s NYCset thrillers or maybe it's just the DVD's dingy print . The guys support themselves with thievery and con jobs. Their female confederates play hookers luring unsuspecting foreign businessmen in posh Manhattan hotels only to have Jack and Charlie bust in posing as cops willing to accept bribes from the eagerforsecrecy businessmen.  These scams are LtHW's best bits but then I enjoy con games as long as they're only in movies!    However Jack supposedly has a poet's soul beneath his streetwise demeanor writing the Great American Pulp Fiction Novel in his spare time.  He meets cleancut Columbia University student Claire and as the apparent opposites attract the film turns schizoid.  Despite his attraction to her Jack realizes he and Claire are from different worlds  but when he dumps her angelic Claire becomes an avenging angel her words as she refuses to take no for an answer Jack's told her all along what a scoundrel he is so you'd think she'd have seen it coming  especially after catching him in bed with one of the bogus hookers! sending everyone involved on a downward spiral as I kept checking the clock to see how much longer this dreariness would go on.  The actors are fine but the script feels like a series of sample film noir scenes somebody wrote for film school not a wellrounded story with any sense of internal logic. Though Brody's acting is terrific and he looks great despite that jacket  the script and sluggish pacing defeats him rendering Jack more obnoxious and smug than sexy and charismatic.  Jack and Charlie are apparently supposed to be lovable rogues but when Claire's ex and his Columbia U. pals start a fight with Jack and Charlie at a local night spot I rooted for the collegians to mop the floor with them.  SPOILER ALERT...I cheered aloud when Detective Linda Fox finally catches the schemers redhanded and hauls 'em to the hoosegow for a 2year stretch!...END SPOILER ALERT  As Claire pretty Ayanna has a likable presence. She and Brody generate heat in their love scenes which at least perk up the dour proceedings  especially Brody's lean sexy physique!  Yum!  but screenwriters Sehr and Noelle seem unsure what she's supposed to be. Goodgirl Claire is described as complex and multifaceted but she merely comes off as erratic  first she's a jaded banterer then a sweet lovestruck babeinthewoods then a possessive selfdestructive FATAL ATTRACTION type. Then sleazeball Jack suddenly shows a sensitive side as well as literary aspirations schlepping around in a guiltridden devastated daze as Claire shoehorns herself into the hookerbusinessman scam degrading herself in every way to teach Jack a lesson.  Apart from the stupidity of degrading yourself instead of degrading the person who's done you wrong if Sehr and Noelle wanted to make a movie about such a person why didn't they foreshadow the characters' nutjob potential instead of having it happen out of nowhere?  I felt like I was switching channels between several different glum nofun movies!  Still every so often there are amusing scenes taunting us with what LtHW might've been with better writing and directing for example Jack has a tape of traffic noises with which he fools people who call him on his cell phone wondering where he is. As a writer I also enjoyed the scenes with Jack in his selfstorage space writing his novelinprogress. Pam Grier gives the film wit and style as Linda Fox the undercover detective playing catandmouse with Jack and Charlie.  When Fox catches Jack with the fauxhookers' hotel room number 1865 and tries to nail him with it the guys cover up by pretending they're history buffs Jack  1865 is the year of Lee's surrender at Appomattox.  Charlie  It was a dark day for the Confederacy ma'am.. Like Claire's loony behavior this bit of daftness comes from nowhere but at least it's funny and clever!  Another atypically breezy scene  the playful interview between Jack and future Nobel Prize winner Claire. Too bad the fun's leeched from even that scene later on when we hear a tape of it under tragic circumstances it's like LtHW hates to actually entertain its audience for long. The DVD cover screams Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody with the asterisk meaning For Best Actor in 2002's THE PIANIST.  I halfexpected to see another asterisk next to the banner 'Two BIG Thumbs UP'  Ebert  Roeper since I can't imagine why they gave this depressing mess even one little thumb up let alone 2 BIG Thumbs Up. To paraphrase Webb Wilder in HORROR HAYRIDE I gave it a finger! ";

The acting is OK and it is shot well but the premise is a bit farfetched. Brody isn't physically imposing enough to carry the role and Ayanna is FAR too good looking. She would be at Columbia a month before she hooked up with the NYC jet set and as for him...I mean...who does he intimidate acting like a thug? He's about 140 pounds soaking wet holding a brick...looks convincing as a starving war refugee not as a toughguy. Would have been better if Seda and Brody had switched roles.

Love the Hard Way has a more than decent cast that works well together  Brody has good chemistry with both Ayanna and Seda and the New York of the movie has good chemistry too  it's real and beautiful without being obtrusive.  The German director and the French cinematographer may be why the town has such a fresh look in this movie.  The clothes however are obtrusively bad  it's lucky Brody has a model's body and Seda is hunky or those duds would make us laugh them off the screen. The German director's adaptation of a Chinese novel translated to New York may be a bit secondhand. Nonetheless it's not uninteresting to have a pimpextortionist who's also a budding writer  the film and the actor are intelligent enough to make us entertain the possibility of the two people in one body.  But despite various points of interest none of it quite works.I wasn't convinced that any of this stuff was realthe emotional collapse of the petty criminal the descent into prostitution of the brilliant med student or their miraculous coming together two years later after prison and a botched suicide. The trouble with the attempt to establish a hardedged milieu is that what Brody and Seda's characters are doing doesn't seem ugly enough the bedroom scams are too pat and too independent of the outside big city world of crime.  The big bachelor pad isn't mean and sleazy enough either nothing is  I can't quite believe in Brody as a bad guy.  The early scenes where Brody and Ayanna are wooing each other start him off not looking hard at all in fact he just seems like a nice cocky young Jewish boy who's full of himself and bursting with joie de vivre.  He could easily be a college student just playing tough and lowlife to seem sexy to a studious well brought up girl. His pimp clothes and pimp manner don't fit him right and just seem put on to strike a pose.You keep watching your DVD for the acting job Brody Ayalla and Seda do.  As in 21 Grams they manage to produce many powerful emotional moments even if it doesn't all meld together into a story.  The incoherence is signaled by the confused ending. This is a bit more than merely an obscure footnote to The Pianist but only just.".

The movies I like the most are the ones that show real people. I always say that reality causes emotion. We don't want to see anything fake. Well many people cry in movies because the plot is manipulated for them to do so and they just cry. In movies that come close to reality we cry because we know the things can happen or because we identify with them. It's not something we don't know. Adrien Brody plays Jack a thief. He wakes up every day probably with a girl beside him in the bed and wears the same jacket just to go out for a walk for a movie or for a heist He has two friends Charlie and Jeff or colleagues and knows two women Sue and Debbie. The five of them created a plan and periodically carry on with it and succeed. These types of persons really exist. They are lost in their lives and are always looking for a way to find themselves again. Is amazing that Jack kind of hides a passion he has for writing. He hides inside a room he has and starts to write about the things he deals with everyday. When Jack meets Claire Charlotte Ayanna he doesn't know how to act. She's very intelligent looks at him and says You're trying to get some attention. He instantly leaves but they meet again in the University where Jack and Charlie do some work. Claire has a boyfriend Fitzgerald Joey Kern and a girlfriend Pamela. The two girls are going to meet the boyfriend at a scientific presentation. This great scene shows Jack and Charlie following them and ruining things every time they try to impress the girls. They are a little ignorant in another scene when a detective asks Charlie what his work is he says African American literature until 1950 he knows that doesn't exist probably however charming enough to arrange a meeting I'm talking about Jack and Claire here at a station. Jack goes there he invited Claire and doesn't know if she's going to come. I forgot to say he has never met anyone like her. He's used to all these one night stands and never thought he would be meeting her because she went to the meeting.That same day they both have dinner and talk for a while. She's trapped by him because she has never met anyone like him. She tries not to stare at him. He tells her as they're going to his apartment You're in love with me. She answers No I'm not I have a boyfriend. You're not now he replies. But you will be. They both have sex that night in a beautifully shot scene with anticipations that seem to be coming from someone's mind. What happens next is part of their daily lives. It can be good it can be bad and that is the best about it. I have a lot of personal experience. He explains that everything is like a box and is always the same so I know what I'll probably find in it. And what about this box? Claire says referring to herself. Do you already know what's inside or you want to open it and take a look? This movie is wonderfully directed edited and of course written. You get involved in it you want to see life. The score is amazing and the team made an excellent work in finding every different song with its style and lyric just to explain each scene of the movie. Every frame is connected in every possible way.We shouldn't forget the actors. They all do a good job. Some are important some are just there but they have to be.I don't consider Adrien Brody a great actor. I think he knows how to choose a role and that he chooses it because he wants to play it. That's good enough. Now I'm going to praise his performance in this film and don't hate me for the things I'm about to say. He voices Jack with a humanity that makes him unique. He looks at people with a simplicity that makes Jack a real being. He walks with steps that define a performance. He won an Oscar for The Pianist a movie I didn't find a masterpiece as many say. Maybe it's because of the Holocaust which has been used over and over for movies. Roman Polanski is a fine director and in my opinion he directed a fine movie. Going back to Brody hate me now but he probably deserved that award although his performance in The Pianist isn't as good as his Jack in Love the Hard Way. I just found all the elements and the ones that make him shine in this performance.His manners and movements are part of the body language that wraps this wonderful portrayal. His character made me think about Mark Ruffalo's an excellent actor Coles in the also real and compelling XXXY. The kind of character that doesn't know his feelings because he doesn't feel anything at all. I can't love anyone Jack says to Claire looking directly into her eyes.".

I even enjoyed the initial back and forth of I love youWho are you againI love you. But when we got to the Claire is a bloody whore part of the film I just fell a bit a apart.Not to mention there are glaring holes in the logic of the film. Just because two guys are friends doesn't mean they'll get assigned to the same kitchen in prison.

And in fact to be screwing guys without condoms in NYC for several months before her beau was bagged? All I can say is AIDS AIDS AIDS. When they fastforwarded two years forward I expected him to show up at her funeral plot not to meet the successful scientist doing well without him.Decent acting. Decent plot. BIG PLOT HOLES.".

But when we got to the Claire is a bloody whore part of the film I just fell a bit a apart.Not to mention there are glaring holes in the logic of the film. Just because two guys are friends doesn't mean they'll get assigned to the same kitchen in prison.

The script doesn't actually explain how Jack Grace became the way he is. The sketchy details about his background he provides Claire could be a figment of his overactive imagination.

Everything about him  from his leopard pleather jacket to his studied swagger  is sleazy. Everything about her  from her Ralph Lauren clothes to her idealized notions of love  is innocent. She tries to get closer to him but he pushes her away until his games push her over the edge.

Adrien Brody is excellent as Jack a conmancumpulpfictionwriter who falls for a biology graduate student with a selfdestructive streak. Played with intensity by the daring Ayanna. Everything about him  from his leopard pleather jacket to his studied swagger  is sleazy. Everything about her  from her Ralph Lauren clothes to her idealized notions of love  is innocent. She tries to get closer to him but he pushes her away until his games push her over the edge. Though some of the characters  including Claire's tough loyal best friend  and dialogue are nothing new a fresh soundtrack wellacted supporting cast and unglamorous portrayal of New York City vice made this film stayed with me for weeks.";

It is a documentary on the Grande Chartreuse cloister situated in a deep valley above the city of Grenoble France. A couple of dozen monks live there. There are novices on probation and seniors long having made their vow of permanent ascetic life. The rhythm of their daily cloistered routines is the backbone of the film frequent prayers meals eaten alone in individual private apartments execution of assigned chores etc. From Monday to Saturday few words are exchanged. The only sounds are those of human movement work activities church bells and chirps from the surrounding forest. The only music to be heard is that of liturgical evening chants.Not every aspect of monastic life is covered. As the director explains this is not an informational film. It is a long contemplation on ascetic life. It may seem too long after two hours. The tedious repetitiveness is purposeful however. Even onthescreen quotes are shown multiple times throughout the movie accentuating that repetitiveness. It is enough to convince us that it takes a special individual to commit to such constrained existence one modulated only by the moods of the seasons. We are presented with snapshots of odd moments monks frolicking in the snow preparing a vegetable garden for spring seeding a summer Sunday outing when monks are free to socialize and on this day they discuss the appropriateness of washing one's hands before meals a contrarian monk has a simple solution don't get your hands dirty.Despite the isolation there are signs the outside world is not too far. Fruits are served with supermarket produce number stickers still attached correspondence and bills arrive and managed with a laptop computer no evidence of an Internet connection and some of the tools are distinctly modern.It's a quiet film.

The message is simple and repeated over and over again because the contemplative life is simple and they spend their days trying to grasp that which cannot be grasped Grace and God. This movie is a must for those who think that Catholicism is too mystical. It clearly describes the simple beliefs of the contemplative life that as one abandons one's attachments to things and the material world one is seduced into the nirvana of religious enlightenment. During the final scene with the blind monk an interesting comment is made on body sculpting plastic surgery and other techniques that make one appear younger than one is.

He structures the film in an unscathed and natural way both accurately capturing the monks' daily routines yet also flowing by seasons. Each season has its own pleasures which range from the playful walks of the monks in spring and summer to the moody yet harmonious miseenscene of the winter. Sublime to its very hushed core Into Great Silence does take some getting used to specifically because the monks hardly utter a word the beginning of the film is a four minute opening shot of a monk praying in his solitary room. It is after this however that the film resembles true life itself rarely have documentaries portrayed such an unhurried sense of time yet all of the film passes faster than you wish it to each minute counting to the very last.Grning's masterful shots of the Grand Chartreuse are let alone one reason that elates the film yet more than a placed and planned camera the shots almost resemble spying. It is undeniably true as weird as it may sound that the monks have gotten used to the camera. Months go on and they blatantly ignore it which only goes for the better. In what follows Grning takes us through more than just the random praying of the monks but also of them playing there's a scene of the monks going sledding cooking eating and sewing all daily activities of the monks excluding the playing aspect. One need not be religious or even agree with the existence of god and the fact of locking oneself in a monastery to enjoy a film of this caliber. Nevertheless Grning has created a film of its kind the type that will keep you thinking and enjoying its quiet pleasuresonly through simple imagesfor a long time yet also one that could gratify film lovers without a limit to its quiet sense of aptness.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've often pondered which sense would I rather lose sight or hearing. I had decided sight would be the one to live without since music has the power to make me weep often. But Die Groe Stille has made me rethink all of that. It's a pointless game anyway but I reexamined the importance of sound in my life versus the magnificent ravishing images put forth in this film.Like the works of Frederick Wiseman it's less a work of cinema than a window that Grning offers. We watch seemingly arbitrary action both mundane and ecstatic. We're not told who these people are as individuals nor why they have chosen to wall themselves off from the world's joy and suffering. But as we watch the pace of the film is slowed so that we enter this world and test our own thoughts about human contact as well as faith. But only if you're so inclined. There's no proselytizing.At one point late in the film one monk chides the world for living without God and you immediately think How would YOU know? And immediately we see the value of silence. In silence we don't argue or plead complain or preach. We simply live with our thoughts and here the brothers seem very comfortable with whatever it is they are thinking.Through repetition and ceremony we enter the serenity these men have found. And while there's beauty in the physical aspects of both the natural world in its changing seasons as well as the cloistered setting it's the tranquil beauty of faces that rivet. We meet them as individuals only in a series of live portraits where their eyes stare into the lens through the camera and into our souls. If I didn't have my sight I would have missed that and been lesser for it.For me this was an amazing experience. But for others in the theater it was tough evidenced by squirming and the occasional snore. Surprisingly it was the younger members of the audience who seemed most entranced.".

We watch seemingly arbitrary action both mundane and ecstatic. We're not told who these people are as individuals nor why they have chosen to wall themselves off from the world's joy and suffering. But as we watch the pace of the film is slowed so that we enter this world and test our own thoughts about human contact as well as faith. But only if you're so inclined. There's no proselytizing.At one point late in the film one monk chides the world for living without God and you immediately think How would YOU know? And immediately we see the value of silence. In silence we don't argue or plead complain or preach. We simply live with our thoughts and here the brothers seem very comfortable with whatever it is they are thinking.Through repetition and ceremony we enter the serenity these men have found. And while there's beauty in the physical aspects of both the natural world in its changing seasons as well as the cloistered setting it's the tranquil beauty of faces that rivet. We meet them as individuals only in a series of live portraits where their eyes stare into the lens through the camera and into our souls. If I didn't have my sight I would have missed that and been lesser for it.For me this was an amazing experience. But for others in the theater it was tough evidenced by squirming and the occasional snore. Surprisingly it was the younger members of the audience who seemed most entranced.";

The life of these monks isn't sensational. It's quiet. It's about small things and a lot of prayer. Furthermore it is a good idea to read up a little find some information about the Cartusians and their way of life. The film itself will not give much facts and figures about its subject matter  it's an experience more than a film. But when you do have the right frame of mind an open and patient mind you're in for something extraordinary. Although the Cartusians have the reputation of being the most strickt and austere of religious orders I was pleasantly surprised by the 'lightness' of the film. One one hand there is the silence and the long hours of prayer and labour. One the others hand there's the cats the cows the Sunday afternoon conversations and the snowy slopes ideal for sliding down on your bum. Both sides of the monks life are being presented with pleasant serenity. These men are happy you can tell. And I was happy when I left the cinema these afternoon.".

	schema:headline " Lord You Have Seduced Me And I Was Seduced!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've just awakened from a beautiful dream. Before I slept I came from an Italian restaurant in which I was with my business manager and we talked about various subjects and we gossiped about our personal lives and feasted upon a sumptuous meal. Before we went to that Italian restaurant we were in Santa Monica's Nuart Theater and feasted upon a very poetic mesmerizing entrancing seductive and breathtaking film.INTO GREAT SILENCE is not for the popcorn flick fan. If you're into blockbusters and that's your taste then you probably won't like this film. You must be a staunch art house filmgoer. You must be a sophisticated film watcher to truly appreciate this film. Your taste level for film must be at a higher level to enjoy this film with little ease. But if you're not any of those and you surrender to this film you will have no doubt a poetic mesmerizing hypnotic sensual introspective and breathtaking experience.As the story goes in the early 1980s Philip Groning contacted the Roman Catholic Monks of the Carthusian Order which was founded in 1084 by St. Bruno of Cologne. The Carthusian Order is reportedly one of the strictest orders of the Roman Catholic church. Although they don't take a vow of silence the Monks speak only when absolutely necessary and once weekly on walks outside their monastery. The Monks told Groning it was premature and that they would contact him when the time was right. They got back to him nearly a decade and a half and told him they were ready. He was told that only he could enter the monastery and that he could only use natural light. He was also told that there be no musical score or soundtrack. And on top of all that he was told that there would be no interviews and commentaries. With all those restrictions however Philip Groning says that those did not affect his intentions for the film. So he spent several months living working and filming over 120 hours of life in the French Alps in the Great Charterhouse of the Carthusian Order.Lord you have seduced me and I was seduced. I wouldn't call INTO GREAT SILENCE a documentary because the film INTO GREAT SILENCE is an experience. It plays on every sense and it entrances you into using your intangible senses as well. It lives up to its name as there is hardly any dialogue and interviews. And there are absolutely no commentaries and voiceovers. You don't hear a human voice until 20 minutes into the film. But the rare human voice in the film makes you appreciate the sounds of nature that surround that quiet place in the French Alps. You experience the poetry of the sound of the snow falling melting and dripping. The sound of bells tolling and rain dropping creates a melody. And the sound of Monks footsteps are like a serenade. But the Gregorian chants sung by these Monks are so hypnotic haunting and entrancing that it seduces you to surrender to their world.And the film supplies a cinematic visual buffet. This film must be seen on the big screen. There is not one single frame in the film that can't be a featured photograph in some art museum. Every shot stimulates the eye which in turn stimulates your heartbeat to a rhythm which makes your body participate in that GREAT SILENCE. The occasional flashes of Bible verses Lord you have seduced me and I was seduced and Anyone who does not give up all he has cannot be my disciple. Create a time of pause for one to reflect.The narrative of the film follows several Monks. One of them an African novice who gives up everything he has to join the order. Another a young Monk who has given up everything he owns and is new to the order. But how much did they really give up? We are reminded of the outside world by a single airliner flying above. And to contrast the silence of the Monks we glimpse tourists or pilgrims from afar. The film also follows an elderly Monk who takes care of the garden and grounds and a blind elderly Monk at the end of his life. When one watches these Monks and is drawn into their life one sees the joyfulness of their penitence. The rhythm of their life is as entrancing as the Gregorian chants they sing. The peaceful serenity of their world and surroundings does indeed seduce one.The film does not aim to preach or teach. The film entrances you to experience the world of these Monks as they honestly are. Weather you agree with them or not one sees the sincerity of their prayer work mass rituals and meal as poetic innocence. One cannot help but experience personal joy as these Monks slide down snowy slopes with their shoes. And while these Monks do give up everything they own the nature that surrounds them are so breathtakingly priceless that one longs to stay in that peaceful serene place in the French Alps.INTO GREAT SILENCE is indeed a cinematic experience much more than a film documentary for entertainment or educational purposes. The almost three hours of rare dialogue had a very loud and clear point of view. This is how the Monks gave up everything so that they can be God's disciples. And this is how God seduced them and why they are seduced. This is the world of the Monks of the Carthusian Order. The almost three hours although slow were needed so that one could immerse in those French Alps with those faithful Monks. And admittedly in the later part of the almost three hour film I was fidgeting. But when it was done. I had wanted to experience it all over again. Lord you have seduced me and I was seduced.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you can sit still for the nearly three hours of this film it's almost guaranteed to bring down your heart rate maybe make you want to spend more time in the high mountains or in the snow or contemplating spring flowers in some isolated place. Into Great Silence Die Groe Stille is a documentary of unusual austerity and beauty like La Grande Chartreuse itself the Carthusian order's central monastery high in the French Alps that German filmmaker Philip Grning has recorded. His film is steeped in a unique atmosphere there is no narration. To have provided any would have interrupted the prevailing silence that is characteristic of the place. This method  the withholding of all commentary  can work fine for a documentary especially where there is a lot of dialogue as in the recent highly admired Iraq in Fragments or where the activities shown are familiar such as the classroom scenes so meticulously filmed in tre et avoir To Be and to Have an unnarrated chronicle of a rural French elementary school. But lovely and calming as Into Great Silence is it preserves the atmosphere at the cost of failing to penetrate its subjects' inner lives. How well can we ever understand spirituality? But above all how well can we understand it from visuals without any words describing the inner experience? There are other specifics that Grning who was forced to work virtually alone and without any artificial light chooses not to detail. A monk's life is rigorously organized but here that schedule isn't specified. Editing flits about arbitrarily between shots of monks praying alone or in the chapel external landscape shots shots of wood being chopped food being prepared or delivered to cells snow being shoveled robes being made heads being shaved books being read at cell desks. And there's an initiation ritual plain chants poetically blurry closeups of candle flames or fruit. There's even a moment of laughter and high spirits when a group of younger monks slide down a hillside in the snow in their boots without skis or snowboards. Bells sound and the monks bustle about from one activity to another but according to what system is left to the imagination. In one shot a monk sits in front of a big desk strewn with bills and documents. He just stares at them. What does it mean? Several times the succession of scenes is interrupted with a short series of shots of individual monks staring into the camera wordlessly of course. There is one long shot of a monk who may be dying. He too stares into the camera. These moments are rather spooky. Despite the presence of prescription eyeglasses shoe goo electricity for lights and an electric razor in the Razora room  even despite wood stoves in the cells the sighting of a single radiator  the place has a thoroughly medieval feel and that's spooky too. Every so often in large letters there is a saying of Jesus such as He among you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be my disciple flashed in French on the screen as in a silent film and these are repeated randomly. But again is this randomness appropriate in depicting a life that is anything but haphazard in its structure? After an hour the film shows that the monks though they lead daily lives that are silent and isolated except for chapel services do also get together on Sundays for a communal meal followed by a walk and a chat rain or shine. When given this opportunity they don't analyze the world situation. They discuss minutiae of the order's regulations. Later a blind old monk with impressive downdrooping eyebrows is the only one to address the camera directly. He speaks of blindness and death describing both as welcome gifts from God one received another still to come.There is a significant omission. This place begun in the early eleventh century rebuilt in the seventeenth produces a famous liqueur whose sale supports it but we don't see the monks doing this work. Grning says the process is too complicated and would distract from the rest. Distract from what? From the effect he wants to create not from a picture of what the place is about. Grning underlines the uniquely rare opportunity he's sharing with us by explaining at the end that he asked for permission to film in 1984 but was held off from doing so till 2000. Maybe he thought since he had to wait so long he should make a long film. But the extra time doesn't mean deeper insight. At most it is the prolongation of a mood. Rather it seems an outgrowth of the random editing system an unwillingness or inability to cut or to organize. Offputting and tightlipped though this film is it will no doubt stand as one of the more distinctive of recent documentaries. But it inspires as much irritation as reverence. It's not utterly clear that Grning is the ultimate guide to this world  or to any world for that matter.There are many paradoxes and ambiguities in a monastic existence. The Carthusian order is austere. Its life is one of renunciation and penitence. In this austerity there is a certain luxury. The monks choose it willingly. If they can stick with it many apparently don't it is what they want an ideal setting for the uninterrupted contemplation of God. And it is a peaceful life a safe life a life cut off from the worries of cities and families and all uncertainty. Monks don't prepare their weekday meals in their cells any more they're brought on a cart.

And in today's time where almost everybody writes a book about almost everything it shouldn't be a problem to find out. But I had no luck so far until I have seen this movie it's really a documentary.This movie was shot on a single small camera I'm no expert using the light that was available at location. Some of the shots are very grainy see above I'm no expert those make a very dramatic effect. And apparently it took 16 years for the monks to grant the filmmaker permission to film. And even then only on his own no artificial lights.The film has almost no dialogue no need to learn Latin to understand the movie and is almost 3 hours long. The camera freezes on a certain scene like somebody in prayer and stays there for a few minutes and then it goes to a different scene. I was especially impressed by the recording of the changes in the seasons. The beautiful location somewhere in France is highly suitable for that type of movie. Large amounts of snow followed by birdsong and lots of greenery in summer. Combine that with a tremendous ability by the filmmaker to compose the pictures and you are in for sensational treat.But it doesn't stop there for the film takes you into the Monasteryi doesn't look in from the outside it tries to look in from the inside. This is not a documentary telling us How to be a Monk in 10 easy to follow steps. It rather explores the silence and the solitude. One of the repeated shots is of a red candle flickering inside a glass no noises whatsoever just the red glow using a tele lens. Other shots are of monks in deep prayer or engaged in their other activities.The film doesn't explain why these people choose to live a life like that. Nor does it explain the level of selfsufficiency. But what it does explain is the material sacrifice and the related spiritual freedom.I know that I am not the only one in today's society to suffer from the stresses of 21first century life and the constant noises of our cities. And probably from the breakdown of moral and ethical values in our society. I admire the monks that they are able and committed to that kind of life. It certainly appears to be a lot more difficult than to choose which TV channel to switch on or other mundane tasks.I always considered going into monastery as a step too far. Not anymore now but I fear it is still a step too big for me.A final note this movie lasts for about 3 hours and it is a very encouraging way to assess your levels of patience and consideration and several people walked out when I watched it. But the reward is exceptional I came out a slightly different person. And even if you are not interested in Religion or Monasteries the photographic value of this movie is more than anything I have ever seen before. The shot selection and composition is outstanding !".

Both those who value the film and those others who aren't impressed by it have contributed worthwhile and valuable comments.Before I make some observations of my own I would like to recommend to those who intend to see this film that they see the film when fully alert  no heavy drowseinducing meal or drink make sure your toilet needs are taken care of etc. There were times during the film when I felt that catching 20 winks would do me more good than watching every frame of this slow film  but that's because I was tired and had had a huge meal only a few hours before. So be prepared.Concerning the desire to take a little nap during the film even though I am not a religious person at all  but still know quite a bit about Catholicism  I had to recall Christ's admonishing Peter for not being able to stay awake with him in the Garden of Gethsemani. Watching those monks praying in the film I could only wonder how they could do it for a lifetime while I had to struggle to stay awake for only a couple of hours. It made me chuckle at how appropriate the comparison was. It also made me grin as I tried to figure out whether any particular monk was praying  or dozing.As numerous reviewers here have noted the film is almost a collection of stills no pun intended but stills which nevertheless have meaning such as in a painting. For example if you do not know that the candle in the small red glass holder hanging above the altar is the traditional way of indicating the presence in that place of the Holy Eucharist for Catholics the actual body of Christ you won't understand why the film maker shows so many shots of it even when it's flickering in the distance. Likewise seeing a monk's cell if fine but if you want to know more about it  and many other things too  you might first want to read a book such as Nancy Klein Maguire's AN INFINITY OF LITTLE HOURS or visit the links on her web site which provide many facts about the Carthusian way of life including the petty problems that are blown up out of all proportion when such a small group of men live in such close proximity to each other. It also may be that most viewers would not be aware that the film depicts not only the monk priests but also the nonordained working brothers  some of whom take vows others of whom do not  who perform the monastery's manual labor.Ultimately though I kept coming back to the question of whether or not such a strict monastic life was worth it whether giving up the world in order to live in a cell and meditate and pray was anything other than the waste of a life. What if they are wrong about God? I certainly recommend the film. See it when you're rested and wide awake.".

The nearly 3 hours that I quietly followed the life of the monks at the Chartreuse monastery actually had a positive effect on me. I felt as if I had been able to momentarily diminish if not completely shut out the noisejunk in my mind. I woke up in the morning feeling a certain lightness and calmness which can only be attributed to having watched Into Great Silence.The night before I had mixed feelings about the documentary. For one thing it had seemed especially long and uneventful even for a patient viewer. Yes the photography was nice and it was interesting to peek into the lives of these monks. But I had expected to learn more about their traditions their philosophy and even their routines. I also resented the detachment that I felt from them throughout the film's duration. I kept asking myself what was going on in their heads. Had they actually learned to dissipate what some call the mind's internal dialogue? Or were they perhaps suffering in silence? As I watched the movie it was frustrating to observe them for so long and at the same time somehow be so far removed from them.However the peace that I felt the next morning helped me arrive at the conclusion that it's not the individual monks or their religion that the film is mainly about but the Great Silence that they share. Yes we observe these people carrying out their vow of silence and their daily duties in what one would guess is a state of contemplation and extreme serenity. But this is only a medium. I believe the goal of the director is to serve as a bridge between the Great Silence and the audience even if only for an instant.".

According to the synopsis the movie is supposed to show rhythms the flow of time the change of seasons and more. If this is the goal then it fails badly Watching the movie one gets the impression that the seasons at La Grande Chartreuse are winter spring early summer and winter. This is unsurprising since most of the shooting occurred in the spring and summer of 2002 but I still felt cheated when there was no autumn between early summer and winter. As for rhythms I never really got into the groove because the pacing seemed haphazard the slow flow of the daily routine of the monks kept getting interrupted by timelapse shots of sunrises and sunsets that always threw me off this may be a matter of taste though.Other aspects of the movie confirm this general sense of halfbakedness. For instance we meet two novices who are introduced into the monastery but we don't find out whether they actually go on to become full members. We see a gardener sowing some seeds but we don't see the harvest. We see other activities cooking sewing garments in their early stages but we don't see them come to fruition. The absence of the time of harvest is so pervasive throughout the movie that I'm wondering whether it's intentional. I don't see what purpose this might serve though.Finally I feel that the movie does a disservice to the monks it portrays. They have to stare into the camera a lot and most of them come across as an insecure fidgety bunch. Few of them exhibit the sort of serenity you'd expect from someone who's living a life of silent contemplation. I figure that they are merely being selfconscious because they are not used to being on camera but it still seems to me that the director should have found a way of making them feel at ease.Summing up the director took a great idea a silent meditation on the life of Carthusian monks and a great opportunity a filming permit at La Grande Chartreuse and he botched it.

It pretends to be a meditative movie but in my opinion seeing others meditate is just simply very tiring especially after 2 hours or so...initially I thought wow there is so much beauty to be seen here and I really love silent movies or movies with a slow pace but this one just goes way to far. I caught myself at wanting this to finish much earlier than it actually did.

It pretends to be a meditative movie but in my opinion seeing others meditate is just simply very tiring especially after 2 hours or so...initially I thought wow there is so much beauty to be seen here and I really love silent movies or movies with a slow pace but this one just goes way to far. I caught myself at wanting this to finish much earlier than it actually did.

His big joke is to go to the bathroom and come back and whisper What'd I miss? Because in these films nothing happens. The other movie like this we went to was Our Daily Bread at the New York Film Festival. In both films we see unmoving camera shots with real sound. Just whatever happens to occur in front of the camera during that time. Then a new shot . . . then a new shot. Maddening really. The real error was the producer at the Hamptons Film Fetsival who introduced the film by saying it was a three hour film about a silent monastery. Not exactly motivational. So from that point my husband was seething so it was hard to enjoy for the hour that we stayed. I guess these occur as a response to both the shaky handycam cinemaverite style and the massive use of cgi and digital compositing. These films stylistically guarantee that what you see is exactly what was in front of the camera unmanipulated by the filmmaker. For surely no one could create anything quite so boring. It must have really happened. Bonified verite. Yet I really did despite my husband enjoy both for the time we stayed. They'd be great to have playing in the background during a cocktail party or a meditation session. Beautiful.".

But that's it.Running well over twoandahalf hours the film could've easily been cut by half and still held the same level of immersion. Too many lingering shots on monks kneeling in prayer monks praying in the dark with the red candle of God everpresent monks walking through hallways monks sitting near windows and just an otherwise tremendous amount of overly indulgent quiet from the production standpoint. I know that the title has the word silence in it and that these men take a vow as such when they enter the monastery but I think a bit of interaction explanation or some sort of definitive purpose would've made the film much more enjoyable.Before I get plowed asunder by those that enjoyed this film let me make it clear that I understood the nature of it.

We have all tried to hang on to a girl who when in perspective we look back and think what the hell was I thinking? I am sure that girls have had the same experiences in their lives.

How predictable can it get. And yet this movie isn't completely boring but at times even quite funny and David Krumholtz and Milla Jovovich have the kind of chemistry that you need for this type of movie and which makes it still quite entertaining. If you're in the mood for something that doesn't require thinking and you don't mind the cliches then this one might be worth renting some time.Only thing that baffled me though was how someone can remain stuck up on Denise Richards while meeting Milla Jovovich who is about 10 times as beautiful. It would've taken me about 10 seconds to forget about Richards. Oh well. Must be me.".

How predictable can it get. And yet this movie isn't completely boring but at times even quite funny and David Krumholtz and Milla Jovovich have the kind of chemistry that you need for this type of movie and which makes it still quite entertaining. If you're in the mood for something that doesn't require thinking and you don't mind the cliches then this one might be worth renting some time.Only thing that baffled me though was how someone can remain stuck up on Denise Richards while meeting Milla Jovovich who is about 10 times as beautiful. It would've taken me about 10 seconds to forget about Richards. Oh well. Must be me.";

David Krumholtz who I barely knew from a short apparence on The Mexican impressed me a lot with his deeply heartbroken and friendly character. I'd say a must see for romance lovers.

It was the continuity of the scene that seemed not right that he showed no emotion about what may be going on inside. The conversation about stars the couple keeps having was seems to live in a world of its own like a story inside a story. These things are what I'd expect in a sitcom or soap opera. The dialogues here go by very fast often without leaving the audience to sink in the words. There are a few points to the movie but they were hard for me to remember for most things said didn't seem to add up to anything. I rented the movie for I'm a huge fan of Milla and expected to be impressed by her performance nonetheless. That I was. Somehow she managed to pull off the ridiculous jokes and coy punch lines. I hope that someone else makes a simple comedy with Milla in it but takes some time to write it and even keeps less dialogue but more camera work to express a point because Milla has the skills to pull off a very quality movie which this sadly wasn't.".

I spent money on this because it starred her and I don't regret that she gets to show some of her best features if you can tolerate it this is worth watching for us fans of her. The acting is pretty good especially hers. I say the following without any bias of a single cast memberwell I only knew the main four Her performance and the part of Nadine were the only thing in this that made me carenear the conclusion when she got to add a third dimension to it. There is plenty of strong language and brief sexuality in this. The DVD comes with 4 trailers. I recommend this solely to others who love seeing Jovovich in movies and to fans of the genre who don't care what level of quality they're getting. You know independent filmmaking is such a perfect way to express that which you won't be allowed to in mainstream pictures... why bother putting together something runofthemill? 510".

Full blame can go to Brian Burns who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. The situations develop completely without any inner logic besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts behave stupid and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We don't believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the onehour mark is particularly pitiful. Why would anyone fall for a egocentric selfobsessed arrogant bch like this in the first place much less a second time? Especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? And if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the Richardsone but it is to no avail. There is no chemistry no spark nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. Worse these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in whatsoever.Overall a very poor showing. Even diehard romcom fans might want to pass on this one as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm.".

Denise Richards does not appear in those black leather pants or in any outfit that is particularly hot. On the other hand 2001 was the absolute peak of her attractiveness.

Many of my friends associated her with the movie Resident Evil or the The Fifth Element saying Oh Milla the one who kicks the bad guys. But Personally I am not a fan of Resident Evil but I do like a lot The Fith Element and perhaps Ultraviolet. Here in this movie YSM Milla played an ordinary girl that is single and tries to win Owen's heart an ordinary yet naive young man. She does it so well that we almost believe it really happened to her and all her emotional feelings are so well expressed. Sometimes is not that easy playing a role that reproduces a real person who can be any of us. So I think some of us would really find ourselves among the characters more or less. This is definitely my favorite Milla Jovovich film. But I hope changing my mind in the future when I'll see a better one.".

The dialogue didn't seem scripted at times it felt like they had a cameraman just following them around and seeing what would happen. The magic really happens once Jovovich hits the screen if anyone ever criticized her acting ability then they really need to see this movie. The way her and David Krumholtz chemistry come together really made it seem like they really disliked each other and at times really loved each other. Denise Richards does a great job portraying the confused girlfriend who has yet to come to terms of who she really is and William Baldwin balances things out by playing the rude over the line older brother who doesn't really give a crap about rules. How the story plays out is rather interesting but once things get complicated it kind of blands out for a bit. Luckily not for long. Overall a great movie whether you're on a date or just relaxing at home. I don't say this very much but I really really enjoyed this movie.1010 that's the final word".

	schema:reviewBody "This excellent drama accomplishes the difficult task of being quite earthy and often grim in the ways that it depicts its characters and their lives yet at the same time being an ultimately uplifting story about the possibilities of human understanding. It also features a fine performance by Louise Brooks. Her performance in Diary of a Lost Girl is on a par with that in Pandora's Box her other celebrated collaboration with G.W. Pabst.The story has Brooks as a pharmacist's daughter whose young life is drastically changed by events that she can only dimly understand. From then on she must endure a variety of trials while gradually learning some important lessons often with only the barest help from those around her. The role contrasts nicely with her role in Pandora's Box. Both in that film and in Diary of a Lost Girl she has the same level of energy and appeal but in the former movie right from the beginning she was very much the catalyst for the other characters' actions while here she begins as an innocent youth who is completely at the mercy of all of the others and then grows as the movie proceeds.The settings are wellchosen so as both to contrast with her character and to develop it. Her experiences show many aspects of the seamier side of both human nature and human living and yet this is by no means a mere gratuitous display of sordidness but rather a growing experience for Brooks's character. It culminates in an uplifting finale that is all the more effective for having arisen from material that is by no means idealistic.The expressionistic style in the photography lighting and sets enhances the atmosphere and also the effectiveness of the story and the characters. The slightly stylized nature of both works quite well and all of this contributes significantly to the high quality of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The comments submitted are from Josh76's Dad Dan47 I found this film to be deeply moving. Louise Brooks portrays the innocent Thymiane with such pathos that I wanted to reach out to the screen and rescue her. Unlike most films from this period there is no rescue in the nick of time. Events follow an inexorable nightmare pattern as Thymiane the victim is condemned to imprisonment after being raped and impregnated by her father's employer. Abandoned financially and emotionally by her selfish father she can only fall into prostitution after she escapes the home for wayward girls. I couldn't help being reminded of The Magdalene Sisters another film where girls are blamed for the lustful acts of their attackers and seducers. Louise Brooks expresses more with her eyes then most actors do with paragraphs of dialogue. Even during the giddiest parties in the brothel she expresses desperation despair and regret with rare subtlety. Despite its' age and the lack of sound the film stands up well. The presentation is not overly sentimentalized though the enduring goodness of the Thymiane and her eventual redemption might stretch the imagination. In an age where human trafficking is running rampant we could use an actress of such beauty charisma and sympathy to portray the continuing plight of girls and women driven into the sordid life of prostitution.".

	schema:reviewBody "The is the best film that Louise Brooks made. It is far better than the overlong Pandora's Box and the more I have thought about it the stranger it seems that Dairy of a Lost Girl should not be more famous than its overblown predecessor.The fame of Pandora's Box is attributable to the image and presentation of Louise Brooks as an archetype  not unlike a mannequin or fashion plate for a generation of 'liberated' German girls. Diary of a Lost Girl is forgotten despite its artistic superiority and the revelation that Brooks was not just a sensational beauty but a very fine actress to boot. In most of her films Brooks was called upon to pose and perhaps to smirk  and she did it very well but she was not asked to do any more which might have explained her mounting frustration with the American movie business.After she completed Pandora's Box she sailed back to the U.S.A. perhaps expecting to be treated with greater consideration by the Paramount executives who had been driven to distraction by her uncompromising selfish? working methods. The long suffering managing executive B. P. Shulberg offered her a much higher salary in order to turn her last American silent The Canary Murder Case which I have not seen into a talkie. Oddly she viewed this as an insult and treated Shulberg with undeserved contempt. Having destroyed her relationship with Adolph Zukor's Paramount she returned to G. W. Pabst in 1929  she presumably hoped that HomFilm would be a more accommodating employer. Accommodating that is of her increasingly erratic and temperamental work habits which were lubricated by a heroic consumption of alcohol.Pabst obviously had a great affection for her who wouldn't even allowing for her often lamentable behaviour? and he famously remarked on the last day of shooting that 'Your life is like Lulu's and you will end the same way'. That was almost prophetic and her failure to register to Pabst that she was in any way aware of the consequences of her folly was discreditable. So when I look at a film as good as Diary of a Lost Girl I am as conscious of her striking ability as I am appalled by what she threw away through sheer wilful arrogance. The story by Margarete Bohme caused a great scandal in 1905. It replicated the tale of the baroness Elsa von FreytagLoringhoven who committed suicide in 1927. It was not just the subject a very candid treatment of prostitution that revealed a sordid and  worse still  undisciplined underbelly to Wilhelmine society but the outspoken attack on the reformatory system on the conditional and de haut en bas nature of charitable provision and the strong suggestion of feminism that was highly offensive in a rigidly paternalistic social system.Attitudes towards manners and morals changed emphatically with the establishment of the Weimar regime and Bohme's novel was first filmed in 1919. A decade later and having established herself as a poster child for sexual liberation the role of Thymiane Henning seemed ripe for fresh treatment by Brooks.Brooks performs the role of the wronged daughter who has suffered a 'fate worse than death' at the hands of a repellant apothecary's assistant an excellent performance by the great Fritz Rasp brutal treatment at a reformatory more great stuff from Andrews Engelmann and a sadistic Valeska Gert  a differentiated reprise of the Sapphic character of Countess Geschwitz played by Alice Roberts in Pandora's Box to further disappointments in the brothel etc. The entire ensemble turns out a first class performance and Pabst and Sepp Allgeier ensure that the photography complements the power of the story.".

And like no one else probably could now that movies have filled out all the sensory space they can. And we have come to expect information in those channels.For instance can you imagine a movie today just showing people dancing? No story information no bizarre or comic behavior to amuse us just people dancing. This has three or four such scenes.I'll leave it for others to speculate on how such an on screen presence happened to be possible except to say that much must come from the nuance of the eye all the things associated with the camera and its context. I pay attention particularly to placement and movement here not obviously novel but intimate nonetheless.What a woman! Between she and Clara Bow  these two women alone  we changed.But the other reason I put this on my must watch list is because of the sheer virtuosity of the filmmaking.Realize that the hardest thing for a filmmaker is to start. How do you begin? You have to create a world a feel a system of mechanics and fate. You have to create a situation with context and characters. You have to have a story with events and pull. All this you need to build in a couple minutes and do it in such a way that the viewer is not only fully familiar and comfortable but swept along she begs for more.Pay attention to the first few moments of this. If you haven't seen it dear reader remember that this is a silent movie that there is no rolling text to tell you what is happening and there haven't been several months of previews that tell you the whole darn story.In just a few minutes you learnIt is christening day for Thymiane whose name we learn and as a gift from a livein aunt she gets the diary from which we know what we see later will be drawn.We learn that she is the daughter of a successful chemist who lives in an opulent house above the pharmacy. That below lives an assistant chemist who is obsessed by sex. We discover that she has a bossy set of relatives who turn a blind eye to her father's dalliances.And that one of those dalliances impregnates her governess who then kills herself. Meanwhile the downstairs chemist has designs on the young girl and makes the first entry in her diary.The story is off.I dare say that there is no other movie in existence that conveys this much information so compactly and so directly. The way it is done today is by reference to other movies. You enter today's movies with all sorts of tacit knowledge about other movies that is recalled and activated by codes. Here it is all done the old fashioned way cinematically.Ted's Evaluation  4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.".

It is far superior to Pandora's Box in my opinion. Louise Brooks plays Thyamin a young innocent who is raped by her lothario father's chemist assistant.  Her pregnancy results in her banishment from the house and she is placed in a reform school.  Her escape from the institution leads her to a brothel where she spends her life until her father's death...when her life changes. Unlike Pandora's Box which is about an unredeemable nymphomaniac Diary of A Lost Girl is a story about loss redemption forgiveness sacrifice and hope.  It has a much richer plotline sublime cinematography and Louise Brooks shone like a star.  This film itself is a rediscovered treasure. Highly highly recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw Pandora's Box several years ago.  At the time Diary of a Lost Girl was unavailable for viewing.  I discovered it had been re released on DVD completely restored.  It is far superior to Pandora's Box in my opinion. Louise Brooks plays Thyamin a young innocent who is raped by her lothario father's chemist assistant.  Her pregnancy results in her banishment from the house and she is placed in a reform school.  Her escape from the institution leads her to a brothel where she spends her life until her father's death...when her life changes. Unlike Pandora's Box which is about an unredeemable nymphomaniac Diary of A Lost Girl is a story about loss redemption forgiveness sacrifice and hope.  It has a much richer plotline sublime cinematography and Louise Brooks shone like a star.  This film itself is a rediscovered treasure. Highly highly recommended.";

I haven't seen the film in its original form so I can't make an accurate assessment as to whether it unspools a bit more quickly simply due to projectors of the era or the way it was filmed  the point is this watching a movie such as this Pabst classic now adjusted to a more realistic pace does seem to make one appreciate them more in a strangely contemporary context. Though we still note the differences in clothing and appearance of the people they all seem more identifiable somehow. But I swear I spent a few minutes wondering if I had stumbled onto a contemporary silentfilm imitation of some type! Oops! I experienced something similar recently when watching a screening of Murnau's Sunrise  the film and its characters somehow transcended their era. Though part of me wonders if that film also had its pacing adjusted technologically there was a human dimension to it that made me push aside any preconceived notions of silent cinema and just enjoyed it as a tale well told beautifully filmed and amazingly acted. This film has the same effect  though I think it was actually I who transcended my era by experiencing it.".

	schema:headline " The Perils of Thymiane in a World that Threatens to Smother Her Light";
	schema:reviewBody "Leaving Hollywood was a gamble for Louise Brooks who had by the end of the Twenties reportedly grown restless with the studio system and had traveled to Europe. There she became involved with a trilogy of movies and director G. W. Pabst on two of them starting with PANDORA's BOX in Germany and culminating in France with PRIX DE BEAUTE each considered essentials in her alltoobrief body of work. DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is the second collaboration between Brooks and Pabst and it's hard to point which one of the two is visually stronger. Both contain elements of strong German Expressionism. Although where the former was drenched in dark images the latter had a more cerebral darkness closer to the moral fabric of Margarethe Bohme's sordid story.It's also hard to say in which one of the two Pabst films Louise Brooks looks better because in both she has extremely modulated performances way ahead of her time dismissed when they were released rediscovered over the years. Where in PANDORA'S BOX Brooks had that one remarkable scene where she seduces the doctor who's taken her in as the doctor's son walks in on them rendering her sensuality to that of a cool Goth dominatrix thirty years before Bettie Page in DIARY as the innocent Thymiane Henning she's seen as a virginal survivor. Clearly the camera loves here even more here as her dark looks give way to an ethereal beauty looking for her inner woman while a world filled with dark people threaten to quench her light out.It becomes an outrage of almost mythical proportions when Thymiane falls from grace due to actions outside of her control in searching for the truth as to why a beloved maid has decided to leave the house she falls into the sexual trap of her father's assistant Meinhert. Nine months later she gives birth to a child but because she refuses to marry Meinhert she is sent to a reform school where she is stripped of her elegance and forced to become an automaton under the uberstrict iron hand of both Directors of the reform school. There she also befriends another girl Erika with whose help she escapes. Going back home proves fruitless  she learns her child has died. Having nothing to hold on to she tracks down her friend Erika who is now working in a brothel for a madam.It's here where life warms up to Thymiane as she slowly joins the land of the living. However an encounter with her family leads to heartbreak when they see what she has become. Even so she marries into wealth as her father dies and leaves her nothing and Meinhert tries one last time to trick her into coming back home and is finally able to help the other girls who still live in oppression at the reform school as she denounces its evils.DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is all but a dark affair. Despite the lurid elements of the story it's extremely compassionate as heard by the nearambient score and those close ups where Louise Brooks' transcendent face fills the screen and serenely communicates a myriad of emotions at key scenes differentiate it from PANDORA'S BOX where Brook's Lulu was always seen in shadows and was essentially a fallen woman spiralling down into tragedy. For the time it was considered scandalous and erotic  if anything its eroticism is implied more than seen. The scene where Meinhert seduces Thymiane is charged with a huge amount of electricity as is the scene when the stern headmistress is banging her drum to a beat she only knows as the girls exercise. Hers is an ugly performance typical of predatory lesbians preying on girls they can't have and it's one that can't be unfairly considered stereotypical.Time has proved to be kind to the Pabst's masterpiece. Storywise it's still contemporary in many ways  it's no different than the story of PALINDROMES in spirit. There are moments of weirdness such as when Thymiane drinks liquor at the brothel and gets loose as the clients and other prostitutes watch or the bizarre exchange between Thymiane and her male client. The delicacy in which the darker aspects of the story are handled elevate it from being a merely exploitative film and there is one haunting moment when a male client tells Thymiane We're all lost. It's a tender scene of solidarity within a world that only sees such woman as tainted and men as lecherous. A historic movie that should be discovered by people looking to find the roots of subtle acting and subdued drama.".

Context will be valuable. That is because Pabst does not set out to impress on the scope of Lang or Murnau who impress easily and you may be fooled that he's pretty ordinary. Not so. I rate him as the top German filmmaker of the time the man had a truly subtle  humane touch that cut deep.It may seem as pretty ordinary this one. It's melodrama about a hapless young girl who is neglected and abused unwanted pregnancy forced marriage reformatory prostitution. It is a journey of maturity that takes her through many worlds most of them depressing. DW Griffith would have done this in somber  sanctimonious tones. Chaplin could do it frivolously with a bit of kindly fate in the machine of sorrow. Pabst did it another way and it's his way that most likely has influenced our contemporary understanding of cinematic melodrama as something quite pure and sophisticated.That sophistication is seeking ways to deliver both the redemptive story and many ways different paths to reason and emotion some of them shrouded in dream and seems to have carried on from here to Sirk to elsewhere and Lynch.I want to devote this comment to all these items of let's say peripheral narrative vision. You can read up a description of the story in the other comments.There's Louise Brooks for one exquisite beauty even among movie queens of the silent era. But Pabst was sensitive unlike Sternberg in Blue Angel he doesn't frame her for sex trusting the male gaze to work the usual way anyway. Brooks both here and in Pandora's Box is a spirited  swanlike creature.There are four worlds that she travels through possibly more. Each one revealed by the treatment of sex. The first is the parental nest sex is covert yet the tryst with the maid and she is a sheltered child naive and innocent of finer implications around her. The film begins portentously with a suicide and a man promising truth of the story. In a roundabout way he does by exploiting sexual vulnerability.The second world is at the reformatory it is a simplistic world with stock villains matron  guard where expressions of sexuality are forbidden. Here others administer decisions and she only has to obey the story. It is very much a stepdown into childhood but in a way that is painfully clear to her in the parent's nest she had illusions of freedom. A revolt is staged and she escapes.What she doesn't know is that she escapes to a highclass brothel. We find out as she does when an envelope full of money arrives the morning after a night of drinking merrymaking and sex. But  as sex enters the picture  so this is a world now where people are ambiguous figures not always villains. Here a creep looking for sex is repudiated only for the kind protector to assume his place this man has noble aspirations to save the girls but he'd much rather have a good time. He's a bit of a hypocrite but it would be a puritanical stretch to think him bad. Here she learns to endure and persist.Now for the best part. The narrative is on the top level in the form of excerpts from a diary. But you will note steadily the introduction of more and more subtle visual dislocations from the ordinary. That male gaze mysteriously lulls her to sleep both times she has sex. Both times it's against her will both times signify a turn in the gear of the world. The second time is accompanied by the bedroom door inexplicably opening ajar by its own self and then the lover and a sedated Louise in his arms waltz into frame. It's a heady  seductive shot.It's obvious what Pabst is getting at  she succumbs to the role expected of her  but in doing so succeeds in demanding from us a different set of reasoning tools for the rest of the film. There are several more shots of her asleep in the hands of men as though dreaming her whole ordeal. Dance is a main thread and wrapped around the recurring notion of deciding the depth of your performance.That different set of tools is at the same time as the world around her changes and demands each time a different response getting to note semiconscious spillovers inside of her.This aspect of the work is amazing. Look how in both the reformatory and brothel she is part of a chorus of girls usually framed with two or more girls hovering beside her and it's that chorus instead of just herself that is experiencing the story as though part of that fragile self has splintered by the trauma and each splintered self has taken mirrored shape around her to shoulder part of the pain. compare to the brothel scenes from Inland EmpireThe fourth world is having learned to cope and that allows her to return to the early stages of the story starting with another scene of dance and frolicking by the beach and eventually save one of those splintered selves from the same fate.Something to meditate upon.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second G. W. PabstLouise Brooks collaboration comes close to equaling its predecessor in terms of depicting a world in moral decay through the plight of a fallen woman. Brooks' acting is slightly weaker at the beginning of the film where she struggles to portray her character as a naive youngster. She becomes far more convincing as the film progresses and her character grows.As with Pandora's Box there is a somewhat lurid atmosphere to this film with each major character acting in their own sometimes depraved selfinterest. For instance one of the overseers at the reformatory confiscates a girl's lipstick only to apply it to his own lips when he is back in his office. As with Pandora's Box it is tempting to read this as symbolic of the decadent moral climate of Weimar Berlin. The general theme of rising and falling fortunes sometimes due to one's own actions and sometimes due to events beyond one's control must have spoken to Depressionera audiences though.The diary features prominently as a device early in the film but is forgotten towards the end. Perhaps as Brooks' character has grown she no longer feels she needs it but this is not depicted clearly. Rather it seems to have simply been forgotten.The Kino edition of this film has a beautiful very moving score that fits the scenes incredibly well. In fact it is the best I have heard for any silent film.Ultimately this film is on a par with Pandora's Box. Both are wellexecuted melodramas that reflect the seediness and decadence of the era and Brooks' acting is refreshingly modern in each.".

The general theme of rising and falling fortunes sometimes due to one's own actions and sometimes due to events beyond one's control must have spoken to Depressionera audiences though.The diary features prominently as a device early in the film but is forgotten towards the end. Perhaps as Brooks' character has grown she no longer feels she needs it but this is not depicted clearly. Rather it seems to have simply been forgotten.The Kino edition of this film has a beautiful very moving score that fits the scenes incredibly well. In fact it is the best I have heard for any silent film.Ultimately this film is on a par with Pandora's Box. Both are wellexecuted melodramas that reflect the seediness and decadence of the era and Brooks' acting is refreshingly modern in each.";

I easily identified with the daughter characterand who wouldn't want to identify with the most beautiful woman you'd ever seen I still think that. The injustice she endured changed her from a vulnerable happygolucky girl into a hardhearted survivor.

If you have fatherchild issues this movie may be as cathartic for you as it was for me. One caveat when watching silent filmsyou have to remember how long ago they were made they may seem laughable because they're so different and some of the acting is exaggerated because not long before film began all acting was done on the stage and had to be read at the back of the house.

	schema:reviewBody "While it was common during the silent era for Europeans like Greta Garbo and Rudolph Valentino to cross the Atlantic and make it big in America Louise Brooks as was her nature went against the grain and headed in the opposite direction where she made it big in three European films two directed by G. W. Pabst. Of the two Pandora's Box is the better film but Diary of a Lost Girl is the film that made me fall in love with the girl in the black helmet.Diary doesn't have the sure hand of Pabst's direction in Pandora but it does have a story and characters that are more easily accessible. And though I feel Pandora is one of the greatest films ever made it took me a few viewings to recognize the scope of its originality. And Brooks' character Lulu though fascinating and exquisitely performed is somewhat impenetrable.Thymian the character Brooks plays in Diary is an innocent caught up in circumstance and the social mores of her time. The very nature of her character makes us care what happens to her. Without resorting to cloying sentimentality Pabst manages to create a character in Thymian that gets under our skin emotionally even when she succumbs to manipulation by others. Big spoilers in next sentence so skip to next paragraph if you haven't seen the film After being raped giving birth to an illegitimate child and sent away by her family to an institution for delinquent girls then losing her baby and becoming a prostitute Pabst keeps us rooting for her to succeed in life however she chooses.Pabst's effectiveness is due in no small part to Brooks' performance. Her detractors have suggested that she wasn't much of an actress just a pretty face playing herself. Yet all anyone has to do is see the two Pabst films back to back to realize what different characters Brooks created from two in many ways similar roles. I do not see an ounce of Lulu in Thymian. If Brooks was channeling just herself she had some far ranging personality facets to select from. But whatever she was doing I'm just very glad it was captured on film.I prefer not to say much about the plot of this film because there are some nice surprises throughout and though I've checked the spoiler box for this comment because of the brief description of what happens to Thymian I don't want to spoil the film's wonderful twists and turns for those who happen to read this.Technically the film is beautifully shot and although it doesn't possess the dark atmosphere of Pandora it does have it's own distinctive look via locale set design and some spectacular camera moves particularly a wonderful shot that follows Thymian up a stairway. The secondary characters particularly in the girls institution are far more caricatured than need be and the humor is overdone in spots but none of that detracts from the unusually forward story being told. Like Pandora the film is ahead of its time. And although Pabst did not shoot the ending he wanted I find the ending used one of the most satisfying things about the film.See this film and fall head over heels for the girl in the black helmet.".

	schema:reviewBody "Liza Minelli's character in Cabaret 1972 looks so much like Louise Brooks that you have to wonder if Minelli didn't model her look after the famous silent film star.Diary of Lost Girl puts the drama in melodrama. Brooks stars as a young innocent thing who's life goes a bad direction when she's introduced to every vice the world has to offer. Name a vice and it's in here sex booze dance gambling. It's like a public service message as broadcast by the Christian Coalition. It's a cautionary tale about the evils awaiting innocent souls and it's pretty hard to take by the time the film has neared the twohour mark. However it's redeemed by a finale in which Brooks decides to devote her energies to helping other lost girls by truly understanding their plight rather than cow them with moral fire and brimstone.Brooks is beautiful but she's not much of an actress at least not as evidenced by this film. Her Thymian what a name! is a blank slate and Brooks's reaction shots more often than not catch her staring at the camera with little or no expression on her face. Thymian is a girl who just lets things happen to her so it's hard to muster up the requisite sympathy to really care about her plight. What's more interesting is the peripheral action always going on around her. The middle section of the film which takes place in a home for wayward girls captures some of the most entertainingly bizarre moments I've seen in a movie for a long time. The home is run by a butch dominatrix who leers lecherously at the girls while they eat soup and works herself into what appears to be a sexual frenzy when she forces them to perform nightly calisthenics which consist of the girls flopping over at the waist and then standing up again quickly over and over like fish gasping for oxygen. There's also a looming tall bald man who looks like he could have auditioned for the role of Lurch who we see playing the piano one minute and gripping young girls by the backs of their necks the next. The best scene in the film comes when the girls turn on these two and begin pounding on them to the beat of a drum making one wonder why the girls didn't do this much sooner since there are about twenty of them and only two of the caretakers.People not familiar with preCode cinema and European preCode cinema to boot may be surprised at the adult subject matter in this film nudie postcards lesbian overtones premarital sex even a shot of a pregnant woman gasp!. It's always a reminder of just how straightlaced movies became in the years shortly following the advent of sound.Diary of a Lost Girl is longer than it needs to be and doesn't exactly take the subtlest approach in its storytelling but then what silent film ever did? If you like silent films you will probably at least enjoy this one. If nothing else it provides a nice introduction to Louise Brooks and the onscreen charisma that made her a star.Grade B".

The best scene in the film comes when the girls turn on these two and begin pounding on them to the beat of a drum making one wonder why the girls didn't do this much sooner since there are about twenty of them and only two of the caretakers.People not familiar with preCode cinema and European preCode cinema to boot may be surprised at the adult subject matter in this film nudie postcards lesbian overtones premarital sex even a shot of a pregnant woman gasp!. It's always a reminder of just how straightlaced movies became in the years shortly following the advent of sound.Diary of a Lost Girl is longer than it needs to be and doesn't exactly take the subtlest approach in its storytelling but then what silent film ever did? If you like silent films you will probably at least enjoy this one. If nothing else it provides a nice introduction to Louise Brooks and the onscreen charisma that made her a star.Grade B";

But at the same time this film is not just witty it's GOOFY with broad comic scenes that skirt the ridiculous in a way that challenges you from left field  dare you laugh at a silent masterpiece when it presents a spoiled aristocrat failing to milk a cow or a horny bastard one of several with a Kropotkinesque goatee mincing around the dance lesson like he's in a Dwain Esper movie?

Well.wouldn't you??  Geraldine Page has quite the green thumb as Mrs. Claire Marrablethe wicked widow with the pine tree fetishin the chilling thriller Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice?Grand dame Bette Davis once quipped Fasten your seatbelts it's gonna be a bumpy night!  Bette you are so right!  If you remember Geraldine Page as the sweet li'l ol' lady from Trip to Bountiful'.FUGETABOWTIT!  Page does a 180 as she transmogrifies from helpless Southern widow to  cool calculating murderess with money and murder on the brainand a means to achieve both. Page hits the bullseye with each scene.  All of her nervous ticks are appropriately timed.  She is at her best when putting on airs and verbally sparring with unarmed opponents.  What a stellar performance!

She's a woman believing her husband has left her penniless who moves to Arizona where she will be near her nephew. But she's intent on hiring lonely housekeepers and murdering them to steal their savings. Not unlike some reallife events depicted in a gruesome TV documentary recently.

I first watched this film at age the age nine when it was released theatrically it was actually more enjoyable than the supposed bigger picture of the double feature! It is very obvious that Geraldine Page relished playing her role of Claire Marrable she's totally awesome so witchy and naturallike in her acting technique. Ms Marrable is a rather narcissistic woman who goes through an astonishing array of household help. Enter Ruth Gordon a sly fox who comes to Marrable for a position in her lovely desert home. Once hired the viewer is in for a tourdeforce game of catandmouse. Played to the hilt this little sleeper creeper is most enjoyable.".

Why pack up and move to Arizona to be near your nephew and begin killing housekeeperslivein companions for their life savings of course.  Aunt Claire seemingly has a green thumb as she transplants her housekeepers to the ground and plants a pine tree over them.  As we see in the first part of the film there are at least three pine trees before we see the first woman bashed in the head with a rock and then planted. We then see another housekeeper Edna Tinsley killed in similar fashion with a shovel.  Now five pine trees in the desert.  Enter Mrs. Dimmock a woman in disguise as a housekeeper out to find out what happened to her longtime friend Edna. This cat and mouse relationship between Claire and Mrs. Dimmock serves as the basis of the film.  This film was produced by Robert Aldrich who was responsible for bringing us films like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? and Hush..Hush Sweet Charlotte.  Aldrich made films that had older female protagonists popular in the sixties by giving these starring roles to ladies that were a bit aged and considered passe.  Geraldine Page stars in this film as Aunt Claire and if you had any doubts about her talent as an actress prior to seeing this film no doubts should have remained afterward. Page is simply stunning.  She has an aura and charm about her.  She has a wonderfully sadistic and maniacal laugh.  She has an ability to take dialogue which would not work for any one else and make it sound meaningful. Her portrayal of this wicked cruel greedy woman is one of the best I have seen for roles of this ilk.  Aiding Ms. Page is Ruth Gordon.  Ms. Gordon gives a very good performance as Mrs. Dimmock out to find the truth no matter what the cost might be.  Gordon and Page act and interact very well together and it is their relationship which really makes this film work. The rest of the cast is okay and the direction is okay but everything is brought up a notch by the two outstanding performances of these two incredible actresses.  After seeing this film twice in two days I am still stunned at the magnificent performance given by Geraldine Page. WOW!".

In short What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? is a deliciously twisted tale of greed and murder filled with plenty of suspense real atmosphere rock solid acting witty writing and some of the darkest humor put on film. It's a real winner from start to finish. And while I'm sure I could go on and on praising the film it's the acting that sets it apart from similar movies. To call Geraldine Page's performance brilliant would be a gross understatement. The gleeful menace in her voice and on her face as she goes about psychologically torturing and killing those see sees as beneath her is amazing to watch. And if her presence wasn't enough along comes Ruth Gordon. She's feisty fun and every bit the equal of Page in her role as the titular Aunt Alice. Watching these two spar when all the film's secrets have been revealed is one of those moments I won't soon forget. These are the screen moments that keep me searching out new movies.Nobody asked but if I had to come up with one flaw I suppose it would be the supporting cast.

This was an independent film. Although it wasn't one of ABC's television movies it quickly became a favorite on the the 'Movie of the Week' lineup because of its suspense factor. It still creeps me out to this day. Nobody can play disturbed female characters like Geraldine Page! She even starred in an episode of Rod Serling's 'Night Gallery'.The irony of the film is her finding out that she didn't have to go through all that trouble to keep living comfortably. Turns out that her late husband's stamp collection  that she used to bribe the next door neighbor's son  was a lot more valuable than she thought. I absolutely loved this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really crazy about this film when I was a kid and it would show up on t.v. late at night sometimes I still don't know why. I even sought out the book by Ursula Curtiss that it's based on. For some reason a movie about a hateful old woman who badgers and then kills her housekeepers takes all their money and buries them in the backyard and laughs about it really spoke to me as a kid.I saw this again recently and was reminded that overall it is basically a lowbudget 70's t.v. movie. It's slow and sometimes tedious. There's no gore or swearing and the action is minimal. It's depressing and even kind of sad and the Arizona location shots while beautiful leave you feeling dry and dusty inside. The acting is acceptable enough the subplots are peculiar what's up with the one lady with all the makeup wanting to start dramas everywhere? the whole logic behind the plot is debatable could this have really happened? But there are really only two reasons to keep returning to this movie Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon! Geraldine as Claire Marrable is beyond over the top as a woman who has lost everything she held dear her money basically and devises a grisly way to continue living the good life. It's a tricky situation for a movieClaire is the one we're going to follow through the whole movie yet she's a thoroughly despicable character at least on paper. And yet the way Ms. Page plays her there's a hint of vulnerability underneath the captivating madness and her bullying ways. This is a woman who never had anything to begin with and so she has nothing to lose by being evil cruel and even homicidal. It's hard not to feel for her when she's being read her husband's will or in the final scenes where she still refuses to give in. On the other hand if you have a somewhat black heart it's hard not to appreciate the obvious joy that Claire feels every time she succeeds in committing another murder. Who hasn't occasionally wanted to silence an annoying neighborhood animal? Claire is a living ego selfish childish irrational and pitiless and she's the film's hero. It's dark territory to explore and this movie dives right in without timidity.Then there's Ruth Gordon as Alice Dimmock the only one who could possibly be a foil to Claire. Ruth is...well just Ruth! If you've seen her in any of her other films you know what to expecta feisty dominant little old lady who doesn't take crap from anyone. She's always fun of course and she has some great moments here. It's unfortunate that her role is so brief and never takes off but the few moments when Ruth gets to be Ruth are amazing and satisfying.Overall this is a dark nasty little movie very typical of a lot of late 60'searly 70's filmscynical morally ambiguous ugly to look at and think about and without an easy conclusion of affairs. Not something to race out and see but a decent ride to go on if you happen to be in a dark and quiet mood and have the time for a movie about old ladies fighting each other...".

It's quite obvious that she's meticulous when it comes to the care of her garden...  This movie was very intriguing as a result of Clara's sharp witand even sharper tongue.  To tell you the truth the only reason I stuck with the movie was because this woman had such a badas attitude!  She probably should have been a Marine or somethin'...  I estimated that this movie was filmed during the midsixties based on the clothing which was worn.  Even then for a woman especially one of her stature to be as assertive during that time was rather unusual to me.  Clara's character was very masculine with all the delicate matronly little touches that make her every bit the upstanding societal pillar of a lady she pretended to be. Don't get me wrong this movie was a little bit weird.  As it starts it's hard to understand where it's all going and how long you're going to have to sit there and wait for something to happen...  Luckily something's always on the brink of happening so you shan't get too bored.  And really if you want to learn how to be a shrewd individual you'd better sit down and watch this movie and be sure to take a few pertinent notes  Geraldine has the act DOWN. Her portrayal of this coldhearted Mrs. Marrable is really what makes this movie the sleeper that it is.  I mean everyone pretty much assumes Technicolor productions from the sixties are gonna have fabulous psychedelic qualities to them like Man is that tree really GREEN or what?  Lest we forget the halfbaked acting A'la Valley of the Dolls...  To a degree this movie is no different.  Clara's demonic attitude social grace and charm keep you on your toes as you really don't know what she's going to do next.  Don't be fooled by the packaging or the era from which it came.  This is a pretty decent flick if you like suspensethrillers...".

Unableand unwilling to cope with poverty Mrs. Marrable solves the problem of living up to her station by inviting a succession of women into her home to work as housekeepers and later murders them for their private incomes. Mrs. Marrable's plan works quite well until she makes the mistake of eliminating Miss TinsleyMildred Dunnock whose suspicious friend Mrs. Dimmockthe delightful Ruth Gordon promptly arrives at the Marrable residence to apply for  a position as the next housekeeper and potential victim.

Considering she lives in the middle of the Arizona desert it's not surprising she's not been caught. You soon learn that nasty Clare has made a habit of this sort of thingshe kills off her servants and steals their savings. While you cannot get rich that way Clare deals in volumeand obviously she is out to add to her growing collection of bodies in the yard. The next one it seems is Mrs. Dimmock Ruth Gordonthough you aren't terribly sure who is actually hunting who.The film has quite a bit going for it. Geraldine Page's performance is ridiculously florid and overthetopand her scene stealing actually adds to the fun. The plot is also really cool. However the film also has TONS of plot holestons. They are especially apparent during the huge and very violent confrontation scene between Page and Gordonand the scene was VERY awkward and ridiculous. Overall while certainly not a great film it is VERY entertaining...in a lowbrow sort of way.".

As in Gilliam's film this Mnchhausen is a magical character but it is not the magic you find in a modern animated Walt Disney spectacle it is a magic with a dark side a magic that can threaten and seduce and corrupt.  Mnchhausen himself comes across as an ambiguous character charismatic and heroic but by no means cuddly and lovable.As a result this is more a fairy tale for adults than one for children and the full original version with nude harem girls sexual innuendo etc. wouldn't have passed the American censors of its day and probably still get an R rating today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone should do a book on the making of this one. It might represent the best blindsiding of the Nazi regime by artists who had scores to settle. I'm always amazed and grateful it made it past the censor. First the writer Erich Kastner was blacklisted a Jew and had his books burned by the Nazis. But they were SO desperate for a good writer they got him on board for this. You sense they wanted world distribution....even down to the product placement shot of a Munchausen children's book Albers is holding before the flashback. Hans Albers the Brad Pitt of his day was forced to give up his Jewish girlfriend Hansi Berg and work for the Nazis. He sent her money in London all through WWII. She made it out in '38 escaping with her Dad. Dad Eugen Berg was not as lucky. He got caught and sent to the camps. He died there in '44. Kastner's script pokes fun of ALL authority and embraces life itself and urges the viewer to wake up and take it all in before it's too late the Baron turns down power to enjoy life and always has time for a good meal or a hot date. The photography is excellent the KINO restoration the one to get..Carnival in Venice is wonderful to see and you find bits of humor and wit and set decoration that survived to the 80's version..but there is a haunting melancholy air to this version even when everyone is enjoying themselves...the writer knows too quickly everything can just GO and you're best to enjoy what you can while you can. I sometimes see a sad long look in Hans Albers eyes...is he wondering if he would ever see his gal again? Does he KNOW where her Dad is? What does he THINK of the Nazis?? As it was Kastner lived to 1974 the richest of the lot when Disney made his two most famous books Parent Trap Emil and the Detectives into movies. He is the only cast member who's name is associated with a Lindsay Lohan movie. Hansi came back to Hans and they lived together until Albers' death in 1960. She died in 1975.".

The production values are of a very high order and the Technicolor photography is sumptuous to the eye. Remarkably there is no National Socialist propaganda in the film and the War is never mentioned.In the title role Hans Albers gives a surprisingly sensitive performance for such a robust production. He takes the legendary character and gives the viewer a portrait of a dashing reflective amorous compassionate resourceful man. Whether riding on a cannonball ingratiating himself with the Ottoman Sultan or examining the fantastic flora of the lunar planet Albers always makes Mnchhausen totally believable.All the acting is of a high order but especially worthy of mention are Ferdinand Marian as the mysterious Count Cagliostro Brigitte Horney as a flirtatious Catherine the Great and Gustav Waldau as an aging Casanova.It should be mentioned that this is not a movie for children. Given its European origins it should come as no surprise that MNCHHAUSEN is a good deal more libidinous than the standard Hollywood fare of the time.There was a real Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Mnchhausen 17201797 a German adventurer and teller of tall tales but he had nothing to do with the book of fictional exploits which borrowed his name written by Rudolf Erich Raspe 17371794 upon which this film was based.".

The sets and costumes are very detailed and elaborate this must have been a very expensive movie in its time. Hans Albers is wonderful as the ageless Baron wandering through the wacky adventures in this film without taking it seriously for one moment. In some respects the acting is ahead of its time as the actors almost seem to be making fun of themselves for example when the princess earnestly utters the line fate bestows us luck but the interest is very high. The goofy special effects only add to the fun for instance when the cannonballriding Baron crashlands in the Sultan's palace and greets him with a hearty Salaam! or when the balloon drifts all the way up to the moon which is populated by people who can remove their heads at will. I find it astonishing that there are so many sexual references in this movie the oneliners fly pretty fast in the sultan's palace especially the scenes between the Baron and the eunuch who speaks in a comically highpitched squeak like a mouse. I know it's stupid but there are two parts where I laughed the most when the Baron takes a gun in each hand to shoot in two different directions and his eyes act independently of each other the camera holds on his expression just long enough for it to be a hilarious sight gag. The other time I laughed was when the Baron used his sword to humiliate the princess's brother in Venice. This is a very good movie that deserves a lot of praise. I think it has more depth than Gilliam's version and the acting is top notch.".

I know it's stupid but there are two parts where I laughed the most when the Baron takes a gun in each hand to shoot in two different directions and his eyes act independently of each other the camera holds on his expression just long enough for it to be a hilarious sight gag. The other time I laughed was when the Baron used his sword to humiliate the princess's brother in Venice. This is a very good movie that deserves a lot of praise. I think it has more depth than Gilliam's version and the acting is top notch.";

I truly believe that it is among the greatest achievements in the history of film. The unique pastel colour is magnificent and the film is filled with hilarious and daring moments. Especially when you consider that Mnchhausen is a Nazi era 1943 German film It really is hard to believe that this is true.Acclaimed director Terry Gilliam of Monty Python and 12 Monkey's fame obviously tried to draw more attention to this striking wonder when he made his own version of this tale 'The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen' in 1988. If it wasn't for Mr.Gilliam I probably would have never bothered to even watch this film. So I owe him many thanks as Mnchhausen has easily become one of my all time favorite films. The pace humour and sheer originality of this fantasy make it one of the easiest subtitled films to watch in existence period. It ranks up there with the greatest pre1950's films such as The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre and Chaplin's brilliant City Lights. If you love movies if you love classic cinema if you love original fantasy films if you love humorous films Seek out 1943's Mnchhausen whatever you do. It will not disappoint. This film is certainly not for children. However in terms of flat out fantasy entertainment I would say that this nearly 70 year old antique blows away Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings films any day and easily. Enough said.910".

Anyway I remember the film with affection and I thoroughly enjoyed rewatching it on DVD even if this version is still several minutes shy of its 134minute original length!.For being made right in the middle of WWII this is an obscenely expensive  circa 35 million in today's currency  spectacle given pretty much carte blanche the producers went overschedule and overbudget commissioned by the Nazis  but scripted ironically by a Jew  on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Germany's foremost film unit UFA it was also seen as a direct response to such foreignmade extravaganzas as Hollywood's THE WIZARD OF OZ 1939 and Britain's THE THIEF OF BAGDAD 1940! The character of the talespinning Baron Munchausen originated in a book by 18th century author Gottfried August Burger which along the years has inspired 4 featurefilm adaptations as well as a Silent short by pioneering wizard Georges Melies and an animated short that was thankfully included on the Kino DVD and which will be discussed separately. Despite the stature accorded the 1988 Terry Gilliam version THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN which I watched only once several years ago and recall being a somewhat hitormiss affair the 1943 film emerges as perhaps the most satisfying cinematic rendition overall.The film is bookended by scenes with a contemporary i.e. 1940s setting in which the Baron played as a dashing yet cunning womanizer rather than the Quixotic fool envisioned by Terry Gilliam recounts some of his adventures  in the third person  to a nave young couple the female member of which had fallen under his spell at a fancydress ball. The rest is an episodic fantasia in which Munchausen  usually driven by the promise of a romance and accompanied by his faithful sidekick  journeys from one country to the other meeting along the way historical historical figures like Czarina Catherine The Great Giacomo Casanova and the magician Cagliostro who endows him with both immortality and the power of invisibility as well as purely invented characters such as the selfproclaimed world's fastest runner until he ends up on the moon itself. Quality varies but the end result as a whole is a delight and a veritable feast for the eyes thanks in no small measure to the highly pleasing Agfacolor the splendid production design and the charmingly primitive special effects.Still one thing that bothered me about the DVD was the fact that the subtitles barely allowed one time to read them in all fairness this had a lot to do with the virtually uninterrupted flurry of the film's dialogue itself  hence something other than a thin white font should have been adopted! The extras were more extensive than I had anticipated and up to Kino's standards for a Special Edition release  the best however was the 17minute interview with the head of the German archival company that handled the current restoration which goes into some detail about this as well as the production of the film itself.DIE ABENTEUER DES BARON MUNCHHAUSEN  EINE WINTERREISE Hans Held 1944 12 610 A pleasant animated short from Germany about the popular title character made in color but containing no dialogue it came hot on the heels of the 1943 epic film version  though the latter apparently left no recognizable impression on it as the Baron here looked and acted nothing like the part as played by Hans Albers nor was the plot 'lifted' from some particular sketch in the episodic film. In fact the short presents only a couple of incidents presumably taken from the book which inspired the film version in the first place and several others made before and after it one in which the Baron's horse ends up dangling in the air from the faade of a building seen in the frontcover illustration of the book from which Albers reads during the modern sequences in the film though the episode itself is not reenacted and then when the two of them are chased by a hungry wolf in the snow with the latter proceeding to swallow the horse in one gulp and replaces it in leading the Baron's sled!".

	schema:headline " Lavish and highly entertaining Agfacolor fantasy! A rarely shown gem of the European cinema!";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS This lavish production in Agfacolor ordered by Goebbles himself was made to mark the 25th anniversary of the German UFAStudio. The film begins with a gala 18th century ball at the Bodenwerder castle by the jovial Baron Muenchhausen and his wife. There is a sudden lovers' quarrel between two of the guests. The young girl flees and jumps into her car. We have been viewing a costume party and the period is very definitely the present. The baron and his much older wife attempt to reconcile the pair. He tells them of the adventures of his ancestor the fabulous Baron Muenchhausen and the film goes into flashback this time to the real 18th century. Muenchhausen and his servant Christian visit the baron's father who is puzzled over Christian's invention of a rifle which can see and shoot a distance of 200 kilometers. After the visit the pair decides to go to Braunschweig at the invitation of the Prince of Brunswick to whom the Empress Catherine the Great has offered a command of a Russian regiment. The prince asks for Muenchhausen's help in convincing his lovely mistress Louise la Tour to make the trip and when this is accomplished the group sets off for Russia. The dealings at the Russian courts are devious. The magician Cagliostro tries to enlist Muenchhausen in a plot against the empress but without success. At a carnival the baron meets a young girl named Kaetchen who is later revealed to be the Catherine in disguise. Muenchhausen becomes Catherine's new lover kindling the jealousy of the former favorite Prince Potemkin who challenges the baron to a duel injuring him slightly. Muenchhausen goes to the sinister loking house of Doctor Cagliostro to have his wound treated and while there warns Cagliostro that he is about to be arrested. Although the magician knows this he rewards the baron with the secret of eternal youth and also gives him a ring that will amke him invisible for one hour. As the secret police breaks into the house Cagliostro escapes using magic to amke him invisible. Catherine soon tires of Muenchhausen and sends him to Turkey in command of a regiment. He is inadvertently shot on a cannonball to Constantinople where he becomes a prisoner of the sultan. After a period of imprisonment he is reunited with his servant Christian. The baron is offered his freedom if he will convert to Moslem religion. He explains to the sultan that this would be impossible because he would have to drink water instead of wine but the sultan tells him he does not really abstain  and gives a sample of his private stock of Tokay. Muenchhausen insists that the Tokay he drank at the palace of the Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna was twice as good. This leads to a bet in which the baron promises to provide the sultan with a bottle from Vienna in an hour. If he wins the bet he will have his freedom. Thanks to a wonderful runner the bottle is produced leading to a second wager. If the wine is indeed better than the sultan's Muenchhausen will be rewarded with the beautiful Princess Isabella d'Este a prisoner in the harem. Muenchhausen wins this bet too but the Sultan reneges on his promise attempting to pass off the aging Louisa la Tour as Isabella. Using the magic ring the baron invades the harem abducts the real princess and sets  sail for Venice. He learns that the girl's family had planned to marry her to an old man. She had fled the city but was abducted by pirates who sold her to the sultan. Her sudden return is no joy to the family and her wicked brother Francesco has her kidnapped a second time and locked up in a convent. Muenchhausen fights a duel with Francesco that results in the latter's clothes being cut to ribbons. Muenchhausen and Christian with the d'Este family in pursuit escape Venice in a balloon conveniently anchored in the Grand Canal. Their vehicle takes them to the moon. There in a surrealist landscape Christian ages and dies because one day is equal to a year on earth  but Muenchhausen is of course immortal. His gloom is dispelled by the presence of the wife of the Man in the Moon. She can be in two places at the same time by separating her head from her body. But even her charms soon pale and the baron returns to Germany. The scene now shifts back to the present presumably the 1930s where Muenchhausen tell the startled young couple that he and his distinguished ancestor are one and the same. Thoroughly frightend they flee the castle. The baroness having observed that her husband is attracted to the girl tells him to follow his new love. Instead he renounces the gift of eternal youth to grow old with her.This film has been a favorite of mine since my childhood. Therefore I can highly recommend it. In my opinion this version is much better than the 1988 offering by Terry Gillian.".

Jack Pearl a former vaudevillian had a radio series based on the Munchhausen character and his famous line to those who questioned the authenticity of his stories was Vas you dere Charlie.

Such a lavish type party was definitely in keeping with the regime's culture of the time.Though Goebbels kept it light as he did most of UFA's product except those that were outright propaganda they did get their shots in. During the part of the film concerning Munchhausen's visit to Imperial Russia the German background of Catherine the Great played by a fetching Brigitte Horney is emphasized. Catherine was a name she took when she married the Czar she was in fact Sophia of AnhaltZerbst. Also there is a scene when Pugachev the peasant leader of a revolt in Siberia is brought in caged like an animal and looking like something from Dr. Moreau's laboratory. Pugachev was later played by Van Heflin in the film Tempest in the next decade. The caricature was definitely in keeping with the Nazi ideas to depict Slavic people as some kind of subhumans almost as bad as Jews.Throughout the film as Munchhausen travels from St. Petersburg to Istanbul to Venice and even the moon Albers's faithful sidekick is Herman Speelmans who is like Sancho Panza or even Gabby Hayes if you will.

	schema:headline " Munchhausen on the cannon ball is pure movie magic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Munchhausen was a historic German nobleman who became famous for throwing lavish parties at his home in Bodenwerder where he told the most fantastic tall tales about his adventures. Now a wellknown literary figure Munchhausen has become a synonym for unbelievable and exciting adventures that often involve tremendous exaggerations and even lies. It's not surprising that the wonderful stories of this man were eventually made into a movie and interestingly enough it was the one that celebrated the 25 year anniversary of the German UFA film studios. Even more interesting though is the fact that it was made in Nazi Germany during World War II and yet doesn't contain one single antiSemitic reference or propaganda for the cause of the National Socialist Party. Extremely funny and hilariously entertaining Josef von Baky created an unusual and highly original odyssey through Europe of a man pursuing the exciting and adventurous. Those who have read the stories know that some of Munchhausen's more famous deeds include his ride on the cannonball tying his horse to the tip of a church tower and breaking into the ice out of which he pulls himself by his own hairs. The first one mentioned can be found in the movie as well as other humorous scenes that perfectly fit into the Munchausen concept. Munchhausen lived at the end of the 18th century in Brunswick but he always traveled around Europe with his loyal servant Christian Kuchenreuter. The story starts out with Munchhausen returning from one of his several trips to his residence in Bodenwerder where all the jackets in his cabinet get rabies and Christian introduces a fascinating substance that makes a man's beard grow in a matter of seconds. Hours later Munchausen leaves for the court of Prince Anton Ulrich of Brunswick who is commanded to leave for St. Petersburg and would like Munchhausen to accompany him. On their way to Russia Munchhausen and Christian encounter the dark Count Cagliostro who is wanted all over Europe for performing notorious witchcraft. He plainly tells Munchhausen of his intentions to become count of the Courland and asks Munchhausen to assist him which he denies by telling him that he has absolutely no intention of reigning. In St. Petersburg he meets Katharina the Great and the two become lovers and he also meets Cagliostro again and warns him that Katharina intends to arrest him. Out of gratitude Cagliostro gives Munchausen a ring that makes him invisible and the ultimate gift of eternal youth as long as Munchhausen wants it.Baron Munchhausen was never very complex in the original stories as they mostly focused on his fairy tales rather than the vast and interesting personality. But here the man is a very deep and powerful character who sees people die around him while he possesses the gift of eternal life and becomes more and more torn between his desire for adventure and that to share a mortal life with his friends and loved ones. For this movie the basic concept of the Munchhausen stories was changed a bit with the film being somewhat of a life story even though there is no real linear plot with the narrative reminding more of episodes. While a lot of the film is actually more of a historical drama than fantasy many scenes will bring you into the wonderful world of Baron Munchhausen including the cream that makes your hair grow in a matter of seconds the rifle that can shoot accurately for hundreds of miles and the ride to the moon in an air balloon. An exemplary tale of imagination and creative adventures Munchhausen's visual effects can't measure up the ones of today of course but in perspective to the times they are absolutely stunning.Some of the acting in this movie really stands out even though it mostly centers around the colorful sets. Hans Albers makes the perfect Baron Munchhausen a witty intelligent charismatic and very deep character who is not the perfect hero but a man who goes through life trying to have it as exciting as possible. Whether he's deeply philosophical in the middle of one of his fun adventures or once again seducing a beautiful woman Albers is extremely convincing as the flawed but goodhearted Munchhausen who learns a lot during his life enough to choose mortality over eternal life at the end. The film features a huge ensemble of characters and many of them are just part of one episodes in Munchhausen's life. Hermann Speelmans who plays Munchhausen's loyal servant and friend Christian Kuchenreuter was also an exemplary casting choice and manages to be funny growing his beard in a matter of seconds and very emotional rapid aging on the moon in a number of scenes. Another performer who really stands out is Ferdinand Marian as the mysterious Count Cagliostro who is very powerhungry selfserving but in the end a thankful and appreciative man who rewards Munchhausen for warning him by giving him the eternal youth. Brigitte Horney as Katharina the Great is also great in her role as the proud monarch who is completely charmed by Munchhausen.Another thing that might shock you is the nudity in this movie that wouldn't get past any UScensor these days as well as some pretty explicit sexual jokes. Therefore Munchhausen really is a fairy tale for adults and not necessarily for children.What's left to say is that Munchhausen is a beautiful tale of adventures and imagination that is an impressive document of what Germany's film industry was able to conjure in the 1940s already. And when Hans Albers rides on the cannon ball turns his head to the audience and takes off his hat in greeting you will completely be captured by his charismatic and smart personality that brings the magic to this outstanding movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "If this clever intelligent and visually stunning 1943 German version of the Baron Munchausen story was made elsewhere and not under Nazi rule it would surely rank as one of the great classic fantasy films. Films made in Germany during World War II received almost no worldwide distribution. Up until now the only way to view MUNCHAUSEN was through faded video bootlegs. Kino Video with the assistance of the F.W Murnau Foundation who helped preserve Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS has released a handsomely restored version of this colorful dreamlike fantasy treat.MUNCHAUSEN begins with a great visual gag regarding an elaborate 18th century costume ball attended by the charming but constantly fibbing Baron Munchausen Hans Albers whom film fans will recognize as the strongman who steals Marlene Dietrich away in THE BLUE ANGEL Munchausen tells of his wild adventures. One moment he rides a cannonball to a sultan's grand palace at others he takes a trip to the moon does battle with flying barking clothing and encounters a manhungry Catherine The Great. MUNCHAUSEN was filmed in Agfacolor a bright and stunning color process developed in Germany. You will see the storybooklike colors that make this film so enjoyable. MUNCHAUSEN also has some really wild moments for a film made in 1943. In one scene topless slave girls are auctioned off. In other scenes Russians are depicted as weasely gluttons slobbering over vats of caviar. As MUNCHAUSEN neared completion the Germans suffered a crippling blow at Stalingrad. Any jab at the victorious Russians would have been welcomed by German audiences. MUNCHAUSEN was the film that heralded the 25th anniversary of UFA Germany's grandest film studio. During the bombing raids on Berlin UFA studios and its vast achieve were severely damaged. It is true miracle that MUNCHAUSEN survived as well as it did".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Mnchhausen in my native Romania as a child during the war I mean WWII and the scene of the baron's landing on the moon and having a conversation with the head lying on the ground of a woman who left the rest of her body in her lunar home made such a powerful impression on me that to this day I remember it in all its funny details. It was also the first movie in color I had ever seen yes those were the days when movies as a rule were in black and white. Revisiting the movie now as a euphemistically labeled senior citizen I was surprised that it holds up quite well. It amuses it surprises it is well acted the dialog is clever written after all by the famous novelist Erich Kstner under a pseudonym to cover up the fact that the Nazis saw themselves forced to employ him after burning his books. There is something quite disturbing in hindsight about this movie. Why was it made? It was released in the year between the Battle of Stalingrad and the Allied Normandy Invasion the two events that were to seal Germany's fate. Was it an attempt to sustain both at home and abroad the farfetched illusion that the war was going so well that all the German people cared about was laughing at the Baron Mnchhausen's lies? Or was it an attempt at showing that Babelsberg could produce a grand spectacle just as well as Hollywood? And if a spectacle was being offered why in a country in which mass murder and deception were the order of the day was even the hero to be a liar?I am asking these questions because much in this movie is disturbing for reasons related to them. Take the Baron himself played in this movie by Hans Albers the greatest star the Clark Gable of German movies in those years yet by the time of this movie a man in his fifties pretending to be irresistible to females. It is as if MGM had cast an aging Adolphe Menjou as Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind. Now Albers is a fine actor but to enjoy the movie you definitely have to suspend disbelief and pretend that the aging actor riding the cannonball is not bothered by arthritic pain. The sets look more like cheap nouveauriche furnishings and the costumes are cut from wartime stock. Ilse Werner as Princess Isabella d'Este is as beautiful as ever and as Count Cagliostro we get to see Ferdinand Marian the actor who just a few years earlier had disgraced himself by playing the lead in Jud Sss the most disgusting antiSemitic propaganda film ever made a fact that ultimately led Marian to alcoholism and a DUI death at war's end considered a suicide by many. Now one can say let's just watch the film for what it is and not in its historic context. But then Marian's acting of Cagliostro a swindler is crafted with the same mannerisms he used in creating the Jew Sss. In short the undeniable artistic qualities of this movie are infected with the severe moral deficiencies of its makers and this surprisingly renders the movie more interesting than it has any right of being. This is what disturbs me.".

Indeed at times they manage to subvert it with some explicit statements against imperialism and in favour of racial equality slipping past the censors.Mnchhausen's decision to age and die at the end stands in contrast to Hitler's determination to build a thousandyear Reich and both Turks and blacks are depicted as noble virtuous and intelligent people.Reality illusion and delusion frequently blur throughout the film and this tone is set from the start with the oftdiscussed scene in which the 18th Century ball is revealed to actually be a presentday costume party.Erich Kstner who also wrote the beloved children's story Emil and the Detectives produced the script which brings the essence of the Mnchhausen story faithfully to life each lie becoming more and more deliciously outrageous culminating in the famous visit to the moon.Hans Albers is perfectly cast while Brigitte Horney and Marina von Ditmar are two of the most beautiful female leads ever to grace a German film.Colour is used effectively the bright pastels bringing the film's fantasy world vividly to life as the audience is transported to exotic realms. This would have stood in contrast to life in the Reich as the tide of the war turned against Germany and the horrific carpet bombings began. A piece of escapist fare such as this would presumably have provided great comfort at this time though of course Goebbels' original aim had been to simply reflect the glory of the Reich and compete directly against Hollywood's Wizard of Oz.Ultimately though this film stands alone as a worthwhile work suitable for the entire family. As mentioned previously it makes some strong criticism of war and imperialism that adults will appreciate and creates vivid fantasy worlds for children.

	schema:reviewBody "In film history class we were usually shown a silent era German movie followed by Triumph of the Will. This film ought to be included. It is surprising on a few fronts. One is the high production values. Not a cheap movie at all. Even when compared to a US technicolor film of the period this had a few advantages like real European locations access to the Venice canals a movie in colour first?. It could also be the first colour film to show a spacescience fiction sequence. The effects were impressive for the time and its clear that the Gilliam version borrowed some fx ideas from this. The often heard assumption that Germany's best film technicians all fled or were killed simply isn't true judging by this. Very colourful film. The language barrier prevented me from judging the comic timing very well but looked as though the performances were on target. As others have pointed out the nudity and sexual talk is rather jarring to see when you think of the US censorship board of the period. Probably the two biggest surprises were the black people! and the not so unsubtle digs at the regime. The villain with the moustache talking about invading Poland really came as a surprise. This flies in the face of what I often heardthat Germans were brainwashed by Hitlerclearly there was some dissent judging from this. And it also counters the idea that was put froward in the last 10 years that in war time one doesn't criticize the sitting president. They did in Nazi Germany!".

	schema:reviewBody "Some claim that this film was made to boost sagging Nazi morale as their world conquest began to falter in early 1943. Please people think a moment. This film took two years to make so if it was released in spring 1943 it would have gone into production in early '41 when the Nazis were still on the rise toward their late 1942 peak of conquest. Plus the preproduction must have taken a while also so this film probably started in the conceptual stage as far back as 1939 or 1940! Munchhausen has a swashbuckling feel  with cavalier characters performing outrageous stunts with seeming effortlessness. The funniest is the runner who zips through the countryside like a rocket and isn't even out of breath when he stops. Hans Albers is both good and bad as the lead. He is clearly too old to fit the description of an eternally young man the jowls alone are a dead giveaway but his coolly aristocratic and macho bearing seem to suit the type he is playing so you are able to go along with it. The casual female nudity in the harem scene is another reminder of how advanced over Hollywood the European cinema was in its attitude toward the body. The film's depiction of blacks is no more or less racist than Hollywood's at the time.Although scene flows quickly into scene  there is nevertheless a tedium about the whole business perhaps because the emotional tone within the scenes is so cool and so talky. No one seems to feel anything very deeply so it's hard for the audience to feel anything much either. All we can do is applaud the sumptuous set pieces the endless stunts and cleverness and chuckle at the silly magic tricks like the clothing that dances or the ointment that makes mustaches spring from cleanshaven faces or the gun whose sight can see a target many miles away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering that this film was made in Nazi Germany during the middle of WWII I expected the film to be a dogmatic piece of propaganda. Surprisingly despite its pedigree it was a wonderful piece of escapist fantasy and seemed to have nothing to do with the Nazi regime. In fact a writer whose works were burned by the Nazis is the man responsible for this screenplay though of course under a pseudonym. So my advice is try to forget when it was made and just sit back and enjoy.Baron Munchausen was despite the weirdness of the film was a real adventurer and war hero. In real life he tended to greatly exaggerate his exploits and this was the basis for later stories of his life.In this film the movie starts in the present day 1943 but it was brilliant how the writer and director made it look like it was in the 17th or 18th century. This was very clever. Then when a party guest begs the host to tell them about the exploits of his ancestor Munchausen the story of Munchausen's adventures begins. This is a wonderful way to both introduce and conclude the film and makes this aspect of the film better than the 1988 version of Baron Munchausen. Now this isn't to say the 1943 version is superior overallit certainly isn't. In fact BOTH are extraordinary films and I recommend you see both. However if you can only see one try the 1988 version by Terry Gilliam first as the story itself is a little more actionpacked and the special effects are truly amazing even today whereas the 1943 film at times looks a bit cheesymostly because special effects of the day just weren't up to the story in a few places since it was SO weird and overthetop.PSA note to parentsthere is some nudity in the film which is surprising considering this seems to be a familyoriented film. While not supergraphic you do see a lot of topless harem girls during one scene. It's really a shame as it doesn't exactly fit in with the rest of the film though compared to some newer films the nude scene is rather tame. However you should consider this when you think about having your kids watch the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I'm sorry but no matter how much I expected myself to like this movie I just didn't. No it's of course not like this is the worst movie I have ever seen but I was shocked at how poorly this movie actually was constructed.Problem is that the movie feels way too messy especially with its fantasy elements thrown into the story. Quite frankly the movie simply featured some poor storytelling and this movie is simply not how a fantasy movie should be like. The movie tries hard to create a magical kind of atmosphere but instead the fantasy elements often feel awkward and way too sudden. Sometimes it doesn't even serve a purpose for the movie it's story. It's just not a movie that could grab me. The storytelling is too messy and certain story elements seem very random and don't really blend in with the rest of the movie. The characters are confusing as well. Perhaps it would had helped if the movie was closer to 3 hours long rather than it's now almost 2 hours of running time.From a movie with a fantasy story such as this also some more entertainment was to be expected. The movie only mildly entertains throughout but the movie just never becomes an awful lot of fun to watch due to its story or fantasy elements.But it needs to be said that for a 1943 movie this is simply a great looking one. It used some unique coloring techniques Agfacolor which German filmmakers used between 1939 and 1945. It gives the movie an unique very bright looking style. But also the sets and costumes are fine looking though obviously deliberately fake looking as well at times.A movie that tries really very hard but in the end just isn't good and entertaining enough.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie I was prepared to like because Robert Downey is an excellent actor and Zack G has proved to be a weird character who can be very funny in the right film.But it just doesn't work very well. This story has been done before and with much better effect in Planes Trains and Automobiles. The two movies have a very similar story arc but in the one case you have two very funny men playing actual mature adults who have differing personalities and in the other you have two men who are immature imbeciles with differing personalities. The former are likable while the latter are just annoying.Zack G's character is just too bizarre to be credible but at least you know where they are going with him. Downey on the other hand is an excellent actor badly miscast here. His demeanor is just too dark and his personality too brooding and cranky to play the part of a good family man trying at all costs to get home in time for his child's birth. To be honest his character simply isn't very likable and is sometimes just downright mean even spitting in an innocent dog's face. This is in stark contrast to the frustrated everyman played by Steve Martin in PTA  a person every traveler stuck next to an obnoxious slob understands implicitly. Another example of such a role being done to perfection is Jack Lemmon in The Out of Towners.I suppose it didn't help that the theater was packed with very young children who had no business going to this movie. The very crude language extensive drug imagery and graphic masturbation scenes while funny for adults were grossly inappropriate for 512 year olds in the crowd. Some people clearly are not cut out to be parents.Perhaps the most memorable line in the movie was Downey proclaiming that he had never done drugs in his life. Given Downey's well documented reallife problems his statement in the movie couldn't help but make the audience compare the character to reality thus serving to knock down the 4th wall in the process. No doubt the contrast was created by intent but I'm not sure it was a great idea.As Steve Martin John Candy and Jack Lemmon proved superior comedy and deeper laughs come from brilliant acting and comic timing. If you have to resort to endless gutter language potty humor and masturbating canines you have already lost the game before it starts.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you make a road trip movie and you have two mismatched characters sharing that road one can't help but to think back to John Hughes 1987 masterpiece Planes Trains and Automobiles. It might not be right but unfortunately it just happens. And when you do you come up with the conclusion that this film is a food stamps version of the real deal. While Todd Phillips is talented and Zack Galifinakis and Rober Downey Jr. are fine actors the material in this film is just mean. In every way.In PTA you had a workaholic who was trying to get home for Thanksgiving only to get stuck next to a slob. John Candy was that slob and for all of the shortcomings of his character Del Griffith the character knew he was a bit of a slob he knew he was a bit annoying and he knew that he was a bit hard to get along with. But when all was said and done he was a sweet man and absolutely knew WHO HE WAS. If you compare him to Zack's character it's like comparing a character after he has been through the editing process 17 times as opposed to the original draft that Galifinakis seems that he is. Candy might have been written like Galifinakis' character is at the beginning but Hughes took the time to polish and shine him. And what we were left with a family man indelibly devoted to his wife and a man who was giving honest kind and principled. He was flawed no doubt but he wasn't a jerk. The same can be said about Neil Page flawed but a decent human being.Due Date has unlikable characters. I mean every single character in here with the exception of Downey's wife is a complete jerk at times. Ethan Trembley is so over the top that you just can't take him seriously. He is just mean and he is such a slob that you have no empathy for him. Peter Highman is an angry violent rage of a volcano that even when he is being helped across country to see his wife he finds it hard to be nice. This is a man who will punch a child spit in a dog's face and leave a man broke at a rest room while stealing his car. I found it hard to like any character in the film but especially the two leads.With PTA there was humour in the situations. In Due Date it's just not that funny because in this film you have crack whores lots of drugs unrealistic and cringeworthy situations and scene after scene of incredulous acts that would get you punched out in real life. To see a man masturbate in the seat beside you is not funny. However seeing the dog do it I have to admit is.Due Date sis not entirely unfunny. There are sporadic scenes of humour. And Downey is good as always. But like I said maybe it's just wrong to compare it to PTA but there were laugh out loud scenes like the car rental scene You're going the wrong way those aren't pillows do you think this vehicle is safe? and so on on. Then at the end you have the cover of Every Time You Go Away and it fits perfectly with the tone of the film. At the end of this you just have Zak being Zak.I wanted to like this but it disappointed me immensely.310".

	schema:reviewBody "I think that Due Date operates under the main premise that the viewer has never heard of Planes Trains and Automobiles for if they had they'd be wondering why they were watching the same movie with all the jokes stripped out. Due Date is in total neither a terrible nor an offensive film. Its problem is that it's a little too bitter thus eliminating with surgical precision any empathy we might have for its two protagonists. It's a road trip with an obvious end in sight and somewhat unpredictable wacky hijinks in between. You could do worse but you could do much better.Peter Highman Robert Downey Jr. is an architect who's attempting to fly out of Atlanta back home to Los Angeles to be with his wife Michelle Monaghan who's about to give birth. But thanks to a bag mixup with a fellow traveler named Ethan Trembley Zach Galifianakis Peter finds himself stranded in Atlanta placed on the national No Fly list minor misunderstanding of course. Ethan offers him a crosscountry ride in his rental and off we go.The movie uses the trope of mismatched people enduring a common experience. Peter is uptight dithering endlessly about what to name his newborn. Ethan is well flighty. In fact Galifianakis seems to be playing the same character he played in the two Hangover films childlike maybe psychopathic andor sociopathic not all there. He's wildly misinformed about such things as the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam but he is heading west to try to make it as an actor in Hollywood. Oh and did I mention he's carrying the ashes of his deceased father in a coffee can to dispose of along the way? Well there's that too.You and I both know that there's no way Peter and Ethan will make it from Georgia to California without any problems. But Peter has no choice  his wallet was confiscated at the airport and his bags are on their way to LA. He has no cash and no ID. It could happen to anyone. So he's essentially at Ethan's mercy. Along the way we learn much about the characters and what makes them tick but whereas the earlier Planes Trains got melancholy without getting maudlin this one achieves no such feat.Downey Jr. and Galifianakis give it their best shot and to tell the truth they're not bad. They make an okay team it's just that it's a teaming we've seen before and much better. Steve Martin and John Candy got into their share of situations that would never happen to a normal person but they also ran into problems with which we could all relate here it's more of the former than the latter. It's as if the movie keeps daring itself to get weirder and weirder.The final nearfatal flaw of the movie is that it really doesn't give you anyone to root for  except of course at the end. It's a comedy after all. But these guys do some rather nasty things to each other and not in the ohnohedidn't sort of way either rather in the scowling almost hateful way. It's a little disconcerting at times. But the actors do their best as I said and you could do worse.".

Well I fancy there exists a male equivalent of the MPDG who I'm calling 'The Healing Schlub.' A staple of screwball road comedies these cheerfully disgusting stoners help steer their hardass copassengers towards emotional closure with their manchild antics. The late John Candy specialised in them and in Due Date Zach Galifianakis once again lollops up to the plate.Here he plays beardyweirdy Ethan Tremblay resembling like all Healing Schlubs a space hopper rolled in Jgermeister dog hair and pretzels. Cursing his luck for having hitched an emergency ride with him is uptight architect Peter Highman Robert Downey Jr. racing across America to be present at his first baby's birth.In other words it's Planes Trains and Awfully Familiar Stuff and although the movie's tagline is 'Leave Your Comfort Zone' we pretty much know where we're headed. Still RDJ automatically adds value to anything he's in plus Galifianakis is virtually reprising his hilarious breakout role from The Hangover  a wonderfully inventive treat for the Sideways generation also directed by Todd Phillips. So what could possibly...? Oh everything. What a horrible misfire we have here clichd meanspirited as amusing as a bedlocked fart and tonally all over the road  swerving like a narcoleptic driver or four scriptwriters between lanes of slapstick contrived pathos and misguided grossout. And generally just terrible terrible writing. At one point the pair drive an alltoo publicly stolen police car from the Mexican border to the Grand Canyon and nobody follows them. It's no wonder Downey Jr.  straitjacketed in second fiddle  looks cross because as usual none of this is actually the cast's fault. All the same Galifianakis might experiment with leaving his own Comfort Zone quite soon lest he's written off as a onetrick Schlub.".

You just leave the theater with your head down and try to forget everything that just happened...Zack Galifianakis is fast becoming the next Seth Rogen Micheal Sera Jonah Hill etc. His appeal is fading pretty quick as he is being typecast in the same role playing the same goofy lovable neurotic overweight guy. Hopefully by next year we will all be saying do you remember that guy..?Basically the movie is a clash of the oppositesbuddy road tripfeel good stereotype that has been done better by classics such as Planes Trains and Automobiles. The characters are not lovable at all do not generate sympathy and actually work to create animosity towards them. All the unbelievable situations they find themselves involved in are completely ridiculous and have you rolling your eyes and looking at your watch all at the same time.Go rent Planes Trains and Automobiles instead You will get more laughs. Hopefully the next time I see Zack Galifianakis will be on one of those where are they now specials in about 15 years...".

I am a fan of RDJ and ZG and think the majority of RDJ's work is way above par at least the projects he chooses. This is my first IMDb review and likely my last for a long time unless more such as this comes out. The movie was so unsettlingly atrocious I felt compelled to warn others in the core demographic. Side note I am not involved in the entertainment industry and did research online to figure out why RDJ would commit to a project this simply downright wrong.Studios this may have been profitable as the only cost was RDJ and I know you have him committed to a multipicture. Please be aware that you ruin brand equity in RDJ by associating his name with things like this amongst his core fan base. With that settled my thoughts on the filmIf this title had been billed as a horror film It might have understandable. I went to go see it with my 18 year old little brother and we both left in shock with the same feeling we got from Schindler's List. On the way home we discussed what's wrong with America and why terrorists feel the way they do about America pointing to demand for this kind of film as a core problem in our culture. Nothing ZG's character did was mildly redeeming and the only thing I question about RDJ's character is his sanity for allowing contact with ZG. Why RDJ's wife feels that ZG is anything but in need of a restraining order is beyond my understanding.The scene designed to show ZG as anything but criminally insane the pot in Range Rover Pink Floyd bonding talk was either cut or muted in such a way that it appeared to be nothing more than ZG drugging RDJ in his sleep. Why RDJ would have any affinity for the deranged ZG is not clear and why he all of a sudden changes opinion after that and the Mexican breakout less so. What is clear is that you put a great actor with an established brand in a contrived plot film that compromises his ability to remain credible so that you could cash in on his name. Perhaps ZG established a niche market with his appeal to the mentally ill in this film maybe this segment will allow his movies to run profitably in the future.One question writers why didn't RDJ's wife or friend hire a towncar limo or greyhound to get him home?Anyone involved in the greenlighting of this movie should be ashamed of themselves I hope the promotion or bonus and short run gain to the studio is worth the damage you have done.".

I know that Zach Galifianakis relies on awkwardness and an appearance of being socially inept in his standup which I don't generally enjoy but I had seen him in The Hangover and had enjoyed it but I did not walk out of this movie a fan of his. He does his schtick well perhaps a bit too well making it difficult to watch him. Robert Downey Jr. is very talented and was really the only reason I stayed through the entire film. He portrayed a man with angermanagement issues very well which also seems to be a bit of his thing as well.Overall the film has potential but fails to fulfill it. It does not fall flat but kind of just explodes into a big angry catastrophe. Ethan Zach Galifianakis is introduced as obnoxious and rude and I think that the viewer is supposed to end up loving him at the end possible spoiler but I walked out rooting for Peter Robert Downey Jr. who seemed to still harbor feelings of loathing even at the end when they are friends. I didn't laugh once instead just getting progressively more incensed and frustrated. Perhaps I was getting too involved but it didn't bring out the best in me.Ultimately I wish that Peter had pushed Ethan into the grand canyon. And that's that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Due Date is a comedy of mass frustration. I'm not just talking about what happens to the characters in the film no this is simply a frustrating comedy sit through. Here is an alltoofamiliar road picture that pins together two people who hate each other and sends them crosscountry on a madcap adventure. Needless to say one guy is an average Joe that we identify with and the other is a blithering idiot who makes every moment a nonstop irritation. If this sounds at all like the great Planes Trains and Automobiles you're not far off the mark.That earlier movie was a great American comedy. It was funny and endearing because we cared about both parties. We wanted to see Steve Martin get home and we cared about John Candy's shower ring salesman despite all his goofy inefficiencies. Here the Martin role is filled by a very sour Robert Downey Jr. as Peter Highman an uptight yuppie on his way from Atlanta to Los Angelas to witness the birth of his first child. The John Candy role is filled by Zach Galifianakis as Ethan an irritant on two legs who gets Peter thrown off the plane when he won't stop saying the word bomb. Neither of these two characters are really funny enough to spend any amount of time with.Peter is probably a nice guy. He seems to care about his wife but he spends the entire movie in a state of boiling anger and that's probably because he is saddled with a guy so insufferable that he could turn even the gentlest soul into a state of rage. Through a series of mishaps mostly thanks to Ethan's idiocy they get into every kind of trouble including A fight with a veteran in a wheelchair vehicular theft at the Mexican border a shooting a car accident and questions about whether Peter's wife is pregnant with his child.None of this stuff is really funny. It all seems episodic and some of it is quite violent and unpleasant. I think some of the comic energy that should make these scenes work is missing. We cringe when we should be laughing. I also think that most of the film's failure falls on the head of actor Zach Galifianakis who always seems to illicit the same effect on me as a noisy car alarm. I have seen him in three films now and he always plays the same annoying character An oddball doofus who has a neverending repertoire of annoying and disgusting habits. Ethan is a pothead with an annoying dog and even more annoying habits  all of which get under Peter's skin and sadly ours too. His presence I swear brings this movie to a dead stop and since he occupies at least 90 of it you can imagine how unpleasant this movie is.Due Date was directed by Todd Phillips who made The Hangover one of my favorite films of recent years. What that film had was a collection of likable characters and a narrative structure that pulled us from beginning to end. Here his story an episodic series of annoying moments and meanspirited characters. It ranges from disgusting to irritating to violent and finally soft and cuddly. The problem is that very very rarely ever funny. of four".

Basically this movie failed on every level possible. Downey Jr. did reasonably well with what he had but all other major elements were downright awful. I'll just mention one thing about Downey's character Highman though which is that if he was given something to be such as a gay guy who wanted to get back to California before gay marriage was made illegal perhaps that would have helped provide some color I'm not gay nor do I care about whether there are more or less gay characters in film I'm just pointing out an idea that might have helped this dreary excuse for a film. Then there could have been a message about life's priorities and how our decisions affect others rather than the forced ending of this movie. It could also have had an unhappy ending that would have been acceptable to the American masses they don't get back in time and Highman and his partner must go to another state to get married.Galifianakis' Tremblay is a ludicrous impossible human. Is he a wannabe a poser or deluded? Is he insane or at least seriously emotionally disabled? Is he gay? Is he smug and arrogant? He was all over the map. Is this the director's fault? I don't think I've ever seen such a poor performance because it was so inconsistent I'll take Torgo from Manos The Hands of Fate over Galifianakis' acting here for example. And then there is the humor though mostly the lack thereof. I don't think I found one thing worth laughing at and that is not an exaggeration! Saturday Night Live is funnier with its worst skits. I wish I could describe how bad this truly is but it was so bad that there is hardly anything worth noting. It's not funnybad like Manos The Hands of Fate type films but rather oldtiredgenericdirectionless bad. To make this kind of film work there at least needs to be good chemistry between the two major characters which was missing entirely here. Beyond that there's a car chase some lamecrude jokes a forced sentimental ending etc. none of it anything but a bore. Compared to this Hot Tube Time Machine looks like Citizen Kane.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only thing more frightening that having the Holocaust as part of our world's long history is to know that are human minds capable of creating and sustaining such an oppression. The real horror of Bryan Singer's adaptation of Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil lies in that we have this knowledge. We know that Adolf Hitler possessed the powers of immense manipulation and charisma. This has been so ingrained into our heads that I remember as a child knowing that Hitler was charismatic before I really knew what the term meant. This film is an exploration into the mind of a person who conceivably has many of the same manipulative characteristics. In the progression of the film we slowly learn why.Before any images actually come on screen we hear the voice of someone asking if the Holocaust occurred as a result of economic or social cultural reasons. Or was it in fact human nature? We then realize that the monologue is being given by a school teacher in a social studies class. The principle character Todd Bowden Brad Renfro a member of this class and is fascinated with studying the Holocaust. He spends much time in the library reading books and newspaper articles on the subject. Just as the opening credits finish the camera zooms in slowly to the eyes of a concentration camp leader. This is the first of many extreme closeup shots of eyes. This distance motif is incredibly effective. The eyes are the window to a man's soul and the psyche that Apt Pupil explores.One rainy night while Todd is riding the bus he sees a mysterious man who he realizes is Kurt Dussander Ian McKellan a Nazi war criminal and concentration camp leader who managed to escape from Germany years before. This is when we really begin to see Todd's disturbed mind. He is the kind of person who is so meticulous that he finds fourteen finger print matches of Dussander and builds a file that will be sent to the Israeli government if he doesn't agree to tell stories about the Holocaust that they are too afraid to tell in school. It is now clear that Todd is not so fascinated with the Holocaust because he's racist the film makes no reference to him being racist. He admires the power dedication and will behind the driving force of the Holocaust.  He mimics this power in his blackmailing of Dussander.The scenes with Dussander explaining in explicit detail the acts that he performed in concentration camps are quite disturbing in themselves but what is more disturbing is that Todd seems more detached than Kurt. Most of us would cringe in disgust if we were to sit and listen to the stories that Kurt tells. We get the impression that Todd is thrilled with the fact that he is able to control this man and make him relive his past.In the film's most harrowing scene Todd brings Kurt an officer's uniform similar to what he would have worn during the War years and makes him march. Up until this point we are led to believe that perhaps Kurt has had some time to develop remorse over the years for his haneous acts of brutality but when Todd begins commanding him Kurt fades to the same state of mind of his Nazi persona from the past and we see the man capable of ordering concentration camp personnel to gas hundreds of Jews. The scene is truly chilling and stands out as the most memorable in the film.Apt Pupil is occasionally slow but never boring. I for one could not take my eyes off the screen for a second. The power struggles between Todd and Kurt are always intense. The sequence of events leads up to a horrifying scene with Todd and his guidance counselor David Schwimmer. Here we learn of the lengths that Todd will take his manipulation. You can't do that the guidance counselor says. You have no idea what I am capable of doing replies Todd. This line of dialogue is very effective. We know from having seen the rest of the film that Todd is capable of quite a lot. While not as powerful or intense as Stephen King's novella the film Apt Pupil gives us a creepy insight to the corruption of power and manipulation. out of ".

Bowden offers not to turn Dussander in if he agrees to tell him what it was like to carry out the crimes he did during the war.  However the relationship changes both Dussander and Bowden bringing evil to the surface in both of them.Having read the short story prior to the film being made I knew that this was going to be a difficult subject to bring to the screen.  The film does a good job but makes many changes that will disappoint those who know the book.  Treating the film as a separate entity it isn't bad but it happens too quickly and doesn't go deep enough.  The plot is interesting but the depth Todd sinks to isn't convincing as half of it is forced on him and the other half he seems to embrace it.  Dussander himself is well crafted but his descent into evil doesn't go far enough to be truly captivating.  The ending is different from the book but I'm in two minds if it works better or not.Brad Renfro is good but I can't help but compare him to the character in the book and see his short fallings.  However he does manage to keep his changes semirealistic without descending into being OTT or turning into a cartoon character.  McKellen is perfect in the lead role and he manages to be larger than life.  An actor of Koteas shouldn't have done such a minor role but Schwimmer gives a good performance that isn't his usual Ross' thing again.It's hard not to compare this to the book and beside that it pales slightly. As a film in it's own right it's OK but it doesn't quite convince and has an uneasy tone to it.  Singer was always going to have a tough time following the amazing Suspects but here he does pretty well.  The direction is great and features plenty of great shots throughout the film.Overall it is a flawed film because it doesn't go as far as it should nor does it manage to totally sell the characters to us.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen King's Apt Pupil which is part of the novella collection Different Seasons alongside the stories that inspired The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me is a valid example of how you don't need things to be openly supernatural to have a good scary tale a human incarnation of pure evil will do just as fine and few images are more effective than those of the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis during WWII.Okay minor correction WWII has virtually nothing to do with this story given it takes place in 1984. There is a Nazi involved though his name is Kurt Dussander Ian McKellen but he's been living quite peacefully in your average American neighborhood under the name Arthur Denker. However a young boy named Todd Bowden Brad Renfro from the Grishaminspired The Client manages to uncover the old man's real identity thanks to some thorough research and tells him about the discovery. The unexpected thing is Todd doesn't want to report Dussander to the police. What he really wants is to learn everything  and he repeatedly emphasizes the word everything  about the former Nazi's work under Hitler's regime. Soon enough the perverse bond between the two starts affecting the boy's grades and behavior and Dussander isn't unaffected either somewhere deep inside lies the old Nazi and that part of his personality would like to come out and play.The film's screenplay sticks quite faithfully to the basic idea of King's story and reproduces some of the most famous scenes verbatim except for one moment of animal cruelty which had to be softened although a few subplots are excised presumably for the sake of length and pace. The downside of that is an occasional lack of detail especially when it comes to the development of Renfro's character. Director Bryan Singer who obviously found himself in an uncomfortable position to begin with having to live up to the success of The Usual Suspects makes up for this flaw by constructing a genuinely tense and unnerving atmosphere adding to the moral ambiguity by highlighting the homosexual subtext already present in the book when Todd tells Dussander to fck himself the latter replies My dear boy can't you see? We're fcking each other..Actingwise the limelight is inevitably placed on the leading duo even if the supporting cast which includes fine character actors like Bruce Davison and Elias Koteas is quite strong with the exception of David Ross Schwimmer who isn't entirely at ease in a serious role. Renfro's performance is solid and captivating enough but like his character he is completely overshadowed by the superb unsettling McKellen who inhabits the role of Dussander with his usual Shakespearean grandeur. Case in point the unforgettable moment when the old man is forced to wear an old SS uniform Todd got his hands on. McKellen carries out the assignment with the dignity of a great tragic thespian nailing the scene as one of the essential samples of his film career.Apt Pupil distances itself from The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me in that it isn't as accomplished most notably when it comes to the inevitable bookfilm comparison. Then again it tells a much darker story which asks the audience to root for a psychotic teenager and an aging Nazi. Flawed it may be but it certainly is interesting not to mention carried by an astounding McKellen. It is indeed a different season.".

It would sound like a sweet character study if the old man wasn't a Nazi war criminal and the teen wasn't a Holocaustobsessed recluse blackmailing his new pal for all the gory details.APT PUPIL scores the highest marks for originality. Nothing ever quite like this has been done before and it's all quite intriguing. In the beginning we come close to feeling sorry for the old man despite his past misdeeds. Here is he living out his golden years in peace and seclusion when all of a sudden a pushy teenager threatens to blow his cover. As the tale progresses we see that the elder is just as conniving as the boy threatening simply to expose their friendship forever linking the young man with unimaginable notoriety. What starts out as a bizarre acquaintance escalates into a duel of manipulation.It's not surprising that APT PUPIL is based on a novella by Stephen King. The film bears many of the hallmarks of King's works. And while it's never actually scary it is thrilling at a psychological level that King reaches best. It's not perfect but with the skilled direction of Bryan Singer and solid performances by leads Brad Renfro and Ian McKellen it generally accomplishes what it sets out to do.You don't have to be a horror person or a teenager at a late night party to enjoy APT PUPIL. The film has a unique appeal beyond what its target audience may have been. If you missed it when it was released in 1998 as many did based on its limited commercial success it's certainly worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Interesting tale of cat and mouse based on the idea that someone can become obsessed with a certain text.";
	schema:reviewBody "The underlying theme Apt Pupil maintains throughout is attention to texts and attention to texts that can inspire and influence but for all the wrong reasons. Apt Pupil does not have a set up it jumps right into its narrative from the very beginning as close to perfect student Todd Bowden Renfro sits there having gone through a lecture on the infamous Holocaust that took place during the 1930s and 40s in Central and Eastern Europe. Todd looks disturbed and yet intrigued at the same time the opening credits roll after the teacher rubs out 'Jews' written on the chalk board with the credits doubling up as a montage as Todd goes deeper and deeper into the history of the Holocaust and picks up on lots of information.From here Todd has had his mind polluted with a text he has done every attempt to read up on and is now in a different sort of mindset but since we did not know him before the film started it is his psyche that has been attributed to him. Similarly to the American couple who went on a spree after seeing Badlands similarly to the French couple who shot and robbed a liquor store after seeing Natural Born Killers and similarly to the hoodlums in Britain who dressed up and beat tramps after seeing A Clockwork Orange media texts and texts in general can inspire and influence. Todd's story is a study of this and it become doubly dangerous when he realises local neighbour Kurt Dussander McKellan is an exNazi in hiding.From this intriguing set up comes a film that unfolds at a satisfying pace delivers shocks and the odd surprise whilst maintaining a healthy amount of suspense. The film spends most of its first third informing us that the Holocaust was a 'bad thing' with its trailing off of stories that Kurt delivers to Todd and its dream sequences that Todd must endure. But at the same time this only further emphasises Todd's fascination and displays how vulnerable he really is. There are two scenes in which Todd hallucinates about the Holocaust one of which is when he is peering into a window at a dying Jew who cries out for help but Todd awakes in a cold sweat  he didn't enjoy it. The second of which takes place in the shower when he imagines he is a Jew himself. But he snaps out of it and pants in relief it's over.These reactions display fear and anxiety toward such visions but it is not long before he is treating friends like dirt participating in animal cruelty and wanting to witness first hand a Nazi drill from the real thing.

His presence adds another ingredient to the boiling pot but just when the game looks up in a forgettable scene Todd is quite literally saved by the bell.

	onyx:emotionText "The underlying theme Apt Pupil maintains throughout is attention to texts and attention to texts that can inspire and influence but for all the wrong reasons. Apt Pupil does not have a set up it jumps right into its narrative from the very beginning as close to perfect student Todd Bowden Renfro sits there having gone through a lecture on the infamous Holocaust that took place during the 1930s and 40s in Central and Eastern Europe. Todd looks disturbed and yet intrigued at the same time the opening credits roll after the teacher rubs out 'Jews' written on the chalk board with the credits doubling up as a montage as Todd goes deeper and deeper into the history of the Holocaust and picks up on lots of information.From here Todd has had his mind polluted with a text he has done every attempt to read up on and is now in a different sort of mindset but since we did not know him before the film started it is his psyche that has been attributed to him. Similarly to the American couple who went on a spree after seeing Badlands similarly to the French couple who shot and robbed a liquor store after seeing Natural Born Killers and similarly to the hoodlums in Britain who dressed up and beat tramps after seeing A Clockwork Orange media texts and texts in general can inspire and influence. Todd's story is a study of this and it become doubly dangerous when he realises local neighbour Kurt Dussander McKellan is an exNazi in hiding.From this intriguing set up comes a film that unfolds at a satisfying pace delivers shocks and the odd surprise whilst maintaining a healthy amount of suspense. The film spends most of its first third informing us that the Holocaust was a 'bad thing' with its trailing off of stories that Kurt delivers to Todd and its dream sequences that Todd must endure. But at the same time this only further emphasises Todd's fascination and displays how vulnerable he really is. There are two scenes in which Todd hallucinates about the Holocaust one of which is when he is peering into a window at a dying Jew who cries out for help but Todd awakes in a cold sweat  he didn't enjoy it. The second of which takes place in the shower when he imagines he is a Jew himself. But he snaps out of it and pants in relief it's over.These reactions display fear and anxiety toward such visions but it is not long before he is treating friends like dirt participating in animal cruelty and wanting to witness first hand a Nazi drill from the real thing. There are two symmetrical scenes during which both Todd and Kurt partake in animal cruelty emphasising that Todd is perhaps entering the mindset of a Nazi whilst one who has already been there and been one also tries his hand at animal cruelty  disturbingly fitting how it involved an oven. But at this point Todd has already bordered on the insane since his readings of the subject and the stories of the exNazi have deterred him from the straight and narrow it echoes the scene in Taxi Driver when Travis pretends to 'shoot' the porn stars on the screen in the cinema  he has seen the filth and the bare bones of the subject first hand and is now building up a fascination albeit and 'anti' fascination as opposed to Todd's fascination which makes him want to hurt upset and maim.And so as the film progresses so does the intrigue and the deception.

It's a catandmouse story of a cocky smart American kid who discovers that man who lives near him is actually a fugitive NAZIone of the evil highranking officers that has thwarted the authorities for decades. But instead of doing the obvious right thing and turning him in the boy engages in a deadly quidproquo game of blackmail he tells Arthur Denkerreal name Kurt Dussanderto tell him everything that is too explicit for the war books and magazines.The novel has a very dark ending which you'd expect when a person makes a critically terrible decision and then tries endlessly to cover it up. This movie almost completely sanitizes it. Further Brad Renfro was a horrible miscast as Todd Bowden. He acts nothing like the Bowden in the book. The pacing for this film was all wrong and never allows any of the characters to sufficiently develop. Only Ian McKellan and the wellintentioned efforts of David Schwimmer save this film from being a total skunk.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently this movie was based upon a novel from Stephen King which I haven't read yet so don't expect any comparing between the book and the movie from my side. What I can do for you is to explain how I feel about this movie and I must say that it left me with a double feeling. The acting and the story were OK most of the time at least but the entire concept of the movie didn't convince me once. It even disturbed me but not in the way that you probably expect.The movie gives us the story of a 16 year old boy Todd Bowden who learns more about the Holocaust at school. He gets fascinated by it and starts reading and learning more and more about it. And then he makes a big discovery. He sees a man on the bus who appears to be Kurt Dussander a Nazi war criminal who now lives in his neighborhood under the assumed name Arthur Denker. Instead of turning the man over to the authorities he makes a deal with Denker. If the former Nazi tells him what life in the concentration camps was like he won't tell anybody what Denker's real identity is. What follows is a strange cat and mouse game between Denker and Bowden that will end with a vicious murder...The subject talking about an old man who appears to be a former Nazi who now lives in America and pretends to be a sweet old man isn't bad. Even the idea that he has lived an undisturbed life since he arrived but now his true identity is discovered by a young student is OK. But it is everything after that that bothers me. For instance why do people in Hollywood always think in stereotypes when talking about former Nazi's? I mean sure what they did was horrible and it is almost impossible for us to understand why so many Germans knew about it all and didn't do anything but many of those former Nazi's and soldiers now live a normal life even though some of them still meet each other and seem to be proud of what they did during the war. This isn't a thing that I make up in Belgium for instance the 'SintMaartensfonds' you could translate it as the SaintMartinsfund still organizes the Belgian SSsoldiers who fought in the USSR against the Bolsjewism and I once saw a meeting of former SS and Wehrmacht troops in Austria only a couple of years ago. But opposite to what Hollywood tries to make us believe these people aren't pure evil. I mean they aren't torturing people during these meetings or creating plans to take over power and to chase the Jews...This movie does exactly that. It shows how Dussander changes into a Nazi again as soon as he puts on the uniform and is ordered to march. And that's only the start. Immediately after he tries to gas and fry a cat in his oven I guess the cat has to stand for the hundreds of Jews which Dussander killed personally and eventually even kills a man...Another problem that I have with the movie is that it shows how Todd starts to study Nazism and the Holocaust and eventually changes into a bad guy himself. If that's true than be very afraid when you meet me because I read a lot of books about WWII as well and yes I even read books about the Nazi's. Never have I felt the need to kill someone or something but if you have to believe this movie than I might turn into a disturbed and hating person myself...If you think that this movie is realistic than I guess you should try to find out more about WWII yourself and especially about the Nazi's because I guess it's fear of the unknown that makes believe that this is a very realistic movie. Oh well as a character study this movie isn't bad. Just don't take it too serious like I did than you won't be very disappointed by it. I give it a 5.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apt Pupil is a film I might possibly consider watching again if I didn't have much to do during the day and had absolutely nothing else to watch including TV. It's one of those transitional films for a director in this case Bryan Singer where from one film that's a success to another there's a bridge in the middle that kind of floats and fizzles before getting a closer look. But it's possible too as I remember it that part of my problem initially with the film wasn't as much with Singer's work as a director as it was with some of the writing. Stephen King's story has a lot of potential and its idea could have different directions in the scope of the tragedy and aftermathstyle horror that comes with a Nazi survivor in everyday America. There could even be a Hitchcok element to it as well with a man who has evil stored somewhere inside and now in a very average American town and indeed what evil thoughts might lie in such averagetown inhabitants And some of that potential is tapped primarily in the very tense underplayed exchanges between Brad Renfro and of course Ian McKellan.In fact I would most likely watch the film again more than any other reason for McKellan who is good as usual if not great and tries his best to elevate the complexities of such a character like Kurt Dussander for the audience. But again the problem goes back to the writing as in the third act the film goes completely off into more of a horror movie mode leaving some of the more serious and interesting questions left to muck around in the scenes where Dussander goes off the deep end. And some of the horror brought to the film and I would guesstimate most of it is from King's original story is subpar itself. King has written some great stories dealing with the horrors of humanity in the 'real' world but Apt Pupil isn't one of them. With all of the effort put in by Renfro as the wayward typically curious and in this case unhinged teen McKellan as the understanding and interesting but later truly monstrous figure and Singer's competent direction it's a shame then that the material itself wasn't totally taken into account. Worth a viewing once at least for King diehards who may find some extra enjoyment from seeing at least one unforgettable scene where McKellan puts back on the uniform and gets into the 'mood' of the oldtimes but it's far from being one of the better Nazi war criminal movies.".

There could even be a Hitchcok element to it as well with a man who has evil stored somewhere inside and now in a very average American town and indeed what evil thoughts might lie in such averagetown inhabitants And some of that potential is tapped primarily in the very tense underplayed exchanges between Brad Renfro and of course Ian McKellan.In fact I would most likely watch the film again more than any other reason for McKellan who is good as usual if not great and tries his best to elevate the complexities of such a character like Kurt Dussander for the audience. But again the problem goes back to the writing as in the third act the film goes completely off into more of a horror movie mode leaving some of the more serious and interesting questions left to muck around in the scenes where Dussander goes off the deep end. And some of the horror brought to the film and I would guesstimate most of it is from King's original story is subpar itself. King has written some great stories dealing with the horrors of humanity in the 'real' world but Apt Pupil isn't one of them. With all of the effort put in by Renfro as the wayward typically curious and in this case unhinged teen McKellan as the understanding and interesting but later truly monstrous figure and Singer's competent direction it's a shame then that the material itself wasn't totally taken into account. Worth a viewing once at least for King diehards who may find some extra enjoyment from seeing at least one unforgettable scene where McKellan puts back on the uniform and gets into the 'mood' of the oldtimes but it's far from being one of the better Nazi war criminal movies.";

The novella was a little bit darker but I think it went out on a limb a little bit with the killing all those winos. The book scared me more than the movie did. I think I like the movie a little bit better. The movie seemed it stuck with blackmail and power. In the book the kid kills his guidance counselor. I like the way the end was done much more in the movie. I believe there was a play on the shotgun comment. You see in the book the kid got a shotgun. In the movie he never liked guns. I think Brad Renfro is a wonderful actor and happens to be the same age as me. The final confrontation with his counselor was written and filmed well. Joshua Jackson has a small role. But plays it well. Back to Apt Pupil. Ian McKellan does an excellent job at the role. I find it kind of strange that he plays a Naziwar criminal and then a Jew in XMen. Yes he was a mutant but what happened to him years ago in the concentration camp had a lot to do with the decisions about humanity later in life. Both roles were done well. Apt Pupil kind of scared you in a way to show you how much power someone can have over you if you screw up. Blackmail. I was fascinated by this movie. The detail of blackmail and power. No I don't plan going around making or showing these things but I would have liked to act in this movie playing Brad Renfro's role. I would give this movie a 9 out 10.".

	schema:headline " What a disappointment! Warning! Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I first read the Stephen King story about a year before the movie was made. It chilled me to the bone.  The story is about a precocious young boy named Todd who through a little detective work discovers that an elderly German gentleman in his neighborhood is actually an escaped Nazi Kurt Dussander who performed unspeakable acts during the Holocaust.  The naive Todd full of curiosity threatens to turn Dussander in unless he tells him in detail all about the horrors of his crimes.  Todd is too young to comprehend the evil he is unleashing upon himself and in the next five years becomes obsessed and consumed by it.  His adolescent fantasies and dreams become ones of violence rather than sex until his desire to kill completely replaces all other desires.  He plays society's game pretending to be interested in school and girls but in the end the evil can no longer be hidden and he falls prey to it.  The movie's most fatal flaw is that it doesn't cover nearly the span of time it should.  Todd's development isn't a part of the movie at all.  What made the book so disturbing is how young and naive Todd was at the beginning and how he grew up with Dussander's evil.  I realize this is difficult to do in a movie but it is possible.  In the movie Todd is pretty much the same age throughout.  The movie also doesn't get into Todd's head.  Todd's lack of interest in sex is mentioned as a footnote in the scene in the car with Becky Trask Betty Trask in the book but it is never developed or explained.  The audience is left saying ...huh??  Stephen King emphasized this aspect of the story in his book for a reason sex is number one in most adolescents' minds but Todd cares only about evil.  Even sex isn't important to him. The ending was quite different in the movie as well but I'm not going to call that a flaw because I thought that Stephen King's ending was rather abrupt.  I can't really decide which ending I prefer.  Neither really completed the story in my opinion.  Psychological thrillers are difficult to portray on screen I know.  But unfortunately this disturbing story was turned into just your average horror flick.  One highlight though was the casting of David Schwimmer as the dorky sneakerwearing guidance counselor Ed French.  He's exactly how I pictured French when I read the book.  Well from what I gather from others who have commented if you haven't read the book you might like this movie.  If you have read the book you'll be disappointed.  Either way I highly recommend the book.".

This is not a bad documentary but as exploration on Dunn's part and constituting a light survey it is not quite so informative as the first.I would further note that this is not a comprehensive documentary on metal throughout the world but is more a metal is spreading to exotic places sort of documentary.

At least Headbanger's Journey had a point. This is documentary filmmaking at its worst. The thesis of the doc is quickly abandoned by spending 75 of its time on American and European bands. Nothing new is discovered... We spend our time chock full of Maiden Slayer Deep Purple. We go to precious few locations and discover in all of South America  home to legions of awesome death metal  just ONE band? SEPULTURA!? In Japan we listen endlessly to Marty Friedman !?!?. We profile XJapan one of the crappiest pop metal bands in existence and then barely skim over the only EXTREMELY popular Japanese black metal band  Sigh. Not only do we only see them briefly recording in the studio we don't even HEAR the actual recording session or talk with them about how they are one of the pioneers of the immense genre. What is this guy out to discover? It's pretty obvious that the filmmakers are not privy to the vast expanse of amazing metal bands numbering in the hundreds of 1000's worldwide. We get very little indication of what the music in each country sounds like and instead we're subjected to Mr. Dunn walking along famous landmarks with underscores by Slayer and other American metal. Discussions are not probing. Everything in this documentary is simply WRONG.I've visited many of these areas and can attest that there are metal heads out there.. everywhere bursting at the seams. There are SO many bands out there  extreme weird interesting  and movements waiting to be discussed. The political nature of these areas is simply glossed over and would've provided a much more indepth and engrossing piece.This needed to be WAY more full of bands NATIVE to each area and entire continents are skipped over.It's fairly clear that the filmmakers did most of their miniscule research on the internet they even state this when they go to China and didn't even dig deep into sites such as Encyclopaedia Metallum which illuminates instantly more about this world than this documentary could've ever hoped to achieve.This film is an abomination to metal and should not be pushed onto the public as true information. At least Metal A Headbanger's Journey was a decent primer on the subject. I watched it with my girlfriend at the time and she instantly understood what I saw in the genre. This film is simple tripe.

GM is the perfect film to show to those spoiled whiny leftwing metal fans in the West how much they take for granted i.e. how good they have it in their evil corrupt democracies. Like all egotistical selfabsorbed pastyfaced princesses Leftists think that the world owes them perfection... Perhaps uselessyetpolitical bands like System Of A Down and Green Day could write some songs about the political situation in countries like Iran Indonesia or India for a change instead of bitching like little girls about how supposedly hard it is to live under the fascist George Bush. Uninformed arrogant populist little PCists...That metal musicians all over the world and not just in the States are quite dumb  and I mean DUMB pity I can't type this word any larger  is proved in form of Indonesia's Tenakorak an antiWestern antiSemitic group. Here's a bunch of losers whose own government oppresses them in their right to listen to their music and yet they find the energy the time and the interest to take up beef with the very distant and ohso evil America. I quote the selfcontradicting singer Zionism must be destroyed... It's not the Jewish people we're against... we want Israel eliminated from the map. Meanwhile this funnylooking metalhead wears a crossedout swastika on the sleeve of his clownish heavy metal leather jacket. This guy should work as a clown in McDonalds.Japan although oversaturated with metal tours for decades now still has a vivacious fanatical scene and a fascinating one too. I think Dunn should make an entire documentary just about the Nipponese scene. There's a hilarious cute moment when two Japanese girls show the devilsign and then run away from the cameras giggling.

Not because he decided to live in Japan I would too given half a chance but because he is genuinely excited over the local glam crap such as XJapan. He even describes their makeup as beautiful.

Yes Max how very nice of you to realize this AFTER THE FACT. Sepultura made their worldwide breakthrough by ripping off Slayer Testament Exodus and just about every other major thrash band on their earlier albums but then almost a decade later does Max suddenly decide to create a new more Brazilian imagesound for his band. What sticking a couple of Amazon Indians into a video while playing lowkey numetal riffs? Is that supposed to make you sound Brazilian? Ironically their best phase was when they were ripping off American bands... Anyone who has heard true tribal Brazilian music will know how laughably deluded Max and co. must have been to promote Roots as some kind of an Indian tribute album.Speaking of Indians one of the highlights of GM was watching 30000 Indian fans experience their first major metal concert. Sure one can do much better than watch those old fogies Iron Maiden but it's a start. The story behind the evolution of China's underground metal scene and its subsequent struggles provided further highlights.Also very interesting was the Israeli segment particularly their stance towards Slayer's Angel Of Death song. Tom Araya almost as if wanting to be funny appears in GM looking like Saddam Hussein of the bunker days. As for the song itself Slayer have gone on record many times saying that they neither put down nor glorify Mengele in AOD. In other words Slayer are morons. I've always said that it's best to ignore the mostly cretinous metal lyrics and just enjoy the music.I have to applaud Dunn for having the cheek to ask Lars Ulrich the internet question. The greedy dwarf didn't seem too convincing in giving his support for Third World countries downloading Metallica's music for free. This guy would take the last dime out of the pocket of a desperate Iranian metal fan. Watch his face closely as he answers the question.

	onyx:emotionText "A distinct improvement over A Headbanger's Journey which was merely an introduction for the uninitiated. GM is the perfect film to show to those spoiled whiny leftwing metal fans in the West how much they take for granted i.e. how good they have it in their evil corrupt democracies. Like all egotistical selfabsorbed pastyfaced princesses Leftists think that the world owes them perfection... Perhaps uselessyetpolitical bands like System Of A Down and Green Day could write some songs about the political situation in countries like Iran Indonesia or India for a change instead of bitching like little girls about how supposedly hard it is to live under the fascist George Bush. Uninformed arrogant populist little PCists...That metal musicians all over the world and not just in the States are quite dumb  and I mean DUMB pity I can't type this word any larger  is proved in form of Indonesia's Tenakorak an antiWestern antiSemitic group. Here's a bunch of losers whose own government oppresses them in their right to listen to their music and yet they find the energy the time and the interest to take up beef with the very distant and ohso evil America. I quote the selfcontradicting singer Zionism must be destroyed... It's not the Jewish people we're against... we want Israel eliminated from the map. Meanwhile this funnylooking metalhead wears a crossedout swastika on the sleeve of his clownish heavy metal leather jacket. This guy should work as a clown in McDonalds.Japan although oversaturated with metal tours for decades now still has a vivacious fanatical scene and a fascinating one too. I think Dunn should make an entire documentary just about the Nipponese scene. There's a hilarious cute moment when two Japanese girls show the devilsign and then run away from the cameras giggling. Priceless. Priceless also was getting the latest update on the whereabouts of Marty Friedman. This guy has quite clearly lost his mind.

Well not that recent but it's genius I can assure you.The story takes place in London and begins in what seems to be a very boring office or at least the work is boring. Because of financial difficulties some employees have to be made redundant. For some other reason foreigners are the first victims. In other words Henri Boulanger Laud is out of the game. Having lost the only thing he really cared for he thinks there's nothing left for him in life and therefore tries to kill himself. Repeatedly. And with mediocre results hanging?

With all the talented British actresses available Kaurismki had to pick an unknown with no charm and a dreadful accent. This slight casting mistake prevents I Hired a Contract Killer from being an undisputed masterwork but like all the other movies on Kaurismki's CV it's still worth your attention.".

If you have seen any Kaurismaki's films you should know that they are different His way of filming and his stories are not normal in the commercial way he seems to keep the distances with the characters and that could be annoying for some people but if you like it you will love all his films. Kaurismaki is a genius and he is funny too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Aki Kaurismki like all true film auteurs creates worlds. Not in the scifi fantasy sense  though I am not excluding scifi merely broadening the concept  but in the subjective sense. Like Jarmusch Fassbinder and Lynch you get a feeling while watching a Kaurismki movie that you are watching something highly personal. And so it goes with his odd and amusing love story I Hired a Contract Killer about a man who wants to kill himself but reconsiders after falling in love.Roll your eyes and say you've seen that kind of movie before but with Kaurismki at the helm you get something genuinely touching without forced pathos incidentalmusic or fauxinspirational endings. Starring JeanPierre Laud the French nouvelle vague star of such movies as American Night and 400 blows IHCK moves us from Kaurismki's usual film location in Helsinki to London. Like the downandout squalor of Kaurismki's working class neighborhoods in Helsinki the London depicted here isn't the refined upperclass cosmopolis depicted in Woody Allen's latest movies rather it's a drab trashstrewn working class London full of thugs and harddrinking wage slaves.JeanPierre is plays Frenchman named Henri who was spent the las 15 years of his life working for the same boring English company. Because of financial difficulties his job has become redundant and foreigners are the first ones to get the ax. Distraught  for his rote day job was the only thing that kept him from selfreflection  Henri decides to kill himself. He attempts to hang himself fails when the rope snaps so he tries to gas himself but a gas strike that day leaves him without gas. The next day he reads an article about hit men operating in the city and decides to hire a hitman to do the job.He finds a lowdown bar in the roughest part of London and ridiculously goes to the bar and orders a ginger ale much to the derision of the roughnecks around him. He announces in his strong French accent that where I come from veee eeet people like you for breakfast. This seems to calm suspicions. He finally meets the underworld boss and hires a contract killer.He spends the next hours anticipating his imminent death by constantly looking over his shoulder and providing clues for the hitman to find him. One such clue is a note on his front door indicating that he has gone out for a pint in the bar across the street. The very night that the hitman is about to finish his job he meets Margaret a young women selling roses and  in typically quirky Kaurismki fashion  immediately falls in love. After barely evading the hitman that night he decides to call off the job. So he goes back to the bar from where he hired him and rather hilariously it has burned down.This is probably the most Hitchcockian Kaurismki has ever gotten but it's an amusing and suspenseful plot device. Henri and Margaret spend the rest of the movie one step ahead of the hitman moving from her small apartment to a hotel and finally with Henri going on the lamb when he finds himself unfairly implicated in a neighborhood hold up. Much like the characters in Jarmush's Down by Law Henri becomes an innocent man with just about everybody against him  and like Jarmush Kaurismki manages to make all his characters endearing and subtly humorous. This great mashup of an absurd Kafkaesquire world nearlyHitchcockian suspense and gentle humor make this a not just a gangster movie parody or a runofthe mill love story but truly a movie with heart.".

It deals with life and its contradictions the preciosity of it changes of mind and regrets how desire between two people can make you see things differently make you want to live on  love regardless of social discrimination that is so beautiful and yet so ideal!

But all the attempts on his own life fail. Still determined he decides to hire a contract killer  and have himself murdered.While waiting for the executioner in his apartment he grows bored and decides to visit a bar across the street. There he indulges himself for the first time in hard liquor and cigarettes. As if this wouldn't be upsetting enough to his short remaining life span he meets a flower girl with bloodred lips.

The contract killer is still on his heels...Kaurismki takes this story as an occasion to revive his cinematic universe people standing at a bar and slowly lifting a glass of beer others sitting in front of wornout wallpapers while smoking a cigarette. The camera lingers as if those quiet moments were a subtle study of humans on the fringes of society. They are connected through the central theme of the film but the main focus lies on Henri Boulanger the former employee. Stoically and with a deadpan face he undergoes the metamorphosis of his existence subtly expressing his newfound hunger for life. Standing in a bar and listening to an unknown guitarist Joe Strummer he lifts his drink and takes a long gulp. From all we know this is the equivalent of a spontaneous expression of joy in Finland. You are required to observe and listen quite carefully but if you do this very refrained way of celebrating the small pleasures of everyday life is not less powerful especially against the background of Henri's rather meaningless existence. Kaursimki doesn't need any loud effects or tearful scenes to convince us he doesn't even need dialogue of which there is very little in the film. He tells the story purely through the images and the strong yet sparing expressions of his protagonists. The lighting of the scenes is somber and full of strong contrasts giving the film it's own unique visual mark. I Hired a Contract Killer is like a slow burning fire that still provides warmth long after the big fireworks are spent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I Hired a Contract Killer unites on the same crossroad two helpless and persistent souls of the world cinema working with a plot that suits them almost perfectly directorwriter Aki Kaurismaki and actor JeanPierre Laud. I include the latter not much because of his real persona but mostly due to his most commonly associated character the troubled Antoine Doinel which in a way could be a figure of a Kaurismaki film and the director takes some advantage of that to make Laud be part of his strange yet dark humored vignettes involving helpless characters dealing with meaningless lives until they find exquisite solutions for their problems. The eternal Doinel usually confident and striving for a certain goal as evidenced in his later adventures post The 400 Blows gives space to Henri Boulanger a French subordinate working on a bureaucratic position at a British company utterly lost and alone until the day he gets fired from there receiving as a gift a broken gold watch. With the money he still has he decides to hire a hitman to kill him since he's too yellow to kill himself. Why bother sticking around now that he really hit rock bottom with no job no people who care for him and being just another foreigner living in a cold and distant place. But the man who brought us Ariel and Shadows in Paradise has to give Henri a turnaround that can save his life and also complicates things even more. He falls for a flower girl Margi Clarke who corresponds such love they move in together despite the fact he has nothing to offer to her but the hired killer Kenneth Corley is still tracking him down and he is destined to fulfill his contract and kill Henri. Typical of Kaurismaki who always finds humor in desolated characters and awkward situations. Everything is strangely life affirming without getting near the corny clichs of Hollywood.The union between Kaurismaki and Laud is the main ingredient to enjoy such story not as dark as it sounds but eventually nightmarish as Henri's problems becomes more and more unnerving hilarious to some but we all know that Aki's films are only amusing to very few who can actually laugh out loud  though that's not the director's intentions he prefers the contained laughters. It's interesting to see Laud becoming the antiDoinel here someone who is far removed from any chance of accomplishing anything always escaping and giving up easily. But fate helps them both in unexpected and intriguing ways. And we laugh at their confusion while facing the obstacles life throws at them. Compared with other Kaurismaki films I've seen and Doinel's five films I Hired a Contract Killer is miles away of being equally great as the forementioned examples. And for the first time I identified more with the drama than with the comedy since most of the elements given were too hollow and so narrow with the drama that I couldn't find them much funny  characteristic of the Finnish creator but more effective in his other films. Another downer was having to deal with Laud's poor English practically impossible to understand. Why not make Henri meeting with a French girl so there could be a real sense of connection between both and captions so we can read instead of hearing forced accents? Aside that there's room for some fine suspense and a great musical cameo by Joe Strummer. What's to be learned? With Doinel films I feel hope courage and the sense that things can get better even with some losses on the way. Now with Henri's story I know things can get worse but we can always push harder for one more day and see what happens next. A very needed film in darker times because we all need to laugh at the absurd. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "The settings are suitably grim and grimy. Most of the cast are oddly antisocial enough to fit neatly into the Kaurismaki vision of sixties' London bleakness. JeanPierre Leaud is morbidly deadpan in a truly Finnish way. Kenneth Colley is a wistful hitman par excellence. The stifling dullness of the Orwellian ministry and the heartstopping nature of abrupt redundancy are beautifully drawn. The only thing that drags this movie down from Kaurismaki's usual lofty heights of cruel farce is the awful wooden performance by Margi Clarke as the love interest. I have no idea why she was chosen ahead of the other 3 billion women on the planet to play the role but she stinks up the place something rotten. She is so grimly unconvincing that I was grinding my teeth within ten minutes of her introduction. What should have been a brilliant dark comedy was turned into a dire soap episode by an artless performance of hitherto unimaginable ineptitude. It would appear that sublime irony is not her strongpoint. Nor is holding onto a single convincing accent for the duration. From Liverpool to Roedean in an hour. Hello nosebleed.I've seen her play her usual gobby scouser part in innumerable gritty TV dramas and found her bearable at worst. But here she kills the atmosphere stone dead with her awful timing and dismal delivery. If only her performance was a joke of the so bad it's good variety but it isn't. It's just lame. I'm assuming that Aki cast her on the strength of Letter to Brezhnev or his brother's HelsinkiNapoli but rarely has anyone been so wretchedly miscast in any of his movies. Even Joe Strummer comes out smelling of rosesand beer and cigs. A real shame because the mood of the movie is fantastic. The props and locations are homages to a London long since redeveloped. The giant Corona bottle in the pub is a particularly neat touch. As is the fact that everyone's smoking Players and Capstans. Worth a remake with a decent actress who has some understanding of irony and understatement.".

	onyx:emotionText "The settings are suitably grim and grimy. Most of the cast are oddly antisocial enough to fit neatly into the Kaurismaki vision of sixties' London bleakness. JeanPierre Leaud is morbidly deadpan in a truly Finnish way. Kenneth Colley is a wistful hitman par excellence. The stifling dullness of the Orwellian ministry and the heartstopping nature of abrupt redundancy are beautifully drawn. The only thing that drags this movie down from Kaurismaki's usual lofty heights of cruel farce is the awful wooden performance by Margi Clarke as the love interest. I have no idea why she was chosen ahead of the other 3 billion women on the planet to play the role but she stinks up the place something rotten. She is so grimly unconvincing that I was grinding my teeth within ten minutes of her introduction. What should have been a brilliant dark comedy was turned into a dire soap episode by an artless performance of hitherto unimaginable ineptitude. It would appear that sublime irony is not her strongpoint. Nor is holding onto a single convincing accent for the duration. From Liverpool to Roedean in an hour. Hello nosebleed.I've seen her play her usual gobby scouser part in innumerable gritty TV dramas and found her bearable at worst. But here she kills the atmosphere stone dead with her awful timing and dismal delivery. If only her performance was a joke of the so bad it's good variety but it isn't. It's just lame.

	schema:reviewBody "Very early in his career the Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismki established an aesthetic for his films in colour that has held for decades now the characters are bluecollar people struggling to get by and whatever emotions they feel their lines of hatred love hope or disappointment are communicated in an utterly deadpan monotone fashion. The scenery is usually drab industrial buildings and rusting dockyards. Kaurismki's 1990 film I HIRED A CONTRACT KILLER moves that formula developed in his native Helsinki to London. This is not the posh London of the royal family bankers or socialites. Kaurismki managed to find completely dilapidated locations that I would have never imagined to exist in London of that time though no doubt they've long since been gentrified beyond recognition at this point.Henri Boulanger JeanPierre Laud a timid Frenchman living in London with no apparent friends or surviving family has worked for fifteen years for a state utility. When he is made redundant in a bit of Thatcherera privatization he feels he has nothing more to live for. He attempts suicide twice both tries ending in morbidly humorous failure and he lacks the courage to try any further. He decides to enter the East End criminal underworld and to hire a paid assassin to kill him. The mob boss takes Henri's money and tells him it will be done through a subcontractor. But when Henri meets the lovely Margaret Margi Clarke and starts coming out of his shell he suddenly has second thoughts. Unable to call off the job he and Margaret try to evade the hitman Kenneth Colley already on Boulanger's trail.Kaurismki's films are to a large extent dark comedies and there are some laughs here. I also appreciated the element of homage to Kaurismki's forebears and peers here. Colley's sad hitman and the way the shots frame him was surely drawn from the crime capers that JeanPierre Melville shot in his last years. Kaurismki's perennial love for drab scenery had been boosted by his newly established friendship with Jim Jarmusch a director who presented America at this time as so many vacant lots and abandoned buildings.Still I wouldn't consider this among Kaurismki's best work. One of the things that makes Kaurismki's main Finnishlanguage output so hilarious is that the characters speak in literary Finnish nearly a different language than colloquial Finnish. When the dialogue is in English and with a mix of UK accents the formula is not quite as effective. JeanPierre Laud's English is almost incomprehensible  the actor has been a titan of French film since the New Wave of Truffaut and Godard but he's not proficient enough in English to do Englishlanguage cinema. Kaurismki no doubt wanted intended the character to sound that way but it feels off for this viewer. I'd recommend this film only to those who have enjoyed a series of Kaurismki's stronger films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The powerful criminal and leader of a spy ring Haghi Rudolf Klein Rogge uses his spies that are infiltrated everywhere including in the secret service in attempts to steal documents from the French Embassy in Shanghai and from the Minister of Trade that is murdered. The press questions and mocks the officials in charge of security of state and the efficient Agent No. 326 a.k.a. the vagrant Hans Pockzerwinski Willy Fritsch is summoned by the Secret Service Chief Craighall Sherry to investigate the wave of crimes. Agent 326 immediately identifies that his chief's assistant Vincent is a spy that is providing inside information to the evil mastermind that no one knows how looks like. Meanwhile Haghi saves the scoundrel Hans Morrier Louis Ralph from the gallows to serve him. Then Haghi who is also the general director of the Haghi Bank blackmails Mrs. Leslane Hertha von Walther who is the wife of the powerful Roger Lesland and habitu of an opium den to get information of the Japanese Secret Treaty. When Haghi assigns his master spy Sonya Baranilkowa Gerda Maurus to get closer to the elegant Agent No. 326 they unexpectedly fall in love for each other affecting Haghi's evil scheme. Meanwhile his spy Kitty Lien Deyers lures and seduces the reserved and efficient Japanese agent Akira Matsumoto Lupu Pick to steal his documents about the recently signed Treaty that may bring war to the world.Spies is a fantastic epic of espionage romance seduction and betrayal by Fritz Lang and I dare to say that James Bond stories might have been inspired in this film. I saw Spies yesterday in a restored authorized edition of the DVD released by Kino Video and in the Extras there is the amazing story of the restoration of this film. The 35 mm archives in nitrate throughout the world were very damaged and incomplete but this complex version was assembled from several copies using the guidance of the copy from Prague that was the most complete and also deteriorated. The result is a film of 143 minutes running time meaning 50 minutes longer than any version previously released. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Os Espies The Spies".

	schema:headline " Whose blood shall I wear around my neck tonight?";
	schema:reviewBody "One of things that I think attracts young film fans to German cinema from the Weimar period is that it displays a striking stylistic extremism that captivates modern viewers not yet used to silent cinema. This ranges from Murnau's technical effects extravaganzas to Lubitsch's offthewall comedy creations and of course Fritz Lang's angular architecture and comicbook sense of adventure.A mistaken impression with these pictures is that they got to be so stylised because of a higher degree of artistic freedom in the European studios. However UFA studios were just as much about collaboration and commercialism as those in Hollywood. While individual directors did have a lot of control over the look of their pictures these overt styles owe more to the influence of German theatre as well as German literature painting and the opera.As with any cinema anywhere one of the most important collaborators is the screenwriter. No matter how strong or attentiongrabbing your visual style is if you haven't got the story you haven't got anything. Spione features one of the best efforts from Lang's collaborator and wife Thea von Harbou and is in many ways a tightenedup reworking of Dr Mabuse. Whereas that earlier picture was full of unnecessarily long title cards Spione is far more succinct allowing the audience to fill in the gaps. Importantly it begins with a lengthy piece of pure silent storytelling which helps to engage us before bombarding us with verbal information. Harbou's characters are also very strong. It's a nice touch to make archvillain Haghi wheelchair bound  a man who is weak in body but strong in means and influence.Lang himself was by now a master of his own highly individual technique. Space and set dcor should be important to every director but Lang is probably the only one who tells his stories more through architecture than through actors. With rooms so bizarre and angular they would probably drive most people mad if they had to live or work in them Lang sets a tone for each location and thus for each scene. Narrow corridors give a sense of entrapment open doorways leading onto larger spaces give a sense of uneasiness crisscrossing diagonals carve up the screen often drawing our attention to things and people. One thing that especially stands out in Spione is that way Lang often creates compositions that are almostbutnotquite symmetrical. Just as a great colour director like Vincente Minnelli might throw in a splash of blue to offset and thus bring to life a shot full of shades of red Lang adds for example the nurse standing to one side of an otherwise symmetrical shot of Haghi sat at his desk.Even Lang's choice of camera position was strictly angular. He is either to one side detached from the action or he is right inside it with actors staring straight into the lens. He rarely uses say opposing overtheshoulder shots that many directors would for intimate dialogue scenes but his methods were nonetheless effective. Spione in fact features one of his most beautifully constructed romantic scenes in the first meeting between Willy Fritsch and Gerda Maurus. Lang begins with the camera to one side simply filming the meeting as a casual observer. He then begins placing the camera between them interspersed with closeups of hands or other objects making us experience the growing emotional intensity as well as that slight feeling of awkwardness. We then return to a shot to the side of the actors but closer this time as they move in for their first kiss. In spite of his reputation Lang could be incredibly tender and sentimental at times.Exaggerated acting tends to be part and parcel of that overthetop nature of German silent cinema and in the case of Lang's features it is often particularly apt given the comicbook style characters and situations. Spione is no exception but it is nice to see the normally animated Rudolf KleinRogge getting to underplay it a little as a cool and collected villain. Lupu Pick also gives a very deep and emotionally complex performance as the Japanese ambassador.The upshot of this collaboration is an incredibly exciting and satisfying picture even though it is rarely referenced as one of Fritz Lang's best. If it is remembered at all it is usually for its resemblance to later gadgetbased espionage thrillers as well as containing many of the suspense building techniques later employed by Hitchcock such as letting the audience in on things the characters do not know. It is nevertheless among the most carefully constructed exciting and purely enjoyable of Lang's silent pictures and an improvement on the betterknown Dr Mabuse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spies is much more entertaining than you would expect an old German silent movie to be and at first it's hard to say why. The character types are familiar from hundreds of other spy movies a villain who is bent on world domination and has multiple secret identities a beautiful blonde who works as a spy for the villain a dashing enemy agent who falls in love with the female spy. The plot is fairly ludicrous though it moves along briskly and provides for some great setpieces such as an exhilarating chase scene. But despite all the clichs found in Spies the movie still feels fresh and vital. You get drawn into the world of the film and accept the clichs rather than becoming distracted by them. I'm sure most of the credit for this has to go to the director Fritz Lang. His films Metropolis M often have a very dark world view but the overall tone of Spies is escapist adventurefantasy. It aims to provoke thrills not shock or outrage. Lang creates some stunning visual compositions and proves to be a very detailoriented directorhe delights in closeups of spy gadgetry! His innovative use of montages dramatic lighting camera movement and other techniques gives the film an interesting stylization. I'm writing this review after watching the 90minute American version of Spies. But I had such a good time that I may have to seek out the 146minute version!".

	schema:reviewBody "Spione Spies is a Fritz Lang film about spy espionage. The plot is strangely more complicated than more recent spy flicks which is a good thing. The film focuses on No. 326 a spy that is responsible for investigating leads on a mysterious mastermind that controls a network of spies. The mastermind known as Haghi plots to steal an important treaty. It turns out that he leads a double life as the owner of a successful bank which apparently makes him richer than Henry Ford. Things get complicated when Haghi sends a female spy Sonya to prevent No. 326 from interfering. Sonya falls in love with No. 326 while still under the supervision of Haghi leading to the usual conflicts.The acting and characterization was wonderful. Haghi is the definition of bad guy you know he is evil when you see the goatee. Confined to a wheelchair he is the perfect blend of intelligence and deceptiveness. Agent No. 326 is an interesting character although he loses some of his features as the film progresses. Sonya is beautiful and acted wonderfully. Among the side characters I found that Colonel Jellusic and Doctor Masimoto stood out.Although a little overlong the film is at no point slow. Mixing fast pacing with wellplaced plot twists which really build up towards the end anyone with interest in the subject should have no problem enjoying it for the entire running time.I was not sure what to expect from Spione before watching it seeing that it is a largely forgotten film. I enjoy Fritz Lang films and this was no exception. It may not be the caliber of M but it succeeds anyway. If you do not mind silent films and enjoy the spyespionage genre namely James Bond then you will enjoy this one.".

And the film has one of the greatest finale of all time.Spoilers Ahead!!! But then there are some really stupid scenes like when Haghi the bad guy shoots him self in the head but still talks and stands on his own to feet. And if Haghi was so powerful why didn't he just have No. 326 shot in the beginning in stead of waiting it out? And why should a spy working for the government help a women who has just shot a man like he does for Sonya? And I have to say that the love story between No. 326 and Sonya was way too much over the top.Spoilers Finished!!! But don't misunderstand me. I think it was an fantastic film 810 better than Dr. Mabuse der Spieler  Ein Bild der Zeit 1922. It was also interesting to see how much Bond has borrowed from it. It also reminded me of North by Northwest 1959 by Hitch. Not to mention Dr. Mabuse. I really felt like I was watching Dr. Mabuse no. II.I saw the Masters Of Cinema edition of the film R2. The transfer is amazing. Extremely well done. I didn't care so much for the music though.".

	schema:headline " The Whole James Bond Spy Genre Came From This Film!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is great film making.The whole 'James Bond' spy genre came from this film. It has it all. First we have Haghi the physically flawed here wheelchair bound and exhaling cigarette smoke out of only one nostril but evil genius masterminding a global plot. He's played by the great Rudolf KleinRogge who was the too hammy Rotwang in 'Metropolis' 1927 he totally dominates the film in terms of screen time and acting. In his 'evil' disguise he has two others he looks just like Lenin! Then we have the Secret Service spy hero known as Number 326 Willy Fritsch who falls in love and has an affair with his Russian spy counterpart Sonya Gerda Maurus. Even the 'dialog' sequences between Haghi and Sonya have a Bondish flair! There's the female spy who seduces the Japanese diplomat to steal the Secret Treaty with Japan. Then there's the seemingly international cast of Germans Japanese and a black bartender and the movement between countries. There are the high tech gadgets from the buttons on Haghi's desk to the lapel minicamera and the screen relaying spy messages and the abundance of spies moles and counterspies. Then comes the suspenseful plot to kill 326 on a train going to 'the border.' Finally the exciting dangerous rescue of Sonya and the last undoing of Haghi. All this in a silent movie of 1928! The masterful cinematography by Lang and his crew make this film immensely watchable. There are fantastic dissolves and rapid cutting great close framing and wonderful tracking shots. What a text book of film making! The addition of a modern soundtrack to the KINO version which uses various instruments piano flute bassoon koto bongos and other instruments in solo duet trio and ensemble passages is little more than amazing and is without a doubt one of the most appropriate soundtracks ever made for a silent film. The music adds emphasis and feeling to every shot. One of the best moments is when the Japanese diplomat deeply guilt ridden for allowing the evil spy Kitty Lien Deyer in her first film to seduce him and steal the Treaty commits ritual suicide seppuku in a tatami mat room with koto and piano playing a duet symbolizing the clash of cultures. Masterful! Another fantastic modern soundtrack is the KINO one for 'Woman in the Moon' 1929 also directed by Lang and also starring Gerda Maurus and Willy Fritsch.There are a couple of minor glitches however. Willy Fritsch is not a rough tough sexy Bond figure but just moons over Sonya like a little puppy dog whenever he sees her but Gerda Maurus as Sonya aware of her dual role as his enemy  lover though he at first is not does a much better job because she displays the range of conflicted feelings appropriate to the role and without overacting. The other problem is the train wreck. It's not really made clear what train Sonya was on and why she wasn't involved in the crash of the two trains. This problem may have stemmed from the fact that this film has been reconstructed from various sources primarily from an Austrian print.So I'll give it a 9 not a 10 but it is certainly a film to be seen and guaranteed to be enjoyed by anyone whether knowledgeable about silent films or not.".

	schema:headline " Good points bad points you know Lang has his share";
	schema:reviewBody "Fritz Lang is not a writer or director prone to following narrative conventions too closely. While that is admirable artistically it can make his films relatively difficult viewing and risky. It's difficult because you can't expect Lang's films to have stories that unfold in a traditional way so as a viewer you have to work harder and it's risky because the experimental nature doesn't always result in a successful finished artwork. Metropolis 1927 and Fury 1936 are two examples of Lang films with unusual approaches that work extremely well. M 1931 is an example of one that isn't quite so successful in my opinion even though many people seem to love it. Spies is somewhere in the middle.Like M Spies begins with more of a thematic collage. We're immediately dropped into a fastpaced fastcut sequence of spies stealing important documents and killing others when expedient. We also see news of this quickly filtering through both the spy world and the official media organizations. The sequence is impressive technically but most viewers will be searching for the characters to latch onto. Also like M Lang doesn't let viewers off that easily. He constantly introduces new characters for at least the first 40 minutes of the 90minute U.S. version. A number of the characters look similar and most do not have much accompanying exposition to help viewers ground them. Making it more difficult inter titles this is a silent film where characters' names are first presented often appear between two scenes with different characters so that it's difficult to figure out which character the inter title is supposed to apply to.Additionally the story is complex enough and hinges on small details to an extent where it can be difficult to follow on a first viewing. I had to watch the film twice to feel confident that I had a grasp on the plot. By the end of the first viewing you know who the principle characters are so on the second viewing you can focus more on them rather than the countless ancillary characters who keep appearing and disappearing.It might be difficult to count this as a flaw. There's no reason that films should be 100 accessible on a first viewing and in fact if you're someone who likes to watch a film more than once a gradual unfolding on repeated exposures can be more desirable. But it's best to be forewarned. Expect to be confused unless you keep a scorecard so to speak and keep hitting pause.However once you've sorted the film out the basic gist turns out to be fairly simple and straightforward. An antigovernment the exact government isn't specifiedit's rather left intentionally vague except that we know it's somewhere in Europe spy organization headed by a man named Haghi Rudolf KleinRogge is after some important treaty. There are three copies of it and Haghi is trying to intercept them all. Haghi's principle foe is the government's Secret Service Agency which ends up putting a James Bondlike agent named 326 or Donald Tremaine Willy Fritsch on the case. Haghi sends his agent Sonia Gerda Maurus to gain information and hopefully the treaty from Tremaine. He also enlists the help of a convict whom he helped bust out of death row Hans Morrier Louis Ralph. Complications arise when Sonia and Donald fall in love. Haghi tries to get at another Secret Service affiliate Doctor Masimoto Lupu Pick through another attractive female spy Kitty Lien Deyers. There is a lot of double crossing and there are a lot of spy versus spy machinations. The film focuses on these and the difficult romance as Haghi does the typical megalomaniacal evil genius thing of trying to take over the world although just how he plans to do this with a treaty and his odd combination of public vocations remains a mystery.Lang is often thought of as a heavily visual director. In conjunction with infamous cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who lensed such masterpieces as F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu 1922 Lang doesn't disappoint on that end. There are a number of conspicuously arty shots such as a complex of staircases in Haghi's bank Cabinet of Dr. Caligari 1920like rooftops or the marvelously fantastical imagery of the final clown performance you have to see the film to understand why there's a clown in it but Lang and Wagner are just as good with more subtle compositions.But there are flaws too. Even viewing the film a couple times the overly complex details of the plot can be hard to follow and many are left as dangling threads. The overall gist of the plot is good and Spies certainly has influenced subsequent films in the genre but there are script problems here.Although Lang is good at creating suspense when he wants to for most of M he didn't seem interested in it and he does do effectively quite a few times here he still directs and edits action scenes a bit awkwardly. Also the U.S. 90minute version is satisfactorily paced which helps the suspense but it is also obviously sped up. The film was shot at 16 frames per minute and IMDb lists the original version at almost twice as long. If Spies were slowed down to run close to 3 hours the pacing would be off. The plot would unfold too slowly.For me this is a middling silent film as well as a middling Lang film thus earning my 7 rating or a C but worth watching for serious fans of thrillers crime and espionage flicks. As always Lang is a good ideas man and this film can make you feel as if the whole world must consist of spies or at least people whom you can't exactly trust.".

As a result I was caught a little offguard for the opening scenes but you quickly get used to it and it's quite surprising how little you miss dialogue in terms of plot progression as lengthy conversations are neatly summed up in a few lines.That being said if you don't have the patience for it and unfortunately I don't the silent dialogue prevents you from really engaging with the film and to be honest at two and a half hours its absence is more than noticeable. The longer the film goes on and let's face it it does go on the more frustrating the conversations become as characters talk for around thirty seconds only for the summaries to be a short sentence. While I appreciate that pacing contributes to the film's suspense it does become ridiculous and you're left to wonder why it's all taking so long. The silence also obviously hampers the acting but they all appear to be types anyway look out for the terrible moustaches and the score doesn't really help much the version I saw had one added by Donald Sosin often sounding like some guy has had a bit too much fun with his keyboard the car chase music is particularly bad.However it is fantastically well setup and shot especially considering it is nearly eighty years old and the stylistic influences on later directors such as Hitchcock are obvious. It is probably for this reason that it has stood the test of time. As a story it is also quite interesting and clever it just suffers from some tedious pacing issues.So overall if you have the patience and the two and a half hours it's worth watching as it is well shot and has an interesting storyline. However if you have little patience and a short attention span you're likely to come away from Spies a little frustrated.".

As a story it is also quite interesting and clever it just suffers from some tedious pacing issues.So overall if you have the patience and the two and a half hours it's worth watching as it is well shot and has an interesting storyline. However if you have little patience and a short attention span you're likely to come away from Spies a little frustrated.";

	schema:reviewBody "Spione or Spies is another Fritz Lang silent film from over 85 years ago. It is of course as always with him still in blackandwhite and runs for no less than 145 minutes. At least this applies to the version I watched. Maybe yours is different as there are as always with these old films many different versions out there most of them restored. The cast includes several fairly famous actors from other pretty wellknown silent film classics such as Rudolf KleinRogge. The novel here came from Lang's longtime companion Thea von Harbou and the 2 also came up with the script. But only Lang directed as always.I must say I was a bit disappointed with this one. It has a couple good moments but the material is not as good in quality to justify a quantity of almost 150 minutes. I like good spy movies especially tense ones but I cannot say this is one of them. Maybe it would have been at 100 minutes max. In any case it would have been a lot better than this one here. I have seen several films of Lang and while I would not say it is his worst it is also nowhere near his best. There are several sequences that drag a lot. As a result of all this I cannot recommend the watch. Disappointing experience. Thumbs down.".

''Spies'' sadly is incredibly average. Don't get me wrong this film has great moments. The opening is thrilling. The train scene is suspenseful. And the last 10 minutes are really good. Everything in between is uninteresting and drawn out. I got bored a lot this is coming from somebody who loves 2001 A Space Odyssey and found myself looking at the time displeased. I usually despise when studios cut films Metropolis but Paramount was smart in cutting this from 130 minutes to 90 minutes. I got the pleasure of seeing an original Paramount copy at the Denver Silent Film Festival and found myself enjoying Spies much more. In conclusion ''Spies'' has some standout sequences but is a major step down from ''Metropolis''".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion. It is one of the most influential movies ever made. A lot of the elements in this movie are used a lot in the James Bond movies. Handsome hero with a number as codename beautiful heroine who originally had to manipulate the hero but ultimately falls in love. She was Russian by the way. Which Ian Fleming used a lot in his novels and which can be seen in the James Bond movies today. Even the villain in 'Spione' are copied in a lot of spy and action movies a mastermind who has an eye for everything always two steps ahead of his enemies. Indeed those important elements are used in a lot of movies today. So much that it is almost ordinary but there really is no denying how important they are and how this movies has influenced many many movies.Now the story and plot reminds a lot of 'Casino Royale' so I am tempted to say Ian Fleming has seen the movie and taken the story and plot to write his ultimate spy novel Great book the movie barely does justice to the novel although it is a good movie. The movie's themes are moral and humanity. The moral is explored through the characters and the fight between good and evil. The movie was thorough with it and it is not hard to understand since many movies copy it. The humanity theme is explored by making the villains more humane and has as much screen time as the heroes. Usually the bad guys are portrayed as those inhuman monsters but here the main villain Haghi is very humane although cold and calculating that made him scary. Which in turn gave him a very strong screen presence.The genre of the movie is thriller. That is what spy movies should be thrillers. Not action movies full of Rambos. The movie is full of mystery and intrigue as well as suspense and tension. Which modern spy movies usually lack. Spy movies should be character and plot driven because that's where it is most exciting in my opinion not fueled by car chases and explosions. It comes from a guy who prefers visuals rather than plot story and characters. Because that is what makes this movie so grand and that is what makes 'Casino Rayale' so great that is what makes them stand the test of time. Fritz Lang as usual was awe inspiring in his direction unusually for its time even unusual today he spent as much time on his villain as much as he did on his hero. Alfred Hitchcock did that too and Dario Argento. I am not sure of how much influence Lang had on Hitchcock but I know how much influence he had on Argento. Argento like Lang spent a lot of time on his villains and being more of a visual storyteller. Argento's movies even have German Expressionism feel in their acting. Dario Argento has named Fritz Lang as one of his influences.Now it is a highly influential movie and one of the most important movies ever made so it should not be missed for movie enthusiasts. I would like to give the movie 1210 but the limit is 1010 I can't point out enough how strong and influential this movie is because it really is the granddaddy of all spy movies. Awesome movie that only a few movies have matched.".

The villain is dastardlylooking banker Rudolf KleinRogge as Haghi who sits behind his desk in a wheelchair looking absolutely wicked. This mastermind has killed several agents and assigns beautiful Gerda Maurus as Sonya Baranilkowa to hit on Fritsch. Naturally they fall in love and make things complicated. In fact the plot and subplots of this spy drama are not easy to follow. The story was adapted from the likewise titled novel by Thea von Harbou aka Mrs. Fritz Lang. If your mind wanderers it may be because this film has been restored to a length reportedly greater than any previous edition. This is great for film historians but could induce boredom for the uninitiated. However the production is firstrate and Mr. Lang's work is quite artful. You might need to watch Spione twice.

View on the filmBefore I get to the movieI have to mention that Masters of Cinema have given the title a wonderful imagewith the newly done original cut having a surprisingly clear picture for its agewith Masters sticking to Lang's final cutby even including the original intertitles.Restrained from splashing out after almost making the studio go bust over Metropoliscowriteralong with the soon to be exMrs Lang Thea von Harboudirecting auteur Fritz Lang gives the title an elegantly stylised appearance.Giving Haghi his own evil lairLang and cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner dip the movie into SciFias Haghi delivers his commands by pressing brightly lit buttons.Keeping the SciFi mood locked in Haghi's lairLang gives his spies a marvellous Film Noir playgroundwith the mistrust that the spies have for each otherbeing subtly expressed by casting them against deep lowlightingwhich are litup by sharp hits of rain.Slowly revealing the danger that the spies are caught inLang hits the action scenes with an explosive energyby covering them in tightly held close ups which drive a deep sense of on the edge tension into the title.Filmed as Germany was sinking deep in inflation the screenplay by Lang  Thea von Harbou takes a ruthless allegorical dissecting of the Weimar Republicby making Haghi a respected bank director who uses cold hard cash to get his waywhilst the spies are dehumanised by their names being replaced by numberswhich the agency register in mug shot books in order to keep tabs on them.Along with the allegorical elementsLang  Harbou also deliver a paranoid fuelled Film Noir.Taking the risqu PreCodestyle route of making Lady Leslane an opium addictthe writers reveal that along with his hands of cash that Haghi is also a master at taking advantage of peoples weaknesseswhich along with agent 326 taking the espionage in a gripping international directionsets the stage for a spione curtain call.";

Also it deals with some touchy subjects such as prostitution never called that but it's there. The acting is a little over the top but that's to be expected in silent movies. But there is a wonderful if frightening performance by Grete Berger as Mrs. Schwibe. My only complaint is that this film is shown in flashback which somewhat dilutes the drama that's why I'm only giving it a 9. Still this is a great silent film. It's not up to Muranu's Nosferatu or Sunrisebut then what is? Well worth seeing.".

Lorenz pays a visit to his wealthy and wary aunt and pawnbroker Schwabe Grete Berger to borrow some money to buy an appropriate suit since he believes that he will become a successful writer and make lots of money with the royalties of his poems. However he is followed by a swindler Anton Edthofer that dates Schwabe and they spend the borrowed money in a cabaret where Lorenz meets Melanie.

But the swindler suggests a scheme to Lorenz.Phantom is a moralist tale of corruption of human character and redemption by F.W. Murnau. The story is divided in six acts and has flaws and lack of explanation for many situations but since the film was reconstructed and restored in 2003 by the BundesarchivFilmarchiv of Berlin parts of the original work might be missing. The dramatic plot has many parallel stories entwined through the lead character Lorenz.I saw this film in a Brazilian DVD with a nice soundtrack and in accordance with the Wikipedia the first screening of Phantom in Brazil was on 30 October 2008 on the 120th anniversary of F.W.

The story revolves around a man obsessed with an unattainable woman and his attempts to substitute for his unfulfilled desires. My biggest issue with the film was with Alfred Abel as Lorenz in the lead. He was great in Metropolis in a totally different role but here he looked too old for the part and out of place not quite finding the firm ground to build the character. Other players were good especially Aud Egede Nissen as Lorenz's sister Melanie. Worth a look for Murnau's style but a let down overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "PHANTOM is a very heavyhanded morality tale of a simple man who inexplicably becomes infatuated with a woman after seeing her only briefly. Despite being a seemingly nice guy he throws his life away and the film revels in this spiral as well as the parallel story of his sister who becomes a prostitute.While the film on technical merits isn't bad it did have some inventive camera work it was a major letdown since it was directed by the legendary director F. W. Murnau. Had it been done by some studio hack then I could understand why this film was so hokey and unbelievablebut from Murnau his fans have come to expect so much more.Unlike some reviews on IMDb mine is a bit unusual in that I have now seen just about every known Murnau film in existence today PHANTOM was the last and so I can compare it to the body of his work. Clearly it is the worst of his films and lacks the magic and genius that Murnau is known for having. You might be surprised to hear that although his most famous film is NOSFERATU it may not be his best filmmostly because NOSFERATU like PHANTOM seems a tad oldfashioned and stiltedeven for 1922. This can be forgiven in NOSFERATU because despite these lulls the rest of the film is so transcendent and amazingmaking it one of the greatest silent films of all time. There is nothing about PHANTOM that can make you overlook the very dated plotit's just heavyhanded and not particularly memorable.As I said Murnau made some truly amazing films. Aside from NOSFERATU he is most famous for the Oscarwinning SUNRISE but neither of these is my favorite. I love and recommend you see FAUST because the camera work and artistry is just amazingmaking Goethe's story a freshness and style that just have to be seen to believed. I also liked it because I unfortunately have read the very long book Faust and found the film actually made me like the story! THE LAST LAUGH and TARTUFF are also simply wonderful films that any serious student of German cinema must see.So my advice is to watch PHANTOM if you like but if you aren't acquainted with F. W. Murnau's films try any of the others firstotherwise you might not be able to detect his genius and deftness.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I remember correctly it was Peter Greenaway who wrote a few years ago that in the near future one will be able to make films about how somebody thinks and not only about what somebody does. When this time will be here one should remember F.W. Murnau's Phantom 1922 which does exactly what Greenaways was speaking about. Lorenz Lubota is a little scribe likes books and would like to be a poet. One day on his way to work he is hit by a carriage. In this moment he sees Veronika the daughter of a rich merchant and chases from now on her picture like a phantom. It fills up his whole thinking and feeling. He even goes to her parents' house in order to ask for her hand. After he is thrown out he stops working neglects his belongings and sinks deeper and deeper in despair. I cannot remember whether anyone else in the silent time has made more appropriate use of tinting in order to show the inside of a person than Murnau did. By chance Lorenz meets Melitta who looks like a twin of Veronika. However she cheats on him and demands money which he does not have. So he steals it and even lies to his aunt whom he tells that he needs the money for having his poesies printed as books. Not long after his aunts finds out about the truth and threatens to turn him in to the police. So one night Lorenz and one of his new colleagues break into the house of the aunt. When they are caught by her the colleague kills her. Lorenz goes to prison as an accessory. When he is released the daughter of his former boss waits for him telling him that she always loved him. Besides the unrealistic and rather fairytalelike end this movie shows many motives that Murnau would use in the subsequent year when he shot Nosferatu. One could say that in Phantom he filmed the imaginary world whereas in Nosferatu he projected this imaginary world as a substrate of abyssless gore into the outside world. However one could also say that Lorenz at the end is rightfully awarded by a loving wife because he belonged to the very few people who really believed in a phantom and even gave up his whole existence for it. And simply the fact that a phantom can exist in our real brain proves its reality isn't that so?".

	schema:headline " Wow! Was Lorenz not the biggest whiner in cinema history?";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say from the film's opening I am confused on some of the details. If you took out that confusion factor I'd give this a nine because it is a deep haunting tale almost a noir except twenty years before noir's inception. What movies could we have had to look back on if F.W. Murnau had lived into the 1940's and experimented with noir as Fritz Lang did? Lorenz Lubota Alfred Abel is a city clerk doing a boring menial job. He escapes by writing poetry. He has a younger brother who barely figures into the plot and goes to art school. He has a younger sister who is a party girl who dabbles in prostitution. His mother loves her children but her bitterness is so deep it is almost contagious. She is bitter over her poverty this can't do much for Lorenz' self esteem since he is the provider for the entire family and bitter about her estranged sister's success as a pawnbroker with no mercy who has accumulated great wealth from her profession.Lorenz is loved in secret by Marie the daughter of the owner of the local bookstore. She thinks he is creative deep and a very honest man. Why is Lorenz so honest? Because he has never been tempted! Because at his first encounter with something really tempting his moral code collapses completely. His bout with fate begins when he is run down in the street by a team of horses pulling a carriage driven by the beautiful and wealthy Veronika Harlan. Lorenz is unharmed but he returns to consciousness with Veronika holding his head in her hands and he is instantly infatuated.His lust is awakened by looking into the face of the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and his pride is awakened when he is told by Marie's father that his poetry is genius according to a visiting publisher the publisher turns out to be wrong. When Lorenz realizes he has no chance with the actual Veronika he settles for a lookalike gold digger that he meets in a tavern. The problem? He has no gold for her to dig since he has lost his job as city clerk due to his absences presence in taverns and hanging about the front entrance of the Harlan home. Apparently doing a low paying menial civil service job in 1922 Germany required the dullest of home lives.Lorenz soon learns that his poetry is worthless although this scene is missing from the movie. His solution? A stronger willed criminal minded fellow convinces Lorenz first to commit fraud to keep his gold digging girlfriend and when Lorenz is found out he is convinced by the very same fellow to commit robbery to cover up the original fraud. When the midnight robbery goes awry he just lies down and covers his head to not see his more violent companion murdering the wouldbe robbery victim who just happens to be his own aunt! He doesn't try to stop him at all.Now here is where the film loses me. Lorenz has committed fraud robbery and been an accomplice to murder but apparently spends only a short time in prison because he is still young looking when he gets out. That's a very short sentence! In the U.S. at the time he would have gotten a very short rope for the same crimes. Marie and her dad are waiting for him and drive him to a nice house in the country and tell him This is your new home. Where did this home come from? If he had the kind of money to buy such a home why was his entire family living in a crowded run down apartment before he went to jail? Lorenz calls Marie his beloved wife at the beginning of the film  this entire story is told in flashback  so Marie knowing that Lorenz is really a weak wimpy guy who is capable of giving in to the worst criminal impulses when influenced by a stronger personality married him also knowing she wasn't his first OR second choice? What happens the next time he has a random encounter with a beautiful woman? Maybe they are both weak and wimpy and are thus made for each other but that is not what the hopeful feeling with which this movie ends seems to imply.Maybe the most puzzling and unexplained part of the movie is the very beginning. Before we even get to Lorenz writing down this story in a book and thus the flashback tale there is an image first of an Albert Einstein lookalike walking in the country alone then a Thomas Edison lookalike also walking in the country alone. No explanation. Then cut to Lorenz looking wistfully out his kitchen window. I don't know. Maybe Murnau was trying to say geniuses often walk alone but that doesn't mean that someone who walks alone Lorenz is necessarily a genius??I'll tell you one thing of which this film convinced me  Alfred Abel was a great actor. I was completely convinced he was a tower of jello in this film and in 1927's Metropolis I was completely convinced he was cold deliberate industrialist capable of sentencing his right hand man to the closest thing there was to hell on earth. Catch this silent film if you can even if you are not a big fan of the silents I think you'll find it fascinating.".

The reconstructed Phantom is very well done it's obvious they were working from a very satisfying print of the film as there is little of the deterioration you expect in these old films. They've avoided temptation to enhance the coloring and tinted the nicely preserved original film in original hues inserted new intertitles and added an appropriate Robert Israel score.Our story begins in then present day Germany with protagonist Alfred Abel as Lorenz Lubota and Lil Dagover as Marie Starke living in a happily ever after home which dampens much of the coming tension. Wife Dagover lovingly urges Mr. Abel to write the story of his former life. The couple hopes this will help ease exconvict Abel's painful memories. Then we have the flashback and the problems begin Some time ago Abel is a respected but lowly city clerk. He lives with haggish old mother Frida Richard whorish sister Aud Egede Nissen as Melanie and dour brother Hans Heinrich von Twardowski as Hugo.The introduction of the little brother points out another of the film's structural flaws. You expect since we have a big obvious flashback that the younger man is the younger Lorenz  but this revealed not to be the case when Abel is called to the breakfast table looking older than he did before the flashback. An unaccredited cowriter Mr. Twardowski is not on screen much of the time but he seems capable and it might have been a better idea to have him play the main role. Or they could have dispensed with the opening and have Abel play Lorenz as a middleaged angstridden character. Which he may be As it turns out Abel gets hit by a coach pulled by pretty white horses. Suffering little physical harm he becomes infatuated with the inhabitant of the carriage lovely Lya de Putti as Veronika Harlan. An aspiring poet Abel becomes involved in a moneylending scheme based on his verse becoming successfully published. Alas Abel's poems turn out to be worthless and he ends up in jail as revealed in the opening sequence. Admittedly there is some disappointment in Phantom. This is my fifth Murnau film and the first one I rate less than 9 on the IMDb scale. Still it's an excellent piece and worth the running time. Phantom 111322 F.W.

	schema:reviewBody "Phantom is a German 2hour film from almost 95 years ago directed by European silent film legend Friedrich Wilhelm MurnauPlumpe. It is one of his longer films in terms of runtime but not one of his most famous really. Admittedly it is still somewhat known and also not one of his least famous works. But it's very mediocre for the most part. The actors include a couple solid names but big stars are not included in the cast here and the story is not too convincing either. The genre is certainly something else compared to Murnau's films usually being about horror or mystery so this is maybe the only reason that makes this film worth a watch. Sadly the material is far from sufficient for a film that runs for 120 minutes.Apart from that it is the usual blackandwhite silent and could have needed a lot more intertitles. It is based on a novel by Gerhart Hauptmann and the one who adapted it is Thea von Harbou Fritz Lang's longtime collaborator. Sadly all these big names did not result in a great or even good film. Actually the outcome is very much forgettable from start to finish and that is why I give it a thumbsdown. Only worth checking out for the most hardcore silent film fans.".

Although the screenplay is consistently witty from start to finish it is mainly in the second half of the film that it is also extremely moving.

To today's audiences the pace may seen slow but all is redeemed by the ending. This has by far the best ending of any motion picture ever. The fact that this film is not out on DVD is shameful. Interestingly this is Kelly McGillis' introducing film she was showcased and it was made clear that she was expected to be a great star. She does shine in this role. The more relevant social commentary is the portrayal of women after they have lost that flush of young love tend to become disillusioned. We are left wondering whether Geneva Spofford McGillis' character will become like the other sad society women around her. See this movie if you have the chanceit won't disappoint.".

The answer he comes up with is a headspinner but it's also a perfect answer to this dilemma and answers your lingering questions about the movie's name.";

Conti's portrayal is so good that I can't think of anyone else doing it. We're charmed by this tragic and comic figure. Kelly McGillis also gives a good performance as the college student who gets mixed up with the worldrenowned poet. The relationship is realistic and adult  they both know it will end. What they don't know is the shocking way in which it does end. It's a highly entertaining thoughtprovoking and powerful classic. It's mindboggling that it isn't available on DVD.".

	schema:headline " A portrait of a narcissistic intellectual";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably best known for having launched the screen career of Kelly McGillis who charmingly and winsomely plays the young female lead in this story a character whose name is Geneva she is not Swiss but lives in New England nor is she a banker. The lead role in this film is played by British actor Tom Conti who had 24 years of film experience behind him already by this time. He still at this stage had an amazing head of curly hair like a little boy. Conti has always been a consummate actor as he proved so spectacularly to a mesmerised British public when he appeared in the remarkable TV series THE GLITTERING PRIZES in 1976 when he became for some time a kind of national cuddly icon. Conti does not play someone called Reuben. Reuben is the name of Kelly McGillis's dog the real dog's name was Jamie who plays a crucial role in the film at the ending which I cannot reveal because of IMDb rules. Conti gives ones of his typically brilliant performances here albeit of a highly unsympathetic character. He is a serial seducer of women and when he meets McGillis and falls in love for the first time his habit of noncommitment means that he misses the chance of marrying the girl of his dreams because marrying is just not the sort of thing he wants to do again having messed up a marriage with a very nice woman the first time round. Conti plays a famous British poet on a lecture and poetryreading tour of New England and remember that this is the 1980s when people could still become famous for being poets and they could actually travel round being admired and rooms full of adoring American women would swoon over them. Conti has insufferable affectations such as leaving a huge silk pocket handkerchief hanging perilously out of his tweed jacket breast pocket by as much as a foot in length trailing in the breeze. It is meant to be 'a touch of the poet'. Nobody laughs at his handkerchief and everybody takes him terribly seriously. He is brilliantly witty and a master of words entrancing people with his wordplay ironic jokes endless witticisms and dazzling verbosity. There is one amazing scene where Conti is persuaded to go to church by Geneva no she is not a Calvinist either but an Episcopalian. He goes up to the altar rail with his hands in his pockets kneels down and when the priest comes to him with the host and says 'The body of Christ' Conti says 'No thank you I'm on a diet.' Everything for Conti is an excuse for a joke. The only thing he takes seriously is himself being hopelessly narcissistic and hence all empty inside. This film is 'kind of a downer' even though it is extraordinarily funny and has an excellent script full of nonstop wit and irony by Julius Epstein and Herman Shumlin based on a Peter de Vries novel. As a portrait of this type of narcissistic intellectual individual it is an excellent film exposing the hollowness of excessive selflove with merciless honesty. It is extremely well directed by Robert Ellis Miller whose best film in my opinion was the emotionally devastating THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER 1968 which was one of the outstanding films of the 1960s and introduced Sondra Locke as a teenager. It should be mentioned that Tom Conti's performance here was so highly regarded when the film came out that he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor and he well deserved that recognition.".

As they said in Dead Poets Society why was poetry created  to woo women of course. As the movie opens we see him giving a reading of his work to a group of women. Some of them obviously piqued by his naughty little self and the way he scrutinizes himself and others under a microscope to find what really makes us tick and what turns us on on all levels. He uses this theme of an awakening of self in his work an arousal of all senses. The film centers on him trying to write and at the same time finding women to.... Enter Kelly McGillis who sees him on a train unable to pay his ticket so she offers to pay and then bumps into him again later in the little Massachusetts town. Gowan tries to find semblance of order of his life when he's told by an ex that she's writing a book about her marriage to him and he dictates some feelings into a tape recorder for her use. There's not any real action but there's plenty of stimulation great acting by Tom Conti and extraordinarily insightful writing in this film. I was very impressed with screenwriter Epstein's script. The thoughts and ideas and feelings here were told in such a way as to be clear and simple while they are representative of deep multilayered people and their mores. Epstein has the talent to be succinct. No other film has touched me or made such a profound impact on me since I discovered Ordinary People. The ending is a bit abrupt and almost unexpected almost. But when I see it again I'm sure it will seem like it flows together. Everything was thoughtful and deliberate and those who love film like that will fall in love with Reuben Reuben. But wait his character is Gowan McGland. So who or what is Reuben? What does it mean? What DOES it mean?".

Simplistic yet profound in some way and always with a very positive attitude. That is exactly what this movie delivers. Plain old simple jokes for everybody kids and parents.If like myself you're a fan of Yogi Bear you won't be disappointed. Indeed this was the best carton to big screen adaptation I've seen. If you didn't use to watch the cartoon then I don't know what your expectations might be but I noticed most of the people are expecting what this movie is not.The movie is very laid back. Photography and scenes are also very fresh and so is the cast performance. The cast fits the characters very well and gets the job done there's no intense dramatic dialogs but keep in mind that this is kid movie. The interaction between Yogi and his faithful friend Booboo and Ranger Smith is the cornerstone of Yogi Bear. The are friends and enemies at the same time. This passes a very positive message to the kids and the movie does it in a very faithful way just like it was done in the cartoons. The other most characteristic aspect Yogi is his obsession for human food. Again that is well featured in the movie.A disturbing yet positive thing about this movie is the realism of the Town Mayor character's personality. It's supposed to be a caricature but is a very accurate one.Finally computer generated characters and living ones work very well on this movie. Unlike most of the movies that resource to this mix the cartoon characters blend well with the rest of the scene.Great entertainment for all the family with some classic Yogi jokes.".

I love the clear and simple jokes and how all the story goes around well I rather see Yogy Bear movie or cartoon than have to see aliens becoming children robots creatures that I never heard about. Because this is what keeps our kids on TV now days when its not the video game. So please people that come to criticize please go find a movie where you find something interesting for yourselves. But don't come here with your awful words for something that makes so many kids laugh through decades. Its not fair its not nice. Yogy bear will be in my memory forever and I am pleased that the movie made the best that could do.".

	schema:reviewBody "When reviewing a family movie I look at it a few different ways first is it appropriate for my three kids second is it entertaining to me and my kids and third is there a decent storyline. I didn't see Yogi Bear in theaters and I am glad I didn't spend money for a family of five on tickets and concession items that go with taking my family to a big screen showing. However I think this is one of the more appropriate and enjoyable family movies that I have seen in years. Yogi made me laugh and it was just long enough to keep my kids attention for the entire movie. The story line is basic and not to deep which helps to keep the kids' attention. As a dad I appreciate not having to explain everything to them and am able to enjoy the movie myself. I thought Dan Aykroyd's voice work on Yogi was over acted and made to sound like the cartoon I grew up on but after a few scenes you get used to it. Justin Timberlake as you would expect him to be was funny voicing Boo Boo. Tom Cavanagh as the abused Ranger Smith was a clean cut likable character similar to the character he portrayed on the T.V. show ED on which he starred. Anna Faris's part although limited fit in the movie's overall context. T.J Miller Nathan Corddry and Andrew Daly were entertaining fodder to Yogi's antics.I watched this movie with my kids and I can't remember a part where at least one of them was not laughing. To me that's all you can ask for in a family movie no swearing no violence just good old fashioned Yogi Bear Fun. This is a movie that I will be buying for the collection.Grade Avisit our site at www.twodudereview.com".

	schema:headline " Not smarter or dumber than the average family movie Yogi Bear is perfectly good clean and harmless fun that the whole family can enjoy";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to slam a movie like Yogi Bear just talk about how simplistic the script written by no less than three writers or how childish the antics are of the titular character and his cautious sidekick BooBoo or even how repetitive picanic basket stealing gets. Yes they are all fair observations of this liveaction adaptation of the 1960s HannaBarbera cartoon but I wouldn't go so far as to criticise the movie for these very traits. If you've seen the Saturday morning cartoons you'll find that this film actually stays extremely faithful to its source. In them Yogi goes around doing perhaps one thing and one thing only that's right stealing picanic baskets and thinking to himself how he's smarter than the average bear together with BooBoo occasionally running into Jellystone National Park's head ranger Smith who yells at him for disturbing the peace. We used to laugh at Yogi's foolish schemes or at least I remember I did so why is it so difficult to laugh at the same things all over again? Sure many of us who have enjoyed those cartoons may have grown up but that's not a fault of the film especially when those in the audience who were of the age when we were watching the cartoons were obviously having a great time. Around the regular picanic stealing writers Jeffrey Ventimilia Joshua Sternin and Brad Copeland have spun an ecofriendly story of the unscrupulous town mayor Andrew Daly who aims to sell off Jellystone to the loggers to cover the city's deficit. Needless to say it will be up to Ranger Smith his love interest the nature documentarian Rachel Anna Faris and of course Yogi and BooBoo to save the day. Yes it's simple but the plot is just serviceable enough to be the glue this liveaction treatment needs. Ultimately the stars of the show were always Yogi and BooBoo and in this regard both the voice actors and the animators have done a wonderful job. Dan Aykroyd does his best Daws Butler impersonation for Yogi Bear most impressive for nailing his character's distinctive speech patterns. Just as outstanding is Justin Timberlake clearly relishing the opportunity to disappear into the role of BooBoo complete with the trademark nasal delivery. It's especially interesting to think how Timberlake sounds so uncannily like the classic Don Messick. Director Eric Brevig of 2008's Journey to the Centre of the Earth keeps the gags flying fast and furious so even if some of the supposed verbal punchlines fall flat there is always something visually appealing to hold your attention. An Oscarnominated effects specialist Brevig makes great use of the stereoscopy to deliver all sorts of visual gimmicks whether something flying in your face or hurling you along but it adds nicely to the fun. And that's one word that sums up what it's all meant to be about fun good clean harmless fun like how the cartoons were 40 years ago and a trip down memory lane for those who have seen the originals. There'll be many tempted to ride the wave of criticism surrounding this movie but if you know what you're in for then Yogi Bear should just be the perfect family entertainment this holiday season.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all if you are going to see this film you probably already know what you are getting yourself into. This is a really really really dumb movie featuring Yogi Bear and Boo Boo voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake respectively. There is no substance at all what so ever in this movie therefore sit back relax become a kid again and enjoy the antics of Yogi Bear and Boo Boo. The movie begins with the picnic basket nabbing antics of the renowned cartoon character Yogi Bear and his partner in crime Boo Boo at Jellystone Park. They are constantly messing with Ranger Smith Tom Cavanagh who they call Mr. Ranger and scaring campers away. Documentary filmmaker Rachel Anna Faris arrives in order to shoot a project by attaching a camera to Boo Boo's bowtie. All is normal until Mayor Brown Andrew Daly decides to sell Jellystone Park to loggers in order to save the town from bankruptcy and help him with his campaign for governor. However Yogi and Boo Boo have something to say about this and team up with Ranger Smith and Rachel in order to stop Mayor Brown plot and save the park.The movie itself isn't very good nor is it supposed to be very good and the fact that the creators recognized this while making the film makes the film a lot of fun. Yogi Bear and Boo Boo are the best part of the film and are laugh out loud hilarious. They aim for the ridiculous and do the craziest things that are very entertaining. Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake were perfect choices for the parts of Yogi Bear and Boo Boo. They help the film avoid any sappy emotional drama and just have some childhood fun. The film is also very short and therefore it does not overstay it's welcome. The film just tells the story and makes you laugh without really worrying about anything.The film isn't worth paying fourteen dollars to see in 3D and is very forgettable because it lacks any originality what so ever. Also all of the actors really do not add anything to the film except a small clich romantic relationship between Ranger Smith and Rachel. The bad guys are very annoying as they usually are these kinds of movies. Also there really isn't a plot or at least a plot that you really care about. The writing is terrible but yet again you aren't seeing the film for that.This is a great kids movie that isn't scary at all and could probably even be rated G. I actually do recommend seeing the film but you should probably wait to see it in the cheaper movie theaters or wait for DVD unless you want a really safe movie to take a kid to. Save your money and do not see it in 3D".

It feels like you are going to get splashed with the water.My favorite characters in the film are Yogi Bear Boo Boo and Ranger Smith. I like them because they have a part in saving Yellowstone Park. Yogi Bear and Boo Boo are the funniest characters in the movie. One part in the movie has Yogi Bear water skiing and Boo Boo is guiding the boat. Yogi Bear catches his cape on fire falls in the water and sets off the entire fireworks display! There are also some bad people in this movie. Mayor Brown and his chief of staff are always trying to sabotage Ranger Smith's efforts to save Yellowstone. They even try to make Ranger Jones turn against Ranger Smith. The actor that plays Ranger Jones is T.J. Miller who played Tuffnut in How to Train Your Dragon which is one of my favorite movies.In the movie Yellowstone Park is celebrating its 100 year anniversary however it may be its last because attendance to the park is down and Mayor Brown wants to close the park and use it for something that will make him more money. Yogi Bear Boo Boo Ranger Smith and Rachel team up to save the park. Yogi Bear really proves that he is smarter than the average bear. I would recommend this film for ages seven and up. Parents will really like this movie because Yogi Bear was a TV show that was on when they were growing up. Go out and see it when it premieres in theaters on December 17th. For an extra treat see it in 3D you will really feel like you are a part of the movie.Reviewed by Anthony Aranda age 8 KIDS FIRST! Film Critic".

	schema:headline " Good film for youngsters and the adult won't be bored";
	schema:reviewBody "Not that a review should be about ME but it seems to help with the review a little. I haven't reviewed a film in a long time probably because I have been busy getting married and having kids. With that being said I don't really see too many movies anymore and needless to say this was NOT tops of my list. If I finally get to see a movie I prefer an adult film but alas I have children. I got on here before hand and was even less than ecstatic about Yogi given the reviews and the star rating.However so many of them were so far off that I felt inclined to write this review the same night after seeing this movie. First off for those that review andor rate a movie like this without having seen it is quite silly and hinders the reasoning behind the rating itself. Ratings are to help people not skew them. OK on to the film. This is a legitimate PG moving for children i.e. under 10 so take that into consideration. Someone in a rating said it was not a movie they would take a date on . . . really? I mean I would hope not. Anyway I have seen lots of kids and young adult movies with far less plot and acting than this movie.I thought it was perfect for the age bracket and while yes there is a mention about urination and about Boo Boo having trouble with baked beans other than that I was actually quite impressed that the movie survived without a bunch of potty humor. I thought it was a lightly funny film that stuck to the entire Yogi Bear theme of trying to save the park. I thought while some of the adults were silly to stupid many of them were again lightly funny and silly but not over the top stupid. Mentioning the word stupid also brings me to another thought that the movie wasn't filled with boring dialog of people calling each other silly names that make kids laugh but irk parents knowing now after the film their kids are going to be calling each other those names and we will be left with trying to tell them why that is inappropriate.I actually laughed quite a bit and enjoyed seeing Yogi. I am 34 years old and my daughter is 3 that was with me and we liked it. I could even watch it again. I've seen bad films of all ages and genres and this is NOT one of them. Is it academy award material? Not even close but you won't be disappointed in an entertaining film for children.Again about the silly reviewersif you don't like it no biggie and it is your perogrative to also write a review they are needed but why the lies in writing a review? Bored to tears in 10 minutes? Yogi getting hurt all the time? keep it lighthearted? How about paying attention. If there is any major complaint it should be that this movie was nothing more than a glorified version of the cartoon but that is what one would expect. Have you never seen the Yogi Christmas special. You know the one where Ranger Smith tells Yogi to stay away and where the place is going to be forced to close and all the animals are sad? Sound familiar hmm.Now for my final soap box that does make me mad. This dumb 3D is not all that impressive and given the extra added cost to go see one it is NOT worth it. While there is a non3D version the theaters don't really want to play that one too much because they can't charge the exuberant fee. I will for a fact plan ahead next time better and NOT do the 3D film and make sure I send a statement although minimal it is.".

	onyx:emotionText "Not that a review should be about ME but it seems to help with the review a little. I haven't reviewed a film in a long time probably because I have been busy getting married and having kids. With that being said I don't really see too many movies anymore and needless to say this was NOT tops of my list. If I finally get to see a movie I prefer an adult film but alas I have children. I got on here before hand and was even less than ecstatic about Yogi given the reviews and the star rating.However so many of them were so far off that I felt inclined to write this review the same night after seeing this movie. First off for those that review andor rate a movie like this without having seen it is quite silly and hinders the reasoning behind the rating itself. Ratings are to help people not skew them. OK on to the film. This is a legitimate PG moving for children i.e. under 10 so take that into consideration. Someone in a rating said it was not a movie they would take a date on . . . really? I mean I would hope not. Anyway I have seen lots of kids and young adult movies with far less plot and acting than this movie.I thought it was perfect for the age bracket and while yes there is a mention about urination and about Boo Boo having trouble with baked beans other than that I was actually quite impressed that the movie survived without a bunch of potty humor. I thought it was a lightly funny film that stuck to the entire Yogi Bear theme of trying to save the park. I thought while some of the adults were silly to stupid many of them were again lightly funny and silly but not over the top stupid. Mentioning the word stupid also brings me to another thought that the movie wasn't filled with boring dialog of people calling each other silly names that make kids laugh but irk parents knowing now after the film their kids are going to be calling each other those names and we will be left with trying to tell them why that is inappropriate.I actually laughed quite a bit and enjoyed seeing Yogi. I am 34 years old and my daughter is 3 that was with me and we liked it. I could even watch it again. I've seen bad films of all ages and genres and this is NOT one of them.

	schema:reviewBody "Not an awful movie. Not one that I would take a date to go see though. Odd...one of the jokes was talking about getting a date with a young woman and Yogi mentions urinating on her. I was wondering why that had to be included. Really don't want to talk to my kids about urination. To throw that into a movie that is so obviously a kids movie seems out of place like a sex scene in a Dr. Seuss book. Or day care advertisements in Penthouse. At the very least it was odd. But the plot is predictable and easy on the mind. There is very little deviation or subplots that play out and the ending is easy to guess. But again it's a kids movie. So I took my 5 and 3 year old and the 5 year old giggled and the three year old played with my smartphone. I napped. I do have one other flaw for this movie...why do they think that using Dan Akroyd or Justin Timberlake increases the sales for this movie? Or any movie out there that uses big name stars for a cartoon? What's the point? Dan was just fine and Timberlake was very good as booboo but there are hundreds of voice actors in Hollywood.

	onyx:emotionText "Not an awful movie. Not one that I would take a date to go see though. Odd...one of the jokes was talking about getting a date with a young woman and Yogi mentions urinating on her. I was wondering why that had to be included. Really don't want to talk to my kids about urination. To throw that into a movie that is so obviously a kids movie seems out of place like a sex scene in a Dr. Seuss book. Or day care advertisements in Penthouse. At the very least it was odd. But the plot is predictable and easy on the mind. There is very little deviation or subplots that play out and the ending is easy to guess. But again it's a kids movie. So I took my 5 and 3 year old and the 5 year old giggled and the three year old played with my smartphone. I napped. I do have one other flaw for this movie...why do they think that using Dan Akroyd or Justin Timberlake increases the sales for this movie? Or any movie out there that uses big name stars for a cartoon? What's the point? Dan was just fine and Timberlake was very good as booboo but there are hundreds of voice actors in Hollywood. This could have been a huge film for one of them. Instead the producers overpaid two big stars that could have literally phoned in their parts. Is that why I pay 20 bucks for popcorn?

Nevertheless compared to such recent releases as Green Hornet or Kick Ass with former getting 0 stars Yogi Bear is a masterpiece and deserves 10 stars. Compared to other kid movies like Madagascar or Toy Story I would probably give Yogi Bear 7 stars because it's plot is not as rich. But Yogi Bear stands on it's own and it doesn't have to be big to be great. It is great because there is not much competition for greatness.".

Dan Ackroyd and Timberlake were wonderful as the primary voices. People on this board complain about the plot. Come onit's a kids cartoon! To expect a compelling plot would be like buying Hustler to read the articles. The plot such as it is keeps the film moving along and provides motivation for the pratfalls and physical humor which are executed better than for most movies of this kind. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is and it is good at what it does. I'll sure take it over Fantastic Mr. Fox.".

I had been a fan of Yogi Bear's family of cartoons from sometime ago in the past and I knew that many people are interested in bears so it was nice to see some kind of resurgence or comeback from this important HannaBarbara cartoon character. I also thought that Dan Aykroyd was one of the wackiest Saturday Night Live players at the time so this show was like the good old Halcyon days entertainment with him cast as the voice of Yogi. Yogi and Boo Boo were just like I thought they used to be. The plot was full of noteworthy humorous situations carried out effectively and I thought that in resolution quality Yogi and Boo Boo were about to jump off the screen making one feel as if you the audience were in the middle of their environment and their costumes or special effects were most convincing whether or not they were purely computer generated. Yogi's antics and those of his human counterparts also took lots of imagination turned to reality as if observers were inside an amusement park. The movie kept you entertained for its duration. The girl in this show was a funloving early admirer of Yogi Bear and his exploits in her environmentally conscientious kind of way which gave Yogi and Boo Boo plenty of room to show off and goof up in. The mayor of the city who wants to exploit Jellystone Park for his greedy personal gains is just funny and outrageous in his stubborn view of nature and the park. This gives us a good backdrop story which pits the forest rangers and Yogi and Boo Boo against the politics of corruption. The acting seemed okay to me although I am not as critical as some evaluators of this aspect in this movie. I would recommend the movie to all kinds of kids and older audiences familiar with the characters.".

	schema:headline " Yogi Bear is an Old Friend with a New Look";
	schema:reviewBody "To bring the younger viewers up to speed  Yogi Bear has been around since the 1960s he started as a cartoon pickanic basketstealing bear in Jellystone Park. He had a good run for several years and eventually faded into the background with a few television reboots along the way. Thanks to 3D liveaction CGI wizardry Yogi is back on the big screen. In the new Yogi Bear movie he appears brand new in all of his CGI magnificence yet he maintains his familiar look and catch phrases at the same time. He's hasn't come back alone he brought his old side kick Boo Boo also in CGI and his friendly nemesis Park Ranger Smith.Yogi voiced by Dan Aykroyd starts the movie with what he is known for  stealing picnic baskets from visitors of Jellystone Park. In Aykroyd's best Ed Norton impersonation for the younger viewers that is a character from the 1950s television series The Honeymooners he self narrates his strategies so not to lose the audience along the way. Yogi and his accomplice in petty thievery Boo Boo voiced by Justin Timberlake are continually devising new methods to steal food from the tourists to Jellystone Park. Yogi is the da Vinci mastermind while Boo Boo is the rational voice of conscientiousness. They opt for stealing because the alternative is to resort to foraging for food like the average bear. Word about Yogi's pilfering gets back to Ranger Smith played by Tom Cavanagh who has a long history of battling with Yogi. Instead of just shooting Yogi full of tranquilizer darts and dragging his body to another park that's my idea it's not in the movie Ranger Smith uses his sternness to reprimand Yogi therefore upholding law and order within Jellystone. Yogi soon goes back to his cave and Ranger Smith goes back to his cabin and the cycle of picnic basket pilfering continues.Meanwhile back in Franklin City Mayor Brown played by Andrew Daly is making plans to sell off Jellystone. He needs the money to bring his city out of debt and with a coy evilness he rationalizes that each resident of Franklin City will make money off the deal. Daly was a fresh enjoyment to watch as the nemesis delivering his role so both children and adults could pick up on the humor of a fun yet despicable character.A threeway conflict soon begins with Ranger Smith stuck in the middle. Yogi is disrupting the tourists and the mayor is trying to close Jellystone Park. Then in steps Rachel played by Anna Farris who is filming a nature documentary. On top of that Ranger Jones played by TJ Miller is gunning for the job of top ranger it's funny because there are only two rangers for the entire park. It seems like a multilevel story line but the director Eric Brevig presents the smaller stories in a clearcut linear format where even the youngest viewer can pick up on what is happening.While tension is building between Mayor Brown and Ranger Smith the 100th anniversary of Jellystone is upon them. At the celebration Yogi who was only trying to help ruins everything and the park closes. At Ranger Smith's lowest point he loses not only the park and his job but also a chance with Rachel too. Knowing that his intelligence is also a hindrance Yogi tries a life of being an average bear but that doesn't suit him. He and Boo Boo soon devise a scheme to rescue the park and to stop Mayor Brown from becoming Governor Brown.Should you see this movie? Yes it's simple yet charming. There were a lot of jokes for an older and younger audience. You didn't have to grow up with the cartoon to enjoy this newer version of an old classic just be a fan of clean humor.".

Hitch thought it was the worst film he'd ever made and Jessie thought it was perfectly dreadful.It was an adaptation of a London musical stage play which apparently ran for over a year Johann Strauss II played by Esmond Knight wants to be a composer like his father I Gwenn who is arrogantly dismissive of his talents throughout. I'm afraid I won't see Gwenn as Santa quite the same again. II eventually succeeds spectacularly with the help of Countess Fay Compton was she ever anything but elderly and wistful? and barmaid girlfriend Matthews  incidentally Robert Hale who played her father was her reallife fatherinlaw. Jessie was as usual good to look at personally speaking but unfortunately didn't really get to sing much and Hitchcock was excellent as usual but didn't get to show off much. Most people will be disappointed with the latter but for myself it was with the lack of Jessie's beautiful singing voice in what was after all billed as a musical and with her name over the title. On the other hand Hitchcock seemed to be mining the One Hour With You stylistic vein a lot of the time albeit in a cheaper but still pleasant British way there were some nice sets and of course there was Louis Levy's orchestrations for The Blue Danube to admire when it arrived. The less said about how II was supposed to have composed it here the better!It's a pleasant enough 76 minutes for someone like me who isn't a Hitchcock completist but probably will be a real chore if you are.".

Most people will be disappointed with the latter but for myself it was with the lack of Jessie's beautiful singing voice in what was after all billed as a musical and with her name over the title. On the other hand Hitchcock seemed to be mining the One Hour With You stylistic vein a lot of the time albeit in a cheaper but still pleasant British way there were some nice sets and of course there was Louis Levy's orchestrations for The Blue Danube to admire when it arrived. The less said about how II was supposed to have composed it here the better!It's a pleasant enough 76 minutes for someone like me who isn't a Hitchcock completist but probably will be a real chore if you are.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1933 Hitchcock found himself without a picture to direct and signed on for this unlikely choice of a musical just so he could keep working. That being the case it probably helps explain why it doesn't seem to have a Hitchcock feel to it or any of the elements you might otherwise expect from the master of suspense. I don't think his heart was really in it. The term musical is a little loosely used as really there are only the Strauss's waltzes for music as there was no money in the budget for any other music. So no one breaks out into song for no reason in this picture. Other than the fact it doesn't seem like a Hitchcock movie it's a nice little story about the younger Strauss struggling for the respect of his father with a nice bit of romance and jealousy thrown in on the side. The most amusing scene for me was when the younger Strauss was coming up with the music for his waltz at the bakery. I also enjoyed the opening scene of the fire brigade racing to a fire and the rescue of the damsel. Apparently there wasn't much of a budget for special effects because we never actually see the fire. A pleasant enough film just not very Hitchcockian.  Out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "Biography of the Strauss boys set in Vienna in mid 19th century. The stars are Jessie Matthews as Rasi the daughter of a confectioner Esmond Knight as Strauss Jr. and Edmun Gwenn as Strauss Sr. Also notable are Fay Compton as the countess Frank Vosper as the count and Robert Hale as the confectioner.What makes this film notable is that the director is Alfred Hitchcock. Alma Reville is listed as one of the writers.From the opening scene the film is unusual. The film starts with a closeup of a fire team racing to a fire in a confectioner's shop. The scene is obviously fake because of the background and the fake horses. The actors jostle about and spout wisecracks. At the scene of the fire we see a madhouse of onlookers and employees. The employees are taking tables and chairs out of the shop and setting them up in the street to avoid losing customers. The confectioner is in a panic as he tries to save a huge wedding cake. Smoke billows from the building but upstairs there is music and singing as Strauss and Rasi go through one of his compositions. The sequence is manic full of pratfalls and sight gags.At a dress shop across the street the countess is trying to buy a dress but the models are all watching the fire. When a bumbling fireman carries Rasi down a ladder she tears her dress off and must run to the dress shop for clothing. She meets the countess who is asking to meet the man playing that piano. Thus begins the triangle.Almost as a subplot we get the adversarial relationship between the father and son since the film really focuses on the love story. Although Hitchcock always thought this film his worst there is much to enjoy. The pacing is brisk. The dramatic story is lightened by comic episodes. The direction is very fluid if not florid like the music and the music is terrific especially the climactic Blue Danube number.Also notable are the sets. You would expect very fussy claustrophobic rooms filled with furniture and ponderous draperies but the sets are mostly spartan white softly lit. In one scene the countess sits having coffee in a huge white room before huge curtainless windows. Not what you'd think of for 1850s Vienna.The acting is uneven with Matthews and Knight overacting and Gwenn and Compton underacting. The comic scenes are very broad and involve pratfalls into cakes slapping falling down stairs etc. Yet it all seems to work.Matthews hated this film and Hitchcock. England's premiere musical star of the time doesn't get to dance and only warbles here and there. She definitely takes a backseat to the Strauss music but she's at her prettiest in this film. Esmond Knight's character reminded me of Marius Goring's manic composer in THE RED SHOES right down to the hair cut. Gwenn for all his billing gets less screen time than Matthews Knight and even Fay Compton.".

It is always interesting to hear filmmakers and film stars passing comment on their own work particularly when naming their most and least favourite titles. What never ceases to amaze me is the way they often pick completely the wrong film to call their worst. Jack Benny despised The Horn Blows At Midnight Frank Sinatra believed The Kissing Bandit was the nadir of his career Michael Caine rated Ashanti as the absolute bottom of his acting barrel yet in every case they've picked on the wrong movie. And so it is with Waltzes From Vienna. Hitchcock may have been unhappy whilst making the film and dismayed at the finished product but in all fairness it is nowhere near as bad as its reputation suggests.Johann Strauss Jr Esmond Knight or Schani as he calls himself is a fairly talented young musician living under the immense shadow of his father Johann Strauss Sr Edmund Gwenn. Strauss Sr is a fearsome tyrant of a man a musical legend with an ego as big as his reputation. Schani spends much of his time teaching his sweetheart Rasi Jessie Matthews to play the piano and writing tunes which he dedicates to her. One day he is approached by the wealthy Countess Helga Von Stahl Fay Compton who wants him to compose a waltz to go with some lyrics she has written. Rasi is engulfed with jealousy as her beloved Schani spends all his time with the Countess. And Schani himself is racked with selfdoubt about his ability to come up with a suitable tune. His father has made him feel somewhat inept as a musician and he is totally convinced he isn't up to the job. In the end Schani almost accidentally produces the Blue Danube waltz a piece of music so spinetingling so perfect that it becomes an instant sensation much to the chagrin of his father.There are stories of Hitchcock unleashing his frustration upon his actors during the production often bullying them and forcing them to work unthinkable hours to get the film completed on time and on budget. If these rumours are true it is a credit to the actors that they give such generally likable performances. Knight and Matthews are a little wooden as the lovestruck leads but Gwenn is simply fantastic as the domineering Strauss Sr and Compton delivers a memorable turn as the designing Countess. There is a nice element of comedy in the film and scene for scene the whole thing has been worked out cleanly and economically from start to finish. Perhaps Hitchcock's main beef with this film is that it is a soft lighthearted romance with some features of a musical. He always was at his best doing manontherun thrillers or black comedies. It is a very uncharacteristic film and perhaps the master of suspense couldn't find anything to set his pulse racing in such material. However my advice is give Waltzes From Vienna a go. It's a good deal better than you might anticipate!".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock's only Musical and a great one";
	schema:reviewBody "A Great Musical Film by Hitchcock. He made this film when he was at the lowest point of his career. But he put all of his efforts into this project. I love the humor used in this film. I love the scenes where Esmond Knight develops his music by watching workers arrange the bread and other food.Fear is one of the major elements in a Hitchcock film. In this film we see the fear of being ignored fear of failure fear of losing someone you love. Edmund Gwenn was brilliant as Johann Strauss Sr. We can really see his fear through his actions and emotions. He is a man who is dedicated to the world of music. But he is getting old. And he is afraid that his career as a composer is almost over. And he is also afraid that he will be forgotten in the future years as a great composer who put all his great efforts for the world of music. For Example Johann Strauss says to his son Young Strauss You think I am already at a standstill. Perhaps even a back number. This is mentioned before Young Strauss plays his music in front of his father and other composers in the middle of the film. This is connected to Hitchcock's life during that time. When Hitchcock was making this film his career was in trouble. Like Gwenn's character Johann Strauss Sr Hitchcock did think about his future years as a filmmaker. But I heard through TruffautHitchcock audio interview that it didn't fortunately reach to a point where he believed his career was over. But he didn't have any projects for thriller genre during that time. So he ended up picking this musical project so that there will be some hope for him in the future as a great filmmaker. With the help of his wife Alma Reville he puts his fear into the character of Johann Strauss Sr. and his son Young Strauss. His wife Alma Reville cowrote the screenplay.Young Johann Strauss Jr. is afraid that he will never become a successful composer in the future. During that time Hitchcock was concerned about his future career. Hitchcock's 2 previous films Rich and Strange No. 17 before this film were failures. Jessie Matthews Rasi fears that she may lose Young Strauss to Countess Helga Fay Compton. That's why she is jealous of Countess Helga. Fear can lead a human into becoming a cruel person. That's what see in character Johann Strauss Sr Gwenn. In Hitchcock's film Saboteur 1942 Blind Man Vaughan Glaser asks his niece Patricia Martin Priscilla Lane a question Are you frightened Pat? Is that what makes you so cruel? We see this through the character of Strauss Sr too. Gustav Frank Vosper fears that his wife is having affair with another man. Hitchcock puts some of the film's humor through Gustav. Hitchcock used lengthy shots in this film. Hitchcock used long take technique for the first time in Juno and Paycock. Here we see some lengthy shots in the film.This film also shows Hitchcock's ability to make a film outside thriller genre. Although this film is ignored still I think it is a great film from Alfred Hitchcock. Even though Hitchcock wasn't really interested in this project still he put a great deal of effort into this film through the script and the direction.Like I mentioned before another thing I love about this film is the personal elements applied by Hitchcock. For Example the scene where Rasi's father comes and talks to Rasi about Johann Strauss Jr Esmond Knight. Rasi's father says this to Rasi  He Strauss Jr. will never make a baker. He hasn't his heart in it. This is like Hitchcock saying I am not interested in making musicals. I am interested in making films in the thriller genre. I think these elements make this film stronger because Hitchcock is giving his personal statements to the audience through this film in a subtle way.In a way I thought Countess Helga was a cunning lady villain. Countess Helga really did want Strauss Jr. to become a successful musician. But she cunningly used the idea of providing a successful music career to Strauss Jr. so that she could eliminate the love relationship between Strauss Jr. and Rasi. She was interested in Strauss Jr. romantically and she also knew that Rasi was jealous. But the love Strauss Jr. and Rasi have for each other comes from the bottom of their hearts. When Rasi tries to leave Strauss Jr. in the middle of the film Strauss Jr. comes to her and tells her that he loves her and he sacrifices his whole music career for her by becoming a baker. Even after Rasi tries to end the romantic relationship she comes to save her beloved Strauss Jr. when she finds out that he is in danger. It must be noted that Strauss Jr. becomes a successful music career mainly because of Rasi. Strauss Jr.'s musical work comes to fruition only after Rasi gets involved in his work. It was Rasi who gives the music tune of success to Strauss Jr. Not Countess Helga. Through Rasi Strauss Jr. succeeded with his musical work. Although Strauss Jr. gets his great success as a composer still he reveals to Rasi that he is nothing without Rasi. Despite all the conflicts the deep romantic feelings they Strauss Jr. and Rasi have for each other brings them back together in the end.I liked performances especially from Jessie Matthews Esmond Knight and Edmund Gwenn. My request is give this film a second chance. Afterall it is a film from Hitchcock. I rate this film 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been working through a few British Hitchcocks lately. I decided to try Waltzes From Vienna 1935 a rather lesser known work about which Hitchcock himself wasn't really very enthusiastic. I think that a fluffy romantic comedy was just too much out of his comfort zone. Esmond Knight Johann Strauss Jr was only adequate in the role and Jessie Matthews' singing ability was very much underutilised as was the opportunity to use more of the entertaining music of the Strauss family. One could never really engage with the romantic relationship between the characters Knight and Matthews played. Fay Compton's Countess was reasonable enough but again somehow seemed to lack conviction. The humour in my opinion was frequently forced slapstick predictable and unconvincing. On the other hand the set designs are frequently quite nice for a relatively lowbudget film by the standards of his later works. There was a pleasant performance of The Blue Danube but one has to wait so long for it and the utterly silly explanation of its inspirational source beggars belief! What makes the film worth watching is the great performance of Edmund Gwenn as the angry jealous and dark Johann Strauss Sr. Fittingly he has the last word in the film when he finally relents and signs his name for a young autograph hunter. Until this point he has been the only Johann Strauss. Now he finally recognises the merit of his son's work as he adds Senior to his name when the autograph is signed. It's a good moment and maybe just worth the wait. Allinall it's a film that makes no real demands but is worth having as an example of a very unusual sortie into the genre of the romantic musical by Hitchcock. And despite my reservations about it I think that all Hitchcock fans would like a copy in their collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a world of difference between Hitchcock's seven early sound films for UK's British International and this first of his Gainsborough sound films. Those seven early films were almost always deficient in the sound department and often clumsy in cinematic and editing assembly. The only standout and the only true Hitch classic from those seven is MURDER!.Now suddenly with WALTZES FROM VIENNA we have an assured sound film with fine cinematography sound art direction and costumes. Although it contains none of the Hitch touches we had come to expect from his silent and early sound career unusual camera angles and editing tricks and is the least Hitchcockian of any of his films it is an assured and confident directorial effort.It is fun to compare this to MGM's THE GREAT WALTZ of four years later. We have the same concocted group of characters young Strauss his bake shop fianc Rasi and a countess forming a love triangle. In the MGM film the countess becomes an opera singer. The big difference is that in WALTZES the rivalry between the Strausses father and son is central to the plot. The father does not appear in the MGM version at all. WALTZES centers around the composition of ON THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE DANUBE while MGM's film centers around the creation of TALES OF THE VIENNA WOODS.Although Jessie Matthews who is facially reminiscent of Ida Lupino also a rising UK star of the era is lovely as Rasi she is no match for Luise Rainer in the MGM version. Likewise Fay Compton is charming and elegant as the Countess and has a lovely singing voice but is no match for MGM's Militza Korjus as her opera singer counterpart who earned a deserved Oscar nom for the role. Esmond Knight in WALTZES is equally forgettable as Fernand Gravet in the MGM film as Strauss Jr. Edmund Gwenn is fine as the intolerant patriarch.Hitch directs as if he were Ernst Lubitsch whose elegant and humorous hand with lavish films in 19th century European Graustarkian settings dominated the early 1930s. There is a humorous scene where the Count and Countess converse through their maid and manservant in a central hall as the two latter make out  very Lubitschian. Deft comic touches like this abound. Note that Korngold was one of the adapters of the Strauss music for the film.The print I viewed which was in impeccable condition timed at 11640.To sum up this is a lovely confection and lots of fun. It was to be a sort of intermission in Hitch's sound career. He would follow this with a series of seven more UK films five of which are considered classics.".

This is not a bad film especially when compared to the 1970's fiasco but the 1938 film is all the more better than this version filled with life and joy and Militza Korjus. This comes alive in beautifully filmed crowd scenes and the lavishly filmed Blue Danube symphony. There's really a shell of a plot only showing how Strauss fought for his composer father's approval and his dad's resentment of his involvement with Matthews leading to issues between her and Knight. Edmund Gwenn is nowhere near the kindly gentleman of his later films overly proud and domineering as he watches his son surpass him in public adoration. As this came out as a popular operetta prepared to open on the stage it strives to capture the lavishness of the times but lacks real substance otherwise. Hitchcock obviously did pay great attention to the physical detail but it's easy to see why this is the least known of all his films. Hitchcock also allegedly did not get on with Matthews who really has nothing but her loveliness and beautiful gowns to make her noticable. I'm sure that this was amazing to see on the screen but it just never completely satisfies.".

	schema:headline " The masterpiece that came close to never existing by Johann Strauss Jr not Hitchcock...";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how historically accurate Alfred Hitchcock's 1934 operetta biopic Waltzes from Vienna is but the hypothesis that Johann Strauss' Blue Danube might never have existed because of a juvenile romance with the baker's daughter adds a delightful little twist to its already iconic dimension. Indeed it is like imagining that Leonardo Da Vinci wanted to paint a beautiful woman but she couldn't make it so he picked Mona Lisa sometimes historical events come close to never exist and if you have a hard time imagining what our universal musical heritage might have been had Johann Strauss traded his piano for a baker's hat imagine what history might have been had Hitler been accepted in that Painting School.Still when the film starts we know The Blue Danube will exist and will become the most universally known Waltz tune immortalized by cartoons and by a certain movie directed by Stanley Kubrick as to convey the poetic symbiosis between the space vessel a man's creation and the universe waltzing in sheer harmony. We know but it doesn't affect the enjoyment either because like everybody I love the theme. I'm not a musical expert but I know by just evoking the words 'Blue Danube' the melody is already playing in your head. And the most entertaining aspect of Waltzes from Vienna is to tell the genesis of this iconic melody regardless of historical accuracy when reality becomes legend print the legend.So Johann Strauss Esmond Knight tries to make a name for himself a twice difficult task because his name also belongs to his father Edmund Gwenn who's one of the greatest composers of Vienna famous for the Lorelei and the Radetzky March and because the paternal aura inevitably overshadows the son and affect his selfconfidence. Strauss Sr. himself considers his son a dull composer good enough to play second violin in his orchestra. Junior has no more confidence in his talent and his romance with the lovely but directive Rasi Jessie Matthews doesn't help. As the baker's daughter she can only marry him a man who'd take care of the bakery one that belonged to her family for four generations. So even though Strauss can't equal his father's stature in the worst case he'll marry a beautiful woman so much for selfmotivation.So a kick from fate was much needed and it finally came with Countess Helga Von Stahl Fay Compton who asks him to compose a melody out of a poem she dedicated to the Danube. We don't know if it's the love for the man or for his talent but in both cases as Strauss' love or muse she'll have the same rival. From this point there's a funny vaudeville aspect in that love triangle whose only 'tragic' aspect lies on the way it threatens the existence of a masterpiece to come that and many other factors like Strauss Sr.' reluctance to play for such pointless lyrics the Countess' husband jealousy the film's comicrelief and even Strauss is his own enemy thinking of giving up if the price to pay is Rasi' love. In a way the film questions the notion of ambition and the misguiding effect of love but I might give more credit to the film than needed to it's less a character study than the fun and enjoyable chronicles of the making of a music and I don't think it tries to do more than that.Hitchcock himself considered it as one of the lowest points of his career and It's true there are some bits of overacting and underacting and the lead protagonist doesn't strike for his charisma but it didn't bother me because the real star of the film is The Blue Danube and the movie is never as exciting as when you see the things that made its creation possible. There's one magnificent sequence where Strauss visits the bakery and the melody starts to evolve men throwing bread back and forth or tossing croissants or the sound a dough mixing inspire the whole music. So if there ever is a scene that makes the movie it's this one and it's the one that most reveals some early hints of the emerging Hitchcockian touch.Indeed ever since Hitch made films music took an important place within the plots illustrating a constant harmony between music and real life from cymbals crashing during a gunshot in The Man Who Knew Too Much to the violin screeching notes for each knife shot in Psycho or the psychological leitmotiv in Shadow of a Doubt. Hitchcock knows how to use music as an expressionist tool especially in 1934 when the talkies were still young. Music used to accompany the plots to serve the atmosphere Hitchcock made music serve the plot just like the whistled tune in the German expressionist masterpiece M. The Blue Danube is the film's central piece and we only get little bits of this much loved melody never completely sung or hummed not until the climax finally features the whole thing and that's the emotional payoff we all waited for.And since cinema is a world of images 'show and tell' you know the ending was the perfect way to conclude Johann Strauss' journey without any words. The father is approached by a young girl asking for an autograph he writes his name and calls her back so he can add Senior and his smile concludes the picture. Johann Strauss made a name for himself just by forcing his father to be called 'Senior'. So you see Waltzes from Vienna might belong to Hitch' period as British Gaumont contractdirector and not be consider as part of his canon it was his last musical film but it can be seen as an enchanting interlude before serious things start with his nextproject The Man Who Knew Too Much and not the least in terms of music's use. So Hitch might have learned one thing or two by making Waltzes of Vienna.".

And the most entertaining aspect of Waltzes from Vienna is to tell the genesis of this iconic melody regardless of historical accuracy when reality becomes legend print the legend.So Johann Strauss Esmond Knight tries to make a name for himself a twice difficult task because his name also belongs to his father Edmund Gwenn who's one of the greatest composers of Vienna famous for the Lorelei and the Radetzky March and because the paternal aura inevitably overshadows the son and affect his selfconfidence. Strauss Sr. himself considers his son a dull composer good enough to play second violin in his orchestra. Junior has no more confidence in his talent and his romance with the lovely but directive Rasi Jessie Matthews doesn't help. As the baker's daughter she can only marry him a man who'd take care of the bakery one that belonged to her family for four generations. So even though Strauss can't equal his father's stature in the worst case he'll marry a beautiful woman so much for selfmotivation.So a kick from fate was much needed and it finally came with Countess Helga Von Stahl Fay Compton who asks him to compose a melody out of a poem she dedicated to the Danube. We don't know if it's the love for the man or for his talent but in both cases as Strauss' love or muse she'll have the same rival. From this point there's a funny vaudeville aspect in that love triangle whose only 'tragic' aspect lies on the way it threatens the existence of a masterpiece to come that and many other factors like Strauss Sr.' reluctance to play for such pointless lyrics the Countess' husband jealousy the film's comicrelief and even Strauss is his own enemy thinking of giving up if the price to pay is Rasi' love. In a way the film questions the notion of ambition and the misguiding effect of love but I might give more credit to the film than needed to it's less a character study than the fun and enjoyable chronicles of the making of a music and I don't think it tries to do more than that.Hitchcock himself considered it as one of the lowest points of his career and It's true there are some bits of overacting and underacting and the lead protagonist doesn't strike for his charisma but it didn't bother me because the real star of the film is The Blue Danube and the movie is never as exciting as when you see the things that made its creation possible. There's one magnificent sequence where Strauss visits the bakery and the melody starts to evolve men throwing bread back and forth or tossing croissants or the sound a dough mixing inspire the whole music. So if there ever is a scene that makes the movie it's this one and it's the one that most reveals some early hints of the emerging Hitchcockian touch.Indeed ever since Hitch made films music took an important place within the plots illustrating a constant harmony between music and real life from cymbals crashing during a gunshot in The Man Who Knew Too Much to the violin screeching notes for each knife shot in Psycho or the psychological leitmotiv in Shadow of a Doubt. Hitchcock knows how to use music as an expressionist tool especially in 1934 when the talkies were still young. Music used to accompany the plots to serve the atmosphere Hitchcock made music serve the plot just like the whistled tune in the German expressionist masterpiece M. The Blue Danube is the film's central piece and we only get little bits of this much loved melody never completely sung or hummed not until the climax finally features the whole thing and that's the emotional payoff we all waited for.And since cinema is a world of images 'show and tell' you know the ending was the perfect way to conclude Johann Strauss' journey without any words. The father is approached by a young girl asking for an autograph he writes his name and calls her back so he can add Senior and his smile concludes the picture. Johann Strauss made a name for himself just by forcing his father to be called 'Senior'. So you see Waltzes from Vienna might belong to Hitch' period as British Gaumont contractdirector and not be consider as part of his canon it was his last musical film but it can be seen as an enchanting interlude before serious things start with his nextproject The Man Who Knew Too Much and not the least in terms of music's use. So Hitch might have learned one thing or two by making Waltzes of Vienna.";

But talented as I think he is I am not a die hard fan so was not disappointed to see him taking on a romantic musical comedy. I see now he calls it his 'lowest ebb' but to watch it you can't really tell. It is filled with lovely frames and graceful long shots and has a pleasant air with dashes of humour. Judging by the rest of his catalogue this seems to be everything he is against which is probably why he didn't like it but anyone with a broader spectrum should be able to find some charm in it. In fact it is probably beneficial that an unromantic like Hitchcock filmed it for in the hands of another it might have become too sappy but as it stands Hitchcock appears to know which moments are the cheesiest and never lingers on them.Strauss Jnr. is an aspiring classical musician and son of a renowned one Strauss Snr. He is in love with a bakers daughter Resi yet tempted by the Countess who has connections which would help him become famous. Resi is jealous of the Countess and in order to prove his love for her Strauss Jnr. must give up the music that he loves. One of the biggest flaws of the film is that it never gives us enough reason to think Resi is worth the ultimatum  to think she is worth giving up your dreams for. Her character and their relationship is quite under developed and thus the ultimatum becomes melodrama. To make matters worse the original stage play which ended with Strauss Jnr. and the Countess together was ditched seeing him get back together with Resi instead. One minute she appears distraught at his leaving her the next she is declaring her love. It doesn't make a lick of sense and is just one of those unpleasing crowd pleasers. The music limited as they were in their selection is a highlight and provides much of the films charm. I'm not sure if The Blue Danube bakery composure was intended as humour or not I guess so but either way it was great interplay between sound and image which seems to be what Hitchcock most took out of this film. The cynic may scoff but all artists know unlikely scenarios can birth ideas and that scene  using bread making as inspiration for the song  is a neat depiction of it even if a little unrealistic!This film is not nearly as bad as many would have you believe but neither is it a classic. It is simply a well made studio genre piece  just a different genre to the one we're used to from the director.".

If it wasn't for the uniqueness of the time and place in which it was made it wouldn't be worth remembering. The plot is creaky the acting a bit hammy and the dialogue forgettable. But that's not why you watch this movie. You watch it because it is to the modern eye not so much an entertainment as a fascinating and tragic historical document of a culture and a people that was at the time of filming about to be obliterated. You watch it because you want to see what an actual shtetl looked like to get a real life glimpse of a community that had its own language and music and traditions and because you know that that community is about to be wiped out. There is an eerie quality in watching the film because you know that most of the people flickering before you singing and laughing and going about their daily business would in a short time most likely be rounded up and sent to the death camps.You don't have to be specifically interested in Yiddish culture to appreciate that aspect of the movie  you just have to be interested in the ways people used to live especially when those ways have disappeared for one reason or another. People who enjoy this movie may also enjoy Nanook of the North a documentary about the traditional ways of the Inuit  you can see how an actual igloo was made. Perhaps the movie will appeal more to historians or ethnographers rather than the casual moviegoer just looking for an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes. So please don't complain about bad teeth and unattractive leading ladies because if that's all you're looking for there are plenty of better places to look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fascinating film. A sly comedy with terrific music has Molly Picon posing as a boy for safety and traveling the countryside with her father after they have been dispossessed. As musicians they meet up with a pair of wanderers and the four strike up some merry music and get involved in various situations including a wedding and a theater.Picon is no more convincing as a boy than were Marion Davies or Barbra Streisand in various films but you suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Picon is a major comic talent and also had a nice singing voice. Also good in the cast as Simche Fostel as her father Max Bozyk as Izak and Leon Liebgold as Froim. Dora Fakiel is funny as the widow Trauba.Joseph Green wrote produced and directed this film shooting in Poland in 193536. The film has almost a documentary feel at times capturing the look and sounds of rural Poland before the German invasion in 1939. It's a world long gone. Green filmed three more movies up through 1938 and escaped Poland with his films and returned to America.YIDDLE WITH HIS FIDDLE was certainly a lowbudget affair but it was a worldwide hit in its day especially in New York City where its box office clout rivaled that of any Hollywood film of the day. Highlights of the film are the wedding party scene and Picon's musical turn on a theater stage after she has ditched the boy's disguise. The film is available from several sources and has English subs. In a final and sad note Green never made another film after 1938. He said he gave up filmmaking because his audience was gone. He was referring to the Holocaust and the extermination of 6 million Jews.".

On multiple viewings of Yidl Mitn Fidl Green's undisputed masterpiece of the four films he made one's attention is drawn to its wealth of visual and compositional treasures while admiration for the novice filmmaker Green and his professional collaborator NowinaPrzybylski to be sure! can only grow.  A field of Monet haystacks followed a few moments later by a shot of Monetlike water lilies on the Moonlit river incredible shots of wind swept leaves and backlit clouds punctuated by a bolt of lighting  the visualization of Picon's stormy discovery of her budding love for Froyml as she sings Oh Mama Am I in Love pictorial countryside compositions worthy of a landscape painter a montage of Kazimierz rooftops reminiscent of Ozu's evocation of a Japanese shtetl in Tokyo Story  group compositions of the four shabbily clad singers that could have come from Flemish genre painters an extended wedding dance sequence that is a small film in itself and the memorable first collaboration of the competing buskers or street singers where the courtyard dwellers first close their windows one after another to shut out the cacophony while even a stray dog howls his disapproval segueing into the harmonious coming together of their music as Picon strikes up a haunting melody on solo violin  and then the reopening of the windows one by one with a montage of knowing nods and approving smiles  Aha this is more like it followed by a hail of coins from the upper stories. This scene alone depicting the first public success of the new little Filharmonia is one of the most eloquent purely cinematic sequences in the entire Yiddish cannon. brilliant!Another amazing section of this unique film is the freudian or perhaps Jungian dream sequence although it was probably not intended to be psychoanalytic as such in which we see the Itke's dilemma in love with a man but committed to maintaining her masquerade as a boy. The lapsetime photography fading her alternately in an out of boyish garb and frilly feminine attire all set to exhilarating music is state of the art for the time. The conception of these scenes so lyrically conveying her frustration from which she awakens clutching a cat predates by a decade serious postwar Hollywood films with Freudian iconography. The entire film is in fact modernist to the hilt for an ethnic musical comedy made on a relatively modest budget. Even the musical numbers are not typical klezmer fare but seem to owe more to jazzage influences than Second Avenue schmaltz and the overall musical soundtrack with its clever commentary on the action is quite exceptional. From this single film it is clear that Green had a vision albeit one that formed as he went along of a type of Jewish film that would eventually transcend the bounds of ethnicity.An interesting documentary aspect of the film the first Yiddish talkie to be shot completely on location in Poland is the portrait it provides of the traditional Jewish country town of Kazimierz on the Vistula as it looked in 1936  not to be confused with the Jewish district of the city of Cracow which is also called Kazimierz. There was no need at the time to paint phony street signs in Yiddish  they were already there. Kazimirez is also seen in a number of other Yiddish films where shtetl atmosphere is needed but Green and Przybylski's poetic evocation of the town from the opening shots of the hilltop castle the tiled rooftops and the central market place stand apart. Today Kazimierz na Wisle is still a popular summer resort  minus the Jews. In present day Polish films the Kazimierz locale is still used to evoke the ghost of lost Polish Jewry as for example in Wojciech Has' 1975 masterpiece Sanitarium Under the Hourglass or in the more recent Two Moons Dwa Ksiezice1992.Also to be seen are a few glimpses of Warsaw as it looked before the barbaric German destruction of the city in 1944 a montage of the streetcars the monuments and the Old City as they appeared just before the war. As an historical document aside from its primary entertainment value Yidl is in passing a portrait of everyday Jewish life in Poland just three years before the German invasion wiped it away. If one were to be limited to a single film in this exceptional series this is the one not to miss. A combination of pure joy and historical significance.".

On top of that the film had an incredibly antiquated style that might be a bit difficult to watch today.The story is about a young lady Judel and her father.

Later they meet two other musicians and become a teamand Judel maintains her disguise. However problems arise when she falls in love with one of them. And before she can tell him the truth he's swayed by another lady. What is poor Judel to do? I think that Yidl Mitn Fidl is much more an interesting curio than an entertaining film. It was the most popular Yiddish language film ever madethough there is NOT a huge audience for this today. Most people now living in Israel speak Hebrewwhich is not the same language. Additionally by today's standards the film just isn't very good.

And as dumbed  down and precious as most Broadway musicals are this movie is ten  times more so. I can only imagine just how starved the world must have  been for Yiddish entertainment in 1936 in order for this insignificant  item to have become a smash hit both in Poland and in some areas of  the US.  Beyond the brainless screenplay and childishly simple songs I found  the famous Molly Picon to be very disappointing. I think part of the  reason is that she is 38 in this film well past her prime. I also  believe she was never that good looking. But I must admit she did  manage to be fairly animated and vivacious.  Another strange quality of this film is its almost lunatic defiance  shown with respect to some of the marginal character's grotesque  appearance especially those with very bad teeth. I'm 50 myself and my  teeth are yellow from years of cigar smoking and they have gaps due to  gum disease so I'm not perfect. And I realize that a smile is still a  smile no matter now snaggletoothed especially if it's from someone  you have affection for. But the scraggily beards and the repellent  badtoothed grimaces that are thrust into the audience's face here are  hard to understand. Frankly they just made me nauseous. I leave it to  other more astute cultural critics than myself to make sense of why  this was included in the manner it was.  All in all I guess I'd have to say that this movie is little more than  an historical footnote. If you have a soft spot in your heart for  Yiddish culture than maybe you can forgive this movie's many and large  faults. I couldn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jaded by Hollywood's usually pathetic efforts to portray the real world of sports I was prepared to be disappointed by this movie. I grew up in Oregon attended U of O the setting for much of the movie and witnessed some of the events portrayed. So it was with a surge of satisfaction that I watched this movie that got it right at each point along the way. The attention to detail was astounding and the recreation of races was uncanny  I compared it to actual news photos later and the actors playing competing runners were chosen so well that their bodies and running styles actually match the original men.  When a movie cares this much about being faithful to details you can be sure it will take a quality approach overall. Billy Crudup's portrayal of Pre is full of inner fire and consistent with the real man Donald Sutherland is marvelously powerful and yet understated as Bill Bowerman the examination of the real reasons athletes compete is thorough and moving. Innovative use of music and camera work brings the race scenes to life and if this movie doesn't make you want to immediately go out for a quick ten you're a completely hopeless sedentarian in heart and body. This is among the five finest movies about athletics ever made.".

This film dramatized the life of Steve Prefontaine a preeminent U.S. distance runner in the 1970's.Though some of the details of his life were fudged for dramatic purposes the essence of Prefontaine was preserved namely his brash egotistical style of running and living.  In addition to its realism regarding the sequences filmed on the track this film gives a good account of the psychology of running.  Robert Towne did a fabulous job overall with this film but especially with the realism of the scenes on the track.  The dramatic element focusing on character development of Prefontaine as a person as well as a runner was also well done elevating it above your typical sports documentary and improving its entertainment value.Billy Crudup gives a fine performance as Pre.  He captures the arrogance and the crushing disappointment of his life.  He was also terrific in the running scenes. Donald Sutherland was also great as Coach Bill Bowerman.  Sutherland played the part with the perfect balance of patient guidance and frustration as Pre continued to ignore his prudent advice.  It was as if he were trying to guide a lightning bolt.This was an excellent sports story.  I rated it an 810.  Even for those who are not fans of track and field and never heard of Steve Prefontaine this is an entertaining and absorbing film.".

Strange really because Without Limits is an amazing story about Steve Prefontaine. I didn't know it was a biographical movie up until it showed the Olympics. So when I realized that the main character really ran like the wind and had no physical obstacles he couldn't overcome I instantly became an admirer of Steve Prefontaine.Billy Crudup who truly stole every scene even in Almost Famous is brilliant as Steve Prefontaine. His amazing transformation into the role of America's fastest runner was absolutely amazing and I had no idea who the actor was I only vaguely remembered his name. Donald Sutherland delivers his performance of the decade and the very beautiful Monica Potter does a great job as well.The subtle manner in which the director chose to display Pre's life is admirable and very touching. He truly was a role model. He's a role model to me now more than 30 years later. When he was explaining his running logic to his coach I really understood his look on life. He wasn't planning on being disappointed he went the distance.There's one more thing this movie deserves immense credit for. It made me want to run. AND ACTUALLY ENJOY IT!!!!!!!       A brilliant movie that made me think about my life.  810".

The story is well told with great performances and a superb soundtrack the greatest treat of all being Donald Sutherland's fantastic performance as Bill Bowerman. This bit of acting makes me wonder how once again Sutherland could be forgotten by the Oscars. With a career including such great roles as in MASH Klute and Ordinary People the fact that he is still cheated of even a nomination bewilders me especially when this film came in a year where the only true competition for such a performance was Geoffrey Rush's scene stealing work in Elizabeth. To all of you who agree with James Coburn's win I haven't seen Affliction.".

His movies include the screen play for Mission Impossible and the Classic China Town. China Town brought him both the Oscar and the Golden Globe for best Original Screenplay. He has directed very few films over the years but the fit for this project was on the mark.Steve Prefontaine was a larger then life figure. To tell his story right Robert really had to do his home work. He chose to film the actual locations surrounding Prefontaines life. This really gave it a realistic feel. To see the actual track where Steve broke almost every long distance record on the books. The track where he was never defeated. That had a lot of meaning. Just a side note This track today is the site of the Pre Classic. It's one of the worlds biggest track events of the year. The worlds top track and field star's take part in this event.I had the good fortune to play an extra in this film. I owned a 1965 Pontiac. Warner Brothers was scouting out some car shows and asked if they could use my car in the movie.  you can see it in the outside scene in front of the bar called The Pad. Later I was asked If i would like to appear as an extra. Of course i said yes. After a long shoot the director Robert Town came over and asked me to go to makeup. He had a scene for me. I was to appear with Billy Crubup who played Steve Prefontaine and Monica Potter who played Mary Marchx his girl friend. Although the scene was cut from the movie i got to meet some wonderful people. I had breakfast with Billy who turned out to be a warm person and later met Monica who seemed to be lonely during the long down times between takes.As i was moving my Pontiac on the set Donald Sutherland who was going over his script for an upcoming scene came over to me and told me how much he like my car. I showed him around and he seemed interested. He was really a great guy.I bring all this up to point out that a lot of wonderful people who took pride in their craft came together and put out a wonderful picture.

The monologue that Sutherland gives after showing television news footage of the infamous massacre that tarnished the Summer games in Munich is just...flawless. Monica Potter is fine here as the girl who Prefontaine had the most interest in.  Look for director William Friedkin appears early in the movie in a small role.  The film's directorcowriter Robert Towne is wise in how to handle the drama and tension here and shows what a genius he is.

Donald Sutherland is the consummate character actor literally BECOMING Bill Bowerman.  Billy Crudup as well WAS Pre! And he has a stunning future he was great in Almost Famous.  I would like to see more of Monica Potter who is quietly making a name for herself.  I enjoyed the reality of the script by Robert Towne and Kenny Moore.  And Towne's direction assured that no one overacted as I believe occurred in another docufilm on the same subject recently.  The cinematography made me yearn for Oregon once more and the editing as it is supposed to do completed the work with its continuity  I never felt as though I wasn't brought naturally from one scene to the next.  I have seen this film a halfdozen times and could watch it again and again  if only for the race footage! Steve Prefontaine after all was this country's best middle and long distance runner and moreover its quintessential athlete  American to the core.".

Some tasks are harder than others and its normally because either you don't feel your good enough or you don't feel others see you as good enough. If you give up you never find out if you really did have it in you to succeed. This movie did a good job of representing that. The runners in the movie were excellent the acting was top notch. The fact that they did film the movie in Oregon and still made it into a wonderful experience is amazing. I would love to see more movies just like this to show to my own kids.

Runnerphenom Steve Prefontaine earns his popularity not only for his talent competitiveness and great oneliners but he actually stood up as a major advocate for runners' rights against the Amateur Athletic Union which is still a major issue today between athletes and their governing bodies.

Not necessarily a happilyever after situation but this real life account of his life stands as a stern warning on a rather serious subject possibly making them consider learning from his mistakes and leaving any athlete feeling inspired to go out there and give nothing less than their best!.

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed watching this film mainly for two reasons the performances of Crudup and Sutherland and the emotional and dramatic strength of it. It's a biopic of one of the greatest wasted talents of the American track athletic history Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine nearly won a medal at the 1972 Olympics but was edged out at the last lap and came in fourth instead. It is a movie about promise disappointment and ultimately loss and tragedy.Billy Crudup plays Prefontaine very convincingly so much so that you forget you are watching an actor and not the man himself. This was made in the time when Crudup was just establishing himself as a new force and new star in Hollywood and this role certainly helped him establish himself as that. He is an exciting talent and very capable in expressing the emotions this part requires. Donald Sutherland of course plays his coach and the inventor of Nike shoes Bill Bowerman. He also gives a great portrayal of the man who was the main mentor and trainer of Prefontaine almost like a second father to him. Monica Potter plays Prefontaine's love interest and adds a love angle to the film which makes it complete and more enjoyable to watch.The beginning and the first half of this film is the most enjoyable part and also contains some humorous scenes such as the one where Sutherland exposes one of Pre's college stable mates as well endowed to the man's embarrassment. Also we see the rise of Steve's career on national level which culminates in the race where he beats the legendary Frank Shorter. However the triumph doesn't last as he takes part in the Munich Olympics and makes a great race only to run out of gas in the last lap and get overtaken by three men. There is a brief scene afterwards where the winner Finland's Lasse Viren gives a brief look of sympathy and acknowledgment to the disappointed Prefontaine and this scene is one of the dramatic high points of the film. It expresses the feeling of competing at this level and how it is to lose and win sometimes the line is very thin between winners and losers. The direction is great and kudos to the director Robert Towne for doing such a great job on what was his only third directing job. He is otherwise known mostly as a screenwriter but this movie proved he definitely had something to offer as a director to. In the end one can only think about how the 1976 Olympics and the history of long distance running would look had Steve not driven so fast that night.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's the difference between winning and victory? Is it semantics like religious and spiritual? Maybe there isn't one. On the other hand some would say there's all the difference in the world.Steve Prefontaine played by Billy Crudup was a distance runner in Eugene Oregon with scholarship offers from Yale Brown Villanova Princeton and Nebraska. The one school he wishes to attend however has remained silent. Two distance runners from the school and its assistant coach make a personal visit to his home but Prefontaine Crudup is not impressed. In the lessthanthree week period between that visit and the date when he must sign his letter of intent Bill Bowerman head coach of the University of Oregon track team sends a genuine plea to young Prefontaine asking him to attend. On his first day he shows an amazing inability to notice the obvious by asking a female student Mary Marckx played by Monica Potter to direct him to an area that is clearly visible ahead of him. He enters the building and sees a long line of fellow team members who recount tall tales of Bowerman's exploits in the military. He is summoned from another room and on the floor in front of him he finds his head coach. Bowerman played and earlier voiced by Donald Sutherland is making outlines of his runners' feet on tracing paper for the purposes of making shoes specifically for them explaining that taking an ounce off a runner's shoe amounts to pounds they won't have to carry during a race. The freshman athlete sarcastically compliments him and that is the end of their first interaction. The next day during a simple workout Steve gives one hundred percent finishes ahead of his teammates and according to Bowerman with a pulse rate north of one hundred and ninety. So begins the struggle that would define their relationship a coach's desire to instruct and an athlete's desire to put forth his best effort regardless of the consequences.Much has been made of the fact that Without Limits and Prefontaine a Disney film covering the same subject matter from a different perspective were released within months of each other. The general consensus seems to be that while Prefontaine is more accurate Without Limits is the better film. As I have not seen the former from beginning to end all I can tell you is that Without Limits is a masterpiece. Sutherland is mesmerizing as Bill Bowerman and Crudup in the first role I ever saw him play is just as entertaining if not more so. The conflict between them rings true and while you understand the position of the coach you root for the runner who seeks to leave the field knowing he's done his best. I have seen this film many times and if you haven't even seen it once you should. Now.".

So begins the struggle that would define their relationship a coach's desire to instruct and an athlete's desire to put forth his best effort regardless of the consequences.Much has been made of the fact that Without Limits and Prefontaine a Disney film covering the same subject matter from a different perspective were released within months of each other. The general consensus seems to be that while Prefontaine is more accurate Without Limits is the better film. As I have not seen the former from beginning to end all I can tell you is that Without Limits is a masterpiece. Sutherland is mesmerizing as Bill Bowerman and Crudup in the first role I ever saw him play is just as entertaining if not more so. The conflict between them rings true and while you understand the position of the coach you root for the runner who seeks to leave the field knowing he's done his best. I have seen this film many times and if you haven't even seen it once you should. Now.";

Nothing you encounter then seems as awful or impossible. But most people live their lives as though they believe they're going to live forever. Pre must have had a premonition of his early demise as he lived every day as though it were his last. He refused to pace himself as his wise coach Bill Bowerman attempted to advise him and as all us mere mortals must do if we hope tomake the finish line. Though Pre was not limited by conventional concerns or constraints as an athlete he did have definite obstacles to overcome as a person. These seemingly negligible human concerns can sometimes trip up and cripple even the most gifted athletes and Pre is almost undone by his own negligent hubris. But as if on a divine mission he heroically persisted in his own unique quest for excellence for immortality.Thanks in no small part to this fine film Pre may in fact succeed at his lofty goal of immortality as anyone who has had the good fortune to experience Without Limits will never forget it. While it excels as a fairly accurate portrait of a truly remarkable individual it absolutely soars as a tribute to that indomitable spirit that moves men to greatness. Robert Towne has captured the essence of the mystery of our competitive natures of how it's more than just about winning or being the best or being known for it. There's still something else undefinable that drives athletes that eludes description just beyond the grasp but of which we all somehow have intimate knowledge. This is Without Limits' most admirable attribute it's subtle and graceful exploration of the human soul. People oblivious to this aspect of Towne's creation will likely find the film to be only average or even dull. That's their loss.Billy Crudup inhabits the role of Steve Prefontaine so effortlessly and is so physically similar that it's still jarring for me to see actual footage of Pre the two are indiscernible. Donald Southerland as the curiously mannered coach is a delight so relaxed yet commanding. Monica Potter is very attractive and alluring as Steve's main squeeze. That Pre would die at 24 in a car crash is almost fitting for someone who lived life so fully so intensely. But he wasn't reckless he wasn't self destructive and that's why his death is all that more tragic. There are so many people that had it all and threw it away out of pride ignorance fear or weakness but Pre seemed to have conquered his demons and was well on the right track to a life of genuine meaning and joy when he was suddenly cut down in his prime. It's a tragedy of epic proportions the stuff of legends.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about truelife stories that generally make them more compelling than fiction. Without Limits is a good example. It tells the truelife story of Oregon longdistance runner Steve Prefontaine Billy Crudup known as Pre headed for the Olympics in the early 1970s.Pre was not built to be a runner he was too small. But determination and sheer guts helped overcome some of his physical limitations. When his girlfriend asks him how he can beat guys with more talent he responds A little secret I learned a long time ago ... I can endure more pain than anyone you've ever met.But he and his college coach legendary Bill Bowerman Donald Sutherland were constantly fighting. Bowerman explains their relationship From the beginning I tried to change him. And from the beginning he tried not to change. That was our relationship and even that never changed. Late in the film after some disappointments Bill and Pre continue their verbal battle. Pre Okay so what's my problem Bill? Bill Vanity. Pre Vanity? Bill Your insistence that you have no talent is the ultimate vanity if you have no talent you have no limits it's all an act of will.Without Limits is mostly a character study of a remarkable young man. Pre comes across as brash contentious charismatic cocky and something of a prima donna he also comes across as idealistic singleminded determined relentless selfassured a risktaker who is unafraid.The script contains some fine dialogue. And the plot builds in intensity as we approach the 1972 Summer Olympics. After that competition there's something of a lull. But given the fatalistic nature of the story the plot turns riveting toward the end.Color cinematography is competent. There are lots of closeup shots and some slowmotion shots during various races. Pop songs from the early 1970s along with era hair styles and clothes help put the story in its proper historical context. Acting is credible. Donald Sutherland has never been better.This is the second of two films about Steve Prefontaine. The other is the Steve James directed film Prefontaine 1997. Both films are excellent. These films are not just for runners or for people who like bios. They're for people who can appreciate the significance of an ordinary guy who really lived a guy who in his chosen field inspired others. That's what makes these two films worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Without Limits Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Without Limits is an inspirational film based on the greatest runner that America has ever seen and the tragedy that ended his life Steve Prefontaine. Billy Crudup looking very similar to the late Pre plays the role. The film takes a look into the personality of the swift footed Oregon native. It starts out with Bill Dellinger trying to recruit Pre. This is when you see the first signs of his sarcastic side taking two of Oregon's best track runners on an easy ten leading them all the way. You also get a glimpse of Pre's stubborn side as well telling Oregon's recruiter that he would not go to Oregon unless head coach Bill Bowerman who didn't believe in recruiting personally let him know that he is wanted. Pre got his greetings in a letter and headed to the running college of Oregon. Pre's first couple of weeks on the Oregon track team got him the nickname that lasted to his dying days Rube as a cause of his drive to push the limits. Pre's first collegiate race was a blowout that shot him to stardom smashing the American record. After that he was the allstar of Oregon's track team. Although Pre was a performer Bowerman insisted on pushing the limits on Pre's mental side trying to cure him of front running which in Pre's eyes was chicken sht. Racing was a work of art to Pre and he wouldn't sit back for 2.5 miles and then take the race in the last 500 meters. The movie focuses on this battle between front running and the way Bowerman wanted him to race holding back. This was the biggest struggle for Pre in his collegiate career trying to test the odds and push the limits when everyone thought they were impossible. He wanted to go all out until he had nothing left. In the 1972 Munich Olympics is where Pre would come to a devastating halt in success. With high hopes in the preliminaries Pre told reporters when they asked how he thought the race would turn out he stuck to his normal routine in saying I hope that it comes down to a pure guts race if so then I am the only one who can win it. He also said at about the same time a phrase that is famous even still today If you're going to beat you will have to bleed to do it. Pre got beat in the race for gold and from there he went into a state of depression. The movie is not just some statistic though it has the romance that diverges the movie to a more emotional side. Mary was the soft spoken religious type that went on with her normal self until she was spotted by Pre. Love that Pre had never felt before was driven to be with Mary. Although at first Mary wasn't interested Pre's sarcastic outspoken and completely goal driven attitude grabbed her and pulled her in. Pre's relentless and persistence really shows in his pursuit of love. His ability to think he could do anything he wanted confused most because he refused to believe in talent. Pre's legacy went to a crashing end as the movie closes out its story. A powerful ending that leaves a lasting impression of the 24 year old track runner that was troubled with the fact that a mediocre effort could win a race and a magnificent effort could lose one. Pre broke every American record from 2000 meters to 10000. Director Robert Townes does a great job depicting the struggle with help from a friend of Pre's Kenny Moore also a worldclass runner the dynamic duo comes together to make a classic sports movie that anyone can relate too.".

I can see why many in the public stayed away from the film itself  not too many moviegoers are interested in track  field let alone track  field in the 1970's. I always knew who Prefontaine was because I ran track and cross country in high school in the late 1970's and remember hearing of his untimely death. The film is done in a very straight forward kind of way and that's why I like it. It doesnt waste too much time with side stories or sub plots. One HAS to have a love story and many of the elements of the romance are some of the weakest moments but what can one do? You have to take SOME of the studios notes besides  even though I think the actress playing the lead is beautiful I have seen her in other films and I find her work very onedimensional.

	onyx:emotionText "Billy Crudup totally loses himself in the lead role and Sutherland does some of his best work as Coach Bowerman. I can see why many in the public stayed away from the film itself  not too many moviegoers are interested in track  field let alone track  field in the 1970's. I always knew who Prefontaine was because I ran track and cross country in high school in the late 1970's and remember hearing of his untimely death. The film is done in a very straight forward kind of way and that's why I like it. It doesnt waste too much time with side stories or sub plots. One HAS to have a love story and many of the elements of the romance are some of the weakest moments but what can one do? You have to take SOME of the studios notes besides  even though I think the actress playing the lead is beautiful I have seen her in other films and I find her work very onedimensional. But Crudup is amazing as the obsessed runner and the scenes of the actual races are stunningly photographed and edited. Well done.";

	schema:reviewBody "Oh man!! What a fun movie! Without giving too much away it's a ghost movie. The plot wasn't anything to write home about it's been done about 100 times before but it was just done better than it has been in recent memory. Seems that movies try to overdo everything lately with special effects gore music and violence. Not here... I kept thinking that they had taken a step back and returned to what makes movies spooky. It's not a computer generated demon or a high intensity soundtrack it's a creaky door it's a reflection in the glass it's that feeling when you know you just pushed that chair in a minute ago and now it's away from the table again. That's what makes people uneasy that's what makes them check their closets and sleep with the hall light on when they go home.The most notable difference in the movie was the silence. I'd guess that about 50 of the movie was completely silent except for breathing footsteps creaking doors... wonderful. Seems that lately the powersthatbe just have to fit every second of the soundtrack into the movie seems they should since nowadays there's commercials for the soundtrack separate from the movie in many cases in order to boost the spooky level... it rarely works. The silence in the movie just added to that tension in your shoulders and made you slowly edge up on your seat.If I had to pick anything to complain about it'd be the weak foreshadowing of two events I don't want to give anything away but you'll know when you see it. It's like they gave up on trying to write them into the plot. They may as well have put a subtitle on the screen or a Pop Up Video bubble that told you that what they were saying was important. For my wife and I it gave a bit away about how the movie was likely to end.Michelle Pfeiffer was really good I'd guess she was in almost every single shot in the film so anything but a great performance would have shown. I'm not normally one to judge actors performances but there's some credit to be given to someone who can act that scared using only her eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets a nod at the academy for this one.".

He has done this with the use of the very many clichs of a thriller. He heightens the tensions throughout the movie by gradually lowering the camera creating a very claustrophobic atmosphere which works in harmony with the terrifying jumpy music.The acting in the movie is of the highest quality and Pfeiffer is admired for her superb performance which creates a strong sense of vulnerability to the role and entices the audience. The casting of Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford as a married couple is very convincing and genuinely believable.What Lies Beneath is a very frightening and scary movie with all the traits of a classic thriller.

	schema:reviewBody "It is interesting to revisit the archived reviews available at EbertandRoeper.tv and listen to their comments regarding this film and their perception of its ability to frighten its technical construction and its characters' success in aiding the narrative. Each of the respective critics dislike What Lies Beneath in both its construction camerawork and plot development and its effectiveness in creating suspense.  While this movie is enjoyable regardless of whether it was viewed on opening weekend or whether it is the third or fourth viewing on television it is more understandable that Ebert and Roeper had some issues with the film during its theatrical release whether they have altered their views upon its DVD release I do not know.  The true beauty of this film is the manner in which it holds up over time and how it DOES splice all of the great filmmaking techniques together into a nice homage to classic suspense films.The plot including the incremental revelations of paranormal activities within the newly goneofftocollege childless home of Pfeiffer and Ford is not really what drives this movie.  Ebert and Roeper complained in their critiques that there are too many red herrings that serve no purpose but to mislead the audience thus when they are exposed as mere ruses much of their existence within the film is superfluous.  But that is the fun of the movie.  That is the fun of many classic suspense films even numerous Hitchcock films.  There are situations that are added because they lend a hand in the buildup fear not the characters' fears but the viewers' fears.  In Psycho the image of the cop's face outside Leigh's car window masked by sunglasses expressionless and looming over the camera is scary to viewers.  Yes it fits into the script because she is frightened as a result of her thievery.  But ultimately it is the viewers' own fear of cops' intimidation tactics that makes the scene effective.  In What Lies Beneath hearing cries of distress through a fence that offers no real visibility of the cause of such pangs is very similar.  Who cares if it is mainly a device to build uneasiness?To be fair Ebert and Roeper really seemed more irritated that too much of the plot and its elements of mystery were revealed in the marketing of the film .  The true cause of the haunting that Pfeiffer's characters is terrorized by was apparently revealed rather blatantly in the trailers and television spots used to promote the film. Therefore Ebert and Roeper seemed more angry that they were not even given the chance to enjoy the unfolding of the plot and the subsequent suspense.  However it is only know that their argument seems to be more fallacious in its use of logic.  I understand that each person has a reaction to a film based on the uniqueness of their own likes dislikes and inclinations to genre but there is an established set of framing techniques camera movements and lighting designs that reliably cause an emotional reaction by the viewers.  It is very hard to find Ebert and Roeper's critiques impervious to default when this film does not tend to lose much of its emotional effects upon repeat viewings.To elaborate the unknown ghost its motivation and its history and relevance to Claire Pfieffer are plot points for the basic construction of a three act narrative and a three act narrative is a contrivance proved to be effective for the assimilation of information by means of tapping into the inherent way humans use logic to invent concepts from raw data if a then b and if b then c therefore if a then c. Subsequently the artist now has a template on which to attach the expressions of humanity that create the emotional impact of the film or play etc..  In a sense the structure of What Lies Beneath is very simple and only attempts to create a large enough template to succeed in allowing the viewer to follow the basic arc of the narrative.  The strength of the film exists in the the technical construction and how precisely orchestrated it is to get the most emotional impact from the various moments in the film.  Watching the film for the third or fourth time the plot isn't new or exciting the characters aren't complex yet the film is still suspenseful.  It is not the unfolding of the story creating all the suspense rather it is Zemeckis's camera use his choices for sound and light design and his ability to precisely coordinate a myriad of elements that enables the film to work as a whole.  This is not a film that would survive on its script.  This is not a film that would survive by its stars alone.  This film succeeds because of the choices in direction.Finally to counter Ebert and Roeper's unsound critiques of this film attention should be paid to their mention of films that they found parallel to What Lies Beneath whether thematic or visually reminiscent in some way.  Roeper states that the movie has too many cliches and that the ending is reminiscent of Carrie Cape Fear and even Gone with the Wind.  On the other side of the aisle Ebert compares the film to Ghostbusters because of moments he found comedic that were not intended to be so although I don't find any scene unintentionally comedic.  The odd aspect of their critiques is the absence of any mention of the numerous shots Zemeckis directly lifted from several of Welles' films and a litany of shot selections that pay homage to Hitchcock. While this movie isn't groundbreaking it is a great exercise in technique that results in a fun effective film.".

It is just about as Hitchcockian as you can get and I rate the bath sequence as gripping pardon the pun as taking a shower at the Bates Motel. The plot is thin and the action is played out sedately. Yet it seems perfectly timed in setting the mood of the whole piece. I particularly liked the musicand the supporting actress Diana Scarwid whose lighthearted attitude during the seance scene made it all the more chilling. A perfect example of good filmmaking with only a slight plot. I am sure this movie will mature with age until it is rightfully regarded as a modern classic. Count the number of times you jump!".

Well yes the influence is obvious unashamedly so. But the trouble with that is having the maestro as a benchmark renders all other modern day attempts as folly. However casting aside that gargantuan issue What Lies Beneath is an effective creeper come thriller that boasts star credentials.Directed by Zemeckis formed from an idea by Steven Spielberg from the story by Sarah Kernochan and starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fragmenting Spencer's. That's a pretty tidy bunch from which to launch your movie. What follows is a mixture of genuine unease and mystery red herrings and standard boo jump moments all of which almost gets lost on a saggy middle section as Zemeckis plays Hitchcock one too many times and loses sight of the supernatural heart of the piece not helped by Clark Gregg's meandering script I might add. None the less the picture gets pulled around for the finale as the spooky combines with thriller to produce some quality edge of the seat stuff. But it's only then that you totally realise that the makers here have tried to cram too much in to one film. In eagerness to manipulate the audience for the fine ending though you probably will have it worked out at the half way point the film just ends up as being confused as to what it mostly wanted to be.Pfeiffer is excellent and looks stunning and Ford gives it gusto when the script allows. Support comes from Diana Scarwid Joe Morton Miranda Otto and James Remar. The house is suitably eerie with its waterside setting and Alan Silvestri's score is perfectly in tune with the creepy elements of the piece. It's a fine enough film in its own right regardless of the Hitchcockian homages. It's just that it should have been a far better horror picture than it turned out to be. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was a wellcrafted thriller in the Hitchcock style I really wish I had not seen any of the trailers prior to viewing this movie because some of the suspense that would normally have built up during the first hour was spoiled by knowledge gained from the trailer.  To be fair the trailer doesn't spoil everything thank goodness but it spoils enough to make the first hour seem a little slow in the buildup.Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific in her role of the housewife and mother now facing an empty nest as her daughter heads off to college.  Robert Zemeckis does a fine job of building suspense and keeping the audience just a little offbalance in spite of the spoilers in the trailers in combination with Pfeiffer's acting one is never quite sure whether Claire Spencer is deranged possessed or calculating.  While Harrison Ford does his usual fine job of acting as the obsessive genius husband living in the shadow of his supergenius father it is Pfeiffer who of the two has the most screen time and who therefore carries the film.My only other complaint besides the spoilers in the trailers has to do with a minor bit of casting. While I think Wendy Crewson is a fine actress I have to question casting her as the wife of one of Dr. Spencer's colleagues given that she so recently appeared as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One... seeing Ford and Crewson together on screen again was a distraction that brought me out of the film at a point when I should have been getting more absorbed into the film.  But it is a minor point.Overall the movie kept me in suspense virtually throughout it's entirety and the final 30 minutes were gripping.  At several points toward the end I thought for sure I knew what was going to happen only to be surprised by a sudden twist or unexpected turn.  And the film does have its humorous moments as well Diane Scarwid helps to lighten things up as Claire's somewhat ditzy friend Jody and Zemeckis has some fun with some of the backdrops in the quaint New England towns a Vermont town named Adamant? And the name of the curio shop is The Sleeping Dog as in Let sleeping dogs lie.Rating 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Zemeckis by dint of such phenomenally popular films as Romancing the Stone Who Framed Roger Rabbit? the Back to the Future trilogy Death Becomes Her Forrest Gump and Contact was already a highly successful Hollywood director when along with producers Steve Starkey and Jack Rapke he formed the ImageMovers production company in 1998. As the company's first project Zemeckis chose screenwriter Clark Gregg's What Lies Beneath a modernday ghost story that the director told his crew he wished to bring to the screen as Alfred Hitchcock might have done IF the Master of Suspense had had access to modern FX technology and computer graphics. Never mind that none of Hitchcock's 54 films dealt with ghosts or the supernatural per se. Filmed largely in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont near Addison during a hiatus from shooting Cast Away the resultant picture released in July 2000 was still another significant feather in Zemeckis' already crowded hat and like those other films named features impressive yet subtly integrated FX to complement a highly intriguing story. As both a horror film and an exercise in suspense What Lies Beneath must be deemed a complete success.In the picture we meet an attractive middleaged couple Norman and Claire Spencer and indeed as portrayed by Hollywood icons Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer the Spencers might be one of the handsomest couples in the history of the horror film! Living as they do in a beautiful home overlooking a Vermont lake the professional couple Norman is a renowned geneticist Claire a retired cellist although their only daughter has just left for college would seem to have an enviable marriage. But before very long weird occurrences begin in the newly empty nest. Strange noises and whisperings a broken picture frame spectral reflections in the surface of the lake and in perhaps the film's single scariest scene bathtub water all serve to convince Claire that the ghost of a young woman is haunting her abode...possibly the ghost of her new nextdoor neighbor who Claire believes has been killed by her husband. But as it turns out the truth is considerably more complex and the unraveling of this truth will go very far in unraveling the Spencers' marriage too....So DOES What Lies Beneath strike the viewer as a Hitchcockian exercise abetted by 21st century computer wizardry? I would have to say yes. There are any number of scenes that are undeniably scary or suspenseful the most agonizing of which is the wonderful scene in which Claire lies paralyzed in a bathtub that is slowly being filled with water. Some of Alan Silvestri's score is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's classic music for Psycho while Claire's use of binoculars to spy on her neighbors at night cannot help but call to mind Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together and do have some screen chemistry they make a credible couple although Norman as it turns out might be one of the least sympathetic characters that Ford has ever essayed. For this viewer however the bulk of this picture's success must lie squarely with Pfeiffer who appears in virtually every single scene and is simply terrific in all of them. Watching her in this film in which she easily displays far more dramatic heft than her costar and also reveals what an effective scream queen she can be the viewer will most likely regret how few other horror vehicles Ms. Pfeiffer has appeared in. And really besides 1994's Wolf I can think of no others unless we stretch the point a bit and include 1987's The Witches of Eastwick and this past summer's horror comedy Dark Shadows. One of the finest combinations of sensational looks and undeniable acting chops to this day and Michelle is 54 as I write these words she is quite simply one of the best we've got and makes Claire Spencer and What Lies Beneath a character and a film to savor. The venerable Leonard Maltin Movie Guide apparently does not concur in this assessment concluding its lukewarm comments with the statement that the story doesn't make sense. But the film DID make perfect sense to me...as long that is as one is willing to believe in spooks. And by the end of Zemeckis' highly effective film most viewers I have a feeling will be uttering that famous line of the Cowardly Lion I DO believe in spooks I DO believe in spooks I do I do I do I do I DO believe in spooks....".

Some of Alan Silvestri's score is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's classic music for Psycho while Claire's use of binoculars to spy on her neighbors at night cannot help but call to mind Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together and do have some screen chemistry they make a credible couple although Norman as it turns out might be one of the least sympathetic characters that Ford has ever essayed. For this viewer however the bulk of this picture's success must lie squarely with Pfeiffer who appears in virtually every single scene and is simply terrific in all of them. Watching her in this film in which she easily displays far more dramatic heft than her costar and also reveals what an effective scream queen she can be the viewer will most likely regret how few other horror vehicles Ms. Pfeiffer has appeared in. And really besides 1994's Wolf I can think of no others unless we stretch the point a bit and include 1987's The Witches of Eastwick and this past summer's horror comedy Dark Shadows. One of the finest combinations of sensational looks and undeniable acting chops to this day and Michelle is 54 as I write these words she is quite simply one of the best we've got and makes Claire Spencer and What Lies Beneath a character and a film to savor. The venerable Leonard Maltin Movie Guide apparently does not concur in this assessment concluding its lukewarm comments with the statement that the story doesn't make sense. But the film DID make perfect sense to me...as long that is as one is willing to believe in spooks. And by the end of Zemeckis' highly effective film most viewers I have a feeling will be uttering that famous line of the Cowardly Lion I DO believe in spooks I DO believe in spooks I do I do I do I do I DO believe in spooks....";

	schema:reviewBody "In What Lies Beneath director Robert Zemeckis gives us a thriller that reminds one of the great films made by Alfred Hitchcock. Now don't get me wrong nobody in my opinion will ever top the master of suspense. Zemeckis does come close. Without giving too much away the story revolves around a suburban wife the ever beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer who we learn had been in a serious accident months earlier. She begins to see things and despite support from her husband Harrison Ford and friends wonders what really is happening has happened or will happen. Zemeckis gives us such plot elements such as things that go bump in the night visions that only the Pfeiffer character can see mysterious next door neighbors a ouija board the doubting husband and the loyal friend. This works pretty well in the first half of the movie but because What Lies Beneath is essentially a two character story events in the second half are often telegraphed before they happen. Pfieffer and Ford are very good in their roles as always. I do think though that more involvement from the supporting cast would have heightened the mystery. But all in all What Lies Beneath is a very good movie.".

Claire becomes convinced that the woman next door has been murdered  that her spirit is haunting her house tyring to communicate with her but the woman turns up safe  well. Claire continues to hear things  strange occurrence's happen which lead her to believe the house is haunted but by who  what do they want...Produced  directed by Robert Zemeckis this supernatural ghost story has a touch of psychological thriller about it too  is a well crafted old fashioned spooky tale of dark secrets from the past coming back to hunt the present. The script by Clark Gregg is apparently a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Mr. Blanchard's Secret 1956  is a coolly effective supernatural thriller it takes itself extremely seriously but as a whole it works  succeeds at what it sets out to do. At over two hours in length it is a long film but while watching it it didn't feel that long which is always a good sign the story is absorbing  gripping as it starts off a lot like Rear Window 1954 but it turns out to be a huge red herring  it ends like some sort of horror themed Fatal Attraction 1987. This is the kind of film where every bit of seemingly useless exposition comes together at the end  is used from the moment we know that the phones don't work on the bridge you just know it's going to be used somewhere  the explanation by the two scientists about the paralysing drug which stands out at the time as being extraneous is also put to good use before the film finishes. If you have the patience to stick with it not be put off by a slightly sedate pace then What Lies Beneath is a really good supernatural thriller.Director Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath while production on another one of his films Cast Away 2000 starring Tom Hanks was shut down so Hanks could lose weight that in itself seems a bit odd really as I would have thought you needed to give a film all your attention rather than just making one to pass the time. Anyway it didn't do the film any harm in the long run as it's very good the film is very stylish too with a muted colour scheme that gives everything a dark eerie overcast look  feel about it. There are plenty of jump out of your seat moments Zemeckis uses every trick  clich in the horror film book with people  dogs leaping into the frame unexpectedly loud music playing when you least expect it although it also has some nice modern CGI computer effects too. The main difference here compared to lots of other horror films is that Zemeckis knows how to make the clichs work  turns in a highly effective film. The one stand out sequence is when Pfieffer is paralysed in the bath as it slowly fills with water it's one of the most tension filled  suspenseful scenes I can remember seeing in a modern horror flick.With a supposed budget of about 90000000 one has to say that sounds like a hell of a lot of money for a film where not that much actually happens it takes place almost entirely within one house with minimal effects  a small cast. Making near 30000000 on it's opening weekend alone I think I'm right in saying this was a big success  does prove modern audiences can sit  watch a two plus hour film which is mostly exposition based if it's done properly. The acting is very strong from the cast.What Lies Beneath is a a old school slow moving but involving supernatural horror thriller ghost story that I enjoyed a lot I can see a lot of people being bored by it but as far as I'm concerned it's their loss.".

	schema:reviewBody "I spent hours last week on the net reading reviews and boy were they rough on this flick. Most reviewers went out of their way to say it was boring stupid unoriginal a waste of time how Harrison Ford looked so old he should retire more on that later and one critic even went so far as to compare it to Battlefield Earth for Godssake! Needless to say I had such low expectations that I went to see it by myself not wanting to subject friends or family members after hearing how awful it was. I even considered skipping the first half because I heard Harrison Ford wasn't on screen much for the first hour. While WLB was not the scariest or most exciting movie of all time I left the theater glad I saw it. Unfortunately for me a careless reviewer gave away 99 of the 'twists' in the story line and the trailers already gave 75 of it away anyway so there was only one real surprise.The surprise turned out to be that I actually had fun. I think everyone already knows the setup and plot by now so I won't bother with a sypnosis. I will say that every seat was full another surprise and there were more screams from the audience than I've heard during a movie in years. We're talking over a dozen times where half the audience yelpedjumped in shock and a handful of moments where everyone screamed. Loudly. We are talking adults here too not nervous little kids. In all fairness many of the jumps are the 'fake' kind that you are all too familiar with if you've seen enough horrorsuspense films i.e. OH GOD! You almost scared me half to death sneaking up on me like that. The movie also frequently employs the device where a character is in frame the camera pans along with them out of frame for a second then we pan back and someonesomething has suddenly appeared in the frame behind themcheap shot but it works. Many reviewers complained that the score was overdone with a loud blast of music in the scare scenes to ensure everyone jumped. Honestly I couldn't tell whether or not this was the case because the audience's yelling covered it up! There is one very big unexpected jumptrust me you'll know it when you see itthat will probably end up on a lot of 'scariest moments' lists I am ashamed to say I SCREAMED at the top of my lungs like a little girl and so did everyone else in the theater including grown men. note if you do decide to see this movie see it with a group of friends or at least a significant other because you will have much more fun I found that it's pretty embarrassing sitting there all by yourself and suddenly yelling and spilling your candy.On the negative side there are many cliched horror movie moments and the dialogue wasn't exactly brilliant. There were also parts where they overdid the foreshadowing to the point of insulting my intelligence. Example Call on the cell phone we're running late Oh the cell phone doesn't work That's right the cell phone won't work in the middle part of this bridge. Yes I forgot about the fact that the cell ph OKAY! WE'VE GOT IT NOW! THANK YOU! So the script could have used a polish but not enough to ruin the movie. Another complaint I've heard is that the movie rips off Hitchcock's films a collapsing character pulls a shower curtain down off the hooks with her a character is named Norman etc but I do know the difference between a ripoff and a loving tribute and Zemeckis knows what he's doing I highly doubt he was trying to trick the audience into thinking these were his original ideas. For the record Harrison Ford still looks great with his shirt off better than some actors in their 30's. He has recently reached the point where he can not pass for a man in his early 40's but compared with other actors in their late 50's he still looks mighty fine especially without that unflattering angry brush spiky hair style he's had in his last couple of films. Let's just say there were plenty of women there with biiig smiles on their faces during the love scenes. When he gives that sexy crooked boyish grin about 20 years instantly drop from his face.OK enough rhapsodizing about Harrison Ford back to the movie. Diana Scarwind as Claire's best friend is funny and lightens up the tone. Michelle Pfieffer is wonderful making some of the corny dialogue sound genuine. Many less talented actresses would simply go into woman in peril mode but her acting is very impressive and even the critics who really hated the movie gave her credit for that. Oh and speaking of aging well there were plenty of males in the audience looking pretty happy during the love scenes too. So guys if your date or wife votes to see this chick flick don't make her drag you you'll have a much better time than you think.  Sure this movie is no alltime horror classic but it is a fairly intelligent entertaining thrill ride of a movie that deserves a much better chance than the critics are giving it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it's any indication of how strongly I felt the need to comment on how good this film really is its that this is my first commentary at IMDB.Robert Zemeckis obviously has fun nodding to Hitchcock at every turn but there's no denying that this is one of the film's key strengths.I'd rather my directors homage Hitchcock than John Carpenter when it comes to making a horror movie.Unfortunately the theatrical trailer just didn't do the film justice or I would have gone to see this one on the bigscreen but it seems that may have been the studio's attempt to hide the plotline and defer any spoilers.I wholeheartedly agree with the positive comments listed for this film. Michelle Pfeiffer held the film throughout with admirable acting. An intelligent protagonist. Every creek and reflection scared the hell out of me because it was scaring the hell out of her. I couldn't sleep for days. This is testament to good old film making strong acting and a fine script. The music alone contains some of the most unnerving violin scrapes I've ever heard dynamically balanced by the long periods of soundtrack silence.Yes there were predictable elements to the film's plot but they added to just how plain disturbing the storyline is as it unfolds creating that unnerving sense of you know what's coming but there's nothing you can do to stop it a la chainsaw. From the opening title subliminal image if you saw the movie  you'll know what I'm talking about to the great twist at the end I was scared out of my wits and ontheedge of my seat the whole time.I have to rank how I felt watching this film to how I felt watching The Shining and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for the first time  quickly placed in a state of terror and things only getting worse on your nerves as the film spirals down.A great film.".

	onyx:emotionText "If it's any indication of how strongly I felt the need to comment on how good this film really is its that this is my first commentary at IMDB.Robert Zemeckis obviously has fun nodding to Hitchcock at every turn but there's no denying that this is one of the film's key strengths.I'd rather my directors homage Hitchcock than John Carpenter when it comes to making a horror movie.Unfortunately the theatrical trailer just didn't do the film justice or I would have gone to see this one on the bigscreen but it seems that may have been the studio's attempt to hide the plotline and defer any spoilers.I wholeheartedly agree with the positive comments listed for this film. Michelle Pfeiffer held the film throughout with admirable acting. An intelligent protagonist. Every creek and reflection scared the hell out of me because it was scaring the hell out of her.

	schema:reviewBody "Overall rating 110  8Scare factor 110  9Number of characters you sometimes just want to slap 1First of all comments seen here and elsewhere note that most of this movie's many scary moments are thoroughly preannounced by swelling music and such.  This is correct.  Only a very few of the main fright points are done in Jaws style i.e. sprung upon us when we can't  help but be offguard.  Still in my view this doesn't detract much. This a VERY scary movie and a good investment if you like shock and surprise.  I definitely wouldn't advise seeing it while holding a hot coffee or a fragile dessert.That's not to say there's nothing in this film that detracts.  First what talent Michelle Pfeiffer has is largely wasted during the first hour on a script that's way too full of boomerangst cliches.  A big piece of the film's first half  showing her character's daughter leaving for college and mom's resulting slushy reaction  could  have been easily condensed or evaporated trimming several minutes  from the total 129.  If this was there to demonstrate what a good  friend of mine likes to call EMS Excessive Mom Syndrome and to help confirm the idea that ole mom is even more delicate than she looks  then I suppose it worked.  But so did several other shorter  simpler scenes which sufficed.  At one point I heard a ValleyGirl sort of voice in the row behind me mutter after a heavy sigh Okaaaaay so she's wound a little too tight we've got that already....  It was an accurate point.  Somebody please wake me when this stock character type  the artsy wispy idle tormented 40ish uppermiddleclass housewife with white teeth and a whiter Volvo  breathes its last.Some comments have also noted considerable over and underacting by both Ford and Pfeiffer.  I agree.  The mix of supercalm moments and shocker scenes while effective is jarringly uneven.  I don't mean  to imply that a horrorthriller film should always jolt us only at  neat and regularly spaced intervals but one could almost wonder if this film was divided into several parts at the beginning each then being assigned to a separate director who rarely spoke with his or  her collaborators.  That said I can't fault the intensity of any  of the several peeinyourpants moments.  As predictable and hollow as many of them are each is a definite seatgrabber and it would be hard to spoil any of them even with a detailed verbal description.The oftennoted similarities to Rear Window are obvious even too obvious but not essential to the plot and in retrospect may seem gratuitous. Again while the film may keep your mind engrossed and your breathing shallow the overkill factor is high.  Some of the  camera or editing work seems overdone in the same way  sometimes almost playfully so and to such an extent that I can't really say for sure if the performers are guiltier there than the director.For example at one point about halfway through a progressively more unnerved Claire Pfeiffer is inside her home peering intently at her neighbor's house which we see in the predictable breathless pan from window to window supposedly through her binoculars.  When she finally sights Thorwald  ooooooooops I mean her neighbor Warren Feur  we of course see his scowling face in a lightningzoomed closeup with a loud blast of eerie music.  and while this isn't done quite as badly as say the Large Marge eyeballpopper scene in Peewee Herman's Big Adventure it's in the same class when it comes to timing  soundtrack!  It's quite a scary moment but you might easily feel cheated by it soon afterward because 1 you realize that the zoom is a major part of what made the shot so scary and 2 this Feur guy isn't really involved in the plot except to affirm yet again that Claire's a borderline basket case.Miscellany  The film is set in Vermont where I once lived and I was pleased with some of the accuracies while also struck by some inaccuracies or improbabilities.  None are really worth mentioning except for the repeated mentions of the town of Adamant.  Adamant is a real  place in Vermont but it's referred to at least twice in the script as being down seven meaning south on U.S. Highway 7  a main northsouth thoroughfare running the length of Vermont's western edge and traversing the BurlingtonLake Champlain area where the film's characters obviously live. But Adamant lies some 40 miles EAST of Route 7 a little over halfway across the state.  It can't realistically be described as down seven from anywhere else in in Vermont or even Quebec and in fact does not lie astride any numbered highway.  If the multiple mentions of this town's name  are a new kind of product placement technique I'd be interested to know the rationale for so thoroughly mislocating it!What happens in Adamant does have some bearing on the plot but  the town itself is not significant or at least not significant  enough to justify its quirky repetition.  If I missed something about this while making a quick visit to the john someone please  clue me in.Special effects  Not many but those that we do see are quite good. No extraordinary innovations just good screamfuel.Bottom line  It's scary and worth checking out.  It's lame in spots and the story isn't all that new but these things won't likely make you sad you went.".

But What Lies Beneath is directed by Robert Zemeckis and the man can deliver.  So if the film is meant to fall in the Hitchcock genre it can easily happen if it's in Zemeckis' hands.I'm not going to get into the plot at all.  I'd like to mention Michelle Phieffer's great performance which is definatly a very complex character that she handles greatly.  Harrison Ford is as good as always and is starting to make a slow comeback after a few disappointments Random Hearts Six Days Seven Nights and the good but overrated Air Force One.  The film is done with great style and has a much slower pace than what most people are used to.My one and only complaint is the marketing for this picture.  This was a good movie but could have been great if it wasn't for the trailer.  Whoever made the theatrical trailer for this film deserves to be shot.  Robert Zemeckis must of looked at it and said It's O.K. with complete sarcasm. For those of you that have seen the very overplayed theatrical trailer to the film I'm sorry to say it but you know a whole lot more about the film than you should.  If you have yet to see it make sure if it ever comes on to cover your eyes and plug your ears.  It really DOES give away that much to prove my point  before the film started I took a guess about what would be discovered in the climax of the film and I was sad to admit I was correct.But don't be misleaded whether you knew as much as I did walking into the picture or not this is a good film nonetheless.

Our movie theatre is quite new and the screen is enormous with the sound almost blasting your eardrums so we were in the right setting for this mystery thriller. I read the good comments of the previous members and have to agree with them. Part of the story is given away. Don't know why they do that. I prefer not knowing too much but they want to rope us into the seats I guess. So without giving too much away it was exciting to watch Pfeiffer work her way through this mystery.Harrison Ford is certainly in fantastic shape for a 58 year old and with a nice tan was very easy on the eye mine anyway! While my husband enjoyed looking at Michelle Pfeiffer. We did jump in our seats quite a few times. Watching Michelle dive into the water would make you run and take diving lessons if that was truly her! Their acting made the story believable and when the story's believable I always enjoy it. Harrison Ford can be a bit on the wooden side at times. My husband's impersonation of him is to turn his mouth up to one side keeping his mouth straight. Pretty good! As you look at the wonderful house they live in in this movie it makes you wish you had one just like it without the ghost of course! For those who like suspense I don't think you'll be disappointed.".

I watched it two years ago and it still rates as possibly the worst film of all time in my book well certainly one of them.The first half hour or 45 minutes of the film is all irrelevant wonderfully summed up by one of the only good bits in the film the hilarious scene where the neighbour mockstrangles his wife at the party. I understand the purpose of throwing us off the scent but we would have to have been on the scent in the first place. A waste of time.After that it gets even worse. Any good thriller should have you saying by the end... oh of course I knew it was himher. Not this one. You walk out thinking how the heck was I supposed to guess that it was the girl he butchered seeing as I never knew he butchered a girl in the first place?The slogan describes him as the perfect husband who made 'one mistake'. Well I'm sorry to get all preachy but anyone who has an affair on his wife and then brutally murders the person with whom he had an affair so as to keep it all hushhush is certainly not 'perfect'. If he had been a brilliant scientist and a loving husband who accidentally created a new supervirus when trying to cure AIDS then maybe I could get the slogan...And what's the story with the dead person coming alive in the water? There's the supernatural willing suspension of disbelief and all that but at that point any respect I had for the film was lost.The theory some of us developed is that there was a first scene entirely missing from the film one that would have made sense of the entire thing possibly where we would have been shown the affair or something. How else could it have been this bad?One final point early on in the film Ford goes away for the weekend on business and yet miraculously reappears halfway through the weekend to comfort Pfeiffer for one scene only to disappear again. Is this explained in the film I couldn't follow what the heck was going on or is this an amazing goof?My only regret is that there is no 0 rating I could have given it. Well that and the fact that I paid good money to see the darn thing!".

Any good thriller should have you saying by the end... oh of course I knew it was himher. Not this one. You walk out thinking how the heck was I supposed to guess that it was the girl he butchered seeing as I never knew he butchered a girl in the first place?The slogan describes him as the perfect husband who made 'one mistake'. Well I'm sorry to get all preachy but anyone who has an affair on his wife and then brutally murders the person with whom he had an affair so as to keep it all hushhush is certainly not 'perfect'. If he had been a brilliant scientist and a loving husband who accidentally created a new supervirus when trying to cure AIDS then maybe I could get the slogan...And what's the story with the dead person coming alive in the water? There's the supernatural willing suspension of disbelief and all that but at that point any respect I had for the film was lost.The theory some of us developed is that there was a first scene entirely missing from the film one that would have made sense of the entire thing possibly where we would have been shown the affair or something. How else could it have been this bad?One final point early on in the film Ford goes away for the weekend on business and yet miraculously reappears halfway through the weekend to comfort Pfeiffer for one scene only to disappear again. Is this explained in the film I couldn't follow what the heck was going on or is this an amazing goof?My only regret is that there is no 0 rating I could have given it. Well that and the fact that I paid good money to see the darn thing!";

	schema:headline " Fassbinder's darkest and most punishing examination of personal exploitation";
	schema:reviewBody "Many if not all of Fassbinder's films focus on weighty emotional issues and characters plunged into personal despair but none more so than the torturous and overpowering melodrama of In a Year of 13 Moons 1978. Here Fassbinder created a film that is completely miserable in both tone and content from the first frame until the last with the director taking the personal loss over the suicide of his lover Armin Meier and turning it into a suffocating chamber piece of pain and humiliation. Like his earlier masterpiece Fox and his Friends 1975 the film focuses on the personal exploitation and persecution of a sensitive character at the hands of the people that he loves as he finds himself cast against a cruel backdrop of the grimy and oppressive homosexual subculture of 1970's Frankfurt. However unlike Fox and his Friends the spirit of Meier's death and the guilt that we assume Fassbinder was suffering from at the time of the film's conception have here removed any prevailing notion of hope or the promise of escape that hungover the character of Franz  the lottery winning carnival worker from the aforementioned Fox as he sought an end to his cruel suffering  and replaced it with a continually degrading emphasis on shame and deprivation.Fassbinder establishes the pitiless tone of the film right from the start with an opening vignette showing our central character dowdy transsexual Elvira Weishaupt dressed as a man and wandering through a park in the early hours of the morning looking for trade. After successfully managing to hookup with a suitably butch maleprostitute her secret is soon discovered and the 'john' alongside a couple of similarly macho friends beat and mock Elvira leaving her as a shivering crying wreck halfnaked on an disused traintrack. From here Elvira limps home to her cramped apartment only to be plunged into a torturous violent argument with her exboyfriend which again leaves her used and humiliated. The film continues in this episodic approach as we follow Elvira over the course of a few days and eventually find out more about her true character and personality and the events in her life that led to the eventual creation of the person that she is when we first discover her. These events are no less cruel and humiliating to the character of Elvira  who has clearly made a number of mistakes either as a result of naivet arrogance or blind stupidity  as we discover the process that turned a handsome young man with a wife and infant daughter into an overweight alcoholic wreck abused and betrayed by the various men in her life and the social pariahs that hang on the periphery.As ever with Fassbinder the presentation of the film underpins the feelings of the character and the world that she inhabits perfectly with the cramped spaces of her apartment made even more prisonlike and oppressive by the director's claustrophobic use of staging design and composition. Fassbinder undertook the role of cinematographer himself here and shot the film on grainy 16mm which again adds to the stark and colourless feeling that the film conveys. The ugliness of the cinematography with its dimly lit rooms fragment composition and awkward camera movements could be seen as either amateurish on the part of the filmmaker or as a deliberate attempt to distance the viewer from the characters and the emotional subtext in a manner that is reminiscent of Brecht or more appropriately Godard's cinematic appropriation of Brecht and his theatre of alienation. As with the subsequent political satire The Third Generation 1979  once again shot by Fassbinder himself  the unconventional approach to cinematography is combined with further elements that attempt to similarly disarm us and make the process of viewing the film as difficult as possible. The opening scene itself is emblematic of this approach with Fassbinder obscuring the frame with large titles and an opening text that scrolls slowly over the entire frame before continuing with his use of obscured images and fragmented miseenscene.Fassbinder also uses jarring cuts with scenes seemingly beginning during the middle of a conversation or after the context of the scene has already been established whilst sound and the disorientating way in which the director has characters talking over one another while music plays disconcertingly in the background all continue this idea of deconstruction and emotional distraction. The ugliness of the film fits perfectly with its tone with the legendary scene in which Elvira and her friend wander ghostlike through an actual slaughterhouse where cows are dispatched in graphic detail whilst a monologue is recited to give us the entire backstory of this truly tragic figure. Whether or not Elvira is an extension of Fassbinder or the personification of Armin Meier is unknown though there is certainly that element to the interpretation. I'd imagine that there is also some of the director in the portrayal of manipulative antagonist Anton Saitz who recalls the depiction of Fassbinder in the director's own segment of Germany in Autumn 1978. Regardless In a Year of 13 Moons is a fascinating if entirely difficult work from Fassbinder one that brims with an uncomfortable feeling of personal confession and searing self examination that is grotesque repellent and utterly draining whilst also standing as a powerful and passionately realised piece of work that is both remarkable and affecting.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant naturally but very difficult to watch. spoiler in first paragraph";
	schema:reviewBody "Part melodrama part infernal parody of 'Candide' 'In a Year of 13 Moons' is one of Fassbinder's most moving films without once relinquishing his icy formal control or savage cynicism.  It achieves a remarkable effect whereby its protagonist's world seems to open up as the film continues  he begins alone meets people traverses a lot of places  but actually closes in imprisons him simply reinforcing the labyrinthine world of his own private hell where the only escape is death.When we first meet Elvira the film's transexual heroine she is dressed in men's clothing trying to pick up boys in a dusky park.  When her female appurtenances are discovered she is beaten up by  a group of thugs left limping on a railway track offering a promise of escape she cannot take up. Fassbinder's alienating method here is typical of the film as a whole.  It is very difficult to make out what is going on the scene is very murky. Fassbinder's editing and composition tend to fragment rather than establishthe action leaving us with a montage of darkness and sinister figures scored to Mahler in an ironic rejoinder to the passive gay fantasy of Visconti's 'Death in Venice'.  To add to our confusion Fassbinder's intertitles begin explaining the meaning of the title making it difficult to follow both levels.  Just as we've finally made out what's going on and the film reaches what might be considered a dramatic or emotional crisis forcing the viewer into the scene Fassbinder hurls us back framing it in long shot and throwing screenfilling credits over it!So while I suggested the film was moving it's with no help from the director.  Elvira shares a narrative trajectory of decline similar to one of Fassbinder's most famous characters Fox indeed here it is worse she never begins with wealth and 'love' but is abused from the very start. The opening sequences reveal the extent of Fassbinder's despair.  Elvira is beaten up by thugs in the outside world.  When she comes home she is attacked by her socalled boyfriend who abandons her having savagely and interminably insulted her mocking her alcoholism her weight problems suggesting her brain has shrunk  that it would be better for the world if she was crushed like an insect.  Fassbinder's vision is not a reassuring one there is no refuge from a brutal world the violent poison infects home and outside alike.So Elvira would seem to be a figure deserving of our sympathy.  There is worse to follow including being flung off her lover's speeding bonnet.  In true melodrama fashion her past is revealed onionlike and her tragic quest to find the entrepeneur Anton Saitz to apologise for insulting remarks made about him in an interview inspires devastating revelations as does a trip to the nunnery orphanage where she was brought up.This mixture of emotional masochism and traumatic incident might suggest a film of overpowering pathos.  But Fassbinder never uses the methods that would allow us get close to Elvira's plain sympathetic music or the closeup.  Indeed it is very difficult to make out the drama at all. Invoking his mentors Sirk and Godard Fassbinder does not foreground the drama very often what is going on in the narrative is marginalised squeezed into a tiny doorframe so that what's privileged on screen is a door or a wall or the objects of a room each scene is very lengthy theatrical like a selfcontained episode as I suggested in 'Candide' with lots of talk stylised movements and positioning of character at other times you can barely make out characters in the dim lighting who is actually speaking in a scene this might be just my inability to differentiate German even those scenes that seem to concern Elvira crucially explanations of her past for instance have no room for her characters talking about her as if she wasn't even there.But like Sirk the film is shot through visually with Elvira's sensibility her feelings of confinement ironically considering her apparent gender fluidity a fluidity Fassbinder provocatively refuses to sentimentalise or celebrate.  Elvira's vision is truly one of hell where horrific scenes in a slaughterhouse offer a peaceful refuge to the human world of confined indoor spaces of intrusive decor or frightening emptiness one scene with the suicide glows with a blazing red light suggesting infernal fires. This is not a realistically rendered Berlin but a living nightmare  there can barely be 20 people in this sparse dream landscape even though Elvira seems to travel the whole city.Naturally such a bleak Fassbinder film is incongruously funny the reunion scene is unbelievably flippant but the humour turns back on the viewer and we must ask ourselves when we laugh are we laughing at Elvira sharing in her oppression.  Is her lethargy her paralysed will also sharing in her oppression?  The film is full of lingering images of destruction eg the primitive computer games.".

Elviras character has to be one of the most pitifully human in the history of cinema and the recounting of her last few days alive are rife with powerful imagery  especially the haunting slaughterhouse scene...not for the weak of stomach! Vegans beware! to convey an extraordinarily beautiful heartwrenching tale. The story is loosely based on one of Fassbinder's own lover who committed suicide and perhaps it is that personal background that infuses the film with a palpable sense of reality... few films have felt more true to me than In a Year of 13 Moons. Fassbinder's approach in this film is a little different than in say Ali Fear Eats the Soul there is less dialog perhaps to convey the loneliness and hopelessness of Elvira in her final moments. The acting is superb and the characters will stay with you long after you turn your TV off. I would recommend the Criterion edition for anyone interested in the film its chockcull of extra features and a really cool introduction by Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie should have been called Despair had Fassbinder himself not made the film with that title just before In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden 1978 which was very personal for the writerdirector who had to come to terms with his lover's suicide. This drama follows the last few days in the life of Elvira  Erwin Weisshaupt. Several years back Ervin underwent the sex change operation in hopes to win love of the man he loved. It did not help him to make Anton love him and it did not make him happier. It may sound beautiful I'll do anything for love I'll be anything you want me to be but by trying to be someone else a person simply loses hisher own identity becomes lonely and desperate and has no way out.The movie is the most touching moving powerful and devastating Fassbinder ever made  it is impossibly difficult to watch at times but it does not make it a bad movie. The acting is fantastic by everyone the directing is tight and Fassbinder is always in control taking movie from its melodramatic roots to the heights of pure tragedy never been oversentimental and even providing some humor. The choice of music with the references to Death in Venice eternal and never fulfilled longing and to Fellini's Amarcord looking back at one's life trying to find the roots in the childhood to understand how and why the things happened the way they did makes the film even more compelling.Warning there is a scene in the slaughterhouse which is almost unbearable to watch. It is the very important scene but be prepared for it. It does not spare any details of the job done and in its emotional impact is as horrifying as The Blood of the Beasts 1949 the short documentary by Georges Franju.".

The choice of music with the references to Death in Venice eternal and never fulfilled longing and to Fellini's Amarcord looking back at one's life trying to find the roots in the childhood to understand how and why the things happened the way they did makes the film even more compelling.Warning there is a scene in the slaughterhouse which is almost unbearable to watch. It is the very important scene but be prepared for it. It does not spare any details of the job done and in its emotional impact is as horrifying as The Blood of the Beasts 1949 the short documentary by Georges Franju.";

	schema:reviewBody "One could not watch Fassbinder's In A Year With 13 Moons and not feel something close to depression. He has captured the actual emotion itself in its raw and natural form and transposed it onto the screen in the form of ErwinElvira. With the help of Volker Spengler's uncanny performance Fassbinder has forever changed the way film will deal with disintegration of the human spirit.The opening scene depicts the main character being beat up by men after trying to have sex. This horrible situation paints the perfect image of the main character who is the epitome of being a victim. The tragic character of Erwin a meat worker fell in love with one of his coworkers Anton. Upon revealing his feelings to Anton Erwin is told it would be fine if he were a woman. This begins the fall of Erwin. He goes to Casablanca and gets a sex change in hopes of being with Anton.Elvira Erwin's new identity is just as much of a slave to Anton's wishes as Erwin was. Though Anton was only the first Elvira's life is full of uneasy relationships where in the end Elvira finds herself alone and depressed. She had changed her whole life for Anton and when he finally finds out he could care less. One can not help but feel for Elvira and her struggle to live happily.There is a scene of cows being slaughtered while there is a long monologue by Elvira. The cows hang there helplessly as the butchers slit their throats and the blood flows freely. The scene is very hard to watch yet one could not help but relate the kinship of Elvira and the cows. Elvira seems powerless to stop others from controllingruining her life and much like the cows Elvira is helpless as the world bleeds her of her life. The cows are stripped of their skin and thus their identity which is precisely what Anton has driven Erwin to do.The most telling scene in the film however is one where Elvira watches a man hang himself in Anton's building. The man is another victim of Anton's and he believes that suicide is not the forfeit of ones life because there is no will to live but rather it is the will to live that causes one to reject this life to live free of its oppression. This man shows Elvira a reflection of herself in another which perhaps she never thought of before due to living her life for others.Truly depressing In A Year With 13 Moons is absolutely a work of art with hints of melodrama comedy and character study. The collaboration of great acting and directing has brought life to the tragic Elvira and will evoke feeling in even the most close minded of viewers.".

Both persons try to change their identities Hermann Hermann by taking over the identity of Felix Weber Erwin Weishaupt by changing his sex and becoming Elvira. Both persons share their desire to transcend their personality by which action they trap themselves and get into a maelstrom of events out of which there is no other escape than insanity in the case of Hermann Hermann or death in the case of ErwinElvira. In both cases despair may be seen as the causing motive of the process of selfdestruction. Despair is the only condition of life I can accept director R.W. Fassbinder said in an interview. It seems as if each person is given a certain role which he or she has to play and which displays this person's personality as perceived by society. Maybe everybody is surrounded by an infinite number of empty but already reserved personalities that will be taken by future persons. If somebody transcends his personality he thus steals one that was already determined to someone else an action by which the equilibrium of subjectivity in this world is disturbed and for which therefore a transcending person has to be punished. And the mechanisms of punishment work in the two forms of destruction or selfdestruction the latter possibility is enabled by guilt a concept that transfers the position of the executor from the society to oneself. Moreover once changed one's own personality there is not return anymore. When Elvira cuts her hair and dresses again with men's clothes he is not accepted anymore by his wife and his daughter as Erwin although Elvira is still recognized as Erwin by Anton Saitz for whom he once changed his sex. Heshe is thus neither Erwin nor Elvira thus both persons or somebody between both persons and therefore in any way taking the position of a third person which again means transcendence and has to be punished by society which paradoxically turns out to be a strictly immanent concept of organization while persons tend to be transcendental.".

Interesting to say that also in 13 MOONS there is an angel like in the xmas Movie. It's the character ROTE ZORA. While Capra's angel had success it's will know it will not happen in 13 Moons. of course while you will learn by the Frank Capra movie how important each human being is in the world we live in Fassbinder gives you here the lesson how hopeless life can be. So while you have tears in your eyes by watching IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE you see all the hope in this movie and you know there will be a happy end. From the first second on in this movie you know there will be no happy end. And you will have no tears in your eyes at the end but perhaps you will be a little bit speechless. From Hollywood a movie like this never will come. This movie don't want to entertain you in a Hollywood way. so be prepared!This movie is the most personal Fasssbinder for sure. He lost some weeks before his boyfriend. then he wrote in three days the whole script. Unbelievable to tell that he ALSO was responsible for BOOKEDITINGCAMERA Michael Ballhaus was asked for but he couldn'tPRODUCINGIDEAEQUIPMENT and of course DIRECTING it. The Music score is very good classic meets suicide the new wave band meets sixties rock'n roll meets Connie Francis. A terrific Volker Spengler as the main character as also a stunning Ingrid Caven. Almost impossible to understand the whole plot when you have to read the English subtitles it's absolutely recommend when you can speak German.Beginning with the written introduction about the 13 Moons through the slaughterhouse scene which is remarkable for the whole movie because here he shows us the Life and the Death the hopeless the movie is about in a short sequence through the next scene where elvira is lying very depressed on the bed while the record player plays a xmas song it's a wonderful life...... but the song has a scratch hopeless again to the important scene where elvira tries to become erwin again but failed the two hours of this movie is very sensitive. It's not a movie to watch between Forrest Gump and Star Wars .... It's a movie which brings you back to the ground of earth. So honest that you feel pain.Everyone will have a time in life in which he falls in a hole. This movie is showing that. A tragedy. OR a horror trip.".

The film is In a Year With 13 Moons. I hesitate to even write about it knowing that no matter how close I come to revealing a sense of the richness and complexity of this film it will only detract from what Fassbinder actually accomplished. It is a confessional film and although certainly not intended to be a critique of gay culture in the end by its beautifully brutal honesty ended in being just that to so many prominent gay persons certainly not all but simultaneously revealing that gay culture is but a reflection or a microcosm of the larger universal matrix of sadomasochistic imprisonment that no one escapes from other than as martyrsaint I can embrace SaintFassbinder a matrix that includes all landscapes that are relational societal religious philosophical anthropological economic and political of every shape and hue. This film resides in eternity so there is no end to itit is epic. It requires multiple viewings and then after a pause lasting moments or years beginning again. It cost a little over 300000 to make yet every frame is perfection in lighting dialogue miseenscene camera work editing and directing and he did it all himself except with some help in editing a personal film of the highest order. He tells the painful truth in every second never letting up from the beginning alarming us to the fact that this film will be an emotional slaughterhouse with every curtain ripped away. Stay at your own risk or cover your eyes and stuff up your ears because this will be a bumpy road like no other. And its finale reveals the glory of the dignity of the human person that can reside in no place other than the truth. Few films capture this in such magnitude. I think of Antonioni's L' Aventura Bergman's Winter Light and Tarkovsky's Solaris but no film I can think of is as personal as 13 Moons.".

Even the content alone deserves praise. This is 1978. I am no expert on transgender history but I cannot think of any films that tackled such a heavy subject this far back.If anything the film seems even more topical today as transgender issues are more front and center. The mainstream is ready to stand up for the rights of these folks and films like 13 Moons should really be reexamined by the film community.".

And indeed the vast majority is really good. Some have said this is his best work. While I am not sure I am ready to jump on that train I am also not willing to deny the possibility. Even the content alone deserves praise. This is 1978. I am no expert on transgender history but I cannot think of any films that tackled such a heavy subject this far back.If anything the film seems even more topical today as transgender issues are more front and center. The mainstream is ready to stand up for the rights of these folks and films like 13 Moons should really be reexamined by the film community.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film effectively dealt with emotions. The emotions that the actor felt was conveyed to the audience effectively. For example when the transsexual woman cried in the game shop she was crying because of despair. She was alone and helpless. There were two men who went up to her but they only looked at her and did not help her. This was an effective scene which conveyed a variety of emotions from sadness despair to the cruelty and indifference of the people in the world.However there were times when the film became boring. The scene where a prostitute friend of his flipped the channels of the TV was very long. It was probably about 10 minutes long! The woman aimlessly look at the television changed the channels and a minute later changed the channel again. This went on for so long that I did not understand why the scene had to be so long.Also it was strange that she had to watch a man hanging himself without intervening. Normally if you see someone trying to kill himself you would stop him. This is the natural response. However in that scene she did not stop the man but totally ignored him and let him kill himself. I tried to analyse why there was such a response. Maybe it was because the director wanted to increase the level of sadness that the woman in the film felt so sad that she could not care about anyone.The part revealing the woman's past life was touching. I felt sad when they said that she could not be adopted from the orphanage because her biological mother did not approve of this. She was afraid of letting her husband know that she gave birth to a child without his knowledge. Because of this selfishness she missed a chance of getting real love from her adopted parents.In short I think there are lots to think about from the film. It is highly thought provoking.".

	schema:reviewBody "In einem Jahr mit 13 Monden is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1978 written and directed by German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder. This is a movie already from the last 5 years of his career and sadly also his life. At 120 minutes it is one of his longer works and it is also in color like most other of his films. The lead actor here is Volker Spengler and he worked with Fassbinder on several films. This one here however is his great moment in the spotlight. The other roles he had were considerably smaller. Fassbinder is known for picking some of his regular cast members as lead characters to give them their welldeserved attention and like I said here it is for Spengler. Another example would be Zeplichal in I Only Want You to Love Me. Fassbinder is also known for elaborating a lot on smaller characters and giving them screentime but here it is really almost everything about Spengler's ErwinElvira. And his performance is also what carries this pretty long movie and what makes it work. I can imagine that many other actors may have done a worse job and because of that I would have given a lower rating. Spengler however is really convincing. It is also good that Fassbinder kept the absurdities fairly low in terms of quantity this time which he sometimes fails to do and it can destroy a serious movie like The Third Generation. And as I said serious movie it needs to be noted that this film is 100 drama and tragedy about a severely struggling soul and how he pulls some of the people around him into his misery. There may be some situational comedy at times but this is always true with Fassbinder and still nobody should see this as a funny film. As a whole this is definitely among my more preferred Fassbinder films. There some films from him that I like even more but not too many as I felt that this one here rarely dragged despite its massive runtime. And there is certainly a handful Fassbinder films that I found a lot less interesting. I recommend the watch here. In a Year with 13 Moons is a quality film that once again includes several of Fassbinder's regular actors not only Spengler but also Caven Kaufmann and John only to mention a few. Go check it out. And one final note this is a very personal film for Fassbinder as he made it to deal with the suicide of a beloved one. You can look for details yourself if you care about the background story.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's rather unfortunate that this is the only film for which many current movie fans remember Mary Pickford because of the neglect of silent films and because of the undue weight given to wellknown but arbitrary motion picture awards.  While she is often unfairly blamed for the mediocre quality of Coquette the fault really lies elsewhere.  Without a thorough adaptation of the material to make it more suitable for the screen hardly anyone could have performed well enough to make this much better.The story did hold possibilities but it's the kind of familiar rather routine melodrama that needs interesting characters unusual situations or snappy dialogue to make it work.  There is none of that here  only a talky and generally predictable script which would work better as a stage play or even a radio play.  Neither Pickford nor Johnny Mack Brown has much of a chance to give it life.  They do their best and they simply perform their roles as they were written.  Nor is it one of the worst movies ever  it does contain some stretches of genuinely good acting and the story is at least a little better than the warmedover scenarios of so many recent movies.Pickford deserves to be remembered for her many fine performances during the silent era.  She could also have made top quality talking films if she had been given the chance but she was never given roles that allowed her to use her greatest strengths.  Further in the early sound era producers and directors were overly interested in dialogueheavy pictures like this which seemed impressive at the time only because talking pictures were still a novelty.  Audiences of the day enjoyed them but now they look as dated and dull as today's overpraised computerimagery extravaganzas will look in fifty years or so.  None of that is the fault of the actors and actresses of the era.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mary Pickford won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance in this film  and this fact has dominated the way people have treated it over the years. Yes perhaps her award had more to do with her power than her performance  but the performance is actually pretty good.  At times she rises to great emotional heights  the death scene is quite extraordinary and the courtroom sequence powerful.  Of course she's too old for the role  but she was too old for nearly every part she ever played and just a few years later Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer played Romeo and Juliet to great acclaim  so such age issues were probably not issues in 1929.It is true that she talks a little like an adult Shirley Temple did Shirley model herself on Mary  they certainly played many of the same roles? but her silent acting is excellent  her looks can really kill.The supporting cast is not very good except for the wonderful Louise Beavers  but Johnny Mack Brown is devastatingly handsome as Mary's love interest.  The script betrays its stage origins and the film suffers the same problems most early talkies suffer  inadequate use of music poorly synchronised sound effects completely absent sound effects eg doors opening and closing silently and limited movement of both actors and camera.But all things considered this is a worthwhile little film  certainly not great but not as bad as myth would have it.  And the ending is really gorgeous.  Watching the great silent stars struggling in early talkies I always feel that they were learning a new craft just as the cameramen directors and writers were.  Sadly the audiences were less forgiving of their beloved stars than they were of those unseen behind the camera and rejected them before they had a chance to develop a new acting technique.  I can't help thinking that if they had been given the chance many of these actors  would have been great talkie actors.  The technicians were allowed to develop but by the time they were skilled enough to make the actors look and sound good most of the old stars had gone.  The supreme example of a silent star who was allowed to develop is of course Garbo  and to a lesser extent Ramon Novarro but he could sing  which helped.  Is it possible that given the same opportunities as Garbo we may have seen Fairbanks Pickford Talmadge Swanson Bow Brooks Gish Gilbert Colleen Moore Leatrice Joy etc for many more years than we were allowed?  But within ten years of this film being made Gilbert and Fairbanks were dead Gish was carving out a new career on the stage Pickford Swanson Bow Talmadge Brooks and Moore had retired Joy was doing the occasional character role and even Ramon Novarro was out of work.  What a waste!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Broadway play COQUETTE ran for a year in the late 20s starring Helen Hayes. Mary Pickford hoped that this vehicle would be a solid entrance into the new sound medium as well as scuttle her little Mary image that had plagued her for the last decade.At age 37 Pickford is too old to play Norma Besant BUT she looks great so the age factor is not really a problem. The problem is the play. It's creaky and farfetched and doesn't work as a late 20s film. The fault is not with Pickford who turns in a terrific performance although in a few spots it all gets rather stagy.Also very good is Johnny Mack Brown as Michael. He exhibits some real fireworks in the argument scene with Pickford's father John St. Polis. But these 2 good performers can't save the film from the rotten acting of St. Polis he plays a despicable character and William Janney who plays brother Jimmy. Matt Moore plays a sadsack suitor to no great effect and Henry Kolker is over the top as the prosecuting lawyer.The screenplay is probably too close to the stage play and director Sam Taylor seems to have absolutely NO ear for dialog or eye for composition.Despite the antiquated story about southern pride and the value of truth Pickford and Brown are well worth watching. Louise Beavers is also good as the maid. The court room scenes are solid with Pickford giving a terrific performance as the irony of the murder become clear. Her final scene walking from the court house and down the street is quite memorable in its beauty and simplicity.Yes Mary Pickford won an Oscar for this performance but the award is likely for the 20 years of films and superstardom she brought to this talkie debut. She was the biggest star in films for many many years and deserved the Oscar for this brave performance even if the film itself is not terribly good.".

As a museum piece it has rather more going for it. If nothing else it shows what even superstars of the Pickford calibre had to put up with in the earliest days of sound. Clearly everyone concerned was treating the new medium somewhat gingerly and Pickford cannot be blamed for playing it safe. She chose a property that had already proved itself on the stage with Helen Hayes in the leadand provided her with a fine opportunity to emote like mad and chew up scenery.And that proves its undoing. With a dated stage technique to draw upon Pickford's declamatory style comes over as something from the stone age. But it unquestionably would have been more impressive to 1929 audiences who were themselves grappling with the new technology. The film itself was a big hit and received its share of critical praise.The plot is ludicrous and does come over as a filmed stage play. Pickford is much too old for her role and most of the other characters are either caricatures or one dimensional. I particularly like one scene where the action is interrupted by two Charleston champions who stop by to demonstrate their latest steps oblivious to Pickford's hair tearing histrionics. And when Pickford rushes through the town to be near her dying beloved the laughter is hard to avoid.For all its obvious deficiencies Coquette has a certain historic importance and it gives an insight into what passed for drama or soap opera in 1929. Did Pickford deserve her Oscar? Probably. It's hard to tell this sort of grand gesturing was already on the wane but it still passed for great acting at the time. Coquette does not add to Mary Pickford's mystique but it doesn't detract from it either. If it's not exactly entertainment it's still of interest.".

Okay sound equipment may have been awful then  talkies were brand new in 1929  but that fact does nothing to make it less pretentious when the characters stretch their mouths to yawn proportions to utter dated lines like darling I love you more than life itself.Then there's the plot another feature of this film that is as quaint as the acting and the dialogue. Norma played legendary silent screen actress Mary Pickford at the end of her prolific career becomes compromised by a night with a boyfriend Michael. Michael vows to marry her but instead finds himself in an angry confrontation with Norma's father the doctor.Father takes a gun to avenge his violated daughter  who is played remember by a 37yearold woman. And poor Norma finding her lover on his deathbed pours forth a mindnumbing melodramatic declaration of her love that had to have been way over the top even in those days.But the most amazing part is the end where the doctor is on trial for murder. Norma takes the stand to accuse her lover of rape and thus save her father which she does admirably and with all the flourishes and eyebatting appropriate for the era. Suddenly the father's conscience is stirred and he rushes to the feet of his daughter  this in a court of law  and pleads with her to let him take the blame with honor. The doctor eyes the murder weapon a revolver sitting on a table before the judge and then stands before the court and demands that he pay his debt to the state. Imagine that!Father then rushes to the arms of daughter and begs her to hug daddy as she used to. What follows was surely even to audiences of the day an excessivelylong gruesomelysentimental embrace. To a modern viewer seeing it in the contemporary context it would clearly suggest incest though this was certainly not the meaning of the scene. That done father grabs gun and commits suicide in the courtroom. To the film's credit the event is conveyed well by the sound of a single gunshot  no blood.Pickford may have been the darling of silent film and she was undeniably a remarkable actress in that setting. But her talkie debut is flawed in every conceivable way from the bogus southern accents of her and others' characters to the comical arm gestures she makes to emphasize her schmaltzy lovetalk with Michael. You have to cut this film some slack not only for the year it was made but also because sound movies were then in their infancy. Still the story line and script are painfully exaggerated and the acting horribly stilted.But is it worth watching? I say yes. It's important cinema history. And it's fun.".

I happen to have got a tape taken from a good print so as to observe that some of the photography and lighting was somewhat decent but not too brilliant. Some of the acting takes a back seat but it is Miss Pickford's presence that saves what would be a forgettable film. This was a whole new concept. Mary Pickford speaks for the first time and her personna was altered by her trendy apparell and short shingled hairstyle. In my opinion she was worthy of the Academy Award. Not only was she one of greatest actresses of the century but she was very instrumental in the deveopment of the film industry. But still her talkies don't compare to her silent films.

	schema:headline " Don't dismiss Coquette plenty of others seemed to copy it";
	schema:reviewBody "In watching Croquette for the first time I had a handful of things to overcome. One was finally hearing Mary Pickford's voice  only to hear it as a lilting southern drawl. Of course the inherent sound and static staging problems of a very early talkie was another. The third was that the plot and performance seemed quite clichd. At least it did until it dawned on me that this was only because OTHERS came along LATER and followed intentionally or not Croquette's lead.Overall I found Croquette a solid film and Pickford's performance quite good although it took me a while to accept the accent. I also had to remind myself that although Bette Davis Jezebel 1938 Vivien Leigh GWTW 1939 and half a dozen others portrayed scheming southern belles in a very very similar manner it was Pickford's performance that set the tone for all future southern potboilers.Did Pickford deserve her Oscar? Well Davis and Leigh won them for drawling their way into and out of romantic jams in similar vehicles albeit Leigh in a much more elaborate one. I would put Pickford's performance at least on par with Davis'  and probably on par with Leigh's if one takes the newness of the sound medium into account.The only real weakness I found was William Janney's hammy portrayal of Pickford's little brother. It was Janney's first film role at age 21 and not a particularly auspicious debut. The rest of the cast was solid enough including a very young Johnny Mack Brown who had not yet found his cowboy persona. True Matt Moore was a bit flimsy as Stanley but his underplaying fit the wimpy role.Pickford was clearly the driving force and she drove well. I have no doubt she could have been a serious sound actress had her public been able to accept her in adult and inevitably as time went on middleaged roles. The lady could act.The film is at least a 6 by today's standards and probably an 8 when all of the conditions under which it was filmed are taken into account. I'll split the difference and call it a 7. While I will probably continue to envision Mary Pickford as the preteen or earlyteen ragamuffin of silent film days I am very glad to have a copy of her best talkie. Don't dismiss her Oscar either. Plenty of others during the next 20 years seemed to think her performance was worth emulating!".

Even before Broadway became the realm of vulgar and witless tourists New Yorkers supported real junk. Viz COQUETTE.

The funny thing was that because of the change in economic conditions which happened almost simultaneously with the change over to sound what flew with the uncritical Broadway audience in the 20s became so inconsequential that it was no longer an evening out.

The suitor played by Alabama AllAmerican football player Johnny Mack Brown we have to take on faith is disadvantaged in class to wit he doesn't own a suitable suit of evening clothes for the seasonal country club balls. Imagine if he'd been black?He pledges to overcome his disadvantages by taking an unspecified job 'in the mountains' where he'd make enough money to get married to her and buy a house. If you gotta ask how come these more liberally munificent jobs seems to exist outside the town 'in the mountains' this play ain't fer the likes of you all.COQUETTE is compromised on a visit to COQUETTE at a country club ball and earnestly wants to make this all right by marring her. Dad reacts to the joyful news by plugging him. COQUETTE in court tells a story in euphemisms which adds up to her being raped and her father acting under the unwritten law suh.

The disappointment with these early talkies would become screamingly clear a year later when picture after picture would fail. The stars would be replaced and the business reinvigorated by more sophisticated techniques and stories. In short it was a steep learning curve and COQUETTE is at the very beginning of the curve so is important as a historical document only. It is a filmed play complete with a phantom proscenium.

	schema:headline " This film reflects its period but still fascinates.";
	schema:reviewBody "Today any sound film made in 1929 will almost certainly be watched with considerable attention by all those interested in the history of the cinema. When it includes the performance by Mary Pickford which won her only Oscar award it should be an irresistible attraction. But this does not necessarily mean that it will provide an experience which can be directly compared with what most viewers would expect from any modern film. Most importantly in 1929 sound recording technology was still at a very primitive stage and in addition the technicians still had to learn how to use the equipment they had to create a sound recording that was even basically acceptable. Design engineers also had to do a great deal more work before this recording could be incorporated onto film as a sound track that could be reproduced electrooptically with reasonable quality. The large bulbous microphones of the period designed to be held and perhaps even caressed lovingly by a singer were not appropriate for the cast of a film and there were no fully acceptable alternatives. The cast would generally have had silent movie experience which had suddenly been rendered obsolete and would therefore have been feeling very lost. The Director had no experience to call upon in helping them overcome their problems. The better known the stars might have been the more serious this would be for them. Finally we need to remember that there are now very different expectations for movies themselves. Even if revivals of 50 year old films could be presented with all the sophistication modern equipment and technology allow they would still have a limited appeal to most members of a contemporary cinema audience the technological limitations reduce this dramatically. The filmscrip raises other problems. Apart from these technical considerations the film will seem alien to many people's expectations because as with so many very significant films from the silent era it has more in common with a mediaeval morality plan than most modern dramatic works  something most of us find difficult to adjust to today. Both emotions and acting are laid on thick with a trowel but the script will still be found to go back occasionally to underline the truths that it aims to depict in case these are not being fully appreciated by the audience. It is therefore pointless to either view or review a film such as Coquette with expectations based on the types of film normally thought to be acceptable today. Despite this I very strongly recommend those interested in the development of modern cinematographic entertainment to watch it for themselves when opportunity arises. As long as the above points are born in mind it will prove a fascinating experience. But one cannot afterwards review or comment on the film in the same way that one would do for a more modern release.What does a filmgoers gain by watching such a rather turgid melodrama today? Apart from a greater understanding of the history of the cinema one answer is a much better appreciation of the traumas associated with the transition from the silent film era to that of the talkies and another is greater respect for the achievements of early stars who are recognised today more by their names than by their performances. If these are of no interest modern viewers should not watch such films even when IMDb users give then a high rating. By today's standards Coquette would barely justify a five star rating but recognising that everyone involved cast director cameraman and the new and vital 'recording artist' who I could not even find credited were learning a new trade together the original film was certainly worth an eight. If you doubt this rewatch it and note how many of the sequences in films which were released during the following decade and are now regarded as classics were closely based on some of those in Coquette. Trying to fairly bridge this difference I am rating the viewability of Coquette today at 7 stars.".

When it includes the performance by Mary Pickford which won her only Oscar award it should be an irresistible attraction. But this does not necessarily mean that it will provide an experience which can be directly compared with what most viewers would expect from any modern film. Most importantly in 1929 sound recording technology was still at a very primitive stage and in addition the technicians still had to learn how to use the equipment they had to create a sound recording that was even basically acceptable. Design engineers also had to do a great deal more work before this recording could be incorporated onto film as a sound track that could be reproduced electrooptically with reasonable quality. The large bulbous microphones of the period designed to be held and perhaps even caressed lovingly by a singer were not appropriate for the cast of a film and there were no fully acceptable alternatives. The cast would generally have had silent movie experience which had suddenly been rendered obsolete and would therefore have been feeling very lost. The Director had no experience to call upon in helping them overcome their problems. The better known the stars might have been the more serious this would be for them. Finally we need to remember that there are now very different expectations for movies themselves. Even if revivals of 50 year old films could be presented with all the sophistication modern equipment and technology allow they would still have a limited appeal to most members of a contemporary cinema audience the technological limitations reduce this dramatically. The filmscrip raises other problems. Apart from these technical considerations the film will seem alien to many people's expectations because as with so many very significant films from the silent era it has more in common with a mediaeval morality plan than most modern dramatic works  something most of us find difficult to adjust to today. Both emotions and acting are laid on thick with a trowel but the script will still be found to go back occasionally to underline the truths that it aims to depict in case these are not being fully appreciated by the audience. It is therefore pointless to either view or review a film such as Coquette with expectations based on the types of film normally thought to be acceptable today. Despite this I very strongly recommend those interested in the development of modern cinematographic entertainment to watch it for themselves when opportunity arises. As long as the above points are born in mind it will prove a fascinating experience. But one cannot afterwards review or comment on the film in the same way that one would do for a more modern release.What does a filmgoers gain by watching such a rather turgid melodrama today? Apart from a greater understanding of the history of the cinema one answer is a much better appreciation of the traumas associated with the transition from the silent film era to that of the talkies and another is greater respect for the achievements of early stars who are recognised today more by their names than by their performances. If these are of no interest modern viewers should not watch such films even when IMDb users give then a high rating. By today's standards Coquette would barely justify a five star rating but recognising that everyone involved cast director cameraman and the new and vital 'recording artist' who I could not even find credited were learning a new trade together the original film was certainly worth an eight. If you doubt this rewatch it and note how many of the sequences in films which were released during the following decade and are now regarded as classics were closely based on some of those in Coquette. Trying to fairly bridge this difference I am rating the viewability of Coquette today at 7 stars.";

	schema:reviewBody "I actually had a previous review for this film that I just deleted and am replacing it with this new and updated one. That's because I first tried watching COQUETTE on videotape from MGM but the sound was so horrendously bad that it was practically unwatchable. It was just reshown on Turner Classic Movies and while the sound improved slightly it was still an awful chore watching and understanding the filmparticularly since they never bothered to Close Caption the movie. The big problem was that the movie came out in 1929 and sound systems for films were brand new and often were inadequate. In this film the sound varies according to who is speakingsome of the actors come across loud and clear and others such as Miss Pickford and the man who played her brother were a major chore to understand. You can't blame the actors for this but it seriously hampered my enjoyment of the film.Now as for the film itself I am shocked to see that this film has a huge number of scores of 10 on IMDb. Maybe this is because it was such an important film historically speaking. It was Mary Pickford's first sound film and she did win the Best Actress Oscar for it. Sadly by today's standards she was not particularly good to put it mildly. I also wonder if maybe giving her the Oscar was a way to pay tribute to her vast collection of earlier works. While I do love Mary in SUDS SPARROWS DADDY LONG LEGS MY BEST GIRL probably her best film and so many other silent films she just didn't seem to deserve an award for her overly melodramatic performance here. Overall her emotional range was HUGEtoo huge to be believable. Also at 37 years old she simply was too old to be believably playing a young and flirtatious woman.In fact overall this was a not particularly good film and seems horribly old fashioned and silly. So often lines were delivered as if this were an oldtime morality play being performed in front of a lot of hicks who loved and expected overacting. Much of the film seemed stagy and the film went on way too long. Also there were many story elements that seemed so contrived and stupid. The worst of these was at the end of the film when Pickford's father grabbed the gun which had been submitted into evidence for this courtroom scene. Inexplicably it was STILL loaded and they left it right where this accused murderer sat!! How ridiculous can you get?!?! Please do yourself a favor and try some other oldtime films first. I am a huge fan of both sound and silent films from Hollywood's Golden Age and there are too many deserving films you should see well before viewing COQUETTE. In fact any of Pickford's silents would be preferable to this wretched film.".

Mary Pickford does her share of overemoting but she also has a couple of brilliant scenes while grieving really letting go and showing she was ahead of her time as an actor. At 37 she also pulls off the look of a young flapper and is so cute with her short hair and standing 5'1. John St. Polis plays the part of her father well the Southern gentleman who must look out for the family's honor and who detests her love interest played by Johnny Mack Brown. The two of them also have some powerful scenes as emotions overheat. I also loved the snippets of dancing scenes we get to see they are so energetic and really convey what we think of about the 1920's. At the beginning of the film I was put off by its slow start and the spotty quality of the film after all these years particularly when it was hard to understand the dialogue. If you feel the same I would recommend sticking with it. It's flawed and not going to be your favorite film of all time or anything but it's worth spending the 75 minutes to watch Pickford and the rest of this cast.".

	schema:headline " The Priceless Vignette of Coquette";
	schema:reviewBody "I think it is profoundly tragic how very destructive and negative a lot of the reviews have been on this IMDb site about Coquette......A truly wonderful vignette and slice of life of American life in the late 20s.It is truly unfair to compare Coquette to the standards of 21st Century Cinema.  There is a lot that can be said for enjoying a film simply from a historical perspective.  There are so many many historical nuggets and vignettes which can be extracted from this film.  I am not speaking just from a cultural or societal level I am also speakingspecifically from a cinematic level.  We do have to appreciate as another reviewer pointed out where Hollywood was coming from when this film was produced.  And we have to give credit to the first brave souls who endeavored to participate in an early Talkie. These folks especially the actors many of whom spoke for the very first timewere indeed pioneers!We also have to acknowledge the fact that Mary Pickford won an academy award for her work here.  As much as some of the other reviewers said that she was AWFUL and should have stuck with Silents I think it speaks for itself that her peers gave this coveted award to her.  This probably also suggests that many moviegoers from the late 20s probably loved her and this picture even if THEY could see back then that it was not perfect.As difficult as it was for me to put myself in the shoes of a 1929 audience I think that I successfully managed to do this while I watched it.  I was born 30 years after this film came out so it was a task to put myself into the head of a man who had been raised on a steady diet of Silent Movies.It was so exciting watching Mary speak knowing that she had been a HUGE STAR for YEARS in Silents and finally the world was confronted with the total package of Mary Pickfordher movements her persona and her voice.  That in itself was probably enough to absolutely THRILL audiences who had loved her before she spoke.  It must have been truly fascinating to hear what their heroine's voice sounded like after all those years.A few general comments about the castJohn St. Polis who played her fatherWhat a terrific actor!  What a great voice!  He undoubtedly had been on stage and had learned his craft so very well.  I loved him in the court room scene when as the dignified noble father he took his lumps for his mistakes and was a part of that huge climactic surprise that took place in that room.  He died 17 years later at the age of 70.William Janney her brother JimmyNow I will give credit where credit is due.  He was terrible absolutely terrible for almost all of the movie.  He overacted in the most cartoonish nauseating manner.  Perhaps some of his later work was better.  He died 63 years later at the age of 84.Mary PickfordThough she began her performance weak and could be accused of overacting she got better and better as the film wore on.  By the time we reached the part where she embraced her lover in the woods and told him how much she missed him and loved him she was giving a command performance no question about it!  She was helped by some really great dialogue from the writers.  There were quite a few other scenes where her performance was just sterling!!  She died in the late 70s at the age of 87.I could go on and on with the cast.  I truly loved this film for what it was worth.  I thought the story and the twist ending was incredibly and wonderfully masterful!  I agree with another reviewer who said that the ending was just lovely and beautiful it shows Mary's character walking down the town square with roundshaped light bulbs from the buildings and stores slowly lighting up and glowing one by one by one.  The picture then fades to its conclusion with soothing peaceful music accompanying it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I think it is profoundly tragic how very destructive and negative a lot of the reviews have been on this IMDb site about Coquette......A truly wonderful vignette and slice of life of American life in the late 20s.It is truly unfair to compare Coquette to the standards of 21st Century Cinema.  There is a lot that can be said for enjoying a film simply from a historical perspective.  There are so many many historical nuggets and vignettes which can be extracted from this film.  I am not speaking just from a cultural or societal level I am also speakingspecifically from a cinematic level.  We do have to appreciate as another reviewer pointed out where Hollywood was coming from when this film was produced.  And we have to give credit to the first brave souls who endeavored to participate in an early Talkie. These folks especially the actors many of whom spoke for the very first timewere indeed pioneers!We also have to acknowledge the fact that Mary Pickford won an academy award for her work here.  As much as some of the other reviewers said that she was AWFUL and should have stuck with Silents I think it speaks for itself that her peers gave this coveted award to her.  This probably also suggests that many moviegoers from the late 20s probably loved her and this picture even if THEY could see back then that it was not perfect.As difficult as it was for me to put myself in the shoes of a 1929 audience I think that I successfully managed to do this while I watched it.

	schema:reviewBody "The earliest sound movies quickly became known as talkies as oppose to soundies as one might expect them to be called. It makes sense though because these pictures tended to have a lot more talking in them than did the sound films of a few years later. The reason is most of them were culled from stage plays where speech largely takes the place of action because this was seen as the most appropriate material for the new technology. And back then theatre was not the prestigious medium it is today. Just as there have been Bmovies and dime novels so too were there plenty of cheap and cheerful stage plays ripe for adaptation to the screen.Coquette comes from a play by the rarelyremembered theatre legend George Abbott along with Ann Preston Bridgers and is essentially a melodramabynumbers. All the familiar hackneyed elements are here  a flirtatious young woman a disapproving father a gun going off and so on. It is all a rather silly affair putting some rather large strains on credibility in its final act. And in its translation to the screen it has retained the structure of a theatrical play. On the stage you can't cut backandforth from one place to another so big chunks of plot will take place consecutively often in the same room. And this looks odd in a movie.Coquette is probably best remembered now as the movie for which mostly silent star Mary Pickford won her only Oscar for acting. The deservedness of this award has since been called into question. Her performance is an abundance of mannerisms but while certainly overt it never quite goes overthetop which is a fair feat given the plot requires her to go through every conceivable emotional state. She is actually at her best when saying nothing such as the odd little expression that crosses her face at the end of the court scene. The best turn however belongs to John St. Polis who gives a nice solid performance. Theatrical but solid. By contrast though the unbearable woodenness of John Mack Brown is like an acting black hole threatening to drag what little credibility the movie has left into oblivion and would have succeeded if someone hadn't had the good sense to pop a cap in his ass halfway through. Ironically Brown was to have the most lucrative postCoquette career of all the cast albeit largely in BWesterns.The director may seem like a strange choice. Sam Taylor was first a gag man and then a director at Hal Roach's comedy studios but lately he had got into drama. Staging in depth was always one of his fortes and he makes some neat little compositions which really give definition to the limited number of sets. For example when Brown first comes on the scene he has him in the background with Pickford on screen right and Matt Moore a little closer to the screen on the left creating a zigzag pattern. He also makes some attempt to bring a bit of cinematic dynamism to what is essentially a filmed play making sharp changes of angle at key moments such as St. Polis's walking in on Pickford and Brown but byandlarge the fact that nearly everything takes place in one room  or rather a frontless set  is inescapable.Perhaps we shouldn't be too hard on Coquette as its flaws are really only the flaws of its era. And in all honesty if you try not to take it too seriously it can be enjoyed on a certain level especially since it runs for a mere 75 minutes. But then again there were also plenty of pictures from this early talkie era  yes even as early as 1929  that managed to rise above their circumstances. And after a look at how much talent and imagination there really was in Hollywood at the time it's not difficult to see how Coquette could have been so much more.".

It was Mary Pickford's first talking picture and for which she won an Oscar probably weren't many nominees this being 1929. Let's just say that there have been many better acting performances since then.Have you ever seen a movie set in the 19th century which contains a live stage play for instance Showboat? That is what Coquette resembles with exaggerated overdone performances and the story confined to just a couple of indoor sets  there is only one outdoor shot in the film. The overacting in Coquette is a sight to behold led by Miss Pickford who chews the scenery in a hammy overwrought performance. Yes she is attractive but looks older than her boyfriends  which she was. Her main squeeze is the old buckaroo Johnny Mack Brown who does the best he can. Best acting honors such as they are go to John St. Polis who plays her father.It is a story of honor and customs in the Old South in the early 20th century and some elements of the plot are tough to swallow especially in 2011. The story is simple enough to follow but the consequences of situations which would be easily solvable today leave the viewer perplexed.But as I said it's a famous picture and it has historical significance so watch it if you get a chance and see what you think.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film won Mary Pickford the second Oscar for Best Actress ever awarded and was one of the more controversial decisions ever made by the Academy for that particular award. When Pickford made this film she was already 36 but was playing a girl who was approximately 20. However her tiny size and petite features prevented her from looking ridiculous. Pickford plays Norma Besant daughter of Dr. John Besant a southern belle of the flapper era known as a coquette  in modern terms a flirt. Her lack of affection for her numerous suitors does not prevent her from accepting their gifts and leading them on but her heart truly only belongs to Michael Jeffery a man from the hills. This is a polite term for what southern rural society in those days would call white trash. The two want to get married but Dr. Besant being a noble southern doctor of that era holds dear several nonnegotiable rules of behavior  defending one's honor seems to require lots of gun play never allow blacks in the house unless they're serving you dinner or cleaning your house and poor white people  such as Norma's suitor  should be neither seen nor heard. Thus when the young man performs the bold act of coming to his house to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage and mentions that they have been alone together the night before  though they were only talking about their future plans  Norma's father follows after Mike and shoots him down in cold blood.What follows is Pickford's best scene. When she hears Mike has been mortally wounded by her father she rushes to his bedside just in time to see him die. In shock she keeps trying to tend to him at first refusing to believe he is dead. Her brother one of her suitors and an old family friend convince her Mike is gone. Now they say she must concentrate on saving her father from the gallows. They tell her she must lie and say Mike forced himself on her and that her father was doing the noble thing. I guess lying was considered OK in the code of the old south if the victim is just a man from the hills. Norma understandably refuses saying that if her father hangs it is what he deserves.Months pass and the trial is in progress. Norma has forgiven her father and here unlike Mike's deathbed her attitude is just bizarre. She acts as though her father has done little more than take away her cell phone privileges  to put it in modern terms  rather than kill the only man she ever loved. She is now ready to go on the witness stand and lie about Mike's character  which by everyone else's account was noble and hard working  in order to free her extremely guilty father. However it does indeed tear up Norma's conscience to say untrue things about her deceased beau and she breaks down on the stand. At that moment her father has a moment of clarity goes to her and tells her he was wrong to do what he did and the two reconcile. He then grabs the gun that is lying as evidence on a nearby table and shoots himself declaring that he owes his life to the state for his actions. You have to admire her dad he is so even handed. He has no trouble taking the law into his own hands whether it is his life or someone else's life on the line.Pickford's performance viewed today appears merely mediocre compared those of other early talkie actresses. You have to remember though seeing America's Sweetheart talk for the first time was for the audiences of 1929 like seeing and hearing that TRex in Jurassic Park in 1993  it's easy to confuse a technological milestone with a great performance at least until the novelty wears off. What was interesting for me was to see the code of the South in its death throes. The attitudes of the upper class toward even the hardworking members of the poorer classes in the south were about to collapse when the Great Depression made poor people out of so many of the socalled nobility and put them all in the same crowded uncomfortable boat.".

In the following she and her family search for the unknown father.It's the unborn child who tells the story from the off and the whole movie is as crazy and absurd like this. Drawn in mighty impressive pictures the movie is as strange as the landscape it takes place in.Everything fits together perfectly the story the actors especially Chulpan Khamatova as Mamlakat and Moritz Bleibtreu as her brother Nasreddin and the special effects.Let the story and the pictures go directly to your brain like a colorful dream you are dreaming and can't get out. Don't block yourself with logic and socalled intelligence don't worry about crazy things that could never ever be and you will love this unique movie!";

Instead this was movie with peculiar amusing and imaginative twists and turns not to mention the odd sight gag.I saw A time for drunken horses about a week before this. Horses was about Kurds and set in Iran on the border with Iraq while Luna was set in breakaway republics of the old Soviet Union. There are lots of similarities between the movies deep poverty dealing with ignorant unkind small town people running a gauntlet of soldiers to do commerce and so on yet Luna is a great comedy and Horses very much a bleak drama. What you take away from both movies is that life is still very difficult and provincial in some parts of the world. Geographically too the films are set in locations that are not very far apart at least from the perspective of a North American!. Woman are treated in a crappy old world way in both places too.Moritz Bleibtreau as Nesreddin the brother is brilliant. Perhaps he is the reincarnation of Harpo Marx.If you're sick of Hollywood formula films and you want to have a good time I'd recommend this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie from the minute I saw the scene where a bull drops out of a local delivery plane  plummets to earth killing two main characters. YUP the bull did the job and then swam to shore unharmed! But I am too far ahead of myself... This movie has a wonderfully painterly quality that is brought about by the surrealistic cinematic effects that the director Bakhtiar Khudojnazarov brings with his use of bright colours and washes of Technicolor. The female lead Chulpan Khamatova is perfect as the seventeen years old aspiring actress who loves Shakespeare and wants to become a film star. She lives in a small village in Uzbekistan with her mentally damaged brother and her loving father. The girl meets an entrepreneur  plane pilot and has sex with him after he makes her believe that he is a friend of Tom Cruise. The next thing she knows she is pregnant desperate and on a quest to restore the family honor by finding the cowardly jerk who seduced her. Father and daughter Mamlakat supported by the decidedly different brother wonderfully played by Moritz BleibtrauManny in 'Run Lola Run' begin a wildly fantastic trip through the landscapes of Uzbekistan in which tradition and superstition clash with the chaos of a materialistic world. The wonderful script makes the film's sometimes slapstick and giddy narrative into something grander  a meditation on maternity as a form of inspired madness.One scene is great genius... The local delivery plane with a bull and a cow in the holding bay swoops sideways to get a closer look at Mamlakat's wedding taking place on a barge in the middle of the the lake and just as the plane swoops the bull falls out of the side door of the plane  plummets down to land SPLAT on the bride's new husbandtobe  her father killing them both dead and leaving her pregnant and a sinner. Chulpan Khamatova is perfect as Mamlakat the perplexed mother to be confronting miracles wonders joy death and the unexpected as she searches for her child's father.

	schema:reviewBody "Since I only understand a little Russian I had to guess what was going on. This movie was set in Tazikistan. The terrain was semidesert. There was grass mixed with desert and mountains. I wasn't sure whether it was in the 80s or the 90s in which the movie took place because in one scene the heroine is dancing in a pumpkin outfit and an official is there with a red star. In addition there were lots of troops around especially tank drivers. That led me to believe it was set in the 80s and the troops were Russian soldiers on the way to Afghanistan. It is also possible that this is set in 1999 and the soldiers are involved in inter factional postSoviet fighting. In either case it is a wild place where life is very cheap. People are always shooting at each other kidnapping people and getting into petty disputes. It is obvious that this is a Muslim region. It is a very rough and wild place. This young women gets raped while walking in the woods near her village. The man is an actor who flies around with his troupe from village to village and seduces women along the way. The young woman gets pregnant. It is a horribly embarrassing and difficult situation for her proud and caring Father. He is mad at first. Her brother though is immediately supportive. He is demented and the villagers seem to tolerate his eccentricity of running around the village with bottles attached to his neck like he is an airplane destroying property along the way. What villagers don't tolerate is a woman who has been raped. They believe that it is her fault and that she is a bad person. It is a big stigma. Her Father decides to find the culprit. He goes from village to village looking for him. Since his daughter revealed that it was an actor the Father goes to local theater productions and accosts any male in the cast. In the meantime his Daughter falls in love with a doctor who rides along on an ambulance. The doctor pretends to be his lover and they are to be married. However a cow falls from the sky and kills both her Father and her lover during the wedding. I guess the filmmaker is mixing reality with surreality to empathize the craziness of living in Central Asia. The movie was pretty good. I spent a bit of the time trying to figure where it was set. The village was on a rather large lake or a small sea. It appeared to be salinated water. That's why I thought it was the Aral Sea. However during the credits I saw that it was filmed in Tadzikistan. The only sizable lake is near Tashkent and only that area is not completely mountainous. The area in the film was somewhat mountainous but more steppeland and desert.".

The young woman gets pregnant. It is a horribly embarrassing and difficult situation for her proud and caring Father. He is mad at first. Her brother though is immediately supportive. He is demented and the villagers seem to tolerate his eccentricity of running around the village with bottles attached to his neck like he is an airplane destroying property along the way. What villagers don't tolerate is a woman who has been raped. They believe that it is her fault and that she is a bad person. It is a big stigma. Her Father decides to find the culprit. He goes from village to village looking for him. Since his daughter revealed that it was an actor the Father goes to local theater productions and accosts any male in the cast. In the meantime his Daughter falls in love with a doctor who rides along on an ambulance. The doctor pretends to be his lover and they are to be married. However a cow falls from the sky and kills both her Father and her lover during the wedding. I guess the filmmaker is mixing reality with surreality to empathize the craziness of living in Central Asia. The movie was pretty good. I spent a bit of the time trying to figure where it was set. The village was on a rather large lake or a small sea. It appeared to be salinated water. That's why I thought it was the Aral Sea. However during the credits I saw that it was filmed in Tadzikistan. The only sizable lake is near Tashkent and only that area is not completely mountainous. The area in the film was somewhat mountainous but more steppeland and desert.";

Adding considerable stress to her plight is the fact that her gruffbutlovable father is widowed and finding it increasingly difficult to support her older brother a former soldier who suffered permanent brain damage in battle and is now the town idiot.When the girl reveals her condition to her father he's determined to find the responsible party and there's considerable mirth as the family of three tours south central Russia in an attempt to locate the actor by attending plays and having Mamlakat try to identify the voice. The film has a lot of beautiful landscapes reminiscent of those in THE ENGLISH PATIENT the production values are excellent the pacing never drags there are many laughs and the three leads are extremely wellcast. The idiot brother BTW is played by Moritz Bleibtreu the dim bulb boyfriend in RUN LOLA RUN. He's excellent  a bit like Harpo Marx with a limited vocabulary  but MAN ... he'd better start playing some swifter characters SOON if he wants to avoid typecasting!My main cavil For a film from this exotic a locale it's just a tad too WESTERN in its sensibilities and techniques. Director Bakhtiyar Khudojnazarov has obviously been a keen student of western popular entertainment. LUNA PAPA is like seeing proven Hollywood crowdpleasing conventions effectively transplanted to a completely different culture and I'm not sure that this is necessarily a good thing. There's no questioning that the movie's far more accessible to western audiences as a result though.The film didn't have an American distributor at the time of its Toronto screening but that should definitely change come Oscar time. This is EXACTLY the kind of goodnatured sentimental nongroundbreaking noncontroversial Hollywoodreverential movie think KOLYA that AMPAS loves to reward in the foreign language category.

Tautou has great presence and luminosity no question and equally obvious is that she has the makings of another Audrey Hepburn. But this isn't it. Someone has obviously seen the grosses on Breakfast At Tiffany's and figured okay let's do another adorable kook in Manhattan let's have another writer manque become enamored of her and write about her successfully. Okay it may be dated by now but Breakfast at Tiffs had STYLE. How else could they get away with making Hepburn WORSE than a hooker a hooker who took money from guys on the tacit understanding that she would come across later and then powder via the powder room. True they were more up front with the George Peppard character he WAS a gigolo any way you sliced it but they could get away with contriving a WHOLESOME romance between two slightly sleazy people because of the Style with which it was done. It was a pity there was no believably chemistry between Hepburn and Peppard but given that Peppard was a graduate of the Forestry Commission School of Acting that was always going to be a problem and given that Hepburn actually married a pygmy Redwood in the shape of Mel Ferrer she couldn't complain. In this one Tautou is cast as the adorable kook French style come to Manhattan to make it as an actress. She is reduced however not only to cleaning toilets but also sleeping and peeing outside the house of Justin Therouze who he? a wouldbe leading man clearly destined to go the same way as Nathalie Nattier. There would be more sexual chemistry between Golda Meir and Yasser Arafat than these two mismatched lovers. See it if you like Tautou the camera loves her but that's the best you can say for it. 310".

It also has very little to do with the tango and we might want to add it has little to do with Paris. Someone once told me this movie is about an American businessman. Out of curiosity are all American's traveling in Europe businessmen? I think not. First of all he was a boxer a bongo player he married a wealthy woman but nowhere did I see this man as working for some corporation. This man had little money and he didn't need a 'serious' career.This film is about abuse a parable about the overly masculine father who sexually abuses his own son a child abused by his alcoholic parents a widower who is abused by his animalistic but deadly honest wife. This movie is about a religious zealot for a motherinlaw in constant denial who shows more interest in her daughter's corpse than in her life. This movie is about an idealistic nolonger teenager who perhaps finds true love the only time in her life but pays a terrible price. It is as though she has bitten from the forbidden fruit and found that love is an illusion.To say Brando is superb misses the point. I simply know no other actor that could have pulled this off. His facial expressions are uncanny. It is a most fitting bookend to Street Car Named Desire. One simply cannot deny the final elevator scene. But unlike Streetcar Brando portrays a vivid understanding of the sensitivity towards women and towards human existence that few men are capable of grasping and few women could probably appreciate. Brando is himself. But Brando is himself because he understands his character not because he plays himself.This movie is an existential parody of the nature of society. It is a bitter reflection of human frailty and vanity. It is a tragedy of a man who has actually found a way to transcend his own suffering who has somehow managed to cut through the illusions that all of us carry daytoday. But with that knowledge he finds himself utterly alone as so many users here seem testament.".

	schema:reviewBody "Widely denounced as obscene upon its release and unjustifiably notorious for two of its scenes Bernardo Bertolucci's 'Last Tango in Paris' is a savage story of lust and sexual debasement. Marlon Brando delivers a ferocious performance as Paul a middleaged American expatriate tormented by his wife Rosa's recent suicide her infidelities and his failure to understand their relationship. In meeting a 20 year old girl Jeanne played by Maria Schneider in an empty apartment Paul hopes to form a relationship purely on his own terms and at his own pace i.e. one he can understand fully. He insists on a new form of relationship so basic that even their names were kept secret from each other where she submitted to his every desire where he could punish himself and relieve his despair and anger towards his wife by punishing Jeanne. Paul's only other interest is in Marcel Massimo Girotti Rosa's lover for whom he has a curious respect and maybe a desire to obtain through him a better understanding of his own wife. Despite his overpowering talent Marlon Brando has often shown poor judgement in his choice of projects and has frequently trudged through films with no apparent effort or interest. In 'Last Tango in Paris' he gives everything and produces a performance of unrivalled force. Unfortunately the obvious improvisation in the film prevents the character of Paul from staying within check as he gradually becomes too much like Marlon Brando in the second half of the film. Nonetheless when Brando is offscreen the film becomes hollow in comparison and is replaced by Jeanne's relationship with her fiance an annoyingly pretentious TV director JeanPierre Leaud. This is a truly unique film and Bertolucci successfully highlights the romance in an affair that is fundamentally destructive. Brando's performance is remarkably powerful and intense eclipsing every other player and dominating the entire film.".

This is a man tormented by inner conflict...

Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken no promises of future liaisons no ties of any kind with the outside... The two lovers know nothing of each other not even their names... Their affair is purely physical and the barren apartment becomes as Bertolucci intended a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a childwoman... She asks what she should call Paul and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question but is constantly framing her for his next experiment besides he assaults her humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists 'It's over!' The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique somber shadowy and painterly... It presents despair and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic intensely realistic immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful dangerous and daring not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy but doesn't always provide it... 'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities Bertolucci camera's movements throughout the film characterize the rights steps of the tango which the two main characters execute at the climax of the film... We feel swept away by the beauty of the tango despite the tragic quality of the acts and events it escorts... The film does prove Bertolucci to be a true filmmaker capable of the audacity of JeanLuc Godard and the distinctive style of Ingmar Bergman...".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm thinking of Last Tango in Paris today because Neznaia a kind IMDb user asked me to write about it and I promised I would. Now a dilemma. Shall I write as I remember the experience or shall I watch it again? Well I'm already here so I seem to have taken a decision. Butter that was the key word that pushed crowds to line up outside the theaters all over the world. Over the years the film has been vilified as utter euro trash or acclaimed as one of the best films ever made. I think that the truth falls somewhere in the middle. Bertolucci was coming out of at least two certified masterpieces of political social and cinematic achievement Before the Revolution and The Conformist. Tango is something else altogether cinema verit photographed by Vittorio Storaro a revolutionary artistic genius Gato Barbieri's music and Marlon Brando giving himself totally in one of the most brilliant pieces of self indulgence ever put on film. Within the intellectual coldness of its intentions breaths a stunning melodrama of operatic proportions. As a side note let me tell you that legend has it that in the original script the Maria Schnaider's character was a boy. At the time an idea of the sort was too outrageous to even consider. Everybody was very sophisticated but not that sophisticated. Apparently the movie went on with a girl in the part but not even a coma was changed from the original. Now look at the film again with that in mind and you will notice that everything as if by magic makes perfect sense. We are ask to justify Brando's first wild approach to Schnaider was an irrational reaction to the pain the anger and confusion by his wife death. Well yes but he is a man she is a woman they may be braking a few rules but the basics remain intact unless of course she wasn't a she. If they are a man and a girl above the age of consent why the charade of secrecy? Why she's never really dressed like a girl always jackets and open neck shirts and why they never make love like a man and a woman usually do? A lot of fingers and butter andtalk. When they get to the tango scene Brando dances with a real woman while Maria Schnaider monkeys around them. And finally look at the end and tell me if doesn't make much more sense if she was a he. She could have explained everything embarrassing perhaps I don't know but perfectly normal. If she was a he the son of a military man the thing had an entirely different color. Impossible to admit or to explain for a boy. Their affair is not between two gay man but between two heterosexuals. That's the key that's at the center of it all. A breaking of rules in the most intimate way. To go against what you have come to accept as your own nature. I may be wrong of course but I don't think so. I will see it again as soon as I can and if I feel that this memory of the film is merely a product of what I may have been smoking at the time I will let you know. But somehow I don't think I will have to.".

	schema:headline " Last Tango in Paris will return to you any thought you put into it...A masterpiece!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris is like any other piece of art You get out of it only as much as you put into it. Many people saw this movie in the 1970's and still see it today as being pornography and nothing else. Others viewed it and took note of Brando's performance how could you not?!? and noticed much much more than a mere skin flick. Personally I find it to be a very important piece of art. Why? Because it broke barriers! In art barriers only exist so that they may be broken and I know that sounds like some liberal artsy BS but I think it's true. Artists are always trying to get down to the basics of human existence and unfortunately it's not always pretty. This film I believe portrays a few elements of the human experience. Passion is the first. Then facades our need to defend ourselves from vulnerability. Also the film tries to show the circular nature of our lives things end only to begin again. The passion is expertly exposed through the savage brutality that Brando brings to the performance as only he knew how to. Many argue that this was Brando's finest performance and I can see why. I don't know if I could ever pick one performance of his and say it was his best but this would easily easily be a prime candidate. In Last Tango in Paris Marlon Brando pulls out all of the stops almost abusing his freedom in the role. Yet this is where the film gets truly intriguing. Is this an act? It is at least in name a performance but how much of it is a performance and how much is a stream of consciousness therapy session? I have never seen an actor pour so much of himself out before a camera. Watching it I couldn't help but wonder What must be going on behind his eyes? How can a man reveal so much of who he is knowing that it is being filmed to be viewed by millions? Brando's performance forces the audience to question is Marlon Brando the performer or the performance. We'll never know. Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps that is how he could pull off the monumental performance that he did. It is quite possibly the greatest performance I have ever seen. The fact that I have to wonder whether his character Paul is the truth or an image is only testament to Brando's power. As far as the circular nature of things we see a rolereversal between Maria Schneider and Marlon Brando. At the beginning it is Brando who is confused lost driven mad by the toll that a past love has taken on him. Yet at the end of the film it is Schneider's Jeanne who cares not about names identity and personal histories. Her life is committed to distance and emotional isolation. Her mind has confined itself to that little apartment where intimacy knew no bounds except the publicity of a painful outside world. A million questions could be asked about these two central characters. What was going on in their minds? Who was more fragile the tormented Paul or the seemingly carefree Jeanne? Who controlled the relationship? Was there control? Was there a relationship? This film like all other great films leaves us asking questions not only about the characters we've seen but about the characters we portray on a daily basis.".

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Bertolucci's requiem for unrequited Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris simultaneously mocks and mourns the human yearning for love and companionship. The movie is a requiem for unrequited love and a testament to the proclivity of humans to surrogate love with lust when trapped in a maelstrom of despondence chagrin and compunction. Bertolucci's purpose is not to glorify carnality as a virtue or to scorn it as a vice but is to use it as an instrument to authenticate the veritable existence of a dark ugly and bestial side of humanity which is so often suppressed and hypocritically denied in similar works on the subject. Bertolucci's penchant for art is limitless and he uses it to full effect in order to give the movie an aesthetic feel while simultaneously catering to the movie's explorative earthy and unconventionally bold motifs. Bertolucci uses his characters uncannily as a medium to foray into unexplored realms of human psyche while unflinchingly projecting them as objects of desire disgust and depravity. Bertolucci pushes Brando and Schneider to a limit where they are not only forced to compromise their egos but also relinquish their pride and I say that not as an offence but as an appreciation for his talent as a moviemaker. Renowned film critic Pauline Kael bestowed the film with the most ecstatic endorsement of her career writing Tango has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies. American director Robert Altman expressed unqualified praise I walked out of the screening and said to myself 'How dare I make another film?' My personal and artistic life will never be the same. Eminent critic Roger Ebert has added the film to his Great Movies collection.The movie presents an episode in the lives of two loners residing in Paris Paul a recently widowed middleaged American businessman and Jeanne a young voluptuous soontobemarried Parisian girl. The two accidentally meet up in an empty apartment available for rent and a steamy affair ensues between the two on strictly anonymous basis. Paul is very discreet about his identity and whereabouts and even cajoles Jeanne to religiously follow the protocol. Paul sees Jeanne as a carnal surrogate for his deceased wife while Jeanne finds in Paul a lover which her fianc could never become. The two continue to meet and serve each other at regular intervals while also going about their regular business. Their sexually charged up affair despite a disconnect at the emotional level satiates them both beyond expectations and resonates to the viewer an ineffable sense of frenzy and euphoria that holds him in a vicelike grip for the entire length of the movie. The dramatically botched anticlimactic ending of the movie which has been snubbed by critics still manages to testify the axiomatic consistency of change in packing a punch stronger than the modernday gimmicks. Marlon Brando gives an inciteful poignant tour de force performance as the reclusive widower. Many people called Brando a chameleon but I would call him a chameleon who hated his camouflage a prodigy who detested his talent a narcissist who abhorred himself for being a mortal. Brando as Paul is a cross between a sadist and a masochist. He uses every ounce of his talent to conjure up his menacing alterego. Driven by guilt and chagrin Paul's sociopathic self is a nightmare for those around him. Roger Ebert wrote about Brando's performance It's a movie that exists so resolutely on the level of emotion indeed that possibly only Marlon Brando of all living actors could have played its lead. Who else can act so brutally and imply such vulnerability and need? The scene in which Paul confronts the dead body of his wife who has committed suicide is probably the most powerful scene ever filmed in cinema. It not only depicts the complexities associated with Paul's character but also highlights the dichotomy he suffered owing to his dual emotions of rage and grief. Maria Schneider is innocent charming voluptuous and pitiful in her portrayal of Jeanne a Parisian girl whose life is devoid of true love. Schneider being fully aware of her limitations as an actor incredibly manages to give a performance that is singular and effective enough not to be adumbrated by Brando's sublime overthetop portrayal. The cinematography of the movie is vivid elaborative and expressive and is well complemented by the movie's sensuously evocative background score. PS. Last Tango in Paris is a profoundly disturbing casestudy of human emotions and is a must for cineastes worldwide but can only be savoured by eschewing bigotry prejudice and conservatism. 910httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

I can watch it again and again and it will remain as powerful as it was when I had watched it for the first time. To me it is more that a movie. I saw it for the first time some 10 years ago as a teenager and I remember being mesmerized by the special mood that pervaded the whole movie. And those images. Grey Paris city of loneliness the lonely figure of Brando the girl in a ridiculous hat. Then the sex in the empty apartment devoid of all signs of normality a strange relationship between two strangers who have sex and still remain as separate and alienated as two people can be. She young  curious full of life going to be married. Him old disillusioned in the end of his lifejourney tormented by the pain of the loss of his wife who had brutally left him committing a suicide without explanation without a note. And so they meet in this naked apartment engage in the sex devoid of any tenderness him dominating her setting the rules for the game where there is no names no reality. And during those moments he escapes from the world around him from the suicide of his wife from the pain of the existence. She is strangely attracted to him captivated by his power lets herself be part of this game. She lets him do whatever he likes with her but she knows she is free she can leave this empty apartment at any moment.And she does. She is young and returns back to the normal life with her young fianc. The last scenes of the dance and the chase are so powerful. The old man making a mickey of himself in front of the dancing crowd playfully chasing the young girl who is visibly scared up into that empty apartment where everything had started. That last scene of him dying on the balcony like a stray dog is still haunting me. There is so much of the existentialist despair in the movie and the final release of that despair is so crude and powerful and beautiful in its bareness.Altogether it is a piece of art so close to the existentialist writers and painters of the 20th century. It is about human condition about the hell of existence about no escape. and at the same time it is so full of emotions of sadness and fear of pain and it is so beautiful.".

That's exactly how Bertolucci's helping of sexual cravings had me feeling after this film.Habitually Bertolucci's work eclipses genius  he is one of the few directors in world cinema that has an eye for definitive detail. He can capture such beautiful images with such great vision emotion colour and panache that the viewer's sentiments are guided like few others in filmmaking. Like aforementioned Schneider's face would be the perfect simile for this particular film. One scene the viewer is startled by the raw depth of the film although slightly troubled by the explicit sex but then all the viewer is treated to in the next scene is a terse and awkward moment which seems to have no correlation with the one that preceded it.Naturally Brando's performance did help boost this film greatly but that seems the film's very weakness  whenever he is offcamera it seems to struggle too much it loses its power and prestige and becomes a little incoherent. This film undoubtedly has some powerful and poignant scenes that really can convey genuine sentiment and exude a tangible originality too but it never really seems to shake off the loss of Brando's presence altogether.For admirers of Bertolucci its a must but for more neutral cineastes it would be advisable to have a more cautious approach when watching this film  to enjoy it it would be paramount to expect this film to be an edifying not an entertaining experience its not a frivolous subject matter in any sense".

	schema:headline " Brando is Great";
	schema:reviewBody "The acting of Marlon Brando is one of the major reasons to watch this feature film.  Brando for the first time in his career exhibits a physical performance that matches the emotional intensity of his earlier films.  Paul like the lead male characters in A Streetcar Named Desire1951 and On the Waterfront1954 is someone who behaves in an animalistic fashion.  1972 saw Marlon Brando in a banner year with his performances in The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris.  It was the last great performance of Marlon Brando as he hasn't done anything goodexcept Apocalypse Now as this.The actor shows plenty of emotion and human depth in his role.  Some of the scenes with Maria Schneider are some of the most difficult things done by the actor.  The scene where Paul lets out his anger and frustration out on his dead wife is a prime example of why Marlon Brando is a great actor. This sequence reveals some about the character of paul.  Marlon does a convincing job during the erotic scenes.The direction by Bernardo Bertolucci is fantastic.  It seems that being an Assistent Director for Pier Paolo Pasolini had paid off in the making of Ultimo Tango a ParigiLast Tango in Paris1972.  There are Pasolinian moments that are evident in many parts of the movie.  Bertolucci spends more time creating a three dimensional chracter in Paul then he did on Jeanne. The erotic sequences are done by the director with finesse and style.There is a contrast between PaulLast Tango In Paris and VittoThe Godfather.  First Vitto is calm and cool while Paul is emotionally unstable.  Second Paul is sexually active while Vitto is sexually inactive. Third Vitto concerns himself with the family structure and Paul is an individual.  Finally Paul is middle aged and somewhat in shape and Vitto is old and nearing death.On the day of its release Last Tango in Paris Stirred up an enormous uproar.  This had nothing to do with the sex scenes itself but the content that propelled these scenes.  It was banned in the director's native soil. One scene that caused a stir is the scene where Jeanne puts her hand in Paul's backside. Another scene that upset people is the infamous Butteromy Sequence.Maria Schneider gives a couragous and emotionally difficult performance as Jeanne.  This film had a negative effect on the actress as she later had a breakdown and spent some time in an asylum.  In one interview Maria Schneider discussed her displeasure with the director.  She does a wonderful job in the scene where she describes her relationship with a cousin as a young girl.  She does things that many well known actresses would be afraid to do.The emotional level of the sex scenes are what caused such a scandal.  The sex is not out of love but out of despair and the yearning for human contact.  The Butteromy scene takes that notion to the extreme.  What makes the sex scandalous is the fact that Paul and Jeanne treat it in a matter of fact way.  It seems that Paul is Jeanne's sex toy as that's the way she views him.Romance director Catherine Breillit has an appearence in Last Tango in Paris1972.  The supporting cast are good in their perspective roles. JeanPierre Leaud is terrific in his portrayal of Jeanne's clueless beau. He would appear in another erotic themed feature called The Mother  the Whore1973.  Jean Pierre Leaud's character is the exact opposite of Paul.Ultimo Tango a Parigi opens with images of a Francis Bacon painting.  The characters are nothing but live paint figures of a Francis Bacon masterwork. The director was influenced by the works of the painter when he decided to do the film.  The scene where Brando is crouched in a corner is a live reactment of one painting during the opening credits.  Bacon's paintings like the feature look deep within the pits of the human soul.Agnes Varda wrote some additional dialogue for this motion picture.  Last Tango in Paris comes between two classics in The Conformist1970 and 19001976.  It is avilable in both a R and NC17 version.  The ending is ironic and tragic because Paul is on the verge of turning over a new leaf. The cinematography by Vittorio Storaro makes the camera another member of the cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pauline Kael once famously described Last Tango as the most emotionally gratifying film she had ever seen in her 20 years as a film critic. I have not been a film critic for 20 years I'm not even 19 the age Maria Schneider was when she played Jeanne. I have not seen more films than there are stars in the sky. But I can agree that this is a film that is groundbreaking in the ways most people don't expect it so nakedly lays open the life of a broken man in all his flaws and his pain and selfloathing. The genius is that we'll never know if it was Marlon Brando exposing his own vulnerability or the greatest trick Houdini never pulled.The plot is so simple it borders on preposterous haunted American widower Paul meets young Parisian Jeanne by chance and together they rent an apartment where they engage in anonymous sex. Those who only know the film by this brief synopsis or its notorious reputation might believe the controversy and fail to look past it. Last Tango is not about sex and it's certainly not about butter. The sex scenes were not merely slapped on to make more money at the box office for they show simultaneously Paul's release his grief his hunger his rage his last desperate attempt to reach out to another person. Marlon Brando inhabits this so greatly and personally it's impossible to imagine anyone else in this role with the same feeling of release. From the first frame you see Brando it's so unbearably evident that his face scarred with age tells a thousand stories of loneliness. Ironically it's only through sex with a perfect stranger that he's able to find himself again.That's essentially what this story is about loneliness identity or loss of it and in a strange way love. More than any director I was reminded of Nicholas Ray whose own violently poignant film In a Lonely Place bears some resemblance both films center on a middleaged man whose troubled existence is briefly calmed when he falls in love and ultimately ends in doom. Like Ray Bertolucci frames his film meticulously with shots though mirrors windows and doorways to convey a sense of loss and emptiness in the large and cheerless apartment something of a haven from the outside world and the people who inhabit it. Only inside is where Paul and Jeanne can begin to comprehend the lonely places of their hearts.So much praise has been lavished on Brando it seems unfair to exclude Maria Schneider whose life was haunted after doing this movie. She's a child aware of her body and her affect on men but unable to understand why she is in this situation and how she got herself there and Schneider plays this with such a devastating honesty. But in the end the film the audience and Bertolucci are all more interested in Paul than Jeanne and for good reasons. Brando gives such ferocity with the simplest of gestures. Usually one can pick the most emotional scene of the film and mark it as the high point proof of an actor's genius. I suppose that that one scene is when Paul visits the corpse of his deceased wife. First he rages at her then he breaks down. Though a great scene every single moment that Brando is on film is a great scene. At once he's insane I mean that in the best way possible he's humorous he's angry he's sad he's broken. Paul goes through nearly every single emotion possible and Brando somehow makes it seem like he was experiencing it himself. Brando told Bertolucci after filming had ended that he put so much of himself into the role that he couldn't imagine doing something as harrowing ever again.He never did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Last Tango in Paris stars Maria Schneider Marlon Brando and JeanPierre Laud and is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. It tells the story of a man who develops an anonymous relationship with a young Parisian woman in an apartment they both wanted to buy. They are both dealing with their own individual issues but when they come together new problems and solutions begin to form also. I absolutely adore this movie. When I first heard of this film I was unsure as to what I was going to get I knew Marlon Brando was in it so I was sure to get good acting but I was not sure about anything else. I had not seen Bernardo Bertolucci's or Agns Varda's other work so I was unsure whether I would like their type of directing. I soon realised how much this film had to offer and how well it was made It did have one moment of discomfort for me as an audience member but other than that it is a really good comprehensive and romantic film. I normally do not enjoy romance films but this really changed my mind about that not only are the characters fleshed out enough to be relatable and likable but I actually cared about them even though I knew very little about them. There are moments where we get an insight into their own lives and we see the deeper story of each of them and how their intimate moments in the apartment are what they need the most in their lives and how important it is for them. We see how Paul Marlon Brando is distant for most of the film but slowly becomes closer to Jeanne Maria Schneider and opens up to her about his past later on even though he remembers nothing positive whilst Jeanne pushes him and wants him to recognise her as a person and become more known to each other from the very beginning but Paul does not want this because he believes everything apart from their relationship is complete and utter bullshit and as soon as they get to know each other the anonymity as well as the pure affection they have for each other will disappear. Paul is damaged and he is always melancholy until he meets Jeanne. He always seems troubled by something which we soon find out in the film. We feel a semiaggressive undertone within Paul because of his actions towards Jeanne whist also seeing an incredibly vulnerable human being with a lot on his mind. This film is filled with emotional honesty it is open and genuine It felt real and bare and the acting was just so perfected. You could feel the characters' pain and anger about their past as well as Jeanne's specific ignorance to the whole situation and Paul's hard exterior but soft heart. You can see Paul's pain and his emotional nudity in this specific scene where he is confronting someone he loved deeply even though he had a lot of issues with them also and this scene alone is why I feel he should have win an Oscar for this role. It is so subtle and well acted It felt honest and truthful It looked difficult for Brando because of how emotional it is.There are a lot of moments where I feel these two characters are just isolated from everyone else and feel detached from the normally accessible society they live within emotionally and even physically similar to Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver where in this case it is due to their unique perspective on others and themselves. Paul is not an ordinary person you meet everyday but more like someone who you can tell is going through a lot and you can just see by his body language that he is contemplating his life and how he wants to move on with it or if he even wants to move forward. In this case it seems the relationship he has with Jeanne is mostly for the sole purpose to stay in the common idea of having a significant other as roaming the city on your own can lead to seriously damaging thoughts. Paul seems to be unstable emotionally as he cannot seem to communicate with Jeanne effectively but rather physically communicates with her quite harshly sometimes but other times in a respectful and considerate manner.This movie is beautiful visually It gives you time to really become a part of the films world and recognise the atmosphere whilst getting to know these characters that become and express the emotions that we feel almost every day almost to a subtle extremity a simple fluidity to their existence and it works very well. I love the music in this movie I find it fits the story very well the characters are interesting and you care about who they are and their past because it is kept from us for a while in the film and you also get to really embrace the relationship Jeanne and Paul have in this movie. I love the directing of this movie I think it flows very well the scenes are captured well and it blends very well with the lighting and the tone fits perfectly also The characters stay on track even though that means they make mistakes or make choices they should not have made.There are beautiful interactions between Jeanne and Paul that I loved watching and that's why the ending really pains me because I know it is how it should end but it is no how I wanted it to end. It's one of my favourite films.".

It is a movie of passionate imagination coming true. I have to say that I can't believe people see the sexscenes in this movie just like any other sex scenes. They're not scenes to make people watch the movie and just wait for the part in which Brando and Schneider have sex. It is amazing sex. It is passion. Strange and exotic fruit. Makes you speechless and addicted. But yet it is bittersweet... Watch the movie it is a genuine a work of art a masterpiece of European cinematography and I also have to point out the music from the movie is brilliant jazz tango... sabor suave y delicioso ".

It is a movie of passionate imagination coming true. I have to say that I can't believe people see the sexscenes in this movie just like any other sex scenes. They're not scenes to make people watch the movie and just wait for the part in which Brando and Schneider have sex. It is amazing sex. It is passion. Strange and exotic fruit. Makes you speechless and addicted. But yet it is bittersweet... Watch the movie it is a genuine a work of art a masterpiece of European cinematography and I also have to point out the music from the movie is brilliant jazz tango... sabor suave y delicioso ";

For a B movie it would have been great nevertheless.Finally after reading up a few things about it the film turns out so popular because it was labeled as artsy porn. This tango is far from that. It even contains those cute and unnatural cuts so you don't get to see too much skin nipples whatever. I am sure there is more than enough for the deranged American fundamentalist to call it smut but for the rest of the world it's just a tame movie about a sexbased relationship. Having stated that here comes the paradox this is probably Brando's best character. Even better than col. Kurtz or don Vito Corleone. He is living each and every scene. Sure most of the dialog is made by him and even some of the stories told by Paul. And although Maria Schneider doesn't get to display anything more than her body Leaud is very good even with the lousy Bertolucci's weak directing.What's so special about the Tango? I've seen quite a few bad movies with great actors doing their best. The key is the light. The light makes the whole movie stand. It's what tricked people into assuming that is a good movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers. Naw it was spoiled long before I wrote this. Bernardo Bertolucci is truly a cinematic genius. To have written and directed this masterpiece is extraordinary  extraordinary crap. The genius is that he conned the artistic elite with it.The dialog was anything but realistic the plot  what plot the acting was on par with an elementary school production the cinematography would have been better using a handheld camcorder for sure the sound quality would have been better the musical score was actually a Bertolucci mixtape and was unrelated to the mood or setting of the scenes.Brando. What can I say about Brando? Trite emotionally flat two dimensional and inconsistent all come to mind. I have yet to see Brando deliver anything near an awardwinning performance he is alleged to have within him. Brando has an incredible range of emotion from angry to not so angry. Moody is not applicable as it would imply that he has more than one and is capable of changing it.Brandon having done his own sex scenes demonstrated that he was still a virgin. I've seen more realistic sex scenes in legitimate porn I'm embarrassed that these scenes would force me to use the words legitimate and porn together. This was the first time I'd seen a woman climax in less than 30 seconds and the rolling around afterward was priceless LMAO. Clearly the writer was also a virgin.Maria while her performance was lackluster did at least have a pair of things going for her  and what a pair. The movie would have been greatly improved by having Maria in various stages of undress for the entire 130 minutes. This would have eliminated the need for dialog AND Brando not to mention reducing expenses on an alreadylow budget.And last but not least is the basic premise spontaneous sex between strangers was unrealistic  but it is a common fantasy of men. In that regard the movie does deliver  just not very effectively. Maybe the purpose of the film was to get women to take pity on Brando and Bertolucci and have sex with them? Just a thought. 2 out of 10 Thank you Maria!".

The genius is that he conned the artistic elite with it.The dialog was anything but realistic the plot  what plot the acting was on par with an elementary school production the cinematography would have been better using a handheld camcorder for sure the sound quality would have been better the musical score was actually a Bertolucci mixtape and was unrelated to the mood or setting of the scenes.Brando. What can I say about Brando? Trite emotionally flat two dimensional and inconsistent all come to mind. I have yet to see Brando deliver anything near an awardwinning performance he is alleged to have within him. Brando has an incredible range of emotion from angry to not so angry. Moody is not applicable as it would imply that he has more than one and is capable of changing it.Brandon having done his own sex scenes demonstrated that he was still a virgin. I've seen more realistic sex scenes in legitimate porn I'm embarrassed that these scenes would force me to use the words legitimate and porn together. This was the first time I'd seen a woman climax in less than 30 seconds and the rolling around afterward was priceless LMAO. Clearly the writer was also a virgin.Maria while her performance was lackluster did at least have a pair of things going for her  and what a pair. The movie would have been greatly improved by having Maria in various stages of undress for the entire 130 minutes. This would have eliminated the need for dialog AND Brando not to mention reducing expenses on an alreadylow budget.And last but not least is the basic premise spontaneous sex between strangers was unrealistic  but it is a common fantasy of men. In that regard the movie does deliver  just not very effectively. Maybe the purpose of the film was to get women to take pity on Brando and Bertolucci and have sex with them? Just a thought. 2 out of 10 Thank you Maria!";

The idea to stage the party in Prague's biggest swimming pool is illegal but cool. And when Gregor the laidback leader of the group thinks an idea is good then noone else from the group objects. But what begins as the night of all nights quickly turns into a life and death struggle as the friends come to realise that death itself is on the guest list...

Arriving at the secret location with Martin Jason Liggett and Diego Maximilian Grill at what appears to be a huge mansion they proceed to party and have a general good time and rekindle old romances. After finding several of them dead they soon realize that a psychotic killer is among them and is one of them. Desperate to get out they soon start to find more ways of trying to get out only to have the killer shut them off before they can escape. With their numbers dwindling and no one to trust the remaining members of the group make one last grasp to escape.The Good News This is one of the better slashers around. The fact this one manages to keep it entertaining while still being incredibly clich. This one here puts together practically a repeat of just about every clich and plottheme possible yet they're not a detriment to this one. The way it manages to keep the entertainment factor going. The fact that it also manages to include a lot of the traditional motives in here is quite nice. This one works the stalking scenes in some of the best scenes in the genre. The opening sequence with the shadowy house during the raging thunderstorm produces some chilling moments especially before the killer actually arrives which is a new thing on it's own and once it gets to the pool house itself there's just nonstop classic stalking scenes. From the first pool attack to the bathroom stalls and the big one through the restaurant these chases only get better as it goes on. Even the biggest moments in the airduct scene which is one of the best in the film contains a lot of the greatest tricks to get the suspense going. There's plenty of sudden machete stabs through the metal sheeting a lot of silence to prepare for the next assault and some of the best desperation moments in the style. They're suspenseful inventive and quite creepy all of which are necessary for good slashers. Another factor to good slashers is a great series of kills which this one has in spades. There's a large amount of stabbing in the stomach a slash across the chest a leg cut off above the knee a slit throat stabbing over the neck and chest with a busted beer bottle and being set on fire to name just a few. However none of these are even come close to it's one simply incredible kill that has to rank as one of the single best kills no matter what the genre and is the single best reason to see this film. There's no way to ruin this one other than it involves a water slide a machete and an open end into the pool. It's easy to figure out but it's still a simply awesome moment that is just pure fun and quite exhilarating. The fast nearperfect pace here is another great factor as this one keeps moving forward onto something else before it can get bogged down in pointless subplots which is a great plus as it stays lean and without distractions. The location at the pool which is house itself is one of the single best locations ever with it's dark and twisting hallways luminous view from the reflecting water and tons of places within to lay traps or hide. The final confrontation as well is quite exhilarating with it's actionpacked setting fighting and different methods of attack that preface a ton of battling. It ends the movie on the perfect high. These elements all make it incredibly fun and watchable.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot of flaws in this one. The film's biggest flaw is that there's simply not a lot of variety in the kills. Practically every single one minus a few is a variation with a machete and there's no real creative modes used. There's some nice setups but while others have become known for their creativity in regards to kills this one's sameness is something that hinders it. The only other flaw is that there's way too many survivors for this kind of film. This one's nearly a dozen survivors are quite surprising and this can lead away from the body count. These though are the only things wrong with this one.The Final Verdict While not a completely great film as a slasher this one is a lot of fun. Highly recommended to all slasher fans or those looking for some nonthreatening fun while the only ones who won't like it at all will be those against the genre as a whole.Rated R Graphic Language Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "The final exams are over and this night Sarah has been invited to a special private party by her boyfriend. The party takes place in a big pool house and it really seems as if this is going to be one party they're never going to forget... but it soon turns out that it's for all the wrong reasons as a masked killer shows up and starts to slaughter the friends one by one in the most gruesome ways.The Pool was originally titled Swimming Pool  Der Tod feiert mit which roughly translates into Swimming Pool  Death also parties yeah stupid title and came out just after the slasher hysteria had ended and therefore flopped disastrously in the German boxoffice chart. The story really didn't bring anything new to the genre and there are many things going against this movie but The Pool still managed to entertain me on many levels as the slasher fan that I am. The movie is very fastpaced with a high body count and a very entertaining slasher story and for all it matters the concept of having a slasher in a pool house has never been used before. Boris von Sychowski makes a terrific debut with this slasher flick and it's really a shame that it never got the credit that it deserved as this could easily have been just as successful as the other slasher flicks of this time if it had only been made a couple of years earlier. However the movie does sometimes struggle and there are many things that I'm sure that the mainstream audience wouldn't like too much like the unnecessary subplot with the cop who doesn't seem to serve any purpose at all in the movie. Either way this was luckily pretty successful when it headed for DVD and video since a sequel just finished production which is the main reason to why I decided to check this one out again even though I've all ready seen it like 6 times. I consider The Pool to be a very good slasher flick even though some of the actors sound like they're part of the Schwarzeneger family many of the actors in this are German and have a very strong accent. But as you all probably know by now I'm a big Kristen Miller fan and since she's starring in this slasher flick it was obvious that I was going to love it in the first place. If you're a fan of modern teen slasher flicks this is definitely not one that you will want to miss.A German slasher flick shot in English which has a lot of issues but ends up being a very entertaining slasher flick if you don't mind some obvious plot holes every here and there. I'm sure many people hate this and it doesn't really work on the mainstream level but if you're a slasher fan you can't afford to miss this one. Oh and there is one reason that will make you watch this movie the most classic horror scene ever  The Slide after you see this you will think twice about going dow a slide.".

A lot of people die violent gory deaths none of that PG13 crap the American market is overflown with. The killer does some serious damage here. The pace is very fast the mystery is at least somewhat compelling the girls particularly Elena Uhlig are all pretty hot what more can you really expect from this movie?

Although this movie flopped badly when it came out it still managed to entertain the hell out of me. This movie is fast paced with a high body count and the cast acted well in they're parts especially Kristen Miller she was hot and made a fantastic scream queen as the lead heroine Elena Uhlig was also sexy and that German accent of hers...well I just loved and Isla Fisher should have been given a bigger part I would have loved to see her in a bikini.Another thing I loved about this movie that the killer does use a machete and certainly makes the most of it especially for the cool impalement bit where that girl comes down the water slide very nasty.All in all a decent enough Slasher flick a definite must for fans of the Slasher genre.".

I recall another film Session 9' built entirely around a cool set someone discovered. This set and the water could have been inexpensively exploited. A lack of skill prevented it.The two most attractive girls both redheads are the first killed contrary to the basic rules of slasher films.Each of these films has a signature slaying.

Opening scene has the killer enter the large home of a woman on her own at night during a heavy thunderstorm. Yes nothing original about that but it was well done even perhaps a touch Argento on show. As usual we have a good looking cast though acting abilities do vary. Despite being BBFC rated 15 in Britain there is plenty of tension and a few cool gory kills the girl getting sliced going down the water slide being the best.

With no way out of the building the friends fight back to stay alive and it becomes clear that the masked killer armed with a machete may be one of them. I absolutely loved this flick it was bloody and intense. Sort of has you guessing who the killer is as new secrets and past betrayals jealousy and wealth become motives. The pool has plenty of intense scenes such as the slide scene the ventilation shaft scene and the pool tunnel scene and the chase scenes as well as the final confrontation between the killer and the remaining teens. I definitely recommend The Pool".

It's unfortunate then that it was deemed we needed another ripoff of Wes Craven's Scream series as opposed to funnelling the budget off to a more interesting project.What worries me about this movie is that despite my being a fairly hardcore horror nut and watching all kinds of garbage this even annoyed the hell out of me. I hate to think what it's do to someone who'd never seen this kind of film. That said the production values are high so Horror virgins might misguidedly think this is awesome and 'well scary'.It isn't. It takes everything that was bad about the 90s slasher movie renaissance movies and bundles them together into some unholy rubberband ball of mediocrity. The killer is lame always an issue with the movies this is ripping off he looks like he escaped from a salon or a particularly dull fetish party the direction is so loose that the chance of anything resembling a scare is lost from minute one onwards and the characters and plot are so pencil thin stereotypical and derivative that it really must have been written on the legendary back of a cigarette packet.Simply put this movie embodies bad horror. It isn't scary it's not well thought out and it tries to compensate with violence. I might add that it doesn't even deliver there either and most of the kills are startlingly unimaginative and pointlessly bloody to the point of stupidity. Normally these kinds of film go under the 'you may like it if you're a fan of the genre' but hey I'm a genre fan and proud of it and I hated it. Avoid. If you want a new offkilter lowbudget slasher to watch check out Shredder or Scream Bloody Murder. They're much better than this tripe and are actually fun with it.".

	schema:headline " A sad and uplifting Jack London adaptation that is not to be missed. You can rarely go wrong with 'Chuck'.";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know about other people although looking at the score this website has given this film I can only ponder but when it comes to international team work in making a film I often love the results. In fact I loved this movie and thought it was extraordinary. Oh and the emotion it blew me away. 'Call Of The Wild' is a very emotional story of a German Sheppard's forced journey from 19th Century California to the Goldrush of the Alaskan wilderness and the meeting with its new owner with which it becomes closer to than with anyone or anything else. A very simple story indeed but the legendary Jack London knew how to tell a great high adventure tale on an epic scale and he obviously fancied dogs very much as is shown with his minute details about his subjects. I believe that Ken Annakin the director of this film realized London's vision to perfection and translated it brilliantly to the screen.The sheer realism that Jack London told his stories with takes you to another world and it takes your breath away with their uplifting finales. Ken Annakin had done a wonderful job with directing Call Of The Wild. The dog in the film is an actor itself as it plays such an integral part of the film. Not even half way into it it is almost certain that you will fall in love with the dog. Its emotions and gestures are all natural and it's easy to relate to the dog's journey. Five minutes into the film I was hooked. The dog had such a commanding presence that not even Charlton Heston could get in its way. And then there is Charlton Heston a man of such phenomenal legendary influence on film history. Yet even with his power fame and success he is one of the few actors in the world who's fame doesn't distract from the film. It's his strong presence and everyman human and subtle performances that set him apart from many actors on the same level of fame. He is always the same 'Chuck' but he is more like we are and that's why we loved his films so much. So when you see him inevitably getting closer and attached to the dog it feels so convincing and real it drains you of all emotions. Call me crazy but when the credits at the end were rolling I felt like crying. Here you are in the middle of god's nowhere in the heart of the Alaskan wilderness two mammals  a dog and a man  who have no families and nothing to come home to find one another and become the closest most reliant friends as it is a key player in their survival of the unforgiving hardships of the Goldrush and the wilderness in between them and the Gold. The scenes where 'Chuck' finds the dog after not seeing him for a long time are so uplifting and you can see the happiness and joy in Heston's eyes. However nothing beats the finale when the dog and the man are departed for the last time in tragedy. It's so sad and it makes you think about how big their journey together was and how close they were to one another. Yet the film still finishes on a positive note with the dog and his offspring symbolizing life goes on.What really set the mood for the film more than the harsh wilderness and the hardships that the two faced throughout was the unusual alienating music written and composed by Carlo Rustichelli which at first seems out of place and very weird but soon becomes the film's underlying haunting atmosphere and power. In a way the music paints a picture of struggle and isolation better than anything I've ever heard in my life. By the end of the film I didn't want anything else it was perfect. And of course the music wouldn't have been any good without the wonderful cinematography that gave a clear realization of how vast the landscape is.Ken Annakin's Call Of The Wild is easily a worthy addition to the adventure lover's film collection. You will feel like you have been on an epic journey. It captures the importance of dogs in those times  for dogs were at times worth more than Gold as they were the only things that could get you around the deep snows of Alaska. Rarely have I seen such a realistic and graphically harsh portrayal of the Goldrush years and the men with their dogs and sleds that fought searched and died for the Gold. And in the forefront there is a most captivating story about love and friendship between two different species. Adventure fans go no further than this great escapist master work. Yes there is wooden acting in some parts but the core of the film doesn't fail one bit. The film is a definite product of the 70s and adds a lot of nostalgia only adding to the atmosphere. I absolutely surrendered to the film's beauty and power and I can confidently call it a classic. They don't make em' like this anymore!".

The sled owner Charlton Heston soon grows attached to the dog and we see their adventures in Alaska which includes hunting for gold. This version of the famous story isn't as good as the 1935 version with Clark Gable and Loretta Young but this one does remain entertaining throughout. There are some major problems with the film that keeps it from being great but even through there are problems there's still a wonderfully touching movie here. What doesn't work is that the film really appears to have originally been three hours and then edited down to its 100minute running time. I say this because there seems to be some rough editing and there are various parts of the film that seem rushed. This becomes rather annoying but the real star here is the dog. The dog used in the film does a remarkable job and really makes his role a real character and not just an animal doing tricks. Heston gives a pretty good performance and his actions with the dog are a lot of fun to watch but there are moments when the actor goes over the top and brings a few laughs which certainly wasn't intended. Michele Mercier is good as Heston's lover and George Eastman makes for a great villain. The film was shot in Finland which leads to some terrific visuals and the movie remains entertaining all the way through. The love story between Heston and his dog is beautifully captured but some should be warned that there are a lot of scenes of animal abuse which will certainly bother some.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the only name we American viewers will recognize in the cast Charlton Heston does very well in the lead role of John Thornton rugged prospector in the Klondike Gold Rush. There are two leads of course the other being Buck the lead sled dog that Heston puts more store in than most people.It's not a misanthropic position by any means. As anyone who lives in the frozen north on any continent a good sled dog is still the best transportation around. One that is loyal and smart like Buck is worth more than the gold he might carry out of a strike.The only other version I saw of this story is the one that starred Clark Gable and Loretta Young in the Thirties That one took considerable liberties with the story. This version is faithful to Jack London's novella which came out when folks were still panning for gold in this area in 1902.You'll not know any other names from the cast except possibly French actress Michele Mercier who plays a saloon owner in Dawson City and who would like Heston to settle down with her. But The Call Of The Wild is as strong in him as it is in Buck The Dog who discovers his second cousin the wolf and yearns for their open existence. Though the dog develops an affection for his human the same way Heston has for the dog.Heston is rugged and fine in the lead role. The nonrecognition of the other players works out because it lends an air of authenticity to the film. Ken Annakin's direction is on target and the location cinematography done in the Lapland country of Norway and Finland is magnificent.Heston wasn't crazy about the film I imagine it was one rugged location shoot for him. Still his fans should like it and I can tell you he's done worse films than The Call Of The Wild.".

Though the dog develops an affection for his human the same way Heston has for the dog.Heston is rugged and fine in the lead role. The nonrecognition of the other players works out because it lends an air of authenticity to the film. Ken Annakin's direction is on target and the location cinematography done in the Lapland country of Norway and Finland is magnificent.Heston wasn't crazy about the film I imagine it was one rugged location shoot for him. Still his fans should like it and I can tell you he's done worse films than The Call Of The Wild.";

It's much like what you'd see in countless Euro horror films from the time but this time it's a dramatic and rather realistic take on the old American classic. When seen it doesn't take much to imagine the shooting conditions and how did they all cast and crew put up with the misery of the terrible cold and snow? Heston isn't miscast here like some say he's just very much different from what might be expected but he does an admirable job. Some of his best film work was during this time not the studio blockbusters he was known for prior to this. It is good that the story doesn't opt for the Hollywood happy ending but without spoiling it for those who haven't seen this it is a much more realistic ending.".

Obviously low budget this is offset by the authentic looking town beautiful locations Hestons great acting and Jack Londons timeless classic. It for me is one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. Even though the dialogue seems to be dubbed here and there I didn't have a problem with it. How Buck ends up in Alaska and is saved by Heston sets the tone for their unique friendship! Heston must decide which path to take as Buck must decide as well! This is definitely a story of fate and of personal choices ending with a desperate and dramatic climax! I read some of the other reviews ans it seems most people don't like this film. I don't care I was able to overlook the dubbing and the other flaws mentioned simply because this movie looks like the Yukon in the latter half of the 19th century. The story is touching and excuse me but i like it. When you have Heston it makes up for a lot............".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS At the beginning of the movie we see this handsome and powerful German Shepherd leading a wolf pack as they run down and kill a caribou for their supper. Later looking under the icy river the dog sees his master frozen to death beneath it The dog's name is Buck the master is John Thornton Charlton Heston. The story of Buck and how he became the leader of a wolf pack in the Yukon territory starts some time back in the sunny climate of Santa Clara Calif. It's 1897 and gold was discovered around the Klondike River in the Yukon and Alaskan territory's up north and dogs like Buck were worth their weight in gold as sled dogs in that country's deep snows and freezing weather. Dognaped by Judge Miller's Alfredo Mayo gardener Manuel for a price of 75.00 Buck was well on his way from being a sweet and loving pet to becoming a strong and ferocious wild animal. Beaten and broken for weeks by a number of different owners of sleddog teams Buck was almost dead when he was bought and put into the service of John Thorrnton and his partner Pete's Ralmund Harmstorf dog team. With John  Pete's kind and tender handling of him Buck became the lead sled dog and the most powerful and at the same time feared dog in the Yukon territory. Buck led the dog team in covering the treacherous 600 mile journey from Skaguay to Dawson as the lead sleddog for John  Pete in record time when no other dog team and it's owners would dare to try it. In the movie Buck is stolen a number of times from John and was once almost shot and killed by the local bootlegger but Buck always managed to escape and return home to John  Pete. It's later that the dog begins to yarn for his home in the wild. The reason Buck didn't go back to the woods where he developed a strong friendship with the local Timber Wolves in the area was his love for and loyalty to the persons who saved his life John  Pete. Torn between his two kind and caring human masters and his wolf family Buck can't quite bring himself to break away from civilization to live in the wild. Later one night a band of local Indians attack the cabin where both John  Pete were staying in and ended up killing both of them. Buck and his wolf pack tried to come to their rescue but were too late to save them as we saw in the beginning of the movie. With the two persons who Buck had a mutual bond with now gone Buck can now return to his distant descendants the wild wolves in the dark and cold woods of the Klondike. Buck in th end ended up answering to something that he understood and that was ingrained in his consciousness from the thousands of generations of canines over millions of years that he eventually evolved from The Call of the Wild.".

He was a German Shepherd mix as described in the book but was presented as a Newfoundland in the film. Curly was also the wrong breed.

The dognapper could have bought a dog and sold it for more.I understand from the beginning that the main character is the German Shepard. Even more so when the all too real looking abusive scenes of animal cruelty are shown. To make it more obvious of the Shepard being the main character a good idea would have been to get a lesser known actor than Heston. He's always been larger than life on screen no matter what he's been inso of coursepeople think that he's the main character.Interseting to see Heston so devoted to the dog and it's well beingmuch like it's a better friend to him than the humans he knows and hunts for gold with.

	schema:headline " Too much focus on Charlton HestonWARNING!!! SPOILER!";
	schema:reviewBody "If you've read the book it's not a spoiler.This movie doesn't work because too much focus is put on Charlton Heston. He's up in the Arctic falling in love delivering mail and you begin to think that he is the main character. But in actuality the dog is the main character. Jack London makes this clear. The story stays on Buck the dog throughout the whole book. While this movie does center on Buck most of the movie also centers on Thornton Heston's character.In the book Buck is stolen from his home in California and sold up north where sled dogs sell for top dollar. Buck is beaten and abused but unlike most pets sold as sled dogs Buck survives and grows strong. In the end Buck is so mistreated and abused he can barely stand. This is when his one good master and last master Thornton rescues him. They thrive together. But Buck keeps feeling the 'call of the wild' but he wouldn't leave his beloved master. Eventually Thornton is killed and Buck answers the 'call of the wild.' With this story it's obvious that the dog is the main character. After all Thornton is only in the end and he dies.But in this movie Thornton is too much of a main character and when he dies in the end as he must for the movie is The Call of the Wild it leaves one angry at the movie if you haven't read the book and aren't expecting it.Aside from this weird creepy music plays throughout the whole film. The acting is mediocre and not terribly enjoyable. At this time in the North there were no airplanes or anything. If you wanted to get anywhere it was either by boat or dogsled. There were dogs everywhere. At one point Thornton and his team mush into a town where there are no sled dogs so his dogs are stolen. This is absolutely ridiculous. A superior sled dog team may be stolen but to find a town with no sled dogs?!? Ludicrous!Not one of Charlton Heston's best films. The dogs aren't given the best roles but they are still a joy to watch.".

	schema:headline " Excellent depiction of the great northern gold rush";
	schema:reviewBody "Several years ago I rode the White Pass and Yukon Railway from Skagway Alaska to Carcross Yukon Canada. The 68mile line through the Coast Range Mountains follows the first leg of the route taken by nearly 100000 people who rushed to the gold fields of the Yukon Klondike and Alaska. The great gold rush that goes by all three names began in 1896 and ended in 1899. Jack London's book The Call of the Wild came out in 1903 and was set mainly in that time and place. But his setting didn't have a railway or highways  which had not yet been built. The only way to Dawson City the goal of the rushers was overland on foot for most people and by dog sled for the more fortunate. Today one can get a sense of the extreme difficulty and hardships of the gold seekers by taking a trip on the narrowgage railway that was begun in 1898 and completed in 1900. Although the gold rush ended abruptly the railway and later Klondike Highway from Skagway remained the principal means of supplies for the Yukon Territory well past the mid20th century. The railway today thrives mostly on tourist trade. The trip to Carcross is a popular shore excursion for cruise ships that sail to Alaska and stop at Skagway. Check out YouTube for video segments on this rail trip. I mention all of this because I think it adds to one's sense of the challenge and struggle of the people of that time. I remember reading London's book way back in high school a few decades ago. While the dog Buck is the central hero of the book the story was also much about the human travail of the gold rush. This film does a good job of showing the human foibles errors of judgment and lack of sense among people who caught the gold fever. Of course Buck and the other dogs and wolves are a big part of the film. The scenery and sets are excellent. I can see how the filmmakers used locales in Norway for scenes that look almost exactly like early newspaper photos of the gold rush. The acting cinematography and sets are all top drawer in The Call of the Wild. The weakness in the film is in the script direction and editing. And I'm not sure yet on the musical score. These aspects were choppy at times. Too often we would have a sudden break in scenes with no transition. Closer attention to these details could have made this an outstanding film. But for the story it tells from the book and the scenery sets and acting I give it 8 stars. For its historical value and realism The Call of the Wild ranks among a few very good films about hardships and struggles with nature. That was not the main plot London had in mind but the film serves up that secondary plot very well.If you ever take an Alaskan cruise that stops at Skagway be sure to take the White Pass and Yukon Railway trip to Carcross. A barbecue lunch is at the Yukon end and you return by bus on the Klondike Highway. It only operates during the summer months. It's a bit costly but well worth it. This rail line is a major historical and engineering shrine today. Skagway also has a fine museum on the gold rush and the U.S. National Park Service has a Yukon Gold Rush museum in downtown Seattle.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie 'Cabaret' filmed in the 1970s but set in Berlin just before Hitler's rise to power features a very annoying scene in which a smug policeman explains that he allows these new troublemakers the Nazis to beat up communists because they keep the communists in line he smugly predicts that some other bunch of hooligans will come along to keep the Nazis in line. With our postwar hindsight we're apparently meant to view this attitude as wrongheaded. Ach ja if only those German bureaucrats had been more sympathetic to the poor dear communists those nasty Nazis never would have taken over. Sorry but I disagree. As terrible as the Nazis were the communists were worse. Stalin killed more people including more Jews than Hitler. If Germany had gone communist circa 1932 the Holocaust probably would have happened anyway ... possibly with an even higher death toll. Let's recall that Hitler and Stalin were on the same side in WW2 until the borscht got a little too hot.'S.A.Mann Brand' is blatant Nazi propaganda but unlike many later and better films made by the Third Reich at least it wears its Nazi politics on its armband I mean sleeve. Heinz Klingenberg plays Hans Brand a handsome young lorrydriver who's been having trouble earning a living in Germany's postwar economy. Ach ja but now that this nice Herr Hitler is making a few changes things should be better soon nicht wahr? As I said this movie is propaganda. Brand gets a job as a stormtrooper and soon things are goosestepping along nicely. Brand's father Otto Wernicke harbours some Marxist beliefs prompted by his bitter memories of the Kaiser and Germany's disastrous Weimar economy. The father approves when his stormtrooper son starts dating Vera Elise Aulinger a German fraulein with some radical Marxist notions. Surely a good NationalSocialist man can love a communist woman?Erm nope. This film clearly states that communism is bad as opposed to Nazism and not to be tolerated under any circumstances. SPOILERS COMING. It turns out that Vera is a hopeless stooge for Anton Huber a demagogue who talks about the plight of the poor German people but who really wants to foment a communist revolt so that he can hand Germany over to the Soviet Union. Fortunately Vera sees the error of her ways. She helps Brand betray Huber to the German authorities and she pledges herself to the new German cause. Brand's dad throws away his copy of the Communist Manifesto and he decides to vote for this new fellow Adolf who has such interesting ideas. All the Nazis live happily ever after. Now if only Hitler would do something about those pesky foreigners...'Stormtrooper Brand' is Nazi agitprop but that's not the problem. 'Triumph of the Will' serves the same agenda but that film is a brilliant testament to the power of cinema. 'Stormtrooper Brand' manages to make Nazis look dull and boring and bourgeois. I enjoyed Otto Wernicke's performances as police detective Lohmann in two of Fritz Lang's best films but here Wernicke gives a dull and stolid performance with a bad makeup job. The photography and sound recording are dodgy. If a propaganda film makes its point well as 'Triumph of the Will' does I can admire the filmmakers' proficiency while despising their agenda. 'Stormtrooper Brand' is just bad full stop. Significantly after this film was released most of the Reich's subsequent films were much more subtle in their sermonising. I'll rate this movie barely one point out of 10.".

The times that the telepath projected his horrors onto others in selfdefense was difficult viewing disturbing yet necessary and very important. The scenes with lobotomy and ECT should remind all of us of the very real nonfiction horrors buried in American medical history experts so sure of themselves that they selfjustify doing terrible things to peoples' brains.

He doesn't succeed and gets submitted to a mental hospital. From there on the doctors have to find out who he is and what his problems are. And rest assured the more they discover the creepier things get. This is a rather unique film worthy of a bit more recognition. A bit slow in pace to some perhaps but for me the pace and rising tension were perfect. If any of you enjoyed films like Richard Franklin's PATRICK 1978 or Douglas Trumbull's BRAINSTORM 1983  this one's maybe a bit of a stretch as it's more scifithrillerdrama orientated  then THE SENDER comes highly recommended.Aside from the steady pace of lingering creepiness  mystery I found that there were at least two real WTF? moments in this film. Two scenes that took me by surprise in a way I didn't know whether to cheer or be terrified. A very good psychologically tinted horror film indeed! Yes I'm rating it highly but compared to some of the trash I watch on a regular basis this film deserves some extra praises. And Paramount should really make an effort to release a worthy DVD edition of this film adding a commentary track by director Roger Christian and maybe some other fine special features. Their 2008 release features only the film and nothing more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whether you want to categorize THE SENDER as a thriller horror or scifi film it makes for a rather strong movie in any genre. The plot centers on a doctorpatient relationship between amnesiac John Doe Zeljko Ivanek and Dr. Gail Kathryn Harrold. Kathryn Harrold as the good doctor goes to bat for the young amnesiac when her colleague Paul Freeman wants to administer electroshock therapy. But Harrold feels she can reach him without the questionable treatment. Little does she know that everyone not just herself can reach him for he is a gifted yet troubled young man who has the ability of telepathy.Images are sent to Harrold via Ivanek which allows her to piece together his past. When John Doe's mother Knight meets with Kathryn Harrold more pieces fall into place but mother might have ulterior motives. Mother also might be a figment of her imagination or another of Ivanek's projected false images. The film focuses on Kathryn Harrold trying to set things in order and thus place the troubled mind of Ivanek at ease.STORY  The story has its strengths and weaknesses. I was quite shocked at how readily Paul Freeman's character accepts Harrold's theory of telepathy before proof is given. If he had any reservations he became a full believer after the great electroshock scene. There are numerous biblical references which some viewers will find offputting but there isn't any open bashing of Christianity just the typical subtle Hollywood questioning of faith. Shirley Knight is a religious freak who viewed her gifted child as a reincarnation of Christ and there is a mental patient at Harrold's hospital that calls himself The Messiah.ACTING  The acting is quite strong. Zeljko Ivanek was cast because he has a natural woebegone appearance with his droopydog facial features and Edgar Allen Poe eyes. Appearances aside the young man gives a very good performance. Kathryn Harrold is very strong in the female lead giving us a convincing performance as a shrink dedicated to human understanding and not radical treatments. She excels with a rather demanding role that forces her to play a strongminded woman who must question the integrity of her thoughts when Ivanek begins to bombard her with mental images. Shirley Knight does a fine job in her subdued role while Paul Freeman has little to do but assist Kathryn.SEXUALITY  There is no nudity in this filmit has a strong story and doesn't need flesh to gather viewers. Be that as it may Kathryn Harrold gives a quality comehither performance never once shedding her clothes though proving that an actress can be sexy without going nude. The first images she receives are at night at her home as she believes a burglar has intruded into her house. Kathryn wears a thin vneck shirt in bed with quite obviously nothing on underneath. Those with a caboose fetish will like the scene when she reaches to secure a window and her backside is fully exposed.".

Well I kept watching as it has been forever since I had seen this film and it had some good moments but it could of been a lot better too.The film does start with a young man trying to commit suicide. He is promptly taken to one of the worst mental health facilities I have ever seen. This is mainly due to what they do throughout the film I mean all it is missing is that nurse from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to make it the the absolute number one worst facility. Well a female doctor wants to assist this man who is suffering from amnesia while another doctor wants to use every extreme method of treating patients hoping to zap the young man out of being suicidal. Well this young man has certain powers...it seems when he dreams or has nightmares he has very powerful telepathic abilities. These abilities make the doctor trying to help him and others in the facility see horrific things. Add the man's mother who appears from time to time seeming to want to help but her motives are not clear.The film has its moments it really is not a hardcore horror film though. In fact if one were to rate it now it would probably get a PG13 rating except for one scene near the end involving the young man and another patient after the young man tries to beat up a television. Still it keeps you wondering where it is going...I am just not entirely satisfied where it ended up. I just find it hard to believe they would have done what they did at the end to the young man as it seems pretty obvious he still needs some guidance. The gore is minimal and you get scenes with rats and insects as well. The most disturbing scene was one involving a procedure being done on him as the cut look really good.So this film had its moments but it was just an okay film to me. Nothing super great or anything. It just seems like it needed more of a point or something. The thing with the mother that was revealed at the end was a bit too obvious as well. Still it is a lot better than a lot of horror films and it does feature deadly dreams before the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise launched.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never really heard of The Sender but it turned out as quite a surprise. A solid refined production with dependable performances and an innovative concept with jarring psychological tension and grisly haunting imagery. A young man is admitted to a mental hospital after attempting suicide and the doctors know nothing about him due to him having no memory. Dr Gail Farmer becomes his doctor and soon discovers that he has uncontrollable telepathic powers that begin to affect the minds of his fellow patients and the hospital staff. This happens whenever he seems threatened hurt or upset by transmitting those visions. Farmer goes about seeking answers and these might lie in John Doe's 83's mother. A warmhearted Kathryn Harrold brings a functional sense to her character Dr Farmer and Zeljko Ivanek creates an uneasy presence by shrouding his character with brooding mystery Why can't I control it?. Accessible performances by Shirley Knight and Paul Freeman add some class. The narrative is completely offbeat and slowboil manipulating its characters and the suspensefulmindscratching situations they find themselves in. The harrowing mother and son relationship is interestingly staged and running through it is an ambiguous edge. Atmospherics are sombre and clinical with an excellent musical score by Trevor Jones. It's melodically eerie and unhinged with its cues like the striking opening sequence with its elegant camerawork. A chilling underseen little supernatural horror gem from the 80s.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently The Sender is quite popular and highly acclaimed among the rest of my fellow reviewers here but I can't say it made the same powerful impression on me. Undeniably this film plays in a much more sophisticated league than the majority of early 80's horror efforts but in my humble opinion it's still a little too flawed to label it as an undiscovered gem. The Sender is actually more of a psychological thriller instead of a horror flick in spite of some genuinely repulsive special effects with the emphasis primarily lying on suspense and an extremely convoluted screenplay. I'll be the first to admit that it's a pleasant surprise to encounter a storydriven thriller amidst all the brainless slasher efforts of the early 80's but the plot can't hold your attention long enough and there isn't enough empathy with the main characters. The Sender opens wondrously atmospheric and mysterious with the attempted suicide of a drifting and clearly disorientated young man who simply walks into a recreational lake with stones in his pockets. The man is taken to the state mental hospital where he's baptized with the name John Doe 83 and gets put under the custody of the caring female psychiatrist Dr. Gail Farmer. In her attempts to safeguard John Doe 83 from undergoing electroshocktherapy Dr. Farmer builds up a liaison with him and involuntarily gets drawn into his world of nightmares. As some sort of telepathy John Doe is able to broadcast his dreams to certain receivers. Dr. Farmer has all sorts of visions and she even receives visits from a creepy woman who claims to be the boy's mothers but she can't be sure what's real and what's not.The Sender contains a highly satisfying amount of grisly images and truly nightmarish scenery like for example mirrors that break and start bleeding rats crawling out of people's mouth and mentally unbalanced patients strangling themselves. The absolute highlight of macabre is undoubtedly the sequences in which an entire operating room shatters as soon as the ETC machine is connected to John Doe's persona. My personal main issue with the film however is that these sequences are merely just isolated highlights in an overall confusing and notcompellingenough thriller. The interactions between Dr. Farmer and her patient are overlong and sometimes redundant while there are so many other potentially fascinating elements to elaborate on like for example a more detailed background of John Doe's fellow mental patients. Also a story like this also needs an evil and greedy doctor who wants to exploit John Doe's extraordinary psychic powers. Some kind of anti pole to Dr. Farmer's character. But enough with the complaints because let there be no mistake The Sender is definitely worth a peek if you're looking for an unconventional and stylishly put together 80's shocker. Director Roger Christian almost 20 years before making the abysmal Battlefield Earth does a professional job maintaining a slow and unsettling pace and the acting performances are far above average. Particularly Shirley Knight is creepy as hell as John Doe's mysterious mother in black.".

Quite surprised given the time it was made that this was a sophisticated film which was well acted had storyline with depth and was shot quite nicely. It's surprising because of the plethora of slasher films around at the time that are by far inferior but more well known.This was a decent horror flick that deserves a rewatch. It reminded me at points of Dario Argento films but without the stylistic lighting effects and also of the Australian horror Next of Kin.The film is set in a mental hospital and focuses on a new patient who has been brought there and the doctor who is trying to figure out his story since he is suffering from amnesia. As the film goes on it is revealed he has some kind of telepathic powers which result in some very cool sequences in the film. For this reason it also reminded me of Scanners and The Fury. It may remind people of Carrie also but it is very different to that film and a lot better too.While there was the odd moment of gore this isn't an 'in your face' horror with lots of fake scares and there is no real bad guy. It's more of a mystery film with great atmosphere some creepy moments and cool effects.".

It reminded me at points of Dario Argento films but without the stylistic lighting effects and also of the Australian horror Next of Kin.The film is set in a mental hospital and focuses on a new patient who has been brought there and the doctor who is trying to figure out his story since he is suffering from amnesia. As the film goes on it is revealed he has some kind of telepathic powers which result in some very cool sequences in the film. For this reason it also reminded me of Scanners and The Fury. It may remind people of Carrie also but it is very different to that film and a lot better too.While there was the odd moment of gore this isn't an 'in your face' horror with lots of fake scares and there is no real bad guy. It's more of a mystery film with great atmosphere some creepy moments and cool effects.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see how a film such as The Sender would go on to be one of the more overlooked horror films of its time. After all it didn't involve a psychopath chasing horny kids with a sharp weapon slasher films were pretty much the it thing during this time period. No this is something different something that derives much of its power from surrealism and performance. It never offers easy answers but it does get its viewers asking questions. Zeljko Ivanek in the role that introduced him is a suicidal young man who's brought to a mental hospital where a caring psychiatrist Kathryn Harrold tries her hardest to get through to him. The main problem is that he has a frightening power he can send his nightmares to other people. Another problem is that a strange woman named Jerolyn Shirley Knight claiming to be the young mans' mother appears and disappears throughout the story to basically say that he needs to be with her. Thanks to the efforts of genuinely talented cast and crew members The Sender sizes up as an interesting and eerie film that has a way of staying with you after it's over. Making his feature length directing debut here is Roger Christian a man renowned for his work as an art director set decorator and production designer he'd been Oscarnominated for Alien and won an Oscar for Star Wars. He creates a constant feeling of creeping unease and successfully alternates between more subtle moments and more horrific ones. The horrific highlights employ well orchestrated special effects by Nick Allder and include the disastrous consequences of attempted shock therapy and an attempted operation. The beautiful scary music score is the work of Trevor Jones. Harrold has a warm presence in the lead role and Ivanek who over the years has emerged as one of the great character actors in the business is touching and vulnerable as the kid unable to maintain control. Knight is excellent as is Paul Freeman Raiders of the Lost Ark in the part of Harrolds' more clinical boss. Aliens fans can also note the presence of Al Matthews a.k.a. Sergeant Apone as a Vietnam veteran which the actor is in real life. This film begins with an incredible feeling of tension and manages to keep that tension going for as long as the movie lasts. Overall it's very effective and discriminating horror fans who are looking for overlooked gems should find a fair bit to enjoy with The Sender. Eight out of 10.".

This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here no words are wasted the setting feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fanboys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation and yet the fanboys still complain. With this film you have a good watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology showing it due respect.It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battletrained too slick too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's overthetop commandostyle action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.".

The zombies here are a little bit faster though.It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy. The effects are top notch solid directing a really imaginative and eerie production design and great acting.Yes i may be a little biased but i really like Milla Jovovich. I think this is the kind of role that fits her best strong kick ass attitude with an odd personality wrapped in a seemingly fragile shell. Her performance here reminds me a bit of the character she played in The fifth element and also the character in the later Ultraviolet The other actors did a good job as well so she's not the only one to get credit although the movie revolves around her character. The child AI is a very nice and creepy addition to the atmosphere.The RE theme could have ended up as a nice trilogy but the sequel unfortunately lacks nearly everythingexcept Milla that this film delivers. Not that RE2 is a complete mess but nowhere near this. I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.If you like zombie and action films you'll certainly like this one.".

The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesheating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene the zombified dogs awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for actionhorrorscifi films did a fine job with the direction.".

And true it wasn't a literal working of the movie it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked and that's a video game player attitude  movies don't have to have good replay value it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once but I don't think it sucked it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. It was an engaging story moved like lightning and had some excellent scares.".

It did not follow the story line of the game and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor.Upon realization that a video game is dumbed down for the players to be able to concentrate however I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed. I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way they made little notice of records and files lying about no matter how relevant they were or were not and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game. I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active. Considering this is first and foremost an action movie with horror elements that would not be considered a good thing.The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work. Her supporting cast every one gave nothing but the best they had. The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed. There is nothing wrong with this attempt. It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations. Unfortunately that was their major principal audience game fans and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt. The fanboys were disappointed the casual fans casually attended this event and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal either way and so did not participate to a profitable level.With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder the casual fans were less casual and the fanboys were still disappointed but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be take it or leave it. We took it and in retrospect embraced the first attempt as well.It rates an 8.410 from...the Fiend .".

I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic accompanied by lame heavy metalthrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an Rrating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of but this is nitpicking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen let alone played the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me like Aliens but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10 if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mild nonspecific spoilers ahead.I had high hopes but Resident Evil wants to be a zombie movie and an action movie and it fails utterly on both counts.You can't have a good zombie movie without gore.  Or without some decent zombies.  The zombies in this movie are feeble except for the dogs who have hardly any screen time.  The movie also has a rather hastily concocted monster which serves as padding.  The gore that does get onto the screen doesn't have any continuity with the action as if the victims of violence in the film wandered in from an alternate universe where they died of different causes.And you can't have a good action movie without action.  Milla has about oneandahalf good action moments in this film and the rest of the cast manages another two.  Those are supplemented by a lot of inaction and a lot of loud nonsense where they try to confuse you into thinking something interesting is happening.  Dull dull dull.Shaking the camera a lot during a closeup of someone waving their arms and screaming is not an action scene.  It's passe and pathetic and wasn't a decent substitute for action back when it was relatively new in the mid80's.The movie has a few moments of genuine atmosphere but those have all come and gone by the twentyminute mark.  There are some nice props but they generally don't get much use and some nice sets although the gross overuse of the closeup generally obscures them.  The cast shows some promise but they don't have much to do and the dialogue is all too often wincingly bad.The movie relentlessly copies better films and does it poorly a long and annoying reminder of what you could be watching instead.Most mysteriously of all the film contains nudity but none of it serves any purpose.  The movie already had an 'R' rating for violence.  The nudity isn't necessary or flattering.  I admit rarely have I seen a movie in which an attractive woman appears without her clothes and thought the movie would be better without the nudity but it happened here.All in all it's not as interesting or exciting as watching someone play the game.  Or hearing them talk about having played the game.  It's not even as good as the director Paul Anderson's earlier videogame movie Mortal Kombat. As the final credits rolled I was easily able to think of almost a dozen zombie movies that are far far superior  and only two of them are Japanese.Weak dull derivative amateurish underwritten underdirected and generally disappointing.  I feel bad for Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez who I know can do so much better.".

So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies and the story was excellent.A virus breaks out in a lab called the Hive where everyone is held in captivity and dies. All of a sudden we see a woman passed out in a shower she has no idea who she is she meets two other men who have no idea who they are but they are taken by soldiers who take them underground to the Hive. There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened. The main thing is that they control the Hive but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead zombies. The woman Alice turns into the leader and must find out why this happened and also how they can get out alive without contaminating the world.Resident Evil was an awesome movie to watch and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action movies. If you loved Mortal Kombat I'm sure you'll love Resident Evil. There are so many great scenes but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab it was really scary but so awesome to watch. Well you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.710".

Well you'll just have to see what I mean. Milla Jovovich was just a perfect choice for Alice she is such a cool character and now I'm really looking forward to seeing Extinction.710";

The group Milla Jovovich  Eric Mabius  Colin Salmon  Martin Crewes  James Purefoy battles the Umbrella Corporation  the undead and a super computer that plots total destruction over the human race . The commando to prepare for their roles the actors playing commandos and Milla Jovovich and Eric Mabius had a week of commando training with a Navy Seal in the heart of Umbrella's most clandestine operations facility and unveil mysterious plans . First original film with nonstop action  violent combats and spectacular images by computer generator . The human race's last and only hope is Alice Milla Jovovich is the only actor to appear in all five films . Spectacular  actionpacked and thrilling first installment of the Resident Evil series  adapted from the video games characters produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi . Yet another noisy film rendered from a video game which never gets as eerie as a Zombie picture should . Unstoppedaction gorefeast that provides for highoctane escapist entertainment with some eyecatching visuals and pulsing soundtrack . This exciting picture contains thrills  chills  actionfilled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts . The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized  being the first movie of the series not to feature undead dogs . This original takes more  more approach  more fights  more blood and gore than subsequent sequels . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with scary and amazing frames . It's predictable but we have seen some scenes in previous films  but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the actionwomen  as Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . Milla Jovovich did all of her own stunts except the pipe jump in the sewer scene . The main actors were told to prepare for the film by getting copies of the games and playing them through. Some of them didn't know if they could complete them in time so they had to get video copies of other people beating the games and then watch it . One of the most popular scenes in the film  when Alice runs up a wall and flings round to kick a zombie dog in the head  took 3 months of training for Milla Jovovich. The flesheating mutants appearance deliver the goods  plenty of screams  shocks and tension . The makeup assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals and stateofart FX won the Canadian Screen Award for Achievement in Visual Effects . Professional dancers were cast as zombies . Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with destroyed city  with a technological facility totally inhabited by fleshmunchies creatures and much of it was filmed in unfinished stations of Berlin underground .

	schema:headline " AMAZINGLY WELL DONE!";
	schema:reviewBody "I want to start off by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I am a big fan of horror movies. And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking....Resident Evil a '10'? Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawnout scene but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick but Manson does his best work to date. And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme. The score starts with an ominous sound followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses more and more tension builds as drums guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun gorefilled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscarworthy but they do portray their characters well. The makeup work IS oscarworthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is welldirected seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002 one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead the other masterpiece. In fact you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything it captured it all to well. As with all movies there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.".

	schema:headline " One of my most favourite films";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge fan of the video game series I've played  completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow  peaceful but then it went really fast  relentless just like a rollercoaster going up slowly  zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer  director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice  Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action horror  thriller is superb they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid  boring especially House of the Dead the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the TVirus released into the air vent after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they need to feed nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is You're all going to die down here from the Red Queen she is one of the best characters along with Alice Matt  Rain. Background music score is the best music possibly for any film I have ever heard it has heavy metal guitar for the fight scenes and very soft eerie  sensational for the main title. I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good. There is nothing more I can ask for in a film that makes it one of my all time favourite movies and there is never going to be another film based on a video game like this!".

The zombies were not the main point of the story though...the writers were actually smart in the fact that there was a certain step to follow in the movie to survive. There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal everyday woman will think. OK I might not be normal but I generally have good opinions about movies. The women in this movie show power and the men were intelligently resourceful. The zombies were well played out and were not overshown. The twists in this particular movie made me watch it twice at the movie theater once with my family and once with my friends.".

There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal everyday woman will think. OK I might not be normal but I generally have good opinions about movies. The women in this movie show power and the men were intelligently resourceful. The zombies were well played out and were not overshown. The twists in this particular movie made me watch it twice at the movie theater once with my family and once with my friends.";

No I don't expect every film based on a game or a book to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies especially horror for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie. One minute someone is on the ground surrounded by undead the next he is 'edited' up onto his feet and running for his life. HUH?I thought the 1940's and 1950's had it bad with Abbott and Costello running the Universal monsters into the ground. Hey at least their films were INTENTIONALLY funny. Resident Evil isn't even UNintentionally funny. So with no humor that leaves horror to carry the film which it doesn't. Why? Because like most films of the last 15 years it's all quick cut action with no suspense. Creating tension takes time and consistency something most modern film makers don't seem to understand. This film plays like a commercial or a music video without music.Once again the characters are completely unsympathetic. They say dumb things and they do dumb things. Once again the 'modern' tough smart strong cool sexy female stomps all over the proceedings with muddy feet. SHE BOUNCES OFF A WALL AND KARATE KICKS ZOMBIE DOGS! Oooh! I'm so scared. I'm just not sure what to be scared of! I suppose I'm scared of seeing an equally appalling sequel.If you haven't seen this film  DON'T. This is 90 minutes you can never have back. In the age of DVD there's a wealth of good horror to be found. Better yet Video games are fast becoming better than modern films. Resident Evil the game and it's sequels especially 4 out class this pile by miles.".

An above average noir it was produced by Edmund Grainger in 1953 for the home of the great noirs RKO. Excitingly written by William Bowers and Irving Wallace it was crisply photographed in black  white by the great Nicholas Museraca and surprisingly directed in a good workmanlike fashion by Dick Powell. With no A list stars to speak of the picture is more than effectively played by a well chosen cast headed by Stephen McNally Paul Kelly and Alexis Smith.Two escaped convicts McNally  Kelly hijack a car with two occupants Alexis Smith  Robert Paige waylay another carrying two more people Jan Sterling  Keith Andes and along with an old prospector Arthur Hunnicutt hold them all hostage in a ghost town in the Nevada desert. The town has been earmarked and cleared by the military for the testing of an Atomic bomb in a few hours time. This the captors learn from the radio and are confident of leaving on time. In the meantime Kelly is badly wounded from a gunshot he received in his prison escape bid and must have a doctor. McNally finds out that Smith's estranged husband Richard Egan is a physician and inveigles him by phone to come to the hideout or his wife will be killed. Things for the hostages don't go too well with poor attempts at escape and the savagely violent and somewhat psychotic McNally beating Andes to a pulp and shooting dead Smith's lover Paige. Suddenly the radio announces that the bomb test time has been moved up and will now go off an hour earlier. It becomes a race against time now to get off the site. Leaving the hostages to their fate in the town a scurrying McNally his fellow fugitive and a fearful Smith who pleads to go with them take off in the car but drive onto the actual bomb site itself instead of going in the opposite direction. The picture ends with the massive A bomb explosion McNally and company perishing in the car and the hostages all surviving after taking refuge in a cave.The cast do an admirable job with a nicely written screenplay. McNally is particularly good applying himself assiduously to playing what he always played best that of the sneering unscrupulous and mean spirited villain. Paul Kelly  who never gave a bad performance  is also good as McNally's softer hearted partner in crime. But something of a revelation is Alexis Smith! Smith an actress who for years was buried in inane glamour roles at Warner Brothers brings much to the table here in SPLIT SECOND. Her panic driven character continuously on the verge of cracking up is an incisive and inspired piece of acting. Who would have thought she had it in her? It is the best thing she ever did!With brilliant cinematography good performances an exciting screenplay all wrapped in a fine dramatic and atmospheric score by RKO's resident composer Roy Webb SPLIT SECOND comes across as a fairly rewarding visual experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the credits rolled across the opening scene I lost interest in the words as I tried to figure out what I was looking at a high angle shot of a shimmering expanse that looked like slick crazy paving and with muted keyed lighting spilling down the screen centre almost like a searchlight. I blinked more than once trying to focus properly and then saw the two long moving shadows that eventually resolved to the silhouettes of two men running towards me on what now showed itself to be the cracked and parched desert earth. As they disappeared off camera I knew those men were running for their lives...From that superb opener the rest of this story unfolds with relentless fury as the two  escapees from a penitentiary  join a third with an escape car and set off to retrieve a cache of cash from a secret location. The convicts are Sam Hurley Stephen McNally in one his best roles Bart Moore Paul Kelly with a bullet in his stomach acquired in the breakout and Dummy Frank De Kova who only says what he wants with a gun.The three stop for gas where Hurley quickly displays his psychopathology when he casually kills the attendant who resists Hurley's action is almost like swatting a fly. They wait then for their next victim  because the cops are looking for three escaped cons and they want to cover their tracks.A large limo pulls in for gas and the cons force their way into the car where Kay Garven Alexis Smith and Arthur Ashton Robert Paige are in the throes of a love affair that from the intro between the two a few scenes earlier appears to be going sour. So the whole party continues under Hurley's surly orders and direction. That is until they run out of gas  something Kay forgot to tell Hurley much to his displeasure. So they sit at the road side and wait for another useful victim...And that soon arrives in the form of Larry Fleming Keith Andes a well known news reporter and Dottie Vale Jan Sterling an attractive blonde down on her luck and just hitching a ride with Larry. So when they stop to help Kay who was acting as bait Hurley once again steps in to step on Larry's plans this time. Good job Larry had a much bigger car  a station wagon that can accommodate all seven of them.Hurley then tells Larry to drive to a ghost town in the desert where he will link up with another con with another vehicle due late that night. But first he has to get Bart fixed up get that bullet out with the help of Dr Garven Richard Egan Kay's estranged husband. Hurley calls the doctor on a phone and tells him he'll kill Kay if he fails to come and fix Bart...The last piece of the setup falls into place when Larry tells Hurley that the ghost town is only a mile from ground zero a nuclear test is due for detonation at 6 the next morning. Hurley doesn't care he's got plenty of time he thinks. Unknown to all of them however that time is changed to 5 a.m. to take advantage of the good weather.With that all in place the action is then contained on a single stage for the next hour as the clock ticks down to zero hour and as Hurley waits to get Bart fixed. Later old Asa Tremaine Arthur Hunnicutt turns up to provide pivotal support for the other hostages and almost steals the show for my money.Director Powell  one of my favorite filmnoir actors  does an excellent job as a firsttimer behind the camera well done interlaced editing as the separate stories are shown and eventually come together at the ghost town appropriate black and white photography and a well constructed claustrophobic miseenscene in the ramshackle bar in the ghost town  reminiscent of that rundown hotel in Key Largo 1948 as the hurricane approaches. Add to that the standard footage showing the preparations to detonate an atom bomb and the viewer is set for a taut nailbiter.McNally surpasses all in this film and delivers some of the best lines along with Jan Sterling. Paul Kelly is very effective as Hurley's older friend  but one who begins to question Hurley's judgment. And Frank De Kova is chillingly dangerous at all times. Alexis Smith is the quintessential lowlife femme fatale who makes the fatal error of hitching a ride with Hurley. Keith Andes is credible but somewhat wooden to be kind but does show the spunk of heroes when danger beckons. Arthur Hunnicutt is as usual the consummate oldtimer of the desert  and has the means to save the hostages from nuclear annihilation. Lucky for them.There're a number of themes of course greed loyalty and courage being the obvious ones. It's the interaction between Hurley and Bart Moore however that's fascinating Hurley a psychologically damaged WW2 veteran who can't stop killing but who recognizes something he needs in Bart's presence almost like a brother. Or was it just the money? It's a B movie for sure but it's one of the best I've seen. Recommended for all film noir fans.".

So the whole party continues under Hurley's surly orders and direction. That is until they run out of gas  something Kay forgot to tell Hurley much to his displeasure. So they sit at the road side and wait for another useful victim...And that soon arrives in the form of Larry Fleming Keith Andes a well known news reporter and Dottie Vale Jan Sterling an attractive blonde down on her luck and just hitching a ride with Larry. So when they stop to help Kay who was acting as bait Hurley once again steps in to step on Larry's plans this time. Good job Larry had a much bigger car  a station wagon that can accommodate all seven of them.Hurley then tells Larry to drive to a ghost town in the desert where he will link up with another con with another vehicle due late that night. But first he has to get Bart fixed up get that bullet out with the help of Dr Garven Richard Egan Kay's estranged husband. Hurley calls the doctor on a phone and tells him he'll kill Kay if he fails to come and fix Bart...The last piece of the setup falls into place when Larry tells Hurley that the ghost town is only a mile from ground zero a nuclear test is due for detonation at 6 the next morning. Hurley doesn't care he's got plenty of time he thinks. Unknown to all of them however that time is changed to 5 a.m. to take advantage of the good weather.With that all in place the action is then contained on a single stage for the next hour as the clock ticks down to zero hour and as Hurley waits to get Bart fixed. Later old Asa Tremaine Arthur Hunnicutt turns up to provide pivotal support for the other hostages and almost steals the show for my money.Director Powell  one of my favorite filmnoir actors  does an excellent job as a firsttimer behind the camera well done interlaced editing as the separate stories are shown and eventually come together at the ghost town appropriate black and white photography and a well constructed claustrophobic miseenscene in the ramshackle bar in the ghost town  reminiscent of that rundown hotel in Key Largo 1948 as the hurricane approaches. Add to that the standard footage showing the preparations to detonate an atom bomb and the viewer is set for a taut nailbiter.McNally surpasses all in this film and delivers some of the best lines along with Jan Sterling. Paul Kelly is very effective as Hurley's older friend  but one who begins to question Hurley's judgment. And Frank De Kova is chillingly dangerous at all times. Alexis Smith is the quintessential lowlife femme fatale who makes the fatal error of hitching a ride with Hurley. Keith Andes is credible but somewhat wooden to be kind but does show the spunk of heroes when danger beckons. Arthur Hunnicutt is as usual the consummate oldtimer of the desert  and has the means to save the hostages from nuclear annihilation. Lucky for them.There're a number of themes of course greed loyalty and courage being the obvious ones. It's the interaction between Hurley and Bart Moore however that's fascinating Hurley a psychologically damaged WW2 veteran who can't stop killing but who recognizes something he needs in Bart's presence almost like a brother. Or was it just the money? It's a B movie for sure but it's one of the best I've seen. Recommended for all film noir fans.";

Played by Arkansas native Arthur Hunnicutt He's buried at Greenwood Arkansas Asa plays a pivotal role near the conclusion of the film. The rest of the cast is effective particularly Stephen McNally who portrays the coldblooded killer with no morals Sam Hurley.The story involves an assortment of personalities who unwittingly end up kidnapped by three escaped killers one of them mute.

	schema:reviewBody "A cultish favourite that is often listed for festivals of noir cinema this work is less noirish than it is a clear example from the Theatre of Paranoia as Dick Powell's directorial debut melds nuclear explosion fears with a harrowing hostage taking by two escaped convicts fleeing from a Nevada prison. The escapees Sam Stephen McNally and Bart Paul Kelly helped by mute accomplice Dummy Frank DeKova take refuge in an abandoned mining town Yucca Flats along with six prisoners they acquire during their flight despite their awareness that the desert ghost town is within a nuclear test site where in 12 hours a combined military force is going to explode a tower bomb armed with high grade scissile plutonium. Sam believes that he and his two cohorts will be able to evade a protective army encirclement and escape prior to the blast but the uncertain fate of their hapless hostages becomes the oarlock for the film's atmosphere of foreboding with one of the captives played by Keith Andes being a Las Vegas newspaper reporter who has full knowledge of the detonation schedule having attended planning meetings during which the event's timetable has been established. For Powell's initial effort as a director of features he selects a restricted environment essentially one large room as setting for his limited cast of featured players with the bomb becoming an additional sinister character. Following initial leadin scenes including interlaced footage of actual soldiers and military technicians a stage miseenscne is established to advance an atmosphere of suspense. Unfortunately Powell's inexperience with ensemble work is in evidence here as the players generally simply take turns with their readings although a good deal of the dialogue is trenchant. The villainous trio is the most interesting of the cast with Kelly taking the acting palm for his strong yet lowkeyed turn as one who was severely wounded during the prison break and Richard Egan is convincing as a physician gulled into performing surgery upon Bart while on the distaff side talented Jan Sterling handily outperforms the histrionic Alexis Smith. Shot in California's Mojave Desert this work benefits from R.K.O.s master cinematographer with black and white stock Nick Musuraca and there is an appropriately dramatic score from Roy Webb. A nearly fatal flaw is the artless attitude toward the dangerous effects of atomic radiation although it must be conceded that applicable information available to the general public was scanty at the time of the film's production.".

	schema:reviewBody "Split Second is directed by Dick Powell and written by William Bowers Irving Wallace and Chester Erskine. It stars Stephen McNally Alexis Smith Jan Sterling Keith Andes Arthur Hunnicutt Richard Egan Paul Kelly Robert Paige and Frank DeKova. Music is by Roy Webb and cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca. Escaped convict Sam Hurley McNally is on the run with his wounded pal Bart Moore Kelly and henchman accomplice Dummy DeKova. Carjacking two lots of hostages Hurley takes them to a ghost town on an Atom Bomb test sight figuring it's the perfect place to hole up. But with Moore in need of medical help the test bomb set to go off in the morning and tempers frayed within the group something is going to have to give... A taut and sweaty noir Split Second taps into the 50s fear of the bomb and explodes the character dynamics Petrified Forest style. The premise is simple once the character introductions are out the way we wind our way to a bleak ghost town and stay in the company of a disparate group of people for the remainder of the film. As the clock ticks down with the bomb set to be detonated on the town at 06.00 the various characters introduce their respective traits into the story. The tension mounts and the overspills are often nervy sleazy and poignant. The makers don't soft soap the situations but they do dangle shards of sympathy. As is the case with Hurley who is a cold blooded killer we know and witness this but his back story is that of a war hero he also has a deep affection for his injured older pal somewhere along the line a good man lost his balance. Dottie Vale Sterling is a dancer street wise and aware of how to play the situation but sadness resides behind her waspish tongue. Kay Garven Smith is a lost cause she will do anything and trample on anyone to save herself. One of the best sequences in the film finds Garven throwing herself at Hurley the rest goes on behind closed doors but we know what happens and it adds spice to what follows in the final third. Not all of the characters work for dramatic impact such as Hunnicutt's talkative miner who wanders in to the plot at the midpoint it's amazing how easy everyone finds it to get into this supposedly secure military site! but the dynamics work wonderfully well. Weaklings heroes in waiting the forlorn the foolish or the borderline psychotic they all make for a potent and spicy psychological stew. The suspense angle of the impending bomb detonation is water tight as is the ebbing away of Bart Moore directer Powell never resorts to cheap tactics or clichs to keep the noose tight and we are constantly wondering just who if anyone? Will survive the ordeal. Once daylight disappears and we leave the scorching Mojave vistas behind night time envelopes the ghost town and ace cinematographer Musuraca brings his atmospheric magic. Webb scores it with dramatic verve and the RKO effects team headed by Harold Wellman do sterling work to pull it all together without cheap and tacky baggage. Powell gets great performances out of McNally Kelly Sterling Egan and Smith while his ability to not let the logic holes dominate the narrative belies the fact that this was his first directing assignment. From the ominous opening shot of two men fleeing over sunbaked mud flats to the thrilling and darkly tinged denouement Split Second is a coiled spring waiting to explode. 810".

Dick Powell directed this taut thriller with his usual combination of good work with actors and very competent camera work. There are two plots going on here very well interwoven by my standards the normals in the film led by a reporter beautifully played by Keith Andes are those trapped in the doomed desert town the other are those who are holding them there a gang of criminals led by niceguy and talented actor Stephen McNally as Sam Hurelyy an escaped criminal whose brutality becomes a metaphor for the violence of an Age that needs to resort to atom bomb tests. Others in the stellar cast include Jan Sterling Robert PaigeAlexis Smith Richard Egan Arthur Hunnicutt Paul Sewart and Frank de Kova. What sets this film apart I suggest is the brutality theme which is deftly made to affect to every member of the cast. McNally as Sam Hurley equates life with getting to do whatever he wants to do to anyone by force. Andes is his chief antagonist not a great pugilist but a brave fighter for another way of thinking about lifeget on with your own priorities and leave others alone this is by the way the real definition of heroism being a man who can do something well. Alexis Smith plays a woman who to save her life ignores what Hurley is and the fact that is is planning to leave the others behind when he uses their car to drive awaywith the atom bomb taking care of the evidence. The characters here are all unusually welldeveloped from hoofer Sterling who distrusts everyone until Andes takes a beating from McNally protecting her to Paige who underestimates Hurley to Hunnicutt who has run away from people to Egan who comes to save the wife who has been cheating on him a woman who can't take responsibility to Stewart who has to act against Hurley his partner. It's difficult to recommend too highly such an extraordinary blend of noir brinksmanship excellent dialogue and memorable confrontations. This drama only needed one change to be made from the point of view of the reporter not the gang leader to be a great film. It would lose a lot in color since it's superb blackandwhite noir drama from an age of muchbetter acting writing and directing.".

McNally as Sam Hurley equates life with getting to do whatever he wants to do to anyone by force. Andes is his chief antagonist not a great pugilist but a brave fighter for another way of thinking about lifeget on with your own priorities and leave others alone this is by the way the real definition of heroism being a man who can do something well. Alexis Smith plays a woman who to save her life ignores what Hurley is and the fact that is is planning to leave the others behind when he uses their car to drive awaywith the atom bomb taking care of the evidence. The characters here are all unusually welldeveloped from hoofer Sterling who distrusts everyone until Andes takes a beating from McNally protecting her to Paige who underestimates Hurley to Hunnicutt who has run away from people to Egan who comes to save the wife who has been cheating on him a woman who can't take responsibility to Stewart who has to act against Hurley his partner. It's difficult to recommend too highly such an extraordinary blend of noir brinksmanship excellent dialogue and memorable confrontations. This drama only needed one change to be made from the point of view of the reporter not the gang leader to be a great film. It would lose a lot in color since it's superb blackandwhite noir drama from an age of muchbetter acting writing and directing.";

When everyone wakes up early that morning things get worse when the time of the test is brought forward by an hour which gives them little time to escape. The people split into two groups with the two surviving convicts and the unhappily married woman trying to escape but don't survive and the rest going into the safety of a cave and survive.This is an excellent Atomic Age thriller which was well underway when it was made in 1953.The cast includes an excellent performance from Stephen McNally and Jan Sterling Alexis Smith and Richard Egan.This movie is certainly one to look for.

The constant danger that the hostages are in contributes to the threatening atmosphere of the piece and it becomes even more tense as the deadline for the detonation of an atomic bomb approaches. Nicholas Musuraca's exceptional black and white photography is very effective and the whole drama comes to a really shocking and spectacular climax.Newspaperman Larry Fleming Keith Andes is at an Army camp in the Nevada desert preparing to report on an atomic bomb test when he's suddenly reassigned to another story. Two guards had been killed when a couple of convicts Sam Hurley Stephen McNally and Bart Moore Paul Kelly had broken out of Carson City prison. On his journey to Carson City Larry stops at a diner where he meets blonde nightclub singer Dottie Vale Jan Sterling who's on her way to Reno. He agrees to give her a lift and shortly after beginning their journey the couple are waved down by Sam Hurley who holds them at gunpoint and demands that he and the people with him be taken to the desert ghost town called Lost Hope City where he plans to hide out for a short period before going on to meet another gang member and share out 500000 in stolen cash.Before he'd confronted Larry Sam and seriouslyinjured Bart had met up with fellow gangmember Dummy Frank de Kova and after killing the proprietor of a filling station hijacked the car in which doctor's wife Kay Garven Alexis Smith and her boyfriend Arthur Ashton Robert Paige were travelling. Their journey however had come to an unexpected end when they ran out of gas. When the group arrive at their destination the hostages are confined to one of the buildings to await the arrival of Dr Neal Garven Richard Egan who Larry had earlier phoned to come and attend to Bart.The ghost town is located close to the nuclear test area and the group are aware that the bomb is due to be detonated at 6.00am on the following day. A talkative local prospector called Asa Tremaine Arthur Hunnicutt arrives unexpectedly and is also held hostage by Sam and Dummy. Sam then kills one of his captives before the arrival of Dr Garven who after operating on Bart says that it won't be safe to move him for at least another day. The tension builds as it's discovered that the fuel tank in Larry's car is leaking and the sound of a siren warns that the time for the bomb to be exploded has been brought forward by an hour.Stephen McNally is convincingly dominant as decorated war veteran Sam whose attitude to killing was no doubt influenced by his wartime experiences and the other members of the cast also do well with Alexis Smith and Jan Sterling providing the best performances. Alexis Smith as the unfaithful wife of Dr Garven exemplifies most strongly the overriding air of desperation that prevails amongst the entire group during the tense hostage situation. She's sophisticated and snooty and regards Dottie as her inferior. This is remarkable as Kay has no integrity or decency and will do absolutely anything to save her own skin including giving herself to the killer who's holding her captive. Dottie on the other hand shows considerably more character when she's propositioned by Sam. Richard Egan as the doctor is quietly courageous as he puts himself in great danger to help a patient and to try to save Kay's life even though he doesn't want her back.".

All are held hostage while Garven operates on Moore...all the time everyone knows that a nuclear test is scheduled in just a few short hours.Dummy is overcome and beaten up just as Hurley Kelly and their moll take off in a car trying to outrun the blast. Well they don't make it...and end up satisfyingly incinerated by the blast. Tremaine leads the former hostages to an abandoned mine where the group rides out the bomb detonation.I've always liked any movie that stars Richard Egan although he plays a supporting character here and Arthur Hunnicutt is worth the price of admission in his signature role as an old miner. Look fast for Nelson Leigh as a scientist in a control room. Dick Powell directs with a sure hand in his directing debut and confines most of the story to one claustrophobic room in the abandoned town. Catch this film if you get a chancethe plot is familiar but the cast and story twist concerning the nuclear test makes it all worthwhile.".

Tremaine leads the former hostages to an abandoned mine where the group rides out the bomb detonation.I've always liked any movie that stars Richard Egan although he plays a supporting character here and Arthur Hunnicutt is worth the price of admission in his signature role as an old miner. Look fast for Nelson Leigh as a scientist in a control room. Dick Powell directs with a sure hand in his directing debut and confines most of the story to one claustrophobic room in the abandoned town. Catch this film if you get a chancethe plot is familiar but the cast and story twist concerning the nuclear test makes it all worthwhile.";

The storyline basically follow that of PF in that a gang of killers hold an assorted group of people hostage but with the added twist that audiences in the 50's loved....the A bomb.Stephen McNally a journeyman actor does a serviceable job as the lead baddie as does the veteran Paul Kelly  a bad boy in real life. The statuesque Alexis Smith is wonderfully slutty as the cheating wife who gets her comeuppance when she joins McNally in their final desperate flight to escape the atomic test site in which they have mistakenly become trapped. Others in the group hide in a cave and survive....well at least in this film. Since they emerge about an hour later into what we know would be a highly radioactive environment their chances are pretty slim but this was the 50's and what did we know? Also on the scene were two forgettable leading men of the time George Nader and Keith Andes and the always dependable Jan Sterling.Although misconceptions about the terrible after effects of atomic explosions abound in this film put that aside and be enthralled by a taut thriller that could only have been made in the 1950s.".

Unfortunately the ghost town has been targeted as a nuclear testing site with an explosion due for 6 Am the following morning.Alexis Smith she kept getting better with each movie plays Kay Garven who is on her way to Reno with boyfriend in tow Robert Paige from Deanna Durbin's film Can't Help Singing. She is going to divorce her husband Richard Egan. They are accosted at a service station by McNally and his gang and are forced to drive to the ghost town. Unfortunately they run out of petrol. As Smith says Did you think I was stopping at the gas station to buy perfume. I had been planning to buy petrol!!!.So they are forced to waylay another car. Larry Fleming Keith Andes is a reporter going to Canon City to cover the prison breakout and Dotti Jan Sterling was stranded at the petrol station and was offered a lift.When they arrive at the ghost town the film turns into a tense psychological thriller as people's true characters are revealed. Alexis Smith is great as Kay Garven a completely self centred woman who will stop at nothing to save herself.Stephen McNally did play good guys but he was at his best playing pretty despicable characters ie. Johnny Belinda. Jan Sterling plays Dotti the obligatory tough girl with a heart of gold.They know that the explosion is due for 6 AM the following morning ...what they don't know is that it has been put forward an hour.Richard Egan plays Dr. Neal Garven who makes a trip by plane and car to save the wounded escapee's life. That part is completely unbelievable  how would he have found his way out to that ghost town at 2 in the morning and how would he have got through the barricades??? The ending is exciting and laughable at the same time  completely in keeping with the times when nuclear fallout was not considered life threatening.".

It's like if crazed prison escapee Hurley McNally doesn't kill you first for darn sure the test blast will. So how are Hurley's hostages going to survive this double threat while being held prisoners in a ghost town next to ground zero. It's sweaty palms all the way except maybe for some of the side conflabs as the hostages and the gang get acquainted. Nonetheless firsttime director Dick Powell keeps things moving so that even the lesser conflabs pass quickly.But it's really McNally's movie. His Sam Hurley can snarl with the best of the 30's gangster crop and make you believe it. Still Sam's got another side a soft spot for wounded buddy Bart Kelly that is when he's not making a move on the women. Speaking of women was there ever a better movie floozie than Jan Sterling. Here her hardedged Dottie nicely combines the street tough with the reluctantly vulnerable. Even the often obnoxious Arthur Hunnicutt's loud talking rube works pretty well as comic relief. In fact each character is sharply drawn by an above average script.As I recall the movie got a spread in Life Magazine pretty good for a little bw in the year of big screen Technicolor and 3D gimmicks. However if I were handsome Larry Andes I wouldn't rush out into the open so soon after the blast after all the killer you don't hear we now know is even deadlier than the one you do hear. Anyway the movie's a darn good little suspenser that deserves a better rating than TMC's 2.".

	schema:headline " The Disappearance of Morality in the Atomic Age";
	schema:reviewBody "The genre of filmnoir can be divided into three eras  generally speaking the classic era 19401945 the postwar era 19451953 and the Cold War era 1953195860?. Filmnoir was always a genre about fear moral complexity and desperation. When the WWII filmnoir exuded postwar disillusions the concrete war was over but it was still going on on social level in our minds and in the society. What genre would fit more perfectly to the ages of paranoia and fear than the genre of them filmnoir. To my mind Split Second is the first Cold War filmnoir  a statement which one could argue about because in the same year 1953 Samuel Fuller made a filmnoir about paranoia and the fear of communism Pickup on South Street 1953.Dick Powell was the star of the Hollywood musicals in 1930's. In 1940's he tried to change his image from a singing dancer to the new bad boy of Hollywood. In 1944 Edward Dmytryk directed Murder My Sweet based on a novel by Raymond Chandler and casted Dick Powell to play Philip Marlowe  the greatest private eye of filmnoir but the performance by Powell is often left in the shadows of Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe interpretation in The Big Sleep 1946. After the war Dick Powell had some experience from filmnoir and he chose to try directing as well. Split Second was his debut of the six films he directed and I think he succeed quite well in it.1950's was the age when the government of the United States made a lot of nuclear weapon experiments in the deserts of US and in the famous Bikini island. This offered a chance to make a thriller around these kind of events and Split Second represents the attempt of transforming filmnoir from its usual big city milieus to a deserted town in Nevada under the fear of the war. Three men have just escaped from prison unaware of the nuclear experiments of the government. Soon the group of three takes a few hostages in result of getting a doctor because one of the escapees is injured. As time goes on in the deserted town the hostages start to lose their morality and the time before the explosion is running out.The aesthetics of filmnoir were often related to big cities like New York or Los Angeles and exotic milieus were always part of the genre but usually they meant bars in Chinatown motels of Arabia or the cold streets of Shanghai. In 1950's many tried to transform filmnoir to new milieus to snowy conditions On Dangerous Ground to the narrow halls of a train The Narrow Margin and to the back seats of a car The HitchHiker. To me Split Second represents the attempt of transforming filmnoir to deserted towns which The HitchHiker 1953 did as well but Split Second also tried to bring filmnoir to the Atomic Age.There's no question whether this is a high quality noir or a Bclass film. The latter can be seen in its conventional direction low budget and it has got a great number of unknown actors. But the way I see it Split Second is alongside with all the bclass Mitchum films one of the bests. It's a great example of Cold War films and how the Atomic Age affected cinema. It's an entertaining thriller but also a fine survey of the disappearance of morality.".

It's like High Noon with claustrophobia and an atom bombthe majority of the film is set in a single cabin and the characters have nothing to do but deal with each other as the threat of death looms closer and closer.Unsurprisingly the characters' characters ultimately decide their final fate as they all try to socially compromise some fatally and some ineffectually and some with surprise chain effects. It's everything that a wellmade low budget survivalist movie can be and then a friggin' atomic bomb goes off! What more could you need? I was extremely tired while watching this movie but it woke me up like a cup of good coffee. It's amazingly compelling multivaried and unpredictable. I especially like how the production code constraints on one of the seduction scenes created a harrowing horror effect for the unnaive viewer we know what happened but we don't really know what happened. And the characters have some real surprises to give beyond their type keeping the drama fresh and relentless and the clock ticks nearer to doomsday.

Yet despite this being a very familiar sort of film there is enough going for it to make it well worth your while.The film begins with a jailbreak. The nation's most wanted man has escaped and he and two other crooks are hiding in the desertnear the nuclear testing grounds in Nevada. Along the way they take several prisoners and plan on hiding out in the test area until just before the explosion. However naturally things don't go quite as planned.As I said above the idea of a bunch of crooks terrorizing a group of hostages is certainly not new. However three main things make this worth while. First the nuclear angle is newand REALLY pays off great at the end of the film. In fact the ending is great. Second Steven McNally is a familiar face as a noir heavyand here he is at his snarling best. Third despite McNally's great performance I really loved the character played by Alexis Smiththere is nothing like it and you just have to see what I mean. So what you have is a very taut film packed with nice performances and a knockout ending. I might rate it higher but as I said it's a bit familiar and the middle portion is a bit talky. Still....see this film.".

The illiterate chief of a gang of marauding cavalry men is portrayed as a noble protector of the common folk and a brave soldier a menace to the evil White Army. Interestingly enough this 1930s war epic is mostly famous not for its Communist propaganda nothing else can really be expected from Soviet movies of that period or its realistic portrayal of the Civil War battles but for a countless number of jokes and anecdotes about the movie heroes. In that sense Chapayev has become a huge part of the Russian street folklore and one of the most famous Soviet movies ever made. Vassiliy Ivanovich Petka Anka the last two's romance is an interesting subplot in the film and even the stoic Furmanov are laughed at by millions and millions of Russians for God knows how long now. As for the movie itself it is far from a comedy although there are some lighthearted moments mainly dealing with Chapayev's illiteracy and Petka's flirt with Anka. It may not be 100 true to history or to Furmanov's accounts for example the reallife Petka died a much more gruesome death than his movie counterpart but it is an interesting look at the Civil War and one of its most legendary figures.".

It's inescapably heroworship and commendably given that it is hero worship it does not try to portray its hero as immaculate. Chapaev is proud shorttempered and ignorant of politics and history. But this played against his advantages only serves to make him more of a hero. It easy to see why this film became very popular  it's goodhumored politicallycorrect for its political context and appeals to existing conceptions of a popular hero.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd long known about the Russian Revolution but was unfamiliar with the Russian Civil War until I came upon this film in a class I am taking in Russian culture and cinema. The epic changes in Russia wrought by the Bolsheviks engendered the wrath of many we were told by our professor and this film shows some of the conflict between the more ragtag Bolshevikaligned Reds and the Whites who enjoyed such amenities as maps uniforms and financial support from the US and other foreign powers. We meet Chapayev as a man entirely devoted to his troops a simplespoken but clearminded peasant who demonstrates his battle strategy by maneuvering potatoes on a table. In a couple of moving subplots we meet Chapayev's most trusted aide and his lady love a machinegun operator. The aide refuses to leave Chapayev's side even when the enemy brings out its most formidable tank. In another side story the longtime orderly of an emotionless WhiteRussian officer fails to gain clemency for his brother a deserter who is eventually executed with ramrods  so he too deserts  to the warmer Chapayev camp where combattants pass their down time singing in unison. Chapayev seems strangely tranquil and meditative on his last night on earth. His death scene along with that of his righthand man are deeply moving. Throughout the film we observe the juxtaposition of placid nature scenes and man's exchange of brutality with man. In the climactic battle scene the superior numbers and discipline of the White side are displayed stunningly as soldiers in formation march on Chapayev's band of underdogs. I have read that in Russia this most popular of Soviet films is the source of many jokes. I'm not sure why. This portrait of Chapayev as the consummate leader is deeply moving. However there is some colorful speech that even a Westerner can appreciate. When for example did you last hear enema injector hurled as an insult? This deeply atmospheric film starts slowly but builds in strength. Highly recommended!".

We meet Chapayev as a man entirely devoted to his troops a simplespoken but clearminded peasant who demonstrates his battle strategy by maneuvering potatoes on a table. In a couple of moving subplots we meet Chapayev's most trusted aide and his lady love a machinegun operator. The aide refuses to leave Chapayev's side even when the enemy brings out its most formidable tank. In another side story the longtime orderly of an emotionless WhiteRussian officer fails to gain clemency for his brother a deserter who is eventually executed with ramrods  so he too deserts  to the warmer Chapayev camp where combattants pass their down time singing in unison. Chapayev seems strangely tranquil and meditative on his last night on earth. His death scene along with that of his righthand man are deeply moving. Throughout the film we observe the juxtaposition of placid nature scenes and man's exchange of brutality with man. In the climactic battle scene the superior numbers and discipline of the White side are displayed stunningly as soldiers in formation march on Chapayev's band of underdogs. I have read that in Russia this most popular of Soviet films is the source of many jokes. I'm not sure why. This portrait of Chapayev as the consummate leader is deeply moving. However there is some colorful speech that even a Westerner can appreciate. When for example did you last hear enema injector hurled as an insult? This deeply atmospheric film starts slowly but builds in strength. Highly recommended!";

There are a few contrived bits and the end is rushed still its 80 minutes well spent. The highest praise I can think of is if you're like me you'll probably wish there was more with this character.

It could've easily been filler but Zinnemann has too much respect for his craft and the material to allow that to happen.As others have pointed out that dog really is something and nearly steals the show but Arnold is every bit as good. He is particularly amusing in his role within a role where he pretends to be an eccentric illtempered uncle in order to foil the bad guys' dastardly scheme. And that scheme is a big time McGuffin no more than an obviously slight excuse to get all the conflicting characters under one roof.  Arnold's Cat  Mouse games with main villains Katherine Emery resembling Mercedes McCambridge both in looks and delivery and overeducated butler Stanley Ridges are tense and clever.Zinnemann really shines in one ingenious scene set in a pitch dark basement. Arnold playing a super smart blind sleuth growls In the dark! In my kingdom now! and proceeds to outwit a trigger happy thug.  Not unlike the Coen brothers' Blood Simple 45 years later the only light is provided by a number of randomly fired gunshots. Not surprisingly this technique is effectively taut and unnerving. If you weren't aware who the director was at that point it's the sort of thing that makes you go running to your film guide thinking Whoa. Who directed this?".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd never heard of this film but discovered it bundled in with a lot of other 30s40s Bmovies in the Mystery Classics collection from Platinum Video. It's a surprisingly good film really a neargreat film that's hobbled a bit by it's middle act.The first part of the film is really the only part that's a straightforward detective romp w a blind detective and his seeingeyedog and his hired muscle simpleton helping him sleuth out a fairly typical wrongfullyaccusedmurder plot. This part of the film is all golden partially I think because the Detective's characters All intended to be recurring characters in an ongoing film franchise that never quite got off the ground after this really good first chapter feel like they have a past together they feel like they know who they are which is unusual for a potboiler of this era.The second act resolves the murder a bit too quickly  in fact it's never exactly resolved the film merely abruptly changes focus from the detective et al to the murderers themselves discussing why they did it. This robs the film of most of it's dramatic strength and essentially the middle act becomes little more than filler. It's entertaining enough filler  a sort of World War II version of Wait Until Dark  but it doesn't really advance the plot much.The third act is the somewhatrushed climaxresolution though it features an unexpectedly cool shootout filmed in a very unusual style and extended sequence with the detective's amazinglywelltrained dog. Seriously this dog is great! He could easily do his own taxes. He makes any other trained film dog  and really most trained film monkeys  look like idiots by comparison. On the whole the film ends well but it never fully recovers the momentum it lost by shifting focus in the middle and as a result the final wrap up just comes across as slightly unsatisfying. It is however a more than satisfying introduction to what no doubt would have been a great detective series which sadly never really took off. I'm very surprised the concept was never revisited on TV or Radio since the central character is endlessly entertaining.One odd note the ending feels a bit truncated with some of the action happening offcamera. For instance early on one of the bad guys is captured and held by the detective's men. Later on we're shown the detective's men bound and gagged the bad guy having evidently escaped. Later the bad guy reunites with his own people but the transition is so abrupt that it feels like we're missing a scene or two. Also there's a subplot in which the bad guys are hiding family information from one of their own people. This sets up what is obviously intended to be a major plot point but in the end absolutely nothing comes of it. Again is this a missing scene or simply bad writing? I can't tell.Still and all this is a nearclassic film with a great character and some fantastic performances that unfortunately hobbles itself. Well worth a viewing however.".

On the whole the film ends well but it never fully recovers the momentum it lost by shifting focus in the middle and as a result the final wrap up just comes across as slightly unsatisfying. It is however a more than satisfying introduction to what no doubt would have been a great detective series which sadly never really took off. I'm very surprised the concept was never revisited on TV or Radio since the central character is endlessly entertaining.One odd note the ending feels a bit truncated with some of the action happening offcamera. For instance early on one of the bad guys is captured and held by the detective's men. Later on we're shown the detective's men bound and gagged the bad guy having evidently escaped. Later the bad guy reunites with his own people but the transition is so abrupt that it feels like we're missing a scene or two. Also there's a subplot in which the bad guys are hiding family information from one of their own people. This sets up what is obviously intended to be a major plot point but in the end absolutely nothing comes of it. Again is this a missing scene or simply bad writing? I can't tell.Still and all this is a nearclassic film with a great character and some fantastic performances that unfortunately hobbles itself. Well worth a viewing however.";

Rathbone is totally associated with the series of Sherlock Holmes movies that he starred in. Arnold never had a series role like that although his performance as Captain Duncan Maclaine in this film did lead to a sequel a few years later. But Arnold was an actor in such a large demand that he never really needed to be a series role. Yet he could have been in one prior to EYES IN THE NIGHT. In 1935 he played Nero Wolfe in MEET NERO WOLFE and did a splendid job as the orchid growing gourmand and genius. But when a sequel was made called THE LEAGUE OF FRIGHTENED MEN Walter Conolly played the detective.As with other genres certain names will always be recognized by the public in the hall of fame of detective story writers. Baynard Kendrick's novels about retired New York Police Captain Duncan Maclaine were quite popular in the years of World War II but have been supplanted by other writers since. To be fair Kendrick's stories were not the first to have a brilliant blind detective. The Max Carrados tales of Ernest Bramah written in the teens through the 1930s were there first. Kendrick basically brought the idea over to the U.S. and added a police detective background to his hero. This gave Maclaine an edge over types like Carrados. The New York City Police and the other departments have heard of him and respect him as a colleague. Not quite like dealing with a brilliant amateur who shows them up.In the present film Arnold is approached by Donna Reed about threats to her following the murder of a fellow actor. He with the assistance of his trained dog and his aide Allan Jenkins pursues the clues until he finds they lead to a Nazi spy ring with Stanley Ridges among it's leaders. In keeping with the war effort Arnold takes on the ring and demolishes it. He has a secret weapon the pity or contempt that the Nazis have for 1 Americans and 2 blind people. The key to his success is when he demonstrates to a goon watching him that he is far more with it than this nitwit thinks. Taking out a deck of cards Arnold smiles that jovial grin of his and says Haven't you ever been told never play cards with a blind man? He then demonstrates that he is a whiz at solitaire which surprises the goon and then he knocks out the goon. Bravo Edward!!".

My guess is that if Arnold were an MGM contract player the screen might have seen more of the resourceful Duncan MacLain.Blindness as it has in a lot of people has forced Duncan MacLain to rely on those remaining senses and has honed his intelligence to a fine edge. He thinks pretty fast on his feet especially after being hired by Ann Harding gains entrance to her household while she's away by convincing her servants that he's a long lost blind uncle. It's from there he finds out what's going on.Harding hires Arnold because she's concerned that her step daughter Donna Reed is getting in way over her head with actor John Emery. When Emery turns up dead later that's an understatement.But when Arnold gets into the household and sees what an interesting group of servants Harding and husband Reginald Denny have he's thinking that romance might not just be at the bottom of this mystery.Aided by filmdom's most remarkable dog since Rin Tin Tin in the canine of Friday MacLain is also aided for strong arm stuff by his driver Allen Jenkins. Although as you will see in the film Arnold when he gets in close is every bit up to the rough house aspect of the gumshoe profession.The cast is excellent especially butler Stanley Ridges who becomes Arnold's opposite number in terms of wit and intelligence. A worthy Moriarty type to Arnold's Holmes. It's too bad that film never saw more of Duncan MacLain.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edward Arnold plays blind detective Duncan Maclain in Eyes in the Night a 1942 MGM film directed by Fred Zinnemann that has a lot of other familiar faces. Ann Harding made her return to the screen after a few years in this small film playing the stepmother Norma Lawry of a young actress Barbara Donna Reed at 21 who's fallen in love with an older actor with whom Harding was once involved. She wants Mac to help her convince the actor it's best to steer clear of Barbara. Norma's husband is in Washington presenting a formula to the government that is critical to the war effort.Unfortunately the actor turns up dead and Barbara sees not only his dead body but her stepmother when she arrives at the man's apartment. Norma goes running to Mac for help. He sets out to find the killer and it leads him into a web of espionage.Nice job by Zinnemann who was just starting out though he didn't like doing the film except for working with Ann Harding and Donna Reed. As others have mentioned his pitch black gun battle with the only light coming from the fired shots is most effective and portends the great things to come from him. Overall it's an okay story well done.Edward Arnold does an excellent job though Zinnemann said he kept blowing his lines as the smart and likable blind detective who is aided by an assistant Allen Jenkins and his dog Friday who looks to be a German shepherd mix. Friday is unbelievable  what an actor and athlete! That dog had some training. Zimmemann didn't agree. Friday who was descended from a silent dog star named Flash apparently was only good for one take becoming bored easily. In fact Friday's only film appearances are in the two Duncan Maclain films. Besides Reed one can spot Rosemary DeCamp as Vera the maid Stanley Ridges as the butler Stephen McNally as Vera's husband Gabriel Mantan Moreland as Mac's butler and I honestly thought Katherine Emery WAS Mercedes MacCambridge. Wow! Even the speaking voice. This was intended as a series for MGM but the studio only made one other. Universal took the fat man detective series from the radio and made a film with J. Scott Smart with an early appearance by Rock Hudson directed by William Castle but never followed it up. Nevertheless there's something about these fat detectives going back to Nero Wolfe I guess that's appealing.Enjoyable. Glad Friday was able to keep his date after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fred Zinnemann's early directorial career yielded many interesting films and this is one of them. Here Zinnemann directs the young Donna Reed who plays a character who is appallingly arrogant spoilt and pigheaded very convincingly and eleven years later in 'From Here to Eternity' 1953 he would turn to her again for a part where she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The main character in the film is a blind detective Duncan Maclain played to perfection by Edward Arnold. He has a seeingeye dog Friday who responds to the most complex commands opens doors by turning the door handles with his teeth leaps out of basements through high windows and does many impossible things. Dog lovers will be fascinated by this film. There are some hilarious scenes between the dog and Arnold's butler played by Mantan Moreland where the butler is constantly having his job taken away from him by the dog Friday fetches his master's slippers before the butler can reach the closet etc. The haunted looks of Ann Harding are good for her part her eyes dreamy and distant her complexion pale all good mystery stuff. There is an eerie chill cast by the excellent performance of Katherine Emery with strong lesbian implications as she looks at Donna Reed in 'a certain way'. The scenes where Edward Arnold searches for clues in the dark because being blind he does not need light are highly effective. As an early wartime thriller with a certain relevance to the dangers of 'the enemy' this film avoids being hackneyed and is fresh and stands on its own transcending any propaganda aspects. What less would be expect from Fred Zinnemann?".

She does a good job although the role doesn't really allow her to flourish. And then we have Edward Arnold a really fascinating face from Hollywood's golden age who is perhaps most familiar to audiences as a series of nearidentical crafty businessmen in Frank Capra pictures. He turns up here because supporting players from Afeatures were sometimes given lead roles in Bfeatures. He softens his curmudgeonly persona into a character you implicitly like and trust and makes an ideal if unconventional hero.Eyes in the Night is notable for being an early directorial assignment for Fred Zinnemann. The young director seems to be strong on ideas but poor on execution. He goes to lengths to make us accept the dog as a character giving it plenty of closeups. He seems to have had trouble imagining how everything will fit together in the edit though and sometimes the angles of opposing shots look a bit confusing when put together. His main tack seems to be to saturate every shot in a feeling of claustrophobia with visible ceilings props in the foreground and an obsession with shadows obligingly created by cinematographer Robert Planck. The overall impression is of a surreal nightmare world from which there are no exits an effect used in many film noirs of this era and the horrors made at RKO. The dark atmosphere is laid on incredibly thickly and strictly speaking this is not even a noir but it doesn't particularly matter because this is not a picture that gets too close to reality in the first place and a bit of overstatement doesn't go amiss.Eyes in the Night is cheap cheerful... and did I mention silly? And yet it's enjoyable. I actually prefer this to any of Alfred Hitchcock's very prestigious nazispy thrillers which were certainly far better made. You see a picture's problems are relative to its scope. Big picture big flaws. Trivial picture trivial flaws. It doesn't matter that it is nonsense from start to finish. If you allow yourself to be drawn into its world nonsense can be fun.".

Once at the apartment she finds the man dead and the step daughter catches her there and believes that she did the killing. The mother goes to her blind detective friend Edward Arnold who starts to investigate and learns that German spies were behind it. This was the first of a two part series for MGM and I'm really not sure why more weren't made as both proved to be good films. This film features a very attractive cast a nice story and some very good direction by Zinnemann which makes this a must see for fans of detective movies. Arnold is very good in his role making it very believable that his character is actually blind. The actor plays the part very well and has good chemistry with everyone in the cast. Harding comes off quite strong as well even though her character isn't the best written in the film. Stephen McNally Katherine Emery Allen Jenkins and Reginald Denny all add nice supporting performances as well. Reed actually steals the show as the 17yearold step daughter with an attitude. Her attitude is so dead pan perfect that you'll have no problem hating the young lady who thinks she knows everything. Mantan Moreland is wasted in his few scenes though. The German subplot just works itself into the story and there's never a spotlight shined on it due to WW2 which is a nice twist for this type of film. Most movies from this era beat the war stuff to death but this film stays away from that.".

Yet together with his seeingeye dog Friday and a human sidekick Maclain investigates a murder and unmasks the villain.The story's underlying premise is weak and timebound having little relevance post WWII. But the antics of Friday the dog combined with Arnold's fine and at times hammy performance compensates for the weak story. That dog is something else. More than merely posing with humanlike expressions and responding to human chatter he fetches shoes and guns uses doorknobs to open doors and improvises a clever way to escape a basement.I would have liked the film more if it had been a whodunit. As is there's not a lot of mystery or suspense. The villain is identified in the first half. The ending is a bit of a disappointment.Although the source material is a novel the script and visuals compare to a stage play with most scenes set indoors and containing quite a bit of dialogue. But some of the banter is fresh and interesting like when blind Maclian tells the butler Hansen And Hansen turn out the light will you I think I'll read awhile.Sets are a bit cheap looking composed mostly of drab wood with minimal artifacts. Lighting trends dark. One long scene near the end is filmed in total blackness. Of course that's consistent with a great theme that of being able to perceive without physical sight. The intermittent background music is dreary and nondescript. A topnotch cast including wonderful Mantan Moreland helps the production. Overall acting is fine especially that of Edward Arnold.It's not a terrific film. Yet despite a weak story premise and a lack of mystery Eyes In The Night has enough going for it to make it enjoyable not the least of which is that dog. The film will appeal especially to viewers who like detective stories of the 1940s.".

Anyway the real star is Edward Arnold as the blind detective Duncan Maclain who's not above creating some scenes himself as he tries to both solve a murder and uncover a Nazi scheme with the able assist of his dog Friday. Directed by eventual master filmmaker Fred Zinnemann he provides enough atmosphere that makes this movie rise a little above its Bmovie roots. There's also some amusements from sidekicks Allen Jenkins and Mantan Moreland with the latter just two years away from being Charlie Chan's regular manservant Birmingham Brown.

	schema:headline " So you see my dear you killed a man for nothing.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a fairly inventive little drama with a play on words title that effectively describes it's lead character Duncan Maclain Edward Arnold a blind detective. It starts out with a murder but evolves into something of an espionage thriller when Nazi agents reveal their intent to steal a scientist's new invention that will prove useful in the war effort. Charlie Chan would get involved in both types of stories so the hook seemed to be a pretty good one.Being blind was obviously no handicap for Big Mac as Arnold's character got a lot of mileage out of being a blustery blowhard upon arriving at the Lawry homestead.

Charlie Chan would get involved in both types of stories so the hook seemed to be a pretty good one.Being blind was obviously no handicap for Big Mac as Arnold's character got a lot of mileage out of being a blustery blowhard upon arriving at the Lawry homestead.

Oh there is the standard white cane but more than that the main character uses a blind watch where the glass face lifts up so he can feel the position of the hands in order to tell time.He also uses a braille writer in either this one or the sequel The Blind Eye 1945 where he plays the same character in a less interesting film.

	schema:headline " The best classic spaghetti western in the Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood trilogy!";
	schema:reviewBody "For a Few Dollars More 1965 is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite personal classic western flicks ever! It is my third favorite in The Man with No Name Trilogy. I grew up watching this film and it was the first Clint Eastwood western movie I ever saw I fall immediately in love with it and I just love this movie. It is Sergio Leone's best western film of all time my favorite. It is entraining and brilliant western flick with a great original epic story great cast and the acting is fantastic. You have a great shoot outs the music score is original epic. I always enjoy this film. It is my favorite Eastwood western movie. In my opinion It is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood's classic film that they ever made together. Westerns like this film doesn't exit this days anymore. I have enjoyed For a Few Dollars More a lot. I love this one to death. The film is very entertained is not boring and It has a good plot and story to tell. The characters the action shooting sequences are just amazing and awesome. Sergio Leone does what he wanted to do with the film and become one of the greatest epic classic western movies. I love this movie to death and it is my favorite film! There are other western films that Clint Eastwood made and directed but this one will be one of his best films in the history ever.The first film was more about one hero but in this film there are two heroes. The bullets the shooting is outstanding. The gun fights are awesome. This is a Western that simply delivers the goods and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood to the scenes in El Paso and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling as well as in his use of the camera.The film is intelligent when Col. Douglas Mortimer suggested that the way to break the gang will be easy with one man from the inside of the gang Monco  because his younger. The story telling from El Indio about a carpenter who made a big closet were the safe was hiding in it was just plain brilliant.Monco breaks one of Indio's friends out of prison and is admitted to the gang to prove his loyalty was awesome. The watch that Indio opens during the gun fight scenes and when the song stops by the watch he draw his gun and shoot anyone in the gun fight with him that was so awesome. The last showdown between Col. Douglas Mortimer and El Indio when the song stopped was TERRIFIC!Why I love this movie? Simply because of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. I love Lee Van Cleef so much in here because he plays the good guy he kills bunch of outlaws whit his riffle. He befriends Monco and he kills El Inido on the end. He doesn't split the reward with Monco  but he lets him have it the money on a honest way. Clint Eastwood as Monco did a fantastic job in one of his best performances as Bounty Killer Monco. He also kills bunch of outlaws he also shoot Mortimer's hat he never shoots an Innocent or unarmed person that is why I love this actor and his character so much. Gian Maria Volont did a good job on another style he also never shoot unarmed person he only did that once for a women he fall in love. Mortimer's sister on the end of the film it was reveled why Col. Douglas Mortimer was hunting El Indio and his gang. He was doing it for both Justice and Revenge while Monco just wanted to get money and become rich but he changed his mind after he saw how Indio is evil and cruel person. The gun fight between Col. Douglas Mortimer and Juan Wild  The Hunchback  Klaus Kinski in the bar was fantastic! How Col. Douglas Mortimer killed him. I love this film to death I love it! Sergio Leone did a fantastic job directing this awesome flick in fact I think it is his masterpiece. The film that changed the western movies today and I love the music score from Ennio Morricone. The dialogue and the script was amazing the weapons used in this film are awesome and they are used well. Action is plenty in the film.What else do you want in an spaghetti Western film like this at all?! The fact is this is the greatest western ever made in the history. I love this film to death! It is my third favorite film in the Dollars trilogy. This movie is a perfect 10 it is my personal favorite western movie.".

Not only the films looked grittier violent and realistic the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. Per Qualche Dollaro in pi For a few dollars more is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of alltime.For a Few Dollars More the second in the socalled Dollars trilogy a group of films by Leone with the same style is the story of two different yet very similar men Manco Clint Eastwood and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer Lee Van Cleef are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named El Indio Gian Maria Volont. An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward but are these two killers after Indio for the same reason? Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns both Manco and the Colonel have welldeveloped attitudes motivations and purposes they are neither completely good nor completely bad they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm it is probably the best structured of the Trilogy and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.Stylistically the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. For a Few Dollars More is a violent tale of two hunters and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths the Westerns never felt this real.Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world however the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volont as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.Per qualche dollaro in pi is a near flawless movie as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing but fortunately it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film. Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the trilogy is the best and while personally I prefer The Good the Bad and the Ugly over this one it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 1010".

	schema:headline " One of my favorite westerns a fitting middle section to the Dollars trilogy";
	schema:reviewBody "As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works Fistful of Dollars which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness and The Good the Bad and the Ugly which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs. But taken as a film unto itself aside from its place in the trilogy this is a Western that simply delivers the goods and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. The story begins by introducing our two anti heroes bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer Cleef former Colonel and Monco Eastwood a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio Volonte who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason reward money though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood to the scenes in El Paso and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico deserts For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling as well as in his use of the camera.

	onyx:emotionText "As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works Fistful of Dollars which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness and The Good the Bad and the Ugly which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs. But taken as a film unto itself aside from its place in the trilogy this is a Western that simply delivers the goods and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. The story begins by introducing our two anti heroes bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer Cleef former Colonel and Monco Eastwood a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio Volonte who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason reward money though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood to the scenes in El Paso and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico deserts For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful's cameraman Massimo Dallamano Leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters each look in a scene whether it's intense waiting for guns to be drawn or just regular conversation the look of the film draws the viewer in without overdoing it.

In fact Leone's Dollars trilogy actually have no connection with each other and Eastwood's socalled Man With No Name actually has many! In this movie Monco in the previous one Joe. Most people seem go for 'The Good The Bad And The Ugly' as the best of the three movies but I think 'For A Few Dollars More' just beats it. Anyway there's no argument that they are three brilliant films Eastwood is super cool in all of them Leone is on top form particularly in this one and Ennio Morricone's scores are amazing stuff. 'For A Few Dollars More' is helped enormously by Lee Van Cleef playing Colonel Mortimer and the scenes between him and Eastwood and the ones between him and Klaus Kinski are pure gold. This is not only one of the best westerns ever made but one of the best movies of any genre released in the 1960s. It was also a highly influential one. I can't imagine Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' for example existing without Leone. Words fail me praising movies as brilliant as this one. All I can say is WATCH IT NOW. Or if you've already seen it WATCH IT AGAIN!".

The music's almost a major character in this film in fact. Stylistically iconic this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus we really come to like the coheroes Van Cleef and Eastwood  we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain  his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violencefueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre Volonte's performance rises above the film's genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don't see in many films. But so did Van Cleef whose work in this film is incredible. You'd have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a Few Dollars More is the middle film of Sergio Leone's classic western trilogy starring a then upstart Clint Eastwood. Sandwiched between A Fistful of Dollars and the finale The Good the Bad  the Ugly. This film provides further insight into Eastwood's Man with No Name.Eastwood is a bounty killer who is in search of the feared bandit known as El Indio. Colonel Douglas Mortimer played by Lee Van Cleef is in a similar position and the two cross paths many times in their pursuits of El Indio. The premise has similarities to that of the first and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary. The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective not mine one might say that the gunfights are plain slow and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of More can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of The Score or The Italian Job.This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame and one can see his starmaking charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age. The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them and they deliver. The cinematography of More follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of Fistful. While one might not notice anything revolutionary now at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the lowangles utilized prior to a few shootouts as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns and they originated here.Ennio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film. Bottom Line While it might not seem as great now so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10.".

The reason is as i pointed out in my other post is that Clint's role or character is better when he has a good supporting member because it gives Clint's character more depth as well as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent in his role i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising to see him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their own styles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth to this one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In a fistful of dollars Gian didn't have much depth at all and some of the characters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the characters into each other in this one having all of their stories somehow play a role in the other ones. If you haven't seen this movie i suggest you watch Leone's films in chronological order with A fistful of dollars first this one second and finish it off with the good the bad the ugly.

	schema:headline " The Best of The Dollars Trilogy and quite possibly Leone's finest film.";
	schema:reviewBody "For a Few Dollars More has become the template for which most Spaghetti Westerns derive. As Leone went along his films got more daring and complex exploring new ideas and raising not only the bar for Spaghetti Westerns which contrary to popular belief were around before A Fistful of Dollars but for Westerns in general. However this exploration at times affected the quality of his films. Leone was a popcorn director  a visual stylist who always entertained first and maybe provoked a thought or two second. However his films were never think pieces so when he tried to integrate depth into his films the results became uneven. For a Few Dollars More is his best film because it catches Leone in his most transitional period. At once the film is more complex and stylized than A Fistful... and more tight and efficient than The Good the Bad and The Ugly which is almost on par with For a Few.... The revenge subplot involving Colonel Mortimer is more compelling than the similar one in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West because Mortimer is more developed as a character than the Harmonica Player which is not to insult the great Charles Bronson. And hell it has Lee Van Cleef as one of the biggest badasses of all time. The mere presence of Colonel Douglas Mortimer elevates the film to a new level. He steals the film from Manco completely. And Van Cleef's theft of the film is what makes it a cut above A Fistful.... As a character The Man With No Name who in actuality has three Joe Manco and Blondie isn't very interesting and there always needs to be a counterpoint to play off of him. That's why A Fistful... isn't nearly as good as this film or The Good... which had the great Eli Wallach in one of the best scenery munching performances ever.So in closing For a Few... is a tight masterpiece of fluff Western entertainment. It's mean violent and immoral just the way any good Spaghetti Western should be.".

As Leone went along his films got more daring and complex exploring new ideas and raising not only the bar for Spaghetti Westerns which contrary to popular belief were around before A Fistful of Dollars but for Westerns in general. However this exploration at times affected the quality of his films. Leone was a popcorn director  a visual stylist who always entertained first and maybe provoked a thought or two second. However his films were never think pieces so when he tried to integrate depth into his films the results became uneven. For a Few Dollars More is his best film because it catches Leone in his most transitional period. At once the film is more complex and stylized than A Fistful... and more tight and efficient than The Good the Bad and The Ugly which is almost on par with For a Few.... The revenge subplot involving Colonel Mortimer is more compelling than the similar one in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West because Mortimer is more developed as a character than the Harmonica Player which is not to insult the great Charles Bronson. And hell it has Lee Van Cleef as one of the biggest badasses of all time. The mere presence of Colonel Douglas Mortimer elevates the film to a new level. He steals the film from Manco completely. And Van Cleef's theft of the film is what makes it a cut above A Fistful.... As a character The Man With No Name who in actuality has three Joe Manco and Blondie isn't very interesting and there always needs to be a counterpoint to play off of him. That's why A Fistful... isn't nearly as good as this film or The Good... which had the great Eli Wallach in one of the best scenery munching performances ever.So in closing For a Few... is a tight masterpiece of fluff Western entertainment. It's mean violent and immoral just the way any good Spaghetti Western should be.";

Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson's in Once Upon a Time in the West.  He is menacing and sympathetic whereas in The Good the Bad and the Ugly he is just campy and all bad guy but still fun.  What makes both performances so memorable I think is that Van Cleef seems to be in touch with Leone's dark humor where Eastwood is used as a straight man.  Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man.  A much better film than most people who've seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probably realize  you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a Few Dollars More the middle installment of the iconic Sergio LeoneClint Eastwood Dollars trilogy is the most brutal of all three films. Throughout the movie ruthless bounty hunters all of who seem to have no respect for human life often perform coldblooded murders. The bounty hunters use the wild west as a free range they track they kill and they collect.One of these bounty hunters happens to be The Man with No Name Eastwood who returns to us now after his introduction in A Fistful of Dollars which was the first movie of the trilogy. An interesting observation is that the man with no name actually does have a name in each installment  here his name is Manco but this is a fact that is often forgotten.The Man with No NameManco is on a mission to find the criminal Indio Gian Maria Volont whose capture is worth a large sum of money. It is quickly set up that local law enforcement is weak. Sheriffs are cowards. Only the vicious bounty hunters know how to drag in the criminals dead or alive. Along for the journey is a fellow bounty hunter named Mortimer Lee Van Cleef whose own reasons for seeking the man differ from Manco's. At first the two killers go their own separate ways and then decide to team up together and improve their chances of finding Indio  despite the fact that their intentions for his capture are different.Not only are the two men's intentions different but also their methods. Mortimer is a ruthless coldblooded murderer whose selfconfidence is revealed through his barbaric actions. Manco the hero is less of a murderer and more of a law enforcer. Leone quickly sets this up through a sequence of shots Mortimer's introduction for example begins with his search for a criminal which finally comes to a finish as Mortimer confronts the man who is hiding in a brothel. His foe manages to escape through a window leaping onto a horse and galloping away through town. The images that follow reveal an insight into Mortimer's own selfconfidence and startlingly calm nature.Manco's appearance is even more dramatic. He tracks down his own victim and corners him in a saloon only to see three cowboys appear out of nowhere and block off all exits. In one quick motion he swings around and fires three successive shots each bullet finding its target.Here it is established that Manco is an underdog therefore our story's hero. He isn't as ruthless as Mortimer who mercilessly picks his prey off from a distance and his actions are somewhat admirable. The cowboys who tried to kill him were the bad guys. Manco was the good guy.Its lesser admirers often describe the film as being too long. It's true that the film contains some unnecessary scenes and these are often dragged out for dramatic effect  but that is the point. The movie directed by one of cinema's most ambitious and visionary directors Sergio Leone 1929  1989 is all about long passages of closeups and widelense shots. Along with its predecessor and particularly its sequel the Dollars trilogy revolutionized the derogatory spaghetti western description. In the years to come Hollywood would actually aim to create films similar to the Dollars movies  all of which were inferior. The entire Dollars trilogy has such scope and ambition that its Hollywood counterparts pale in comparison.Leone's direction is magnificent and would later inspire  of all people  Quentin Tarantino whose Kill Bill movies owe something to the Dollars trilogy. Long wide lenses and extreme closeups only accentuate the fear of the men. There is a particular sequence of shots that clips back and forth between Mortimer and a wanted notice pinned to the exterior of a building. Leone slowly builds up the backandforth shots until they burst into a pattern of superspeed images distinctly closed with the sound of gunshots. It's this sort of blazing distinct style that makes the film so infectious and enjoyable.The acting cannot be criticized although the English dubbing is sometimes rather laughable. Eastwood is one of the only actors whose voice is not dubbed  but he rarely speaks. His face does all the talking. Lee Van Cleef who was recast by Leone as a separate character in The Good the Bad and the Ugly manages to turn Mortimer into one of the quintessential bad guys of cinema. Although the dubbing can occasionally detract from the flow of scenes and dialogue the two lead performances by Eastwood and Van Cleef more than compensate for this slight flaw.Hollywood was cautious about releasing Dollars. Eastwood known for his role in the television series Rawhide was the only marketable star. The director was an unknown Italian with no commercial successes. As its predecessor before it For a Few Dollars More was delayed release in the States where it was deemed unworthy.However the movie was a huge success in Italy in particular Clint Eastwood quickly gained a cult fan base overseas but it was not until May 1967  after the US release of The Good the Bad and the Ugly  that For a Few Dollars More and its predecessor would open to critical accolade and deserved celebration in the United States. Now almost forty years later it's still a fascinating piece of classic cinema.".

To which he's asked to try that trick again which prompts Van Cleef to utter another one of my all time lines  I generally don't smoke 'til after I've eaten why don't you come back in five minutes.  Just typing this brings smiles to my face. I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon with Robert Wilke and Kansas City Confidential with Jack Elam and Neville Brand! and this wasis the movie that made him a star.  Granted it didn't last for long but he did have his 15 minutes.  This is my favorite Spaghetti Western it was also my first didn't see Fistful until much later  and Good Bad Ugly was a major disappointment  I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role.  And the music especially the pipe organ just blows my mind.  Highly enjoyable think I'll go and watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergio Leone's sophomore film in his Spaghetti Western trilogy and is a major step up from A Fistful of Dollars. This was a film that didn't appeal to me the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.For A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes and rewards and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough even though Eastwood's character is the main star the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.Sergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes. Leone has definitely have gained much more confidence going towards this film as the film doesn't feel as indulgent as the first and seemed to show much more enjoyment with the story than the first film. This film's budget was much higher than the first film which allowed him to create settings that feel real and lively.Massimo Dallamano is back as the cinematographer of this film. The film looks much better than the first film and this may be due to the increase in budget and shot at better locations or it could be due to Dallamano and Leone has a much better understanding of what they want for this film. The film still retains that style from the first film with close ups that take it's time to move things along but it's much more improved here as they have used different angles and techniques in constructing these shots allowing them to feel fresh. Dallamano has the camera move in this film much more than the first. The first film has it's shots set up in a way that doesn't require the camera to move or zoom into anything. This movement makes the film move faster and exciting.Ennio Morricone comes back to do the score for this film and it's just as great as the first one. The score here sounds much more fuller and dramatic this may be due to a much larger story and much more characters focused on. Morricone's score here may not be as memorable as the first or third film but it definitely fits with what is shown on screen and it doesn't feel recycled. The film's score feels fast and upbeat which sound great in moments of the film that have characters riding their horses on the beautiful backdrops. Morricone also has a much lighter and smaller track that plays during the build up of climax the music that comes from the lockets. It sounds beautiful and it connects with the emotional weight during these situations.The film's cast is much bigger in this film and the film is now shared with three characters rather than a main focus on Eastwood. Clint Eastwood is great here as expected but not as memorable as A Fistful of Dollars. Lee Van Cleef brings something different to the film which gives the film much more personality. Leone loves to have actors banter in his films and it's definitely apparent here with the focus on the friendship on both Eastwood and Cleef's characters. Both actors work well together and it's a shame that this isn't the case for the next film. Gian Maria Volonte is back for this film as the antagonist this time his character is much better written and his acting is much more effective but it may not appeal to everyone as he has increased the dramatics in this film in comparison to the first film.For A Few Dollars More is a much better constructed film than A Fistful of Dollars with a bigger and better story and improvements on the acting and photography. The film is great to watch on its own and does not require to watch the first or third film to understand but if you have seen the other films you get to pick up on the small things that Leone has put in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The second entry into the world of Sergio Leone's western landscape delivers more nerve tingling gun duels a greater insight into what drives the characters and a more powerful soundtrack which in all Leone films forms the basis of what he is trying to portray. Leone uses the brilliant Ennio Morricone music to demonstrate the emotions of the characters and the situations that they find themselves in.Fresh from the successful film A Fistful Of Dollars Clint Eastwood stars again as the Man With No Name a man who is identified by this spaghetti poncho and his fast drawing gun action. As the title card states Death Sometimes Had Its Price That Is Why The Bounty Killers Appeared basically describes the motives of Clint Eastwood's character he is a bounty killer that goes up against criminals that have a price on their head.However like anything in life there is competition for Eastwood it comes in the form of a quiet intelligent and efficient killer Col Douglas Mortimer played brilliantly by Lee Van Cliff. Mortimer is driven by a deeper motive one that goes beyond reward money and goes closer to his heart. Lee outshines Eastwood in most of the scenes with his efficient killing style and his vast array of weaponry.Eventually both men collide as a villainous and psychotic man El Indio escapes from prison and plans with the help of his ruthless gang to rob the bank of El Paso. Gian Maria Volonte plays Indio with such perfection and realism and gives the viewers a much more indepth look into his character. As viewers we sense that Indio is a disturbed man with a long past that has made him psychotic and ultimately evil. It was enjoyable to see Volonte have a wider role as the villain as in the previous film A Fistful of Dollars his villain Ramon Rojo didn't really go into second gear. As the film progresses Eastwood and Lee's characters realise that they must form a partnership in order to bring down Indio and his gang of killers both for different reasons.For A Few Dollars More is one of the best westerns ever made with its greatly orchestrated gun duels assisted by this breath taking soundtrack making it a must see western. This has always been my favourite in the Dollars Trilogy as it has a well told story and just one you cant take your eyes off. A Brilliant Director and A Brilliant Film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".

My first impression was simply thinking wow why haven't I heard more about this movie? I understand the fame of it's trilogy partners as A Fistful Of Dollars was Eastwood's debut western and The Good The Bad and The Ugly was the first Leone film to be widely advertised at it's release but For A Few Dollars More breaks the pattern of the middle film in the trilogy being the poorest as it is genuinely the most enjoyable watch of the three. I think that the feel of the movie is about as close as Leone could have got to perfection. Perhaps the most obvious reason for this is that the plot is based on bounty hunting which just works so well. It's a storyline that you feel like you've seen a thousand times probably on Warner Bros cartoons but pulled off in the most satisfying way imaginable. I honestly can't sing this film's praises enough. Agreed the whole trilogy is a masterpiece but this one has the balance between a great music score involving plot lines superb oneliners inspiring acting exciting shootouts and memorable characters down to an absolute fine art. All I can say is well done Leone you outdid yourself on this one. It's rekindled my love for the Spaghetti Western.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was my favoriteWestern before I discovered Once Upon a Time in the West English title Sergio Leone's superiormasterpiece. But when I keep on mentioning For a Few Dollars More English title people to not follow me in the same way. These two Leonemovies have many differences but they still have something in common. Booth has the excitement and the hard core mood that I seldom find in other movies.The story The film might seem thin  but keeps into it's own core. Instead of focus on too much story Leone's direction the set design the costumes the presence of the actors and Morricone's music gets in focus and creates an unforgettable masterpiece and one of the most entertaining movies ever. A Western like this doesn't need more story than it has.The storytelling The film starts with the presentation of colonel Douglas Mortimer reading in the bible on a train which he stops by his own hand ... the next scene contains 'The Return' of the man with no name ... wee see Clint Eastwood walking through the rain at the side of his horse lighting a cigar before he enters a smokefilled saloon. These first eminent scenes contains superb duels and in spite of the fact that they are long they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leoneexaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes The man with no name Clint Eastwood is harder than ever  Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef in his best performance as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel The Good The Bad and the Ugly English title. This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes wearing lots of weapons ...The villains A filthy evil rotten bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volent is El Indio not as handsome as in A fistful of Dollars English title but just as powerful and even more menacing and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fastpaced actionmovie. It is loud fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups the perfect editing the neverending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks but I think that this is his best together with the one in Once Upon a Time in the West English title. They are two different kinds of Morriconesoundtracks this is the tough one the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy The other Dollarmovies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollarmovie has the toughest action scenes. From the start to end the guns keep on shooting...Rating 10 of 10.".

These first eminent scenes contains superb duels and in spite of the fact that they are long they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leoneexaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes The man with no name Clint Eastwood is harder than ever  Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef in his best performance as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel The Good The Bad and the Ugly English title. This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes wearing lots of weapons ...The villains A filthy evil rotten bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volent is El Indio not as handsome as in A fistful of Dollars English title but just as powerful and even more menacing and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fastpaced actionmovie. It is loud fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups the perfect editing the neverending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks but I think that this is his best together with the one in Once Upon a Time in the West English title. They are two different kinds of Morriconesoundtracks this is the tough one the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy The other Dollarmovies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollarmovie has the toughest action scenes. From the start to end the guns keep on shooting...Rating 10 of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1965 and directed by Sergio Leone For a Few Dollars More stars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as two expert bounty hunters the latter more experienced and sophisticated who teamup to take down a notorious bank robber named El Indio aka The Indian played by Gian Maria Volont. If you've seen several Spaghetti Westerns from the 60s70s then you know that the ones by Leone are a notch or two above the other ones in overall quality but I usually find his stories and the overall presentation kinda dull albeit somewhat entrancing. Not to mention these early ones A Fistful of Dollars and this one are hindered by laughable sound effects like punches and bad English dubbing. Then there's the incongruent mixing of seriousness with goofy humor like when hats are shot off a dude's head without a scratch. Why Sure!For a Few comes across as a dress rehearsal for the superior The Good the Bad and the Ugly which was made the next year. Like that one there's no female character of any note and the overlong flick ends with an allegedly suspenseful gunfight between the three main characters. Speaking of which Gian Maria Volont is notably charismatic as El Indio. There's this myth going around that Leone's Dollars trilogy introduced the concept of the antihero otherwise known as the good or likable bad man. Actually the antihero had been around for decades when Fistful was released in '64. Take for example John Wayne's Ringo Kid in Stagecoach 1939 or Richard Widmark's Comanche Todd in The Last Wagon 1956 or Anthony Quinn's Bob Kallen in The Ride Back 1957 and particularly Brando's Kid Rio in OneEyed Jacks 1961. These are just off the top of my head.The difference with Eastwood's antihero in Leone's Man With No Name trilogy is that unlike the antiheroes above he is without personality unless squinting shooting and smoking cheroots are taken as profound marks of character. In Short Leone introduced the antihero CARICATURE as opposed to the antihero CHARACTER. Cool caricatures work just fine when you're in your teens or early 20s but after you mature a bit you naturally desire more threedimensional and believable characters. The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Granada Almera  Colmenar Viejo Spain with interiors done in Rome. The plot of the screenplay by Leone et al. was taken from Kurosawa's samurai film Sanjuro.GRADE B".

Manco and Mortimer team up to kill Indio and his men the older man has a personal vendetta against the criminal.This movie oozes class. From the scene of Clint walking into a town under a light rain to the final duel everything is filmed with flair and elegance. Eastwood is an unflappable icon of charisma. Volont plays Indio as a nasty piece of work who is also smart and dangerous. Van Cleef is magnificent as Mortimer it's interesting how in two movies of the Dollars Trilogy the Man with No Name is the lead but the emotional compass of the film is another character Tuco in TGTBTU Mortimer here.The final scene is fantastic  Leone has rarely done better.

If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone and his performance can't cover horrible plot boring conversations unfunny characters alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear. The opening scene with Denis Menochet as farmer and Christoph Waltz as SS officer is best part of the movie. Only part that have same quality and connects tension from that scene with the rest of the movie is a basement scene. Basement scene was crossroad for me. Michael Fassbender was great in role of British spy and his character adds some new layer of logic and realism in movie. In moments you can actually see some plot finally breaking through the rubbish you watched after the farm scene. After the basement chapter movie is going nowhere. Empty space. A lot of empty space for movie that last 153 minutes. Long and boring scenes with boring characters and conversations. Childish fantasy mixed up with Spaghetti western movies and some atmosphere that don't belong to WW2 period. Thats why we have basterds to fill everything else and patch the rest of movie. They failed. Basterds are weakestundeveloped and most boring part of movie. Movie is named by them yes  Brad is on Movie poster ... but they are horrible. Worst role of Mr Pitt and i hope last one from Eli Roth. CinemaShosanna story with David Bowie music was just another QT patch v1.1 to fill huge empty space between farm and basement. Extremely boring scenes with Mlanie Laurent taking off cinema letters red dresses secret love Marcel... will blast your brain. Yes  headache is a must. Beside 2 good scenes i really enjoyed listening smooth gradient of German French and English language. But again this is connected to Waltz and Fassbender and their personal knowledge that Tarantino used for his fantasy. Inglorious Basterds is Hybrid movie where gangsters are replaced with Nazis adding them wild west background layer with Brad Pitt on movie poster just to sell tickets. It doesn't work in this case.510  only for Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender.".

And I'm both from Germany and into movies.That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series  and even there he didn't play the main parts.

He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.By the way I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German  being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.Now I could repeat what many others have written here before. I'll put it short Finally QT is back.".

For a parody it is neither witty nor funny. The contents is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath lies a subtle political message because it is again the good guys killing bad Nazis. The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around. Could you imagine a storyline where Nazis while making jokes kill everybody in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not but this movie is exactly about that with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people.This movie only works because of the hidden Naziideology underneath. It does not regard the enemy as people. And if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun I am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me.Another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the American crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out. But if a naked body is pornography this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst.Inglorious Basterds is a pointless boring and tasteless waste of time and money.".

Hence I am taking the time to give this film 1 star to hopefully help get it down towards its rightful place among the other pieces of truly worthless cinema with which it belongs.I can understand that this is a movie that you either love or hate  it is certainly true that it is both a provocative and original film. However what surprises me is the massive bias towards the love side given the film's content  which can be summarised as an unashamedly unrealistic and soulless collection of sadisticcasual mindless violence strangely blended with dramatic scenes of the kind of things that genuinely took place under the Nazis.What I am trying to say is that combining very tense well written SS interrogation scenes which evoke some genuine emotional investment in the film with comic book character British generalsNazi leadersJewish soldiers makes for an extremely uncomfortable combination for me. At times it feels like someone has spliced together Schindlers List with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.My best guess is that the film's originality and uncompromising approach is refreshing to people bored of the same old Hollywood formulae. Certainly the film is unpredictable. The plot such as it is is extremely meandering and many of the characters' actions are pretty much inexplicable. SPOILER I point here towards Colonel Landa's killing of Bridget and his nonkilling of Shosanna. But then again every single character is so one dimensional that it leaves you with no idea which characters you are supposed to actually care about anyway. There is no real shock when anyone gets killed because you don't know who anyone is or what makes them tick.Brad Pitt gets the award here for the most wooden and pointless character to appear  he is truly awful throughout the film and finds himself in a role where he does not have to portray a single emotion throughout the film. Nothing.My final point is that originality on its own does not make a great film. Yes Tarantino has made a movie where you see things that you have never seen before in a major Hollywood release but that is not any sort of achievement. The reason a high budget film has not been made before where the entire German high command has a day at the cinema in occupied France with almost no guards or security is because that idea is stupid. Yes the film is stupid  and no amount of brushing over with Tarantino is being postmodern or he's being ironic will overcome that plain fact.In summary this is a film that takes an exploitation film script that would ordinarily be filed under trash cinema gives it a big name directorvery high quality cast and then takes the plaudits for being ground breaking.It is not. It is simply a steaming turd given a coat of gloss paint.".

It is not even the amusingly distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every little kid's head. It doesn't have anything intelligent in it neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. The rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image. Doesn't work. Even the previously seen cutbacks that Tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool. Second Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Ah really? Do they? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of guys one of them being man enough to rather die than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier that is more valiant than any of the Basterds? Certainly not  fail And what happens to the terrible Nazikilling Basterds? Well they all get killed by Nazis except two who are taken hostages  wow what terrible revengeful monsters they are...Third Any characters? Yes one! The only role and the only gleam of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely outacted by Waltz. Never seen a such a weak performance by Pitt... And the rest? Well some Germans you've never seen before and will never see after. When the movie started and I saw the group of the seven Basterds I hoped to see something like the Magnificent Seven A group of extraordinary guys each one with a distinct character making their way to their destiny fearless and knowing... I was then very disappointed when I saw the inglourious Basterds. No details at all no characters no real men just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to differentiate themselves... But in fact you don't even need to differentiate cause the Inglourious Basterds except Pitt hardly play any role in this movie...So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie on place 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened...".

	schema:headline " Fiasco";
	schema:reviewBody "Inglorious Basterds is a movie so clueless so sloppy so jampacked full of halfass characters and shockvalue violence so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 194243 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt one of my favorite actors gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie a parody of a war movie an outrageous Bmovie bloodbath or a documentary about milk  strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa the icy intelligent brutallyviolent Nazi commander. There's a character we've never seen before. His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting human dingleberry BJ Novak from The Office or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington III?

	onyx:emotionText "Inglorious Basterds is a movie so clueless so sloppy so jampacked full of halfass characters and shockvalue violence so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.I just pity him.American soldiers engaging in acts of deplorable violence against Nazi soldiers is not only justified it's hilarious! And admirable. Just look at Hugo Stiglitz' statistics from the 194243 season in a flashback segment narrated by Samuel L. Jackson. Yes Samuel L. Jackson. The idea that we're supposed to derive satisfaction from the torture of Nazis is just as abhorrent as a Nazi relishing the torture of a Jew. Let me tell Quentin something he should have learned in grade school two loathsome evils do not make a right.Brad Pitt one of my favorite actors gives the worst performance of his career as a loudmouth macho bloodthirsty cartoon... I'll never look at him the same way again. He also looked particularly angry... for some reason I get the feeling he and Tarantino didn't quite get along. I can picture Brad slapping him silly between takes. Next time slap harder.Quentin has finally gone off the deep end and become the hack we all feared he would. He doesn't know if he's making a war movie a parody of a war movie an outrageous Bmovie bloodbath or a documentary about milk  strudel. This is the definitive shrug by an artist who has nothing to say and insists on saying it loud.The one standout in the film is supposed to be Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa the icy intelligent brutallyviolent Nazi commander. There's a character we've never seen before. His only crime seems to be the masterful use of conversation as an indirect threat of violence. The only reason for this of course is that Tarantino hasn't bothered to create any genuine tension or conflict so we as an audience are forced to watch characters being forced to listen to Landa's menacing monologues. Dinner with a Nazi is scary enough... but by the time we get to his fifth interrogation I simply stopped caring.Who gets the award for worst stunt casting human dingleberry BJ Novak from The Office or Mike Myers as British General Winthorp J. Starchington III? I'd have to give the award to Myers since his absurd makeup and wandering accent are funnier than Austin Powers on his best day.By the film's finale even the fundamentals of filmmaking have been abandoned and all sense of reality obliterated.

Without Tables MostlyIn which an American Lieutenant talks to his newly formed 8 man Jewish American commando unit. There are no tables present. Cut to Adolf Hitler three years later. He is angry at his men's inability to deal with the Basterds. Hitler does have a table. We return to the Basterds in a flashback. Again distinct lack of tablebased content. Chapter Three German Night in Paris... At A Table... TalkingIn which a Jewish woman who escaped from under the table in Chapter One has somehow managed to become the proprietress of a cinema. The Jewish woman talks to an Actor at a table in a bar. Later the Jewish woman the Actor Joseph Goebbels and a Translator talk at a table in a Restaurant. The Actor and Goebbels talk in German. The Translator translates the German into French. The Jewish woman replies in French. The Translator translates the French into German. Goebbels decides to hold a film premiere at the Jewish woman's cinema. The Actor and Goebbels leave. The Nazi who talked with the Dairy Farmer at a table for twenty minutes back in Chapter One arrives. He talks with the Jewish woman at the table. He leaves. The Jewish woman breaks down overcome with emotion at having spent so long talking at a table. Chapter Four Operation Table TalkingIn which Austin Powers sends a British Officer to join the Basterds and an Actress on a mission to talk in German at a table in a Tavern. After 21 minutes of talking at a table they all shoot each other. The actress survives but spends the next 5 minutes lying on a table talking.Chapter Five Revenge of the Giant TableIn which The Basterds decide to continue the operation by talking in Italian and suicide bombing the cinema. The Nazi takes the Actress into a small room where they sit next to a table. A hoe that he found under the table in the Tavern fits her so he kills her. Then he takes two of the Basterds to a big room where they sit and talk at a table. Meanwhile the cinema burns down Hitler is riddled with bullets and the two Basterds blow themselves up for no good reason at all.The End".

THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards including Oscars as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people but hey reconsider its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi  Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.";

This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans.I wish it were made on nitrate film and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chainsmoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally needless violence the plot holes Tarantino's tableitis sans drama and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful glorified montage. What acting was there? And how much of that was just because I was too busy reading the subtitles? I watch my share of fansubbed anime and kudos for the attempt at authenticity but it was overdone for an Englishlanguage movie. With the glaring historical inadequacies the constant reading killed what acting there was.Why pay money for a narrator who will have absolutely no tie to any of the characters plot themes setting or anything involved in the movie? When the movie needs that sort of off hand explanation it's foreshadowing the utter filth that follows.Historical Research  while it was sprinkled with interesting factiods used the proper costumes and props for the soldiers this movie stretched the truth beyond belief even for historical fiction. Kudos on Mata Hari reference though using it as foreshadowing was a bit much. Mata Hari was executed by a firing squad not choked in an isolated room. This ruined any sense that the reference may have had.Other reviews mention more than half a dozen homages to other artists in the first 15 minutes. Considering the audience all these and other references were completely lost on many who would bother to see this movie and all who would enjoy it.I'm confused by his choices of when to start a scene end it and what needs to be included. In a movie promoted as an action film why did it take nearly 20 minutes to set up any sort of testosterone? What I believe to be the message was trite. The idea of rats and how we act on a primal nature against them and who is the rat? were at best clichd but at worst not realized. Mention of American camps for the Japanese and German Americans would have added legitimacy to this question to the moral high ground. Literally every character in the film that gets a speaking role was caught up in their own legend. Is that the world in which Tarantino lives?I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one. I regret that I bothered to view it at all even with wellmeaning hosts. There was a rich base of ideas to develop but none were realized.".

Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's less than spectacular Dirty Dozen clone but not it's plot points that he takes from all other genre of movies 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anticlimax in that it's dialogue is stale and outcome signposted a mile off. Of course one of the hidden Jews makes her escape but more of her later We the obviously easily pleased audience are treated to the introduction of Lt. Aldo Raine haha that name almost sounds like Bmovie king ALDO RAY....haha Quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming and this character is played by none other than Brad DALLAS Pitt sorry DALLAS was about the only good thing he's ever starred in and with jawjutting Mr Jolie treats us to a hounddogged southern drawled smirking Nazikiller. Meanwhile Mr Tarantino forgets that actual grownups may be in attendance so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'Dirty Dozen'?Raines 'platoon' consists of John Cassavettes looking bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers all looking to get the big payback on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino in all his superior knowledge pays special attention to two of these men by casting his long time best buddy and fellow homagesycophant Eli Roth as the baseball bat wielding 'Bear Jew' The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz and i'll wager more than half the QT fanboys had never heard this name before this movie Keep up the good work Tarantino you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far in the first 15 minutes keep adding them and it may detract from the plot or lack of?Anyhow cutting a long and extremely boring and protracted story short both Raine and his men the 'Inglorious Basterds' and the sole survivor from chapter one both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the showing of a Nazipropaganda movie in a french cinema owned by the forementioned survivor now grown upMore boring and pointless conversations follow two and fro as Pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. And any genuine suspense leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time is thrownaway by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's David Bowie song in a WWII movie.My problems and there are many with this movie is the reoccurring problem i have with most Tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. I don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the joke whatever it may be I knew of Inglorious Bastards Enzo Castellari Aldo Ray Hugo Stiglitz and the ultimate crime of the entire movie Ennio Morricone's haunting score from REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire Barad Pitt i'll assume You Mr Tarantino are the main draw here? I don't want the audience directing the movie. I pay to see YOUR vision your ideas your creativity....NOT how you can patchwork time and time again endless scenes from endless movies. It's high time the fanboys on IMDb employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' god knows if you don't....the studios should?The tired old argument with Tarantino worshippers is well if you can do better...do so Let me tell you if i was a 46 year old director with the unfortunate pull QT has.....i'd want to offer YOU a lot more than a warmed up muddled rehash of better WWII movies than this tripe. The directors he attempts to emulate made movies so bad by accident or due to budgetary constraints. It's a cop out time and time again to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'.

	schema:reviewBody "This was by far the worst and sickest Tarantino film I've seen and I've seen all but one. It's an ungainly mix of cartoony revenge fantasy and subEli Roth torture porn. The Basterds roam around France without any apparent source of supplies ammunition or command of any language other than English. Their actions are hideous scalping bodies with vivid sound effects and exposed brains carving swastikas in foreheads..slowly.. sticking fingers in bullet holes yet these are the good guys and the torture is played for laughs. Tarantino doesn't know any difference between ordinary e.g. drafted German soldiers and Nazis and thus any amount of carving up is OK as long as it's done by Jews or their redneck leader. I guess he thinks it'd be equally OK if the Germans scalped American bodies and carved stars in their foreheads? Tarantino is good at dialog and set pieces but fails to weave them together into a coherent narrative. There are basically two revenge fantasies coming together in the Paris movie premiere but neither one affects the other. There is zero character establishment or development. We're not told how a penniless Jewish girl came to own a fabulous movie theater a few years later in occupied Paris or even how she established a false identity. None of the Basterds have separable personalities or life histories we don't even find out why Aldo has a rope burn on his neck. Compare and contrast with The Dirty Dozen.The climactic premiere sequence is so absurd it's not even laughable. Sometime after the Allied invasion which is never referred to although we've been told it's June 1944 the entire German high command takes off for a gala film event in Paris about 300 miles from the front lines it's not like they had any pressing business. At the theater Hitler is protected by a grand total of TWO guards. When you can't even be as realistic as a Mel Brooks movie To Be or Not To Be you're just insulting the audience. I've seen better security at the library.Hmm what else? Why aren't the Basterds surprised when the theater catches on fire? That wasn't part of their plan. Why did Landa completely lose control and strangle the actress? It's wildly out of character from every other scene. If he's angry she's a traitor he already has it in mind to become an even bigger traitor himself. Why does every German they meet speak English? What was the point of scalping the driver at the end? The war was about to be over who were they trying to freak out? Does Tarantino even know what Goebbels looked like?I could go on but it's like picking apart the physics of Bugs Bunny. It's a spectacle of Tarantino acting out his manchild which unfortunately gets taken as a daring alternate history.".

It stars Robert Mitchum as Peter Hacker an American ambassador to Israel who tries to bring peace in the Middle East by unorthodox means but his adulteress wife played by Ellen Burstyn threatens to derail his plans when she has an affair with a PLO leader.  To make matters worse someone threatens to expose a film of the affair if a high ransom isn't paid and the ambassador has a hefty price on his head for certain assassins. Rock Hudson plays Frank Stevenson the ambassador's loyal security officerfriend who tries to unravel the scheme before the film hits the airwaves.Heading a first rate cast Robert Mitchum plays the lead role with grace and style as a man who tries to accomplish his goals when everything possible is trying to derail him and Ellen Burstyn plays the wife with right note between guilt and steadfast loyalty for her husband.  Rock Hudson on the other hand is given little to do. He does what he can with the thankless role as the security officer but basically he's just there to try to talk some sense into the ambassador's head and to carry out orders it's a little sad ending to a brilliant career.  The film itself is welldone and first rate with a higher budget and quality than most Cannon films and the location shoots are firstrate. Check it out if you want a MiddleEast political thriller with some action thrown into it for good measure.".

According to Lee Server's biography Mitchum spent most of the time getting plastered more than normal. Ellen Burstyn supposedly took a sample of what he was drinking and was shocked to find it real booze. But Mitchum was legendary for holding his liquor.I can see why Mitchum wasn't particularly happy with the film. His role is essentially that of a well meaning fathead who thinks he has all the answers to the Middleeast. Hudson took his role strictly for the cash because he was having increased medical expenses from what would kill him a year later.Being it's a GolanGlobus film the usual quota of violence is present. When you do a film about the Middleeast that's almost a requirement for a picture. Still the location cinematography in Israel certainly helps.Too bad that Mitchum and Hudson could not find a nice western to do as a joint project.".

I didn't find it thrilling in those passages but you're kept glued as you want to see what becomes of the suspense beating situations.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ambassador 1984  out of 4Wellmeaning but incredibly overactive thriller has Robert Mitchum playing the American ambassador to Israel who is trying to bring peace in the Middle East. While him and his security advisor Rock Hudson are getting shot at his wife Ellen Burstyn is banging a man Fabio Testi but neither one realizes that some terrorists are video taping their love sessions to blackmail the ambassador. Pretty soon it is revealed that the wife's lover might have terrorist ties himself.Cannon was known for releasing countless action pictures that were usually rather mindless and just exploited the various subjects that they were covering. Film like DEATH WISH II MISSING IN ACTION and AMERICAN NINJA were among the studios most popular pictures but THE AMBASSADOR is something completely different. It's clear that Cannon wanted to send a message to the Middle East that peace was possible but unfortuantly for them the movie just went off the rails so to speak. This picture simply tried to do way too much and in the end it's pretty much a complete mess.The film is really all over the place in regards to what it's trying to do and it almost seems as if no one could agree on what to do with the picture. It starts off with some incredibly wild and overthetop action scenes and so far so good. Then you've got a rather sleazy sex scene between Burstyn and Testi which includes the actress doing some nudity. Again so far it's fun. You then get into an incredibly long political drama about the whole peace idea and then there's some shocking and incredibly bloody violence that pops up at the end. All the while Mitchum and Hudson are trying to uncover this terrorist plot and get the sex tape back before it reaches the media.I'm going to guess Cannon really wanted a serious drama but there wasn't a way to make money on that alone so additional bits of action were thrown in. Thompson who was working in mainly B pictures at this time manages to build up some nice action but the drama of the story is downright weak and the message of the movie is a bit silly to say the least. The film just never really packs a punch or builds up any sort of tension so the nonstop political talk eventually gets boring and when Mitchum's character isn't worried about the sex tape then why should the viewer be?The film benefits from its terrific cast and that alone makes it worth sitting through. I think had Mitchum and Hudson switched roles the film might have been better but it was still fun seeing them together. Burstyn in good in her role of the wife and Testi is always dependable. You've also got Donald Pleasence so that's another plus. The film's violent climax features some gory shots that I'm sure shocked most people at the time of the film's release unless they were fans of slashers and were already used to it.In the end THE AMBASSADOR has its heart in the right place but it just never fully comes together.".

The film begins in 1984 when Wiesler attends a play written by Georg Dreyman who is considered by many to be the ultimate example of the loyal citizen. Wiesler has a gut feeling that Dreyman can't be as ideal as he seems and believes surveillance is called for. The Minister of Culture agrees but only later does Wiesler learn that the Minister sees Dreyman as a rival and lusts after his partner ChristaMaria. The more time he spends listening in on them the more he comes to care about them. The once rigid Stasi officer begins to intervene in their lives in a positive way protecting them whenever possible. Eventually Wiesler's activities catch up to him and while there is no proof of wrongdoing he finds himself in menial jobs  until the unbelievable happens.";

	schema:headline " A stunning directorial debut which deserves to be seen everywhere";
	schema:reviewBody "Because this movie deals with recent German history some German comments about it get sidetracked into minute historical discussions. Forget them Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie that should be seen everywhere.The former East Germany a relatively small country of 16 million people was controlled by the most sophisticated cunning and thorough secret police the world has ever seen the East German Ministerium fr Staatsicherheit or Stasi. The Stasi had about 90000 employees  a staggering number for such a small population  but even more importantly recruited a network of hundreds of thousands of unofficial employees who submitted secret reports on their coworkers bosses friends neighbors and even family members. Some did so voluntarily but many were bribed or blackmailed into collaboration.Das Leben der Anderen The Life of Others German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's debut builds this painful legacy into a fascinating moving film. In its moral seriousness artistic refinement and depth Das Leben der Anderen simply towers over other recent German movies and urgently deserves a wide international release. The fulcrum of the movie but probably not its most important character is Georg Dreyman an upandcoming East German playwright in his late 30s. Played by the squarejawed Sebastian Koch Dreyman is an apparently convinced socialist who's made his peace with the regime. His plays are either ideologically neutral or acceptable and he's even received State honors.Although he is a collaborator he is also a Mensch. He uses his ideological cleanliness to intervene on behalf of dissidents such as his journalist friend Paul Hauser HansUwe Bauer. These unfortunates must contend with every humiliation a totalitarian state can invent their apartments are bugged friends and family are recruited to inform on them and chances to publish or perform can be extinguished by one stray comment from a Central Committee member. The most recalcitrant can be kicked out of the country and stripped of their citizenship like the singer songwriter Wolf Biermann.Dreyman lives in a shabbygenteel bookfilled apartment with his girlfriend ChristaMaria Sieland Martina Gedeck a renowned actress who often appears in his plays. At the beginning of the movie Dreyman himself comes under the regime's suspicion for reasons that become clear only later. The fearful machinery of the Stasi rumbles to life his movements are recorded and his apartment bugged. The Stasi had bugging down to a science a team of meticulouslytrained agents swoop into your apartment when you're not there install miniscule undetectable listening devices in every single room  including the bathroom  and vanish in less than an hour leaving no trace. Agents set up an secret electronic command post nearby keeping a written record of every joke argument or lovemaking session.The operative process against Dreyman is overseen by Stasi captain Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mhe an actor from the former East who was himself once in the Stasi's crosshairs. Captain Wiesler starts the film as a colorless icy tightlipped professional who shows no mercy in fighting the enemies of socialism if he needs to interrogate a suspect for 10 hours without sleep to get a confession he will do so  and then place the seatcover the suspect sat on in a vacuum jar in case the miscreant should later need to be tracked by bloodhounds. At night Captain Wiesler returns to his tiny apartment in an grubby anonymous highrise. He settles himself among his inexpressibly drab furniture eats a meal squeezed out of a plastic tube while watching reports about agricultural production and then goes to bed alone.As Captain Wiesler listens to Dreyman and his girlfriend he begins to like them or perhaps envy the richness and depth of their lives in comparison with his own. Perhaps he also begins to wonder why a stranger should have the right to become privy to Dreyman's most intimate secrets his occasional impotence his girlfriend's infidelities his artistic crises. At the same time though Wiesler is under pressure a Central Committee official has made it clear to Wiesler and his toadying supervisor Lieutenant Colonel Grubitz Ulrich Tukur that Dreyman has to go down. I won't discuss more plot details as there are unexpected twists. Each of the main characters is drawn deeper into the conflict between Dreyman and the State and each is torqued by loyalty conflicts that intensify as the pressure increases. The cast is outstanding. Sebastian Koch finds the right combination of poetic detachment and watchful sophistication for Dreyman. Martina Gedeck as his girlfriend has the most challenging role since she's buffeted from all sides by her suspicious partner by Stasi agents trying to turn her and by a lecherous Culture Minister. Ulrich Mhe plays the Stasi agent's transformation with reserve only hinting at the stages in his character's secret but decisive change of heart.Director von Donnersmarck a blueblooded West German has recreated the gray drained look of the former East and the nature of Stasi intimidation with a fidelity that has earned the praise of East Germans. His pacing is relaxed but doesn't drag although there are a few longueurs most scenes unfold at just the right pace and there are several great setpieces. One is a bonerattling episode in the Stasi canteen in which a young recruit is caught telling a joke about East German premier Erich Honecker. Another is the penultimate scene a masterstroke in which Dreyman gains access to his massive Stasi file while reading it suddenly understands episodes of his own life which had never made sense to him before. The ending is perfectly judged bittersweet and moving without swelling strings or teary confessions.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding movie probably a great one. If it's not picked up for international distribution it will be a bitter loss for thousands of potential moviegoers in other countries.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall there are many Stasi 90000 overseeing the populace aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted threats to children and loved ones and a few obliged voluntarily.What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.First is Georg Dreyman a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch a tallhandsome actor dressed in writerly rumple shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend ChristaMaria Sieland Martina Gedeck and exists within the strictures of the statesponsored theatre. He is a decent man and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.For reasons that become quite clear Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd WieslerUlrich Mhe. Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence dressed in gray he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a nondescript arborited apartment much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.And he is in a dilemma now as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding it was the only one possible.A must see I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!".

After seeing Das Leben der Anderen this impression shifted quite a bit there actually was suffering killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall.

	schema:headline " Best film in years";
	schema:reviewBody "After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.Putting it simply this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.In summary this is filmmaking at its finest.

	onyx:emotionText "After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.Putting it simply this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.In summary this is filmmaking at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you'll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You'll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows for the one day that films like this get released.10 out of 10 is too modest.";

And then there is also the process that the character of Wiesler undergoes unveiling the emptiness of his own existence the process presented with the subtle pace that Donnersmarck dexterously set.

	schema:headline " Excellent film insightful character studies";
	schema:reviewBody "This film set in the theater world of the mid1980s was particularly satisfying to me because I was a producer of avantgarde theater through the 1980s based in San Francisco but often on tour  including to international theater festivals in West Germany communist Poland and communist Yugoslavia in 1987. Although my experience as an American was of course very different than the experience of these East Berliners there is a mood and sense of personalities in this film that I found authentic and familiar. The people in this film feel like the people I met in the festival bars and refreshment centers for participating artists and on panel discussions in those festivals. Many commenters here have noted the important character change of the Stasi agent attributing the change either to his growing appreciation for the humanity of the playwright and the actress or else complaining that the transformation is unpersuasive. So far as I've read in the comments no one has focused on the key scene. When the Stasi agent hears the playwright and friends planning the suicide article to be smuggled to the West he writes up an accurate report on this and hastens to his boss's office. Up until then whatever sympathies he may have developed for the playwright or for the actress are inadequate to deter him. But when the agent enters the boss's office the boss doesn't immediately give him a chance to give the report or to say anything  instead the boss immediately launches into a discussion of a new study analyzing how to interrogate and intimidate artists and writers. The report categorizes writers and artists into 5 basic personality types. The boss says the playwright is a type 4. He describes how the prescribed approach to intimidate type 4 writers will result in them losing hope and never writing again. Only after hearing this and realizing that his report exposing the playwright as the author of the suicide paper will result in the playwright being crushed emotionally and never even wanting to write anything new does the Stasi agent curl up the report in his hands and decide not to give the report to his boss. The agent's precise motivation is unclear. But it cannot be merely that the agent wants the playwright to be able to continue writing new works. The agent must know that the state will never let the playwright do another play or publish anything if the playwright's authorship of the suicide paper is known and yet the agent was ready to expose the playwright anyway. So the agent's motive for suddenly deciding to hide his report is not merely because the state will put the playwright on a blacklist and block him from publishing or getting plays produced. Thus it must be that the agent is motivated to change by feeling a general revulsion against the idea that the state should employ the crushing of hope of creative spirit as a strategy for responding to a dissenter whom the agent knows is a genuine supporter of the regime but who sees that it has flaws. It is the fact that the state will destroy the playwright's very desire to write that causes the agent to change. It isn't clear whether the agent would draw back from inflicting that kind of punishment on any artist even one whom he felt to be a real enemy of the state but it is clear that he can't bring himself to inflict it on a man whom he feels is a good man like the playwright. And the agent believes the playwright is good because the playwright supports what is good about society tries to correct what is wrong about society is loyal even to a friend who has made powerful enemies and treats his lover with compassion even when it appears the lover is betraying him.And the irony  a good irony  is that by acting to preserve the playwright's desire to write the agent winds up being the focus of the playwright's novel  a novel born of a desire and drive to write that the agent himself kept the state from destroying.Thus it seems to me that the real message of this movie is that even the most unimaginative bland uncreative rigid people  such as the Stasi agent  should appreciate and protect the desire that drives creative people who are also good people to create works of art and literature.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film set in the theater world of the mid1980s was particularly satisfying to me because I was a producer of avantgarde theater through the 1980s based in San Francisco but often on tour  including to international theater festivals in West Germany communist Poland and communist Yugoslavia in 1987. Although my experience as an American was of course very different than the experience of these East Berliners there is a mood and sense of personalities in this film that I found authentic and familiar. The people in this film feel like the people I met in the festival bars and refreshment centers for participating artists and on panel discussions in those festivals. Many commenters here have noted the important character change of the Stasi agent attributing the change either to his growing appreciation for the humanity of the playwright and the actress or else complaining that the transformation is unpersuasive. So far as I've read in the comments no one has focused on the key scene. When the Stasi agent hears the playwright and friends planning the suicide article to be smuggled to the West he writes up an accurate report on this and hastens to his boss's office. Up until then whatever sympathies he may have developed for the playwright or for the actress are inadequate to deter him. But when the agent enters the boss's office the boss doesn't immediately give him a chance to give the report or to say anything  instead the boss immediately launches into a discussion of a new study analyzing how to interrogate and intimidate artists and writers. The report categorizes writers and artists into 5 basic personality types. The boss says the playwright is a type 4. He describes how the prescribed approach to intimidate type 4 writers will result in them losing hope and never writing again. Only after hearing this and realizing that his report exposing the playwright as the author of the suicide paper will result in the playwright being crushed emotionally and never even wanting to write anything new does the Stasi agent curl up the report in his hands and decide not to give the report to his boss. The agent's precise motivation is unclear. But it cannot be merely that the agent wants the playwright to be able to continue writing new works. The agent must know that the state will never let the playwright do another play or publish anything if the playwright's authorship of the suicide paper is known and yet the agent was ready to expose the playwright anyway. So the agent's motive for suddenly deciding to hide his report is not merely because the state will put the playwright on a blacklist and block him from publishing or getting plays produced. Thus it must be that the agent is motivated to change by feeling a general revulsion against the idea that the state should employ the crushing of hope of creative spirit as a strategy for responding to a dissenter whom the agent knows is a genuine supporter of the regime but who sees that it has flaws. It is the fact that the state will destroy the playwright's very desire to write that causes the agent to change. It isn't clear whether the agent would draw back from inflicting that kind of punishment on any artist even one whom he felt to be a real enemy of the state but it is clear that he can't bring himself to inflict it on a man whom he feels is a good man like the playwright. And the agent believes the playwright is good because the playwright supports what is good about society tries to correct what is wrong about society is loyal even to a friend who has made powerful enemies and treats his lover with compassion even when it appears the lover is betraying him.And the irony  a good irony  is that by acting to preserve the playwright's desire to write the agent winds up being the focus of the playwright's novel  a novel born of a desire and drive to write that the agent himself kept the state from destroying.Thus it seems to me that the real message of this movie is that even the most unimaginative bland uncreative rigid people  such as the Stasi agent  should appreciate and protect the desire that drives creative people who are also good people to create works of art and literature.";

	schema:reviewBody "I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year not just because these films share two actors. This multifaceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.Sebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma he's the best Germanspeaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie Ulrich Mhe as the State Security Stasi agent whose task it is to monitor Koch's suspiciously free thinking playwright brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn't have to rethink my opinion of. Weisler reveals himself as a lonely isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of nearadoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman Koch doesn't even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.As I said without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan's Labyrinth this one really did deserve it's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece.".

Some of them played an intricate catandmouse game with the Stasigoing just far enough to attract notice but not so far as to bring about arrest. The problem with the catandmouse game was that the cats had very sharp teeth which they didn't hesitate to use. Blacklisting was just one of the state's weaponsa single word from a high official and you never acted again or your plays or music were never performed. Although both ChristaMaria and Georg have been careful and discrete they haven't been careful and discrete enough to escape the Stasi's interest. The movie although in color looks as if it were shot in black and white. The mood and the locations are drab and muted. Obviously the color reflects the political and social situation of the time. The camerwork and editing were outstanding. Every other aspect of the film is equally excellent particularly the work of the supporting actors. Not only does this film represent a riveting thriller but it provides a powerful political message. After you've seen The Lives of Others you won't keep quiet when someone tells you I don't care if the government taps my phone I've got nothing to hide.This is an extraordinary filmwell acted and directed with a compelling plot and message.

It has a great atmosphere giving back the grey world of the DDR grey buildings grey Trabants and Wartburgs grey people a country ruled by mediocrity even in its colours.Nevertheless a thorough world the Stasi thoroughly maintains the files about the many suspects the agents thoroughly install the bugs in their flats and thoroughly watch them. Later in the unified Germany they thoroughly maintain the very same files and make them open for everyone. A thorough nation the Germans.But the Germans also value morality and this is also evident in the movie. The moral awakening causes the otherwise conformist writer to challenge the Communist power and the very same moral attitude causes the much less typical and much less anticipated awakening of the Stasi agent watching the writer. The latter transformation is clearly more exciting as the grey mediocre thorough and lonely Stasi agent the loyal servant realizes the real nature of the Communist power during the observation of the writer and her wife. In the end he also challenges this power in his own humble way. The story should also be instructive for us Hungarians as it shows an example of how a nation should handle its dark past. The Germans already did a fairly impressive brainwash after WWII to reach a catharsis on the sinful Nazi past and they did a similarly impressive moral confrontation in the 90's with their Communist past and the Stasi. I envy them because we Hungarians have failed in this. The Germans consistently opened all the Stasi files and allowed everyone to go and see who had been watched and who had been the agents and the informers.In Hungary this did not happen. What happened instead was that many of the informers became prominent politicians other professions exposed to the public like artists journalists church officials wereare also heavily infected and the files were used to blackmail them or to get rid of them in a few occasions. Not exactly the right way to purify the society. And the society is indeed far from being purified they just do not really care if it turns out that some prominent person was an informer back in the Communist era. So when such files come to the public the former agent just says some weak excuses I was forced into this and  I always tried to defend the people around me and I never wrote anything harmful etc. and then everything continues as before.This was what happened to Oscarwinner film director Istvn Szab whose story is particularly striking. An article was published in a weekly uncovering the fact that he was an informer back in the early 60's. His personal postscandal behaviour is a typical example of trying to get away with feeble excuses. The reaction of the society was an example of accepting these cheap excuses without criticism just because Szab was an otherwise famous talented and popular person a nice guy.And this is a pity Szab is one of the few informers who could have stood up and confess his sins without losing his authenticity because Szab the artist has done the confession. His best films showed how the power can corrupt talented but weak persons how one can lose one's integrity. He got his Oscar for exploring this very topic in Mephisto and he got Oscar nominations for two other similar movies with Brandauer. And then he did confront this issue even more explicitly in Taking sides too. And he did it in the right way exposing all the complexity and all the moral issues. So it is indeed a pity he could not do it in the right way in his personal life. And it is indeed a pity that we Hungarians could not do it the right way. The Germans did.".

The Stasi are the Shield and the Sword of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation a secret police force of 100000 that subjugates another 300000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler Ulrich Mhe is a buttondown bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz Ulrich Tukur is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf Thomas Thieme and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman Sebastian Koch. Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska Volkmar Leinert who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's livein girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina Maria Sieland Martina Gedeck who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister shades of gestapolike Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writerdirector Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film Sonata for a Good Man is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it.".

I am so wrong about German movies. This one in particular is definitely one of the best movies I have seen.Before the Germany reunification East Germany had this totalitarian government that was accused of infringing privacy of the citizens putting them into 24 hours surveillance to monitor any antigovernment activities. The story involves an interrogation and surveillance specialist STASI State Security officer given a task of monitoring the life of a writer. But soon he discovers the misuse of power of the higher officials for personal benefit and his faith in the system withers down. And more he listens to the life of others he gets slowly absorbed in their lives living it with them. But the question was how far he could go?The direction is absorbing.

For me this movie was really good so I am a follower of the positive reviews I have read.What I would like to do is comment on the negative reviews I have read about the character development and in particular the role of Ulrich Muhe Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler.A lot of people state that the transition from a very strict Stasi agent to the helpful 'friend' isn't realistic and human. When you look at how extremely strict and haunting the man was beforehand he just couldn't turn into a good guy all of a sudden they say.I disagree with that. When you look at it from a psychological point of view it makes clear sense to me. It is very well known that just before a person admits his wrongdoing he is at his most extreme in denying it! The more he is confronted with the fact that his methods are unethical the more he will try to find arguments to defend his methods. A great example of this is the scene where the student in Wiesler's class comments on the brutal interrogations Wiesler has pulled off. Wiesler answers by saying that this is just the way things go in the DDR and that the student better get used to that.Another example of why the transformation of Wiesler is so credible is the fact that he hasn't got a life of his own. This is perfectly illustrated by the scenes in Wiesler's home. Every evening he returns to his home finding it empty. He cooks awefull for himself and orders prostitutes to satisfy his sexual needs. In that particular scene he even asks the prostitute to stay longer. This illustrates even more how lonely the poor guy is. Also this loneliness and 'lack of own life' perfectly illustrate the title of this movie. Wiesler doesn't have a life of his own and therefore 'lives the life of others' when he's sitting in the attic listening to the lives that happen beneath him.A final argument for the credibility of the transition is the piano play Georg Dreyman plays after his good friend the director and writer Albert Jerska dies 'die Sonate vom guten Menschen' or 'The sonata of good people'. This is the key moment for the transition. Wiesler then perfectly realizes that his work is pointless and unethical. That by doing it he will never become a good man and will never have a worthy life of his own. He is confronted with the rich life of the poets and artists and discovers how beautiful a normal and free life can be. From that point on he changes radically and decides that he is no longer a part of an unethical inhuman system. To me this all perfectly fits.In my opinion this is one of the best movie in years. And I hope that I have offered clear arguments on why the transformation of Wiesler is not a wrong and unrealistic move but instead a great enrichment of the movie.".

Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffinlike cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare played by a young Conrad Veidt who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca informs Alan that he will soon die and indeed Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer it seems that the beautiful young Jane beloved by both Alan and Francis has been targeted as the next victim.This is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and in the end we must ask ourselves who is really the mad one here? Subtle and ingenious we see the world the way an insane person might see it warped and confused a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found. The impact of this film is still being felt and seen today and for good reason. It is a shocking disturbing masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.".

	schema:headline " Discovering Silent Film...";
	schema:reviewBody "It struck me last night that I've never seen a serious silent film. Everyone's seen a silent comedy Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton the Keystone Cops... They've all been immortalized in the minds of every film viewer and I enjoy them as much as anyone. But it seems a strange and almost disrespectful lack to never have seen anything but comedy so many silent films were created and the only ones I've seen starred waddling tramps.It was partially for that reason that I rented this movie. I had read about it on a film review site the name of which escapes my memory and decided it was worth the halfhour drive to the video store. The basic premise is that of a man relating a story that happened to him and his friends  their unnerving discovery of a crazed mountebank Dr. Caligari and his prophetic sleepwalker. It follows a series of murders and growing madness keeping you in constant suspense and confusion until the very last scene.There's a period of adjustment when watching it  unfortunately necessary for a modern audience. The titles seem too slow. The camera seems to hold on scenes too long. The makeup on the actors' faces seem ghostly and horrible  even on the hero.But before long the movie has you in its grip. You spend time staring at the architecture  buildings doors and windows that would have been funny in a Dr. Seuss book. In the film they make you uneasy.

	onyx:emotionText "It struck me last night that I've never seen a serious silent film. Everyone's seen a silent comedy Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton the Keystone Cops... They've all been immortalized in the minds of every film viewer and I enjoy them as much as anyone. But it seems a strange and almost disrespectful lack to never have seen anything but comedy so many silent films were created and the only ones I've seen starred waddling tramps.It was partially for that reason that I rented this movie. I had read about it on a film review site the name of which escapes my memory and decided it was worth the halfhour drive to the video store. The basic premise is that of a man relating a story that happened to him and his friends  their unnerving discovery of a crazed mountebank Dr. Caligari and his prophetic sleepwalker. It follows a series of murders and growing madness keeping you in constant suspense and confusion until the very last scene.There's a period of adjustment when watching it  unfortunately necessary for a modern audience. The titles seem too slow. The camera seems to hold on scenes too long. The makeup on the actors' faces seem ghostly and horrible  even on the hero.But before long the movie has you in its grip. You spend time staring at the architecture  buildings doors and windows that would have been funny in a Dr. Seuss book. In the film they make you uneasy. The whole atmosphere is of a world gone wrong like a dream worthy of Salvador Dal. Nothing is square or straight. The buildings loom in on you windows sweep upward slanted or curved doors are obscenely angled holes beckoning you to enter and be trapped inside.Throughout the story defies expectations.

	schema:reviewBody "Like so many of the films from the silent era The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari gets overlooked if you can even find it! for big budget duds and runny romantic comedies. Directors of the period like Griffith Lang Eisenstien and Caligari's Wiene are never given the credit they deserve. And if credit is given it is in small cultish circles in various pockets around the world.The set design here is amazing not a single right angle can be found in any one of the sets. This may not only apply to the disjointed and distorted characters in the film but also the state of Germany at the time. After all the film was made in the dark ages in Germany between WWI and WWII. This point is validated by Siegfried Kracauer with his notion of how the main character of Dr. Caligari can be easily interpreted to Hitler and vice versa. Both controlled subjects with a form of brainwashing both were upset with current forms of society and government and both were masters of deception. In a period where Germans were looking for direction and let's face it authority as well Dr. Caligari embodied it fully.In the area of the players all the names in the film turn out a literally speechless performance. Dagover Krau and especially Veidt as Cesare pronounced Chezaray are excellent in the use of gestures and motion to get their point across without using words. The camera stationary as in most early features uses the miseenscene effectively letting us identify with characters such as Francis and Jane and disjointing us from Caligari and the Criminal.The use of lines and stripes not only in the sets but in small places like in the good doctor's hair and on his gloves adds to the telling of the character. Colour tints of the BW film also play a special part in bringing the whole film together. An amazing sequence where Caligari reveals his true madness pits Caligari stumbling through the unequal streets of Germany while being haunted by textual ramblings written in the air. A marvelous achievement for it's time. And it adds so much.The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has changed the way I look at horror films and even films in general. I urge anyone reading this to pick up this film. The DVD offering is utterly fantastic with the restored print an audio essay of the film and production notes. Bypass the overblown motion picture events of the year and pick up Caligari quite possible the greatest motion picture event in the history of motion pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And it really really is an art film since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German interwar milieu. So be prepared for an otherworldly excursion into the total work of art or Gesamtkunstwerk of this monumental and influential film.This film is best seen at night alone and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have a choice of two soundtracks traditional music and muchscarier modern track b tinted intertitles set in a surrealistic actually expressionistic font and 3 is fairly high quality then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer  try both tracks you'll see.It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it I promise. These betweenthewars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present who know what was about to happen in Germany.Anyway I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways  keep that in mind when it happens. Only one note  artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film  you'll notice the theme of death and the maiden woven into this artwork. Also this film is the direct ancestor of films like Nightmare Before Christmas and a lot more  you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.WARNING  I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining  you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come  such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children  it's an adult art film no not that kind made for adults.".

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Friedrich Feher and an old man are sitting and Francis begins to tell him a story hoping to top the one the man just told him. The story is about a fair that came to his hometown of Hostenwall and a man Dr. Caligari who was one of the vendors. Caligari's submission to the fair is his somnambulist Cesare Conrad Veidt who has been asleep for 25 years and under Dr. Caligari's willing is about to awaken. He does and Dr. Caligari tells the crowd to ask him a question for he knows the future. Francis is there with his friend Alan Hans Heinrich von Twardowski and Alan walks up and asks Cesare how long he'll live to which Cesare replies that he'll be dead by dawn.Alan and Francis both long for the same woman Jane Lil Dagover and after they all three go home we see inside Alan's house the shadows of he and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Back at Dr. Caligari's place we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he lay in a coffin. Another attempted murder takes place but turns out to be the work of a common crook not involved with Cesare and Dr. Caligari. More happens that's not really important. Francis goes to an insane asylum to see if the fled Dr. Caligari is a patient there but the worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the head of the institute for patient information as he's not allowed to divulge that sort of thing. So Francis goes to the head's office a skeleton stands upright in the corner and it turns out to be Dr. Caligari himself.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through his books they discover a historical book about the mythical Caligari who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now back in 1093. When Dr. Caligaru arrives he goes insane saying he must become Caligari and doctors in the institute put him in a straight jacket. Then the telling of the story is done. The film adds a framing device though in the present with Francis and the man he's told the story to. The two go back to the institute Cesare is in the corner and Francis warns the old man not to accept one of his prophesies for he should surely die. Jane is there also and when Francis asks her to marry him she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood huh?. Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari whom Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with. He's grabbed by the doctors and taken upstairs. Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is manic and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk. The last scene is of Dr. Caligari saying he has a surefire cure for Francis' mania.So was Francis the real Caligari? Did Francis kill Alan in the hopes of getting Jane to marry him? After all we never do see his killer. With this appended narrative twist the entire story comes into question. I have a feeling a lot of people would hate this but I found it very interesting maybe even historic.The film is very dreamlike. All silent films are sort of spooky but this one is more otherworldly. Everything is distorted and the camera with that strange blackening gives it an unstable touch like our most vivid dreams have. It's like something's been placed over the lens in order to highlight certain characters or visuals and cover up something else. I'm assuming the film used onset camera tricks.The expressionist sets consist of slanted walls crooked doors weirdly misshapen glasses paint splashed on stairs that bend. A background that is clearly a wall with painting. Trees that look like wires. The characters' faces are all pale white and the blacks are all stark. Cesare specifically looks like a cross between Frankenstein's Monster and Edward Scissorhands. The houses don't look like houses they look like pieces of wood painted to look like a stage set.I can see influence from this film in the set designs of Tim Burton especially and the narrative twist at the end must have influenced David Lynch in Mulholland Drive.The print I saw was from 1992 and for a movie that's 83 years old I was very impressed. There was very little grain and the lighting was fine. The only complaint I had was that some of the handwriting from Dr. Caligari's writings was a bit difficult to read and that has nothing to do with the print. The music is all organ that comes booming in whenever something evil  usually Dr. Caligari  is onscreen. It's hard to judge movies like these but the visuals are wonderful the music is spooky the acting suitable and the pacing fine it's a little over an hour. I would say this is an essential film and unlike many groundbreaking classics it's like nothing else you've seen.12".

	schema:reviewBody "The original screenplay did not contain the frame that many use in their analysis of the film. As it was intended by the authorsit presents a story in which Caligari represents the insanity of unlimited power and his medium is the common man which the authoritarian state trains to do its killing. The story was written by Hans Janowitz a Czech and Carl Mayer and Austrian. They combined events of their lives to come up with a fantastic tale. Janowitz supposedly saw a pretty girl he wished to speak to but she was being followed by another man. He gave her up as lost but the following day he learned that the girl whose name was Gertrude had been murdered the night before. He recalled the suspicious man who was also at her funeral but he had no evidence against him and so said nothing. Meyer whose father committed suicide had to undergo many psychiatric examinations and grew to hate psychiatrists. They determined to write a script together combining these two things but had no plot for it until they visited a fair together. There they saw an exhibit entitled Man or Machine in which a man performed amazing feats and uttered prophecies while under hypnosisthey had their story. It combined all three experiences into a horrific thriller. The story however was not to be produced as they intended. According to Otto Friedrich the authors of Caligari intended it not just as a horror movie but as a kind of revolutionary allegory. As such the powers that be were bound to find it unacceptable. Producer Erich Pommer bought the script and added and opening and closing scene. In the opening scene Francis is sitting on a bench in some kind of park with another man. They watch Jane walk by seemingly in a trance. Francis then begins to tell his story. After he is finished explaining everything that happened the audience soon sees Francis in the lobby of the asylum with many other people including Jane. Francis begs Jane to finally marry him but she responds We queens are not permitted to follow the dictates of our hearts. As the much friendlier looking directorDr. Caligari comes down the stairs Francis begins screaming that he is Caligari. Francis is put into a straight jacket and put in a cell. The directorDr. Caligari puts his glasses back on and once again looks fairly creepy. He then says At last I understand mania. He thinks I am that mystic Caligariand now I also know how to cure him. Instead of a story about the triumph over authority it is simply the babble of a madman. Simply appreciating the story and the meaning behind it is not enough. Instead of being played in an ordinary world the entire set is expressionistic. Buildings are painted at angles. Doors and windows are crooked or rounded. Nothing meets at right angles. It appears as a world not entirely in the realm of fantasy nor is it completely on earth. Despite the story and the scenery being fantastic everything is a reflection of the real worldincluding the fact that Cesare and Francis both lose in the end. The authorities winin reality and in the film. Even the props lend themselves to this overblown idea of authority. The town clerk's desk and stool are set very high. In order to get to the police the characters have to walk up stairs and even still their furniture is higher than normalin case there was a question as to who was in charge. The shadows and lightening also reflect the film's expressionism. The backdrop was painted with extensive shadows to further the eerie quality. In addition the entire screen is rarely completely illuminated. The audience's attention is focused on the important by using what would be a spotlight in a play. Sometimes only a person's face or the spinning top of a carousel can be seen at all sometimes they are brightest while the rest of the screen is darker and sometimes the entire scene is in full view. This gives it a very storylike feel and does much to enhance the movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a classical example of expressionism. Ironically it is an expressionism tempered by authority. Regardless of what the audience of today thinks of the once incredibly popular movie few would walk away from it feeling as though they had wasted their time. Original audiences may not have realized that it was indeed the story of triumph over authority but those of today are better able to see this.".

This gives it a very storylike feel and does much to enhance the movie. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a classical example of expressionism. Ironically it is an expressionism tempered by authority. Regardless of what the audience of today thinks of the once incredibly popular movie few would walk away from it feeling as though they had wasted their time. Original audiences may not have realized that it was indeed the story of triumph over authority but those of today are better able to see this.";

This suggests that in its own time the political message of the film was fairly powerful but compared to the work done in such films as The Golem Nosferatu and Metropolis it is not so farreaching.What sets this film apart from its contemporaries is its absolute commitment to the expressionist movement. Mutated sets heavy darklight makeup light and shadow and a Gothic storyline are classic expressionism. The photography is beautiful and so crisp that it creates an eerie sense that this hellish scene is actually the real world and that our everyday lives are the delusional Technicolor dream of a madman.While there are many better movies made in this period I feel that this one is the pinnacle of the imagery that is characteristic of the expressionist art form.

Buildings and furniture props and painted backdrops are elongated and deformed into blocky savage expressionistic perspectivedefying and proportionless forms. Even the intertitles weren't of the traditional sort. The result is obviously one of unsettling the viewer further into believing themselves suspended in a reality where anything could happen  anything horrible or nightmarish obviously. Nothing is as it seems right to the very end. Btw on a more frivolous note I thought the character of Cesare the Somnambulist looked uncannily like something that might have influenced Tim Burton into creating Edward Scissorhands or maybe even more the look of some of the characters in Rocky Horror Picture Show.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' may not be the kind of film that would shock today's audience but its fascinating and horrific use of surrealistic atmosphere clearly had an influence on modern filmmakers such as David Cronenberg and David Lynch. While the story is not as involving as other German masterworks of the era such as Metropolis it can be appreciated for its unique vision.The thing that really strikes me about this film is the way the set design reflects the unstable mind of the narrator. The exterior scenes often include painted backgrounds featuring houses with sloped roofs and jutting edges along with mountains that seem to twist and curl upwards into the sky. Although these backgrounds are not threedimensionally realistic they convincingly depict the gothic surrealistic atmosphere with imagination and verve. The interior scenes have a claustrophobic feeling that generates from the walls which are often at odd angles and slanting inward as they rise. Much of the design appears to be influenced by cubism even the sinister Dr. Caligari looks squareshaped. The lighting also reflects the chilling mood with shadows haunting the nooks and crannies in the background.The characters in the film sometimes seem equally freakish. All the actors wear makeup that make them appear as pale as a ghost and the men are decked out in dark suits and capes. Ominous figures approach the camera directly in two haunting sequences early on in the opening scene when we see Jane walking towards us in a ghostlike white gown and in the initial carnival scene when Ceasre steps out of his box. In the end we learn that it is really Francis who was insane the whole time thus the sets during the story which is told by Francis himself reflect his disoriented mind. Not surprisingly the bookend scenes where he tries to tell his tale to an old man in a garden are the only ones to involve natural surroundings such as trees and grass.For a onehour horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari requires a lot of concentration on the viewer's part especially since the story sometimes seems fragmented. Nonetheless it will no doubt prove fascinating for years to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any fan of horror or German expressionism needs to see this 1920 classic. Considered by many to be the first true horror movie this is a story that doesn't need sound to get under your skin. Francis Friedrich Feher tells the story of Dr. Caligari Werner Krauss who hosts a sideshow exhibit at a local carnival featuring Cesare Conrad Veidt a somnambulist who has been asleep for 23 years. Dr. Caligari is able to awaken Cesare through hypnotic suggestion for the entertainment of the onlookers. It seems that Dr. Caligari might have other uses for Cesare as well. Shortly after their arrival townfolk start turning up dead. It isn't long before suspicion falls upon the tragic Cesare. But things are not entirely as they seem. Francis may not be the hero we are led to believe he is. Any review of this movie would be remiss without mentioning the set design. With nary a right angle in sight the sets are as much a part of the story as the actors. The strange design certainly contributes to the madness the film means to convey and sets the mood for a truly creepy story. Don't pass this one up just because it is a very old and very silent film. It is a memorable story that is well acted and masterfully executed by director Robert Wiene.".

	onyx:emotionText "Any fan of horror or German expressionism needs to see this 1920 classic. Considered by many to be the first true horror movie this is a story that doesn't need sound to get under your skin. Francis Friedrich Feher tells the story of Dr. Caligari Werner Krauss who hosts a sideshow exhibit at a local carnival featuring Cesare Conrad Veidt a somnambulist who has been asleep for 23 years. Dr. Caligari is able to awaken Cesare through hypnotic suggestion for the entertainment of the onlookers. It seems that Dr. Caligari might have other uses for Cesare as well. Shortly after their arrival townfolk start turning up dead. It isn't long before suspicion falls upon the tragic Cesare. But things are not entirely as they seem. Francis may not be the hero we are led to believe he is. Any review of this movie would be remiss without mentioning the set design. With nary a right angle in sight the sets are as much a part of the story as the actors. The strange design certainly contributes to the madness the film means to convey and sets the mood for a truly creepy story. Don't pass this one up just because it is a very old and very silent film.

	schema:reviewBody "This 1920 film gets extra points for originality. A young man Francis tells a stranger an odd tale of a carnival man Dr. Caligari who comes to town to show the locals his somnambulist Cesare. Cesare has been asleep for twentyfive years and only comes awake on the command of Dr. Caligari. Cesare sleeps in a cabinet resembling a casket. During the show Francis wakes the somnambulist. Cesare then answers questions from the audience and predicts the future. When Francis' best friend Alan asks jokingly how long he Alan will live Cesare answers The time is short. You die tomorrow. Big joke  except that Alan is stabbed dead during the night just one of several mysterious murders that have taken place since Dr. Caligari and his infernal cabinet waltzed into town.I don't know how much I want to get into the plot itself. The ending isn't really predictable so let's just say Francis manages to convince the police that Caligari and his somnambulist are responsible for the murders and there is a chase.However the first thing one notices about the film is not the characters all of whom overact according to the standards of silent movies  and Cecil B. DeMille's sound movies.After Francis launches into his tale what one notices are the sets. This is one cockeyed world that he and his friends inhabit. It's a cartoon world. These are all indoor sets that seem built of plywood. The backdrop is a complicated suggestion of a mountain with a village on its slopes but it's sloppily drawn like the rest of the decorations as if by a child with a set of finger paints. The carousel at the fair spins at 45 degrees from plumb. What passes for streets buildings roofs chimneys and interiors are all drunkenly askew leaning this way and that each on its own trip and totally indifferent to the leanings of others. One might say there isn't a right angle in the joint. I've never seen anything like it.The characters their dress and grooming fit right into this insane landscape. When we are first introduced to Cesare when Caligari opens the door of the upright casket we're treated to a close up of Conrad Veidt's face with its black eye shadow and the thin glossy smear of what looks like paste across his thin lips. And when he opens his eyes it's pretty spooky  the equal of Karloff's monster when he first appears and slowly shuffles around toward the camera. Caligari himself is adorned with an unruly aura of white hair and thick gogglelike eyeglasses. He wears white gloves with three thin black strips on the back just like Mickey Mouse.It might be possible to argue that this is expressionism for expressionism's sake  but that's not the case. The framing story takes place in sets that more closely resemble the world that you and I are familiar with. The Boschian garden of earthly delights in which most of the story takes place is as crazy as it is for a good reason which I can't explain here.There's no other film quite like it. Expressionism been pretty influential over the years but the dark shadows and crooked streets of most later films are only dry dead leaf echoes of this original.".

	schema:reviewBody "As Francis Friedrich Feher sits on a garden bench with an older and skeptical man a woman named Jane Lil Dagover wearing outlandish makeup sleepwalks in a nightgown as she passes them. Francis explains that she is his fiance and that they have suffered a great ordeal. This bizarre opening begins a flashback of Francis' story which covers much of the movie. Francis recalls that he and his friend Alan Hans Heinrich von Twardowski who have a friendly rivalry for Jane's affections had planned on visiting the local town fair at Holstenwall Germany. The painted set of the town hall shows all the buildings cramped together at odd angles with narrow passages weird window shapes peculiar furniture uneven stairs and gray and black shadows covering the white walls. To us these distorted images convey the madness of twisted brains that belong to a different ethos. Now an ominouslooking man named Dr. Caligari Werner Krauss seeks a permit from the town clerk to open a booth and present a somnambulist act at the fair NOTE somnambulism relates to sleepwalking a disorder. Although the clerk harangues Dr. Caligari he approves the permit. But the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed late that night. Then at the fair Francis Alan and Jane enter Dr. Caligari's tent. Caligari summons awake the ashen somnambulist Cesare Conrad Veidt after he has supposedly been sleeping for 25 years ! in a cabinet which looks like a casket. Prompted by Caligari to ask Cesare a question Alan says How long do I have to live? Until dawn responds Cesare shocking Alan. Their fun over the trio quickly depart. Just before the next day begins Alan is seen through the shadows being murdered. Francis goes to the police with his suspicions that Dr. Caligari is behind the murders. At his wagon abode Caligari tells the police that Cesare never leaves his cabinet without permission. The police soon pick up a common criminal who is about to knife an older woman. He is charged with the murders even though he admits only to the attempted murder and not the previous two killings. As Francis and Jane continue to investigate Caligari the doctor orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he attempts to murder her she screams and faints. Obviously attracted to Jane physically Cesare carries her away and leads the aroused townsfolk on a lengthy chase across a crooked trail. Finally placing Jane down Cesare falls from a height to his death. The townsfolk go to Caligari's wagon only to find the doctor gone and a dummy in Cesare's cabinet.Francis travels to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether Caligari might be an escaped patient. An employee tells Francis that he must personally see the director of the institute as he is not allowed to discuss patients. At the director's office it turns out that the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same. So Francis is certain that he was correct all along Caligari must be doing the killings and he just happens to be a lunatic asylum director. Francis summons the police who head to the director's office which is temporarily unoccupied. Rummaging through the director's books Francis discovers that in eighteenth century northern Italy there was a huckster named Caligari who had a hypnotized somnambulist that he trained to commit murder. As he kept the book the asylum director must have liked what he read. When the director returns to his office he is confronted with the dead Cesare and goes berserk. He states he must become the new Caligari. The staff in the institute put him in a straitjacket and he is confined in his own asylum. Here the narrative ends but the story is not over.SPOILERS There is a major twist at the end. Francis now through telling his tale in the garden goes to the courtyard of the asylum with the old man. Shapes are now normal and the tilted walls of the next sets are at right angles. Both men see that Cesare is alive and stands in a corner of the yard. Jane thinking that she is a noble rejects Francis by telling him that he does not have royal blood. Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs and when Francis accuses the doctor of being the killer and scuffles with him the orderlies restrain Francis in a straitjacket. The doctor says that he has a cure for Francis. IT WAS FRANCIS WHO WAS DERANGED ALL ALONG HE MADE UP THE TALE! And Jane Cesare and the old man are all lunatics in the insane asylum!

	onyx:emotionText "As Francis Friedrich Feher sits on a garden bench with an older and skeptical man a woman named Jane Lil Dagover wearing outlandish makeup sleepwalks in a nightgown as she passes them. Francis explains that she is his fiance and that they have suffered a great ordeal. This bizarre opening begins a flashback of Francis' story which covers much of the movie. Francis recalls that he and his friend Alan Hans Heinrich von Twardowski who have a friendly rivalry for Jane's affections had planned on visiting the local town fair at Holstenwall Germany. The painted set of the town hall shows all the buildings cramped together at odd angles with narrow passages weird window shapes peculiar furniture uneven stairs and gray and black shadows covering the white walls. To us these distorted images convey the madness of twisted brains that belong to a different ethos. Now an ominouslooking man named Dr. Caligari Werner Krauss seeks a permit from the town clerk to open a booth and present a somnambulist act at the fair NOTE somnambulism relates to sleepwalking a disorder. Although the clerk harangues Dr. Caligari he approves the permit. But the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed late that night. Then at the fair Francis Alan and Jane enter Dr. Caligari's tent. Caligari summons awake the ashen somnambulist Cesare Conrad Veidt after he has supposedly been sleeping for 25 years ! in a cabinet which looks like a casket. Prompted by Caligari to ask Cesare a question Alan says How long do I have to live? Until dawn responds Cesare shocking Alan. Their fun over the trio quickly depart. Just before the next day begins Alan is seen through the shadows being murdered. Francis goes to the police with his suspicions that Dr. Caligari is behind the murders. At his wagon abode Caligari tells the police that Cesare never leaves his cabinet without permission. The police soon pick up a common criminal who is about to knife an older woman. He is charged with the murders even though he admits only to the attempted murder and not the previous two killings. As Francis and Jane continue to investigate Caligari the doctor orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he attempts to murder her she screams and faints. Obviously attracted to Jane physically Cesare carries her away and leads the aroused townsfolk on a lengthy chase across a crooked trail. Finally placing Jane down Cesare falls from a height to his death. The townsfolk go to Caligari's wagon only to find the doctor gone and a dummy in Cesare's cabinet.Francis travels to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether Caligari might be an escaped patient. An employee tells Francis that he must personally see the director of the institute as he is not allowed to discuss patients. At the director's office it turns out that the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same. So Francis is certain that he was correct all along Caligari must be doing the killings and he just happens to be a lunatic asylum director. Francis summons the police who head to the director's office which is temporarily unoccupied. Rummaging through the director's books Francis discovers that in eighteenth century northern Italy there was a huckster named Caligari who had a hypnotized somnambulist that he trained to commit murder. As he kept the book the asylum director must have liked what he read. When the director returns to his office he is confronted with the dead Cesare and goes berserk. He states he must become the new Caligari. The staff in the institute put him in a straitjacket and he is confined in his own asylum. Here the narrative ends but the story is not over.SPOILERS There is a major twist at the end. Francis now through telling his tale in the garden goes to the courtyard of the asylum with the old man. Shapes are now normal and the tilted walls of the next sets are at right angles. Both men see that Cesare is alive and stands in a corner of the yard. Jane thinking that she is a noble rejects Francis by telling him that he does not have royal blood. Dr. Caligari comes down the stairs and when Francis accuses the doctor of being the killer and scuffles with him the orderlies restrain Francis in a straitjacket. The doctor says that he has a cure for Francis. IT WAS FRANCIS WHO WAS DERANGED ALL ALONG HE MADE UP THE TALE! And Jane Cesare and the old man are all lunatics in the insane asylum! That is why the buildings and landscapes are all distorted! Pretty heavy stuff for 19191920!This Gothic murder plot of a crazed doctor ordering a somnambulist to kill is more complicated.

I'm not in the business to say which film does something first and it hardly matters in my books.

I am talking about the infamous twist ending sure. But in an age where every story seems to implement a twist or two every five minutes this term has lost its power to me to fully describe to full effect of what was done in this film. So the film is framed as a story narrated by Francis himself a central character in the story being told. The shock twist of course reveals to us that Francis Jane and Cesare are actually mentally unstable and locked in an asylum. In other words what we have seen is actually a fantasy and we realize that the narrator cannot be trusted.This is very brilliant and one of the most powerful and successful explorations of the notion of the unreliable narrator in the twentieth century. But the film goes further. What I speak of now is the use of architecture. The most beautiful visual clue in the narrative is actually planted in what we see in the wildly imaginative sets and production art. This is one example where its reputation as a German Expressionist film actually stands in the way of us being able to enjoy it for what it is at least it did for me since it's easy to write off the set design just as German Expressionist. But the reason why the film world looks the way it does is because this is a fantasy this is a world created by Francis who sees the world differently from us hence he's labelled insane. But the most shocking revelation that the end brings is that what we've witnessed is not only a tale of a madman it's actually what we've seen that has been in reality a film seen through a madman's lens.

Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.But they're right for once.Joaquin Phoenix wears Johnny Cash like a suit. He isn't doing a Rich Little impersonation you don't rub your eyes in disbelief but he channels a man so distinct in appearance and voice to a level that is beyond admirable. One of the traits that made Johnny Cash a legend was that nobody sounded or looked like him. Short of a computer generated Cash walking around in his own biopic like one of those John Wayne beer commercials this is the definitive representation.And yet Phoenix may not give the best performance in the film.Reese Witherspoon more than holds up her end in a role that easily could have been reduced to a clichd bumpkin. Witherspoon portrays the onstage June in the way June portrayed her own character the stage persona that people adored while giving her the resolve and inner strength to be the woman who tamed a hellbent grizzly bear of a man like John.The chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon together in any scene but their onstage duets in particular are truthful in a way that resonates long after the credits. I know that unless you have been living in a cave for the past week you have likely been bombarded with the word that the actors sing themselves without use of lip syncing. I have never been a fan of musicals or even musical performances in a film. They generally seem forced and uncomfortable to me the moment when I stop experiencing the story and feel reminded that I am watching a movie. I never felt that in this film. I never felt that their singing took the focus of the film but the performances work with the story like no other music bio I have ever seen. I never felt as if I was being led through the catalog the songs felt as organic and natural as any spoken dialog in a great narrative.This film far exceeded my expectations and afforded me the first trip home from a theater with a true feeling of satisfaction in a very very long time. Highly recommended.".

Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene or four letter word. Yes some movies need that to tell the story this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics with Ray. Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.".

No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene or four letter word. Yes some movies need that to tell the story this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics with Ray. Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.";

Like the great directors of the Hollywood studio system Mangold shows visual and narrative skill across a wide array of genres characterdriven crime COPLAND horror IDENTITY issueoriented drama GIRL INTERRUPTED etc. What each of these films shares in common is a stunningly elegant and expressive visual style an attention to character reminiscent of Renoir and an economy of storytelling that would make Howard Hawks envious.Now Mangold has delivered his masterpiece and it's the best studio release I've seen so far this year. WALK THE LINE Mangold's story of the relationship between Johnny Cash and June Carter is deliriously romantic exhiliratingly entertaining as a musical it invites and earns comparison with the best of Vincente Minelli and profoundly movingall set to a spectacular soundtrack. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are both brilliant as Cash and Carter but not only in the ways you would expect. Their most impressive achievement is to convincingly portray two people falling in love in a manner that's sincere and sweet but never cheaply sentimental. This is the most unabashedly romantic American movie since THE NOTEBOOK but it's totally authentic and lacking in melodrama the subtlety with which Mangold and his performers delineate the one step forward two steps back nature of Cash and Carter's love affair is staggering. Phoenix is particularly brilliant not only in the romantic scenes but in moments in which Cash discusses his brother's early death in these scenes the major tragedies of both the character and the performer's lives merge in a way that is heartbreakingly real. And the movie gets across the intoxicating nature of creative collaboration between two people in love better than any film I've ever seenperhaps no coincidence given that Mangold and his closest collaborator producer Cathy Konrad are married. I could and will go on about this movie for hours but let's just say that it's the movie to beat for the rest of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walk the Line reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating 3.5 out of 4Director James Mangold Cast Joaquin Phoenix Reese Witherspoon Screenplay James Mangold Gill Dennis based off the Johnny Cash autobiographies MPAA Classification PG13 language drug contentTo be honest I've never been a fan of Johnny Cash's music. I listened to it every now and then when flipping through the presets in my car stopping to sing along to the few lyrics I knew but I never gave the musician much thought. Until now. For me Walk the Line is everything Ray was not. Ray was plagued by an uneven screenplay but got enough sentimentality and acting points for people to look past its flaws and managed to nab a Best Picture nomination. Walk the Line however is worth all the press it's likely to get. With acting work just as impressive as Ray's music just as affecting and a screenplay that hits all the right chords Walk the Line is a fine fair biopic for Mr. Cash. The film faces the threat of what music critics call samesonginess. A volley of biopics have been released in the past year making it only a matter of time before American audiences call it quits for the genre. Making matters worse the story arcs for Ray and Walk the Line are essentially the same. A small time musician with tragic childhood memories goes on to become an international sensation but finds himself wrapped up with extramarital women and illegal drugs. Yes it sounds like a rehash of Ray but believe me Walk the Line's storytelling works much much smoother. Also what Ray lacked was romance. Yeah yeah I know there was that cute scene with the hummingbird but that little tidbit will be soon forgotten when Reese Witherspoon hits the screen. Taking on the role of June Carter Witherspoon takes a page from her role in Vanity Fair and not Just Like Heaven and completely inhabits her character. Her pairing with Joaquin Phoenix yields beautiful chemistry and makes their romance believably realistic something I frankly didn't feel with Ray. There's sure to be some trepidation over the fact that Director James Mangold used Phoenix and Witherspoon's real voices for Cash and Carter's songs. Again I'm not really an authority on Johnny Cash music but from what I've heard Phoenix and Carter nail it. And Cash enthusiast Roger Ebert who was in the same screening room as me and heard the same songs stated afterwards that he was incredibly impressed by their mimicry. To extend my comparison between Ray and Walk the Line I found James Mangold's directing style for Cash's biopic to be very similar to the formula used by Taylor Hackford in Ray. Each put a strong visual emphasis on the musical scenes and neither busied themselves with distracting camera tricks or visual pizazz. There are beautiful shots to be found in both films but this is no Fernando Meirelles The Constant Gardener behind the camera. Instead where each director plays his cards is with the screenplay. And this is where Walk the Line truly shows its colors.Biopics are difficult in that a coherent story must be told over a great span of chronology. Films often run into the problem of trying to fit too much into a two hour film an issue Ray suffered from. For instance when Ray starts his downward spiral with Heroin and begins poking himself with needles there were often straight cuts to joyous scenes of his son being born or him returning home to his wife from a tour. The story never let itself settle down with a mood and tell a coherent story. Instead the film jumped around so much it left audiences dazed and numb to the emotions onscreen. But Walk the Line avoids this problem with James Mangold and Gill Dennis' screenplay which is based off of Cash's two autobiographies. The script gives Walk the Line a backbone for the story to follow keeping a foundation for the subplots to wrap themselves around. This foundation is Cash's obsession with June Carter. His childhood story and even his music are motivated by this romance. She was the center of his life up until his death and she's the center of this film. And with Witherspoon's performance as terrific as it is the foundation is solid as rock.If the American public is still willing to pay money for a musician's biopic then Walk the Line's their film. Of the recent four I've seen DeLovely Ray Beyond the Sea Walk the Line's the finest. www.samseescinema.com".

What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew??? And Joaquin! We've been waiting for him to deliver a really spectacular performance for some time and this is finally it.

	schema:reviewBody "Having just left the Press and Industry screening at the Toronto Fest I thought I'd pass along a few words on an Oscar contender.First this is an excellent film. Second it is formulaic but not to a fault. The film is two great performances. Luckily they're the right two. Phoenix has done an excellent job capturing Cash the man. Not the legend and not what everyone thought he would be. What made Johnny Cash such an icon was that he was an everyman and Phoenix gives his all to not only capture every subtle nuance but also to make him believable as a flawed human being. Watch in particular the performance sequences and I'd argue that it's equal to Foxx's Ray Charles without nearly as much caricature.There's no attempts on behalf of the filmmakers at the predestination of Cash as a superstar. They simply show how he learned to sing with a radio and a hymnal. The back story given before his career started is essential to the way his life unfolds and for the most part is kept in wellshot and brief sequences. There are few attempts to overglamourize or overdramatize the events that shaped Cash's life and career. Thankfully as well there are no attempts to recreate his drug use for the audience's benefit in cinematic terms.Reese Witherspoon's performance as well is surprisingly good. There are precious few points in the film where you remember she was in Legally Blonde and her vocals and live performances are stronger than many I've seen from Hollywood actresses in recent years.So with all this greatness what could be wrong? Nothing really. This is a solid film but it is completely conventional. It doesn't go for the weepy Oscar moments that drown many films and it doesn't try to cover too much of the man's life focusing mostly on his years between his Sun Records contract and his At Folsom Prison album. If you have no love for the man himself or his music you may walk away underwhelmed but otherwise you'll be pleased.It is a fairly standard biopic. All a filmmaker needs to make one work is a loved or hated subject a decent lead performance and as few distractions outside of that as can be managed. That is its flaw if you must find one.Walk the Line is a wellmade movie. Mangold's direction is capable and the script stays fairly true to the biographies upon which it was based. It does have excellent performances but barring a groundswell of support for Cash's legacy which could arise I don't see it running away with any awards. It will contend for some due to excellent performances. Considering Ray was about a halfhour too long I'd even go so far as to say it has an excellent shot at a Best Picture nomination. But a win may be difficult.I'd highly recommend it but don't say I didn't warn you if following the rules is in fact a bad thing.".

It doesn't go for the weepy Oscar moments that drown many films and it doesn't try to cover too much of the man's life focusing mostly on his years between his Sun Records contract and his At Folsom Prison album. If you have no love for the man himself or his music you may walk away underwhelmed but otherwise you'll be pleased.It is a fairly standard biopic. All a filmmaker needs to make one work is a loved or hated subject a decent lead performance and as few distractions outside of that as can be managed. That is its flaw if you must find one.Walk the Line is a wellmade movie. Mangold's direction is capable and the script stays fairly true to the biographies upon which it was based. It does have excellent performances but barring a groundswell of support for Cash's legacy which could arise I don't see it running away with any awards. It will contend for some due to excellent performances. Considering Ray was about a halfhour too long I'd even go so far as to say it has an excellent shot at a Best Picture nomination. But a win may be difficult.I'd highly recommend it but don't say I didn't warn you if following the rules is in fact a bad thing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Walk the Line is without question the zenith of Reese Witherspoon's acting career thus far. Joaquin Phoenix IS Johnny Cash in this biopic but Reese as June Carter Cash sets this film on fire. It is one thing to portray a person's life with feeling and emotion something which Joaquin pulls off effortlessly. However it is quite another to make a portrayal bigger than life and Reese makes June Carter Cash the central character of this film.To say that Reese steals the show is an understatement. Reese becomes a lightning rod for Joaquin's character in a way that is actually quite scary. After all Reese is from Nashville and her Southern affect is flawless and absolutely winning. Suffice it to say that Reese will thankfully be present when the Academy Awards are presented next year. She might want to get a few words ready.This movie will not be everyone's favorite flick if for no other reason than that it is a biopic of flawed Southern characters. However perhaps the very flaws that imbue these characters with vitality and realism can establish the acting of Joaquin and Reese with an almost spiritual meaning as they live these real people on screen. But in the final analysis Reese Witherspoon will become the greatest contemporary screen actor upon release of this film. See for yourself. You read it here first.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before watching this film I had my doubts. Johnny Cash is one of my favourite country singers nay singers of all time and I was unsure as whether as with other mediocre biopics namely the flashy Ray could do him enough justice. As it turned out Johnny gets the film he deserves and what's more Walk the Line got me extremely interested in the work of his wife June Carter Cash.Covering 20 years of his life including Cash's rise into fame and delve into nearselfdestruction James Mangold concentrates on the key things in his life  his music the drugs and his allconsuming untameable love for the very special June Carter Cash. It is as a romance that Walk the Line truly shines. In real life Johnny and June didn't get together until 20 years since their first meeting and that they could wait that long for each other is quite poignant.Holding the film together are the Oscarnominated and Oscarwinning figures of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon and their chemistry pretty much carries the film. When they're together they both dazzle gelling perfectly whether it's a bout of verbal jesting they're doing a duet or just chatting. Phoenix captures the tortured soul of Cash eloquently in one of his finest performances and one that exudes that dangerous yet enthralling edge of danger present in Cash. His singing voice resembles that of Cash's yet he never resorts to downright imitation which only adds to the viewing pleasure.But the shining star of the film is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash. She plays the singersongwritercountry music star that grabbed the attentions of Johnny Cash but proved a hard win forcing him to quit his narcotic dependence and violent selfdestruction before she'd consider him. Although many have disliked Witherspoon's work her I simply adore it. She makes June a truly memorable Crouchesque person. For the audience she can be goofy and lovable but alone with Johnny she displays a vulnerable side. Witherspoon here radiates a strong feminist yet effortlessly lovable vibe and every scene she appears in she steals.The look and feel of Johnny's time are captured well in the set design and TBone Burnett guitarled score and the costumes are nothing short of sublime. The dressing of Cash is inspired but it is June's clothes  floral print pink domestic or snazzy that again steal the show. Each of Reese's costumes captures the mood of her characters.There's also great fun to be had in the musical numbers. Ring of Fire and Jukebox Blues allow the audience to get their toes tapping but my favourite number is the performance of Jackson where their unmatched chemistry is showcased in one of my favourite songs of alltime. Like the film this song is entertaining sweet and more intelligent than frequently given credit for.".

	schema:headline " Excellent  review by Johnny Cash close friend and minister";
	schema:reviewBody "I was delighted when John Carter Cash invited me to attend the premier showing of Walk The Line.I hope that those who view this movie will see the spiritual connections between John his family and those with whom he choose to associate. I am privileged to have been one of those who John called a friend. And to the producers and directors It would be a blessing if the story of Johnny and June Cash's remarkable lives is continued from the point at which Walk The Line ended.Johnny Cash and I were close personal friends for over twenty years. I loved him as a brother and miss him dearly. In the early 90's he asked me to call him every day and I did so as much as possible for the many remaining years of our friendship. I would talk with him daily whether we were traveling the world with me as the official 'Johnny Cash Show minister or evangelist' or while off the road and at home. We would talk about the things that most friends talk about but always always about God the Bible a new or a favorite verse or passage life's many challenges and encourage one another in overcoming them.John was one of the brightest individuals I've ever met and at times as the film shows one of the most troubled. John was one of God's sheep. He was as the movie shows living proof that redemption knows no limits other than our own refusal to accept it. Just as evening wolves stalk sheep so the wolves of darkness pursued John. Yet somehow I believe he knew that even though a sheep cannot triumph over a wolf he can beat it every time by staying close to the shepherd and showed up at the feet of God quite often.June Carter Cash was also a treasured friend. She graciously laid aside the opportunities of her own career and gifted talent to become John's lifelong soul mate and a fiercely loyal devotee to keeping him happy and making him 'walk the line'. Reese Witherspoon portrayed June accurately. June was also a faithful gatekeeper for John and taught all of us who were allowed through that 'gate' the grit and grace of friendship once a friend a friend always. The world will never be the same without June and likewise Heaven will never be the same with her there.I deeply enjoyed this film. Overall I felt that the story was credible and portrayed accurately.I commend Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon for delivering 'believability'. This was certainly a far from easy task drawing deeply from their Godgiven talent when you consider the extraordinary lives of the complex and unique individuals they portrayed.I was appreciative of the spiritual content that was gracefully present for it was such a vital part of their lives. Joaquin Phoenix's insightful handling of the lifelong struggle that John endured regarding his brother Jack's disastrous death renewed deep emotions within me. John and I each lost an older brother in tragic accidents when we were young. This gave me an even deeper sense of and identification with the pain he suffered but rarely talked about.There is much more that I could express about this significant film regarding the unique and remarkable lives portrayed in Walk The Line and the treasured friendship and fellowship that God allowed John and I to share. If John could I believe he would ask me to help others understand how he felt about God and how he tried to live his life. Therefore please allow me to share a letter that he wrote to me in Australia.Jack Shaw's ministry in tandem with the Johnny Cash Show may be a first in the entertainment business. The Idea came to June and me on a tour last summer. Jack has long been a close friend and prayer warrior for our group and family. Before each concert we form a prayer circle in the dressing room with our family and any other members of the group who wish to join in. Jack leads a fiveminute service of scripture reading sharing and prayer. The service is uplifting and has put a positive poweredge on our performances.Recently we took what I felt was a bold step in that toward the end of the concert I introduce Jack who is positioned near the stage in the audience and mention that he will be there after the concert to offer free counseling and advice on moral and spiritual matters. I tell them that he is a minister of the Gospel and will talk to them about their personal problems drug and alcohol addiction or simply about the Bible and what God has to say to them. As well as daily ministering to the needs of my eighteenmember group many people have come down to talk to Jack after the concert every night.Lives are changed souls are saved spirits are lifted and light is brought into the darkness of many hearts.We are being led by inspiration and I believe that God is guiding Jack in this great work he is now doing. The potential is unlimited and we feel Jack is just beginning in a great work. He gives us strength and peace through the Word and prayer. June and I feel supercharged especially for the gospel part of our program. Jack's presence and his involvement in our work has given us an extra portion of joy and enthusiasm.Jack is a humble man and it is obvious that he only wants to serve God. Believers and nonbelievers alike have come to know that and respect that. Jack Shaw Ministries has cut a new path and the fruit of the harvest from the seeds sown along the way will be bountiful.

Interestingly I eventually acquired a taste for just about all of them to one degree or another! Well pretty much everythingJazz not so much really and definitely NOT at all Country music. The ONLY Country album I EVER bought in my ENTIRE life Well at least before turning 50! was Johnny Cash His Greatest Hits! Upon realizing that they had released a movie about his life it immediately went to the top of my Must See list! What was it about his music that gave it such widespread appeal? Exactly what made Johnny Cash so special? It would be nice to be able to provide a simple straightforward answer to both questions but in the film Walk the Line it is all too clear that in real life when it comes to a human being things sure can get extremely complicated! So here we end up with a movie that mirrors the life of its lead character very interesting entertaining multifaceted but at the same time often dark brooding and conflicted! WALK is a film I can wholeheartedly recommend no matter how you feel about Johnny Cash andor his music.Quite frankly for the role of Johnny Cash Joaquin Phoenix GLADIATOR is not someone who would have made my short list or even my long list for that matter! Wow what a surprise! This actor who was born in Puerto Rico demonstrates tremendous versatility both as an actor as well as a singer... Yes that is Joaquin Phoenix's own voice in the movie! However I think that at times Mr. Phoenix comes up just a little bit short when it comes to his ability to project his voice firmly but his performance in general was so masterful that this point is quite easily overlooked.What really drives WALK what gives it its soul and keeps it focused and centered is the repressed romance between Cash and the love of his life June Carter Reese Witherspoon  Legally Blonde Cruel Intentions Joaquin Phoenix despite shining in the title role is overshadowed by Witherspoon's overwhelming screen presence in the scenes where they appear together. Previously she had never really flagged my attention that much perhaps other than her notable characterization of Tracey Flick in ELECTION. In most of her roles she seemed to be type cast as the syrupy sweet but at the same time somewhat annoying girl next door! WALK is well worth any time and money you invest to see Reese demonstrate her considerable acting talents ... And how clearly she demonstrates just how stunning those abilities are! Surely Walk the Line for many reasons invites comparison with another film about the life of another famous musician RAY. Perhaps there are many common elements in the life of famous musicians A tragic childhood years struggling in anonymity problems with alcohol and drugs a great deal of conflict and tension in their affectative relationships and great difficulty accepting and managing fame and money. But after all each story is real and each contains many elements that distinguishes it from others! 8...ENJOY!DISFRUTELA! Any comments questions or observations in English o en Espaol are welcome!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash an American icon of sorts. Yes his life and career are notable  the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter his descent into alcohol and drugs and his final victory over his demons  but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles succeeding in them all. And yes he was able to sound like Johnny Cash given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message. Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter  again it was her sassy style that made her a star not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter  leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.But if you condensed the actual acting time on the screen it falls into the overly familiar family clashes drunken bouts weaning off drugs spats and eventual public displays of feelings that seem to be the formula for this genre of biopic. Though Phoenix and to an extent Witherspoon do well with the material they are given does the result merit Oscar attention? That is up to the voters. It seems to this viewer that there have been many finer performances by less publicized actors in the smaller films more worthy. But then what are the Oscars for if not for PR for the movies. Just not that impressed. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie last night and I've done nothing but talk about the movie and listen to Johnny's music ever since.Without a doubt Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon will be nominated for Oscars for their roles in this movie. Joaquin was just electrifying and Reese as the hardheaded but loving June was simply wonderful. The music was outstanding. I'm glad Joaquin and Reese performed the songs because I would hate to know that I'd missed hearing what wonderful voices they have. I was especially happily surprised by Reese's voice. It's gorgeous. I've read recent reports that the family of Vivian Cash Johnny's first wife was upset by how their mother was depicted in the movie but I don't really understand that. Ginnifer Goodwin another one who deserves an Oscar nomination showed Vivian's grief of being alone raising her daughters alone and knowing in her heart that her husband was in love with June. According to the movie Johnny was a horrible husband to Vivian and I thought the movie did a good job of not sugarcoating that fact. I admit I cheered a little when she smashed the picture of June because you couldn't really blame her for doing that.The supporting characters were also wonderful. It was so nice to see Shooter Jennings playing the role of his father Waylon. Another Waylon Waylon Payne played Jerry Lee Lewis with wideeyed craziness. I thought Shelby Lynne who is wellknown in the country music industry was wonderful as Johnny's mother.I didn't know a lot about Johnny's early years with Sun Records so it was great to see that on screen. I also didn't know that June finally accepted John's proposal while they were on stage singing Jackson. I'm assuming that was true and not just movie magic. This movie and John and June's love story was magical. I don't find it surprising that John died four months after June passed. It was obvious that she was the love of his life.".

That is I should say until I saw this movie. When I got home from seeing it I immediately ordered Live From Folsom Prison and Live From San Quinten on Amazon.This wasn't a movie at all really. It was a two and a half hour tour de force of incredible acting great music and storytelling. You just don't get bored for one second and can't look away the whole time. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is one of the best acting jobs in recent years. He isn't acting like Johnny Cash he IS Johnny Cash. Reese Witherspoon is also great as June Carter. The fact that Phoenix had never sung or played guitar before this movie was filmed caused me to wonder how he was going to pull this off. But his rendition of Get Rhythm and Cocaine Blues in the Folsom scene are some of the best music performances in movie history. He takes over the screen and just kicks your ass. It is hard to believe that he is not a professional musician.The music performances are enough to make this film worth seeing. But the love story between these two the way that June and her family helped him back from his drug addiction are what gives the film its heart. I would recommend this film to anyone Johnny Cash fan or not. If you don't like him now you will when the movie is over".

	schema:headline " Walking The Line With Johnny And Ray";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching this movie yesterday couldn't help but remind me in a number of respects. to Ray a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era the main difference between the color of their skin Ray being Ray Charles of course and this movie about Johnny Cash.Both singers and films 1  had a brother who died early on in their lives which affected them for years and years 2  were made to feel guilty about those deaths even though there was no reason for that guilt 3  had adulterous affairs as their singing careers began to take off 4  became addicted to drugs and beat that addiction 5  made bold decisions regarding their careers that went against prevailing thought but turned out to be the right decisions 6  movies featured outstanding music and slick photography 7  movies were fastmoving and interesting to view all the way through despite being over two hours long 8  featured wonderful acting performances.In Walk The Line Joaquin Phoenix who plays Cash goes one up on Jamie Foxx who played Charles because Phoenix did his own singing....and he was very good. The same applies to Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Her singing talent surprised me. It makes the film all the more believable when you know the actors are actually singing.I am not familiar with Ginnifer Goodwin who played Cash's first wife but I think she gets unfairly ignored in the publicity of this film. Perhaps the biggest surprise was seeing Robert Patrick as Cash's father. Wasn't this the same young trim villain in Terminator 2 which wasn't out that long ago? How can this be the same guy?!!I think this was the better of the two films not just because of the realism but Charles seemed almost cold no love in him no commitment to any woman or his own kids while Cash has a lot of more heart to him even if it was misplaced at times.That seems to be the major theme of the WTL movie the romance between Cash and Carter. Unfortunately that's my only complaint about this film. This movie glamorizes this affair between Cash and Carter just a little too much manipulating the audience to the point where we all want this couple to live happily ever after forgetting that Cash was married to another nice woman with two kids. Yeah some of the ugly parts of adultery are shown but not to the degree the sweetness of this illicit romance is portrayed. The movie does not send a strong enough message that the right thing to do is for Cash to be a good father and husband in the first place and for Carter to stay away from him  period. The worst scene in the film might be Cash's two kids crying their eyes out watching their parents fight. Adultery always kills the kids more than anyone which is one big reason I was sorry to see the Cash  Carter affair so romanticized.I'd have liked to have seen Cash's prison ministry detailed a little more since he was so faithful in that area and his Christian testimony in general which was very strong his last few decades but the film didn't deal with those last three decades. Too bad but understandable since there is just so much you can show in two hours. The filmmakers took the triedandtrue road of a romance story instead which makes sense businesswise.With all the goods and bads the film succeeds on being a great piece of entertainment with fantastic music acting visuals and a guarantee to please a lot of people almost as many as Cash did in his eventful life. He was an amazing man and a fourhour film about the rest of the story would have been fine with me.".

	schema:headline " Phoenix Mesmerizing in a Raw Portrait of Masculine Power and Vulnerability";
	schema:reviewBody "Walk the Line is a good movie but what makes it well worth going out of your way for even if you are not a country music or Johnny Cash fan is Joaquin Phoenix's raw mesmerizing performance of masculine power and vulnerability. Phoenix deserved the Academy Award for this performance and more.Early in the film music producer Sam Phillips in a wonderful speech encapsulating the power of pop music demands a great performance out of the then unknown J. R. Cash. Cash who has not yet sung professionally and who could have crumpled after Phillips' challenge slowly emerges out of himself like a snake emerging out of its skin. Phoenix communicates both the power and the risk of this performance. You heart breaks for what he's going through and you get goosebumps for what he's about to become. That scene is worth the price of admission.But there's more success sex with groupies drugs onstage triumphs and embarrassments near death and resurrection. Phoenix just knocks every scene right out of the park.Phoenix is unforgettable as a man in love. I've never seen an actor communicate in love with a woman as profoundly as Phoenix does here.As for the singing  Phoenix does his own singing. His voice is close enough to Cash's to work but it's more than that. It's also arresting and beautiful and worth listening to on its own.There are some weaker performances  underwritten parts in Walk the Line. Perhaps the filmmakers did this in order to make Cash a drug addict and adulterer more sympathetic to the audience. This was a mistake. Cash's story is compelling enough we could handle placing Cash in a world populated by real people rather than cardboard cutouts.Walk the Line's Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison are not as hyper and unique onstage as they were in real life. Lewis onstage was about five times more electrified than he is depicted here. Walk the Line's Elvis Presley is about junk food trash talk and drugs. The real Elvis was about those things too but he was also something more that's not even hinted at here.The worst example of making others look like less so Cash would look like more is the film's portrayal of Vivian Cash Johnny's first wife. She's just an unbearable horror show of a woman unsupportive grasping snappish. She's not given one sympathetic moment. Vivian and Johnny's daughters have protested that Vivian was not well served by the movie. And Cash's mother is played by an actress who is roughly the same age as Phoenix and that shows.Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her depiction of June Carter Cash. She is good. The script didn't make as clear her role as Cash's savior as Cash's own comments have.I'm not a huge fan of country music so I delayed seeing this movie. When I finally saw it what made it worth it to me was Phoenix's performance. He's just riveting in every scene and well worth seeing this movie for.".

The endless live performances by the cast just frustrated the hell out of me if I wanted to listen to the man in black live I could just have bought the recording from Fulsome which would actually have been much better? His father randomly has an element of respect for him at the end of the film? How the hell did that happen? He just woke up one morning and decided 'son you're the one with all the stories'? I just think the hyperbole which surrounds this film is totally unjustified. The plot is boring the script is tepid and the cast Witherspoon aside totally forgettable. I don't even think it's a case for different people different tastes it's just an awful film with so many gaps in the story which could have been filled by taking out the musical sections it's just a waste of time to watch?".

Although even June Carter seemed prepared to have him once he gets a grip on himself alone first and I don't blame her. From a troubled childhood we were taken through an unhappy first marriage the rise to fame the hits and the heartbreaks. The movie really finds its feet when singer June Carter shows up and the pairs relationship provides the movie with a heart. Some great performance acting I must admit pretty outstanding. The story is gripping with Cash's life providing plenty of juicy material but ultimately what is revealed is much more fascinating. It was not just the hard times but also if not mostly his love of an amazing woman that fuelled most of his musical genius.".

After Forbes arrives to help he and his friend uncover a mix of voodoo grave robbing and the undead in this lesser known Hammer title that certainly deserves a greater renown. And thanks to the fine folks at Anchor Bay this film's popularity may soon spread beyond its current cult reputation. Plague features an intelligent script fine acting solid photography and great atmosphere. Andre Morell's doctor makes for a very reassuring action hero despite the actor's age he was 57 at the time this picture was made. The film boasts three very chilling scenes the first nighttime appearance of a zombie on a hillside the muchcelebrated dream sequence and Alice's rising from her grave. The smile on actress Jacqueline Pearce's face in this last scene is just haunting. Though marred by a somewhat disappointing finale the film remains a minor horror masterpiece and one of the scariest works that I've yet seen from the House of Hammer. This movie would make a wonderful double feature with the similarly themed White Zombie 1932 or with another Hammer film made that same year 1966 The Reptile featuring Pearce again and the same director John Gilling. Any way you watch it though the film is a real winner.".

Diane Clare 'The Haunting' his independent daughter Sylvia who becomes entangled in the mysterious goings on in a small Cornish village.

	schema:reviewBody "John Gilling directs with style and flair in one of his minor masterpieces The Plague of the Zombies.  Hammer only made one foray into the zombie subgenre with this film about a doctor and his daughter paying a visit to a former medical student who has written for help.  Apparently in his Cornish village men and women are dying without explanation and are showing symptoms the doctor cannot diagnose with any real degree of certainty.  Of course they soon discover that the bodies are no longer in their caskets and that many of them have been seen AFTER they have died.  Gilling effectively films the sequences of action that take place in typical Hammer style with an emphasis on suspense.  Although lacking the star power usually attributed to a Hammer production this film is right up there in terms of great Hammer films.  The only star is Andre Morrellyou may remember him as Watson in Hammer's The Hound of the Baskervilles.  Morrell is quite good and I think he should have been utilized more by the studio than he was.  The rest of the cast does a very credible job as well.  Gilling's camera is the real treat though as he really shoots several scenes quite effectively.  His dream sequence with the zombies tearing the earth from their way out into the open is a classic.  Now I know some people will make the inevitable comparison to this and Night of the Living Deada film that came AFTER this one. That is understandable using NOTLD as the barometer of all zombie films however let me just point out again that this film came before that one and may have aided Romero in some way.  Granted there are not a slew of similarities but Romero may have gleaned something for this production as it is apparent he did from The last Man on Earth and Carnival of Souls.  I too wish Hammer had done more with zombie films.  they would have given that subgenre a bit more class than is sometimes associated with it.".

It's actually quite a nice change of pace to see a cerebral zombie flick though  one that relies on mystery and characterization instead of torrents of gore.  As usual for a Hammer movie the cast consists of cool character actors who could outperform a good half of our current big stars.  Andre Morell is great as our concerned hero John Carson makes a suitably sleazy villain and veteran Hammer guest star Michael Ripper gets one of his meatiest most memorable roles.  A solid flick if not terribly fastpaced or gripping.  It's fun to summarize the plot to your friends when you're drunk it's about zombies...mining TIN!".

	schema:headline " Don't let the dubious plot put you off one of Hammer's best horror movies.";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in the year 1860 a rural Cornish village has been struck by a mysterious sickness which is killing off members of the community at an alarming rate. Baffled the local GP Peter Thompson Brook Williams calls in his old university mentor Sir James Forbes Andre Morell to help him find out what the disease is and to destroy it. Forbes and his young daughter Sylvia Diane Clare arrive to find that Thompson has lost all confidence in his ability and the locals have lost all faith in him too. Two more deaths follow in the village including Thompson's beloved wife Alice Jacqueline Pierce before it finally transpires that the laird of the community Squire Hamilton John Carson has been practicing witchcraft in order to kill off certain people before raising them from the dead as zombies for cheap labor in his tin mine. Forbes and Thompson have to fight their way through the superstitious and narrow minded ways of the locals in order to stop Hamilton before he eliminates the entire community and his next intended victim is Sylvia!The Plague Of The Zombies was shot backtoback with Hammer's other Cornish shocker The Reptile by director John Gilling at the legendary Bray Studios Berkshire England during the summer of 1965. Both pictures shared the same sets and these were redressed accordingly to their required use. But if you watch The Reptile you will recognise the same village and graveyard sets! It is worth noting that The Reptile is also rich in atmosphere despite the low budget and the limitations that backtoback shooting would suggest. Both Plague and The Reptile were released as supporting features to two of Hammer's main features the following year. The Reptile supported Rasputin The Mad Monk March 1966 and The Plague Of The Zombies went out with Dracula Prince Of Darkness in January 1966. Yet despite their second feature status both of Gilling's films outshone the main feature. When I first saw The Plague Of The Zombies some seven years ago when it was shown late one Friday night on Channel 4 I didn't think that it was going to be very good judging by the plot synopsis in my film guide. But when the end credits rolled I was astonished by just how good it really was. During the fifties John Gilling had directed a number of quotaquickie pictures and some of them were very mediocre but here he takes a rather dubious storyline and gives it a lot of weight by emphasising the distinct contrast between the superstitious country folk and the more forward thinking men of science and the lengths that the latter have to go to in order to solve the mystery. For instance they have been refused the right to perform any autopsies so it isn't until Alice dies that Forbes has to persuade Thompson to allow him to perform an autopsy to try and find out the cause of death. In addition there is an imaginatively staged greentinted nightmare sequence which is still talked about by horror buffs and it has been suggested that it inspired George A Romero when he made his Night Of The Living Dead only a few years later. In this memorable sequence Thompson sees the dead rise from their graves. This turns out to be a premonition as after he awakens Forbes and the local police sergeant Michael Ripper exhume all the graves to find them empty.The Plague Of The Zombies also features fine performances from Andre Morell as Sir James Forbes portraying him as a charming intelligent and resourceful man of science who is prepared to do anything for the benefit of good even though the superstitious locals don't always understand his methods and can't understand that what he's doing can only ultimately save them. Morell's performance is strong enough to rank among the best of Hammer's screen heroes such as Peter Cushing's Sherlock Holmes and Christopher Lee's Duc De' Richeleau. Brook Williams offers good support as Peter Thompson whilst Jacqueline Pierce is standout as his wife whom has to be decapitated by a shovel in order to save her from being enslaved to the cult of the undead forever. John Carson is suitably suave as the evil Squire Hamilton and ever present is the reliable Michael Ripper who played virtually everything for Hammer over the years including pirates old soaks and pub landlords and here he is equally versatile in the role of the sympathetic Sgt Swift.In summary many people agree including myself that The Plague Of The Zombies is John Gilling's finest hour as a director as this assignment gave him more opportunities than the quotaquickies to exploit the setting and place emphasis on the class structure of the time thus giving more weight to the plot. In addition Bernard Robinson's sets are excellent and Arthur Grant's cinematography is suitably atmospheric.".

Sir James decides to visit the friends with Sylvia and helps Peter to find out what is happening. There he realizes that the bodies of the new dead are disappearing from their graves. A further investigation shows them the existence of zombies in that location. This 1966 movie from Hammer just released on DVD in Brazil is a great film of zombies. There are just a few good movies about this subject that I can remember the best of them and classical 1968 The Night of the Living Dead' and the two others of George Romero's trilogy  Dawn of the Dead' and Day of the Dead' the good remake of The Night of the Living Dead' the great Bill Pullman's Brain Dead' and also great Jennifer's Grey Ritual'. This movie from Hammer is also an excellent one and if the viewer pays attention he will notice that it was made BEFORE the 1968 The Night of the Living Dead'. I supposed that George Romero's movie was the first important one to explore the zombie theme but now I realize that this 1966 Hammer's movie came first. My vote is eight.".

No sooner do they arrive when another victim surfaces and it's quickly becomes evident that something far more sinister than medical problems is at work here.Hammer Horror tackles the zombie subgenre with no little amount of success. Directed by John Gilling The Plague Of The Zombies was filmed back to back with the equally entertaining The Reptile. Filmed out of fortress Hammer that was Bray Studios the same sets that were used for The Reptile were also used here. With Bernard Robinson's Cornish Village again a treat for sore eyes. 1966 was the last year that Hammer used Bray Studios and it's fitting that it was a year that saw efficient and varying creepers filling out the Hammer Horror cannon. Peter Bryan's story aided by some interesting imagery delves into the dark world of witchcraft and voodoo thus giving this particular zombie piece an extra dimension. This is not merely about zombies roaming the countryside and killing indiscriminately. Evil they are of course but they have a purpose and being that comes to light as the story unfolds. There's also nods to tyranny and exploitation wryly observed by the makers here cheekily cloaked in a cloud of rotting flesh.Technically it holds up rather well too. The effects are strong enough to carry the story with the zombies eerie personified as they shuffle around all green flesh and grumbling away as we know they should. All captured in deluxe colour that comes out nice in High Definition. The cast are fine with Morell standing out as he gives his usual classy and professional performance while James Bernard's score is suitably at one with each and every change of pace. This is not just a fine and under appreciated part of the Hammer Horror output it's also a worthy and most notable entry in the zombie genre. See it if you can. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie begins with a young woman by the name of Alice Mary Tompson Jacqueline Pearce awakening from what appears to be a bad dream. The scene then shifts to London where a gentleman named Sir James Forbes Andre Morell is handed a letter from his daughter Sylvia Forbes Diane Clare. The letter just happens to come from the husband of Alice who goes by the name of Dr. Peter Tompson Brook Williams which details a mysterious ailment in the Cornish village where he and Alice live. Being a professor of medicine Sir James is intrigued and decides to travel to this village to check it out. Sylvia comes with him because she is anxious to see her good friend Alice. Anyway when they get there they soon discover that this plague is unlike anything they have ever come across and they cannot seem to isolate the cause. Now rather than disclose any more and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie was certainly quite watchable. At least for me. I say this because I typically like most zombie movies. Not only that but I especially like movies bearing the Hammer trademark. So this film definitely had my interest and I was not disappointed. Having said that however I think it's only fair to point out a couple of minor deficiencies. First the zombies looked a bit goofy. But considering that this movie was made in the mid60's I suppose one has to make some allowances. The other thing I noticed was that some of the acting was a bit mediocre at times. Not bad necessarily but a bit mediocre all the same. Be that as it may I liked the performance of Diane Clare and I also thought the story flowed very smoothly from one scene to the next. In short this was a fine preRomero zombie movie and I rate it as slightly above average.".

	schema:reviewBody "When we think about zombie films first titles that come to mind are George A. Romero's trilogy the Return of the living dead series and maybe Peter Jackson's Braindead. All good films off course but this 1966 film should definitely be on this top of mind list.It contains all ingredients off the ideal horror film suspense only the George Romero films have that too most others are more funny than scary. Several scenes just give you the creeps and you stare to them with your eyes wide open. Also great acting performances by rather unknown actors. The accents are typical British and very appropriate in the atmosphere of the film in my opinion of course the makeup effects and the creepy music just make the whole film complete. No negative remarks from my side !!!But perhaps what makes the film excellent the most is the very original story... Zombies rise from their grave and have only one mission  hunt the living !!...normally... In this Hammer production of course Hammer... you gotta love 'em the zombies are brought back by men for whole other causes... The highly respected Dr. Forbes receives a letter from one of his former students. This man Dr Peter Thomson now is the doctor in a small village in Cornwall. A lot of young men died in this village and he's calling Dr. Forbes for help. Dr. Forbes and his daughter Sylvia go there to help him out and they too soon discover that there's something very strange going on. they want to perform an autopsy on one of the bodies to find out more about the disease but this ain't possible because all of corpses disappeared. When Peter's wife becomes a victim of this disease too both the doctor's do everything to discover what in God's name is going on. One man in town is a great mystery...Mr. Hamilton. He recently came to town and now own the old mine. This mine was very profitable in the past but it had to be closed because many worker lost their lives. Nobody knows much about Mr. Hamilton except that spend many years in Hati...the country of voodoo. Telling more about this film would be a real shame cause the it's definitely worth checking out. If you're in the mood to see a good zombie film but a little more scarier than usual...this is your film".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been watching horror films since before I could walk and this is the first time I have viewed this. Story is about a doctor named Sir John Forbes Andre Morell who receives a letter one day from a former pupil who is asking for help because people in his village are dying under strange circumstances. Sir John and his daughter Sylvia Diane Clare head to the village and they find his former pupil Peter Tompson Brook Williams and his wife Alice Jacqueline Pearce who explain the problem at hand. Alice looks pale and sick and has a bad cut on her arm but she insists that she is fine. Sir John asks what the autopsies revealed and Peter tells him that the village Squire would not allow any autopsies due to religious practices. The village Squire is Clive Hamilton John Carson and he has many men who work for him and are very obedient and one day he comes to visit Sylvia. A glass breaks and Sylvia ends up with a cut finger and when she isn't looking he takes some of her blood and keeps it. Then one night Alice leaves her home and ends up dead. Peter is heartbroken and Sir John suggests that they dig up some bodies in the cemetary and when they do they discover that all of the coffins are empty! Sir John figures out that Squire Hamilton has practiced black magic and can make the dead rise up as zombies and make them work in his underground mine. But he has to hurry because the Squire has put a spell on Sylvia and plans on using her next! This was directed by John Gilling who along with Terence Fisher was very popular especially with fans of these films by Hammer Studios. Gilling filmed this and then went right ahead a week later to direct The Reptile back to back and some of the sets can be seen in both films. I think one of the reasons that this doesn't get mentioned much when people speak of Hammer films is because it lacked real recognizable faces in the cast. The whole cast is good and veterans of these types of films but here in America how many people knew who John Carson was? I think most viewers were accustomed to seeing Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in the leads and if they weren't than maybe they got pushed by the wayside over the years. The special effects are not bad and it was pretty eerie seeing Alice rise up out of her grave. But I did laugh at some of the scenes in the mine where some of the men were flogging the zombies with whips to make them work. I guess good workers are hard to find! What's the world coming to if you can't get a zombie to put in a decent days work? But this is an effective film and one of the few that Hammer made that dealt with Zombies. Creepy atmosphere and a good cast make this a fun film to view.".

Sir John asks what the autopsies revealed and Peter tells him that the village Squire would not allow any autopsies due to religious practices. The village Squire is Clive Hamilton John Carson and he has many men who work for him and are very obedient and one day he comes to visit Sylvia. A glass breaks and Sylvia ends up with a cut finger and when she isn't looking he takes some of her blood and keeps it. Then one night Alice leaves her home and ends up dead. Peter is heartbroken and Sir John suggests that they dig up some bodies in the cemetary and when they do they discover that all of the coffins are empty! Sir John figures out that Squire Hamilton has practiced black magic and can make the dead rise up as zombies and make them work in his underground mine. But he has to hurry because the Squire has put a spell on Sylvia and plans on using her next! This was directed by John Gilling who along with Terence Fisher was very popular especially with fans of these films by Hammer Studios. Gilling filmed this and then went right ahead a week later to direct The Reptile back to back and some of the sets can be seen in both films. I think one of the reasons that this doesn't get mentioned much when people speak of Hammer films is because it lacked real recognizable faces in the cast. The whole cast is good and veterans of these types of films but here in America how many people knew who John Carson was? I think most viewers were accustomed to seeing Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in the leads and if they weren't than maybe they got pushed by the wayside over the years. The special effects are not bad and it was pretty eerie seeing Alice rise up out of her grave. But I did laugh at some of the scenes in the mine where some of the men were flogging the zombies with whips to make them work. I guess good workers are hard to find! What's the world coming to if you can't get a zombie to put in a decent days work? But this is an effective film and one of the few that Hammer made that dealt with Zombies. Creepy atmosphere and a good cast make this a fun film to view.";

Even though a much better effort than the overly boring I walked with a zombie this one focuses on the greed of a magistrate and he has a few other important professions using voodoo not only to cause death upon young people mostly men. Again with voodoo he brings them back to life as zombies who are forced to work for him as slaves in a mine digging I guess for gold or other precious things. It has a few nice scenes such as the rising from the grave from Alice and turning into a zombie and than the dream sequence where we see other dead people digging themselves up from their resting place. Unfortunately that is not enough to save the movie. Not saying the story is bad and it's OK in the visual department but it doesn't come across as very atmospheric. There are no stand out performances. I feel this one would have been better had it been in black and white. For me it lacked soul and felt overly long to reach its goal. A rather weak finale too. I think White Zombie did a much better job even though the story was very simple.".

	schema:headline " Hammer's oldschool zombie movie is one of their most original";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the one and only zombie movie that the British horror kings Hammer Films ever put out. It might seem quite odd to some modern viewers in that there are no flesheating ghouls to be found here at all. The reason for this is quite simple this movie came out two years before George A. Romero's legendary classic Night of the Living Dead 1968 which effectively was a year zero moment for the modern more grotesque zombie. In this one the undead are almost tragic beings who are slaves to an evil human. This isn't so strange as Hammer had made a habit of going back to the 30's and making modern versions of the horror classics of that decade. To this end Plague of the Zombies could be considered a new version of the zombie films of those earlier years when the conception of the undead was wrapped up in Haitian voodoo with the zombies themselves slaves to occult masters. A film that looks to have been particularly influential here is the Bela Lugosi poverty row cult item White Zombie 1932 which featured all those things plus the idea of the undead being used to work tirelessly in a mill an idea revisited here also. What was also noticeable to me was that this one looked like a secondtier Hammer film financially with none of their big stars in it. In fact it seems to have been made as a support feature for Dracula Prince of Darkness 1966 with the funny trailer for this doublebill saying that boys will be handed out Dracula fangs and girls will be given zombie eyes! It also seems to clearly have been made backtoback with The Reptile 1966 which also shares the same filming location as well as some acting personnel. But the interesting thing is that despite the lower profile that Hammer gave it this remains one of their strongest 60's movies.A couple of physicians investigate a series of unexplained deaths and vanishing corpses in a small Cornish village. The local squire appears to be involved in some way. One chief strength is the atmosphere which is helped quite a bit by the great locations. The slightly odd looking antiquated village is very distinctive while the old mill is quite haunting. The zombies themselves make only selective appearances but they make for interesting shambling creatures dressed in sack cloths. One of the highlights of the movie as a whole has them rise from the earth in a graveyard and attack one of the central characters in a sinister dream sequence. Even better is a scene just prior to it where the doctor's dead wife comes out of her grave and advances directly towards him with an intense relentless look on her face. This scene was the highlight of the film for me. It was shot very well and acted perfectly by Jacqueline Pearce who also put in a very memorable performance in The Reptile. On the whole this has to go down as one of the best Hammer films from its period on account of its more original material and wellcrafted moments. It was maybe also the very last of the oldschool zombie movies too before Romero changed the subgenre forever more and for this reason too it is worth seeing.".

Alice's husband is the local doctor and has been unable to figure out why people have been dying.

Hamilton more or less runs the village and he also owns the old abandoned mine near town. He is of course approached by Dr. Forbes but cannot provide any help as to the cause of deaths. But soon he doctor begins to suspect the truth That the Squire is actually a practicing Voodoo priest who has been turning locals into zombies to work in his mine!Before too long Alice Tompson dies and her distraught husband has her buried in the local cemetery. We get to watch as she rises from the grave to report to the mine for duty! There are lots of cool shots of zombies lumbering around and rising from gravesIn this film the whole town is shrouded in mist and there is a constant sense of dread among the population. Michael Ripper does a great job as the local constable who is trying to solve the mystery along with Dr. Forbes. Tightly put together with a fast pace for most of the movie this is a great release from Hammer. It is also the only zombie movie they ever put out which is too bad as this one turned out so well.This release from Anchor Bay is another notch in their cap for the fine picture 1.851 anamorphic and sound. There are a couple of trailers and a World of Hammer Episode Mummies Werewolves  the Living Dead. It retails for 30 but it can be found for less.

	schema:headline " Terrific Entertainment!";
	schema:reviewBody "Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling bloody melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the midtwentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang. It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam however has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots. Daniel DayLewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore moustachetwirling villain. DayLewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach DayLewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed. Broadbent is Tweed's spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for Tweed against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though Leonardo DiCaprio is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his costars.  Large slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young James Cagney DiCaprio's acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as Bill or Tweed and as good as DiCaprio is DayLewis operates on a whole other level. Cameron Diaz as the beautiful pickpocket Jenny  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time Diaz fades into the background when compared to her more powerful costars. Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like livedin clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862. Scorsese does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide bold exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling bloody melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the midtwentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang. It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam however has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots. Daniel DayLewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore moustachetwirling villain. DayLewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach DayLewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed.

	schema:reviewBody "You'd think Scorcese has bitten a bit more than he could possibly chew this time. Well he didn't. Gangs of new York is not an epic masterpiece and it ain't that because I seriously doubt the directors aim was that. It's a great movie in it's own account but you have to watch it in the right way.The plot Tight enough and well paced with a couple of lows expected for a threehour film but generally it comes out pretty neat. Some may find it disturbing as it contains extreme violence and it does not portray an America of happy workers even happier slaves benevolent rich and just authorities  instead it portraits the true 1860 society. Definitely not for those who like their films with plenty of sugar on the top.The epic and the drama Well basically the film is the story of two men. Around them things evolve and a brave new world comes forth  but we only get to watch snapshots of that world. Until the last sequence that is when the whole city explodes in some occasions literally... and the streets are being covered in blood and the two aspects the main story and the events of the era are being tied together in the same continuum.At the same time the director attempts to portrait the whole birth and growth of the United States in a kind of parabole but without loosing his focus on the main story and the surrounding. Scorsese dives deeply into the psychology of his heroes without giving out any explanation of their acts other than the probable  he lets us figure it out ourselves and that's a Godgiven gift.The visuals The film is disturbing as it contains extreme violence. There are literally streams of blood hacking slashing crushing  even some action movie fans hey dude look he smashed his head with that thing... cool man! might find some parts of the film interesting. The last sequence is visually astounding and it's by it's own account a reason to watch this film over and over again... if you got the stomach to actually cope with the disturbing images that is.The actors I didn't think it would come a day when I'd say that Leo Di Caprio can act but ...here I go The kid can act. And quite good too. Guess he needed a Scorsese to put him in the right path. Same with Cameron Diaz  she has got some potential seems so. Too bad she wastes it in films like the sweetest thing and other throwups like that. And... Daniel Day Lewis. Truly with this performance they should give him the Academy award. He portrays the vile Butcher in a way few would be able of and he adds depth to a character that could very easily end up twodimensional. He is stunningly good.New York New York Scorsese gets involved in something that compares to his previous work the way a fancy little sports car compares to a huge truck A grandioso film of epic proportions and of great ambition. He does deliver I believe. But this film shall not be acknowledged universally because there is too much violence corruption lack of the good old white vs black good vs evil I mean concept and does not sweeten the pill in any way. It's disturbing and raw and it's a great. It's not a political film  in such the director usually picks a stance a true hero an opposing view and builds upon those. In this case the director is truly endistancemented and keeps that distance even from his hero. There are no good people in that movie all are acting like chess pieces in a predetermined way but at the same time they try to burst out and do their own.The verdict A fabulous film which is going to be recognized for such in some years".

	schema:reviewBody "Finding yourself brooding over the sorry state of civilization lately? If so I would strongly recommend you take a trip to Gangs of New York' and see how much worse things USED to be in the not too distant past.  The film is Martin Scorcese's epic paean to the Lawlessness That Made America Great a theme most often explored against a Far West backdrop out on the open prairie or in twobit towns like Tombstone Arizona or Dodge City Kansas. Here it's been transferred to 1860's New York City which in Scorcese's vision turns out to be a veritable Dickensian hellhole of vice and corruption a place teeming with rival gangsters pickpockets corrupt politicians lawbreaking policemen and even firefighters so obsessed with matters of jurisdiction that they do physical battle with rival departments while an unattended building goes up in flames behind them.  This is a world where life has no value and where a man's existence can be snuffed out without so much as a byyourleave or a single person left behind to mourn him.  The members of these rival gangs make the Sharks and the Jets  who would make their appearance on the same turf a full century later  look like mere pantywaists in comparison.Visually the film is a masterpiece offering some of the best cinematography art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002.  With the help of some master craftsmen Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before.  The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foottall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration. It is truly an astonishing eyepopping achievement.The same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film however. Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks the screenplay by Steven Zaillian Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting.  The main drawback is the story itself which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes.  Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon a young man who as a boy witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher' Cutting the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis.  Bill who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area.  After a 16year absence Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life.Despite the glories of the setting Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life.  Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hardassteel Bill Cutting who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in Oliver Twist' a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors. Perhaps DanielDay Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match.  Perhaps too the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here. Whatever the reason the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of  Gangs of New York.'  Moreover the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and halfbaked philosophizing.  Lucky for us then that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued if not quite fascinated throughout.What does fascinate us however is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story.  These include the everpresent backdrop of the Civil War which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit and the antiwar riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart  both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town.  In moments like these Gangs of New York' almost touches greatness.  Also of interest is the way in which the film highlights the fervid antiimmigration attitude that has so completely permeated the history of a country that in a bewildering paradox has always prided itself in theory at least if not always in practice on being the great melting pot' for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised to flock to  and the film reminds us of how prevalent that antiimmigrant attitude still is today in many quarters. Truly some things never change.In some ways this film might make an interesting companion piece to Scorcese's Casino' in that both films deal with the theme of lawlessness and corruption making way for legal conformity and respectability.  Each of these works so distant from one another in time and place manages to portray the kind of epic birth pangs that cities and countries often have to go through before they can call themselves truly civilized.'  This theme is undoubtedly what led Scorcese to compose a kind of visual ode to New York City in his closing shot his own personal valentine to a city that has suffered so much in the past few years.  It is his way of saying that from such squalid beginnings New York City has grown into the great cultural center that it is today and that it can be proud of its heritage and the people who helped make it.  After the events of 911 that is a very powerful and stirring sentiment indeed.Yes Gangs of New York' is a severely flawed film in a lot of ways but it is also a work of vision and of almost unparalleled technical accomplishment that deserves to be seen.  Even if there is not much here to engage the mind or the heart you can always feast your eyes on the glorious visions unfolding up there on the screen.".

Now a grown man he returns to the Points to find Bill pretty much running the show.  He gets on Bill's good side and eventually becomes his number one man all the while still plotting for his father's revenge.While there is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore the film does an excellent job portraying life as it was in New York.  You can be sucked in to the time of the movie and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.I've never been a big DiCaprio fan but his effort here along with his performance from Catch Me If You Can have made my opinion start to waver a little.  He is good as Amsterdam and believable in his actions and expressions.  Daniel DayLewis is simply phenomenal as Bill the Butcher and really should have won the Best Actor Oscar.  Overall I feel this was the best film of 2002 and really was robbed at the Academy Awards.8 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "For about three months now I have on an almost daily basis passed a movie theatre not far from my home. On the side of this movie theatre is a huge poster advertising the movie Gangs of New York. Meanwhile all I heard about on television was the buzz about the upcoming Gangs of New York. So when this highly publicized movie finally opened I went and saw it.I went to the theatre I bought my ticket I found a seat in a very crowded theatre and I sat. For three hours I sat in that dark theatre and I watched what was one of the most amazing movies I have ever had privilege to see.It is hard to even begin to explain why this movie was amazing but it was. The way it was shot is brilliant. The cinematography is spectacular. The story is completely enthralling.Although the movie was just shy of three hours long it was not at all boring to watch. The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end because after all it is a movie based on a trueish story it was incredible to watch how it got that end.Above all the movie was beautiful to watch. I have to admit to those who have not yet seen it that Gangs is quite violent. However the violence was well shot and it was fairly necessary to the story.All of the actors put in extremely good performances. Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he's not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent which can also be seen in his other movie of the season Catch Me If You Can. Cameron Diaz' performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy. Also after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis' REALLY getting into his character I admit that it was completely worth it. His character William CuttingBill the Butcher is so complex and although you know you hate him you can't decide why for there are so many reasons.In conclusion if you have not seen this movie yet go. Go now. See it. This is one of the epic movies of our time. I heard that Scorcese has been conceptualizing this movie for over twenty years I could tell. The story this movie tells is one  that I had never heard and the way in which it was told makes it seem very important for us to know. The message that is conveyed although not an entirely wholesome one is an important one to learn and if considered is very relevant to our time. However my only message to you is this see this movie.".

However the violence was well shot and it was fairly necessary to the story.All of the actors put in extremely good performances. Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he's not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent which can also be seen in his other movie of the season Catch Me If You Can. Cameron Diaz' performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy. Also after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis' REALLY getting into his character I admit that it was completely worth it. His character William CuttingBill the Butcher is so complex and although you know you hate him you can't decide why for there are so many reasons.In conclusion if you have not seen this movie yet go. Go now. See it. This is one of the epic movies of our time. I heard that Scorcese has been conceptualizing this movie for over twenty years I could tell. The story this movie tells is one  that I had never heard and the way in which it was told makes it seem very important for us to know. The message that is conveyed although not an entirely wholesome one is an important one to learn and if considered is very relevant to our time. However my only message to you is this see this movie.";

I am sorry DayLewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!DayLewis played Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting he is one nasty dude. However there are no real good guys in this story. The supposed hero played by Leonardo DiCaprio is a revengeseeking man with a ton of flaws himself. The rest of the characters are either thieves gang members corrupt politicians or corrupt policeman. Ah yes another familyoriented film from that kindly director Martin Scorcese.What Scorcese lacks in family values he comes close to making up for in style. This is another fascinating visual film with great sets costumes color and camerawork. Other typical Scorcese touches are in here Catholicbashing and brutal language. I question whether the fword was used back in the days this film takes place.All in all a tough film that could be too unpleasant to watch but for Lewis' outstanding performance and the spectacular visuals.".

	schema:headline " The narrative and characters are weak but the general sweep and spectacle of the whole thing makes it worth a look";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1840's New York is a mess of gangs all fighting over small areas of turf. The main rivalry is between the immigrant Irish and those who see themselves as Natives of their New York. A battle rages between them and the leader of the Irish Priest Vallon falls to the blade of Bill The Butcher Cutting  witnessed by Vallon's young son. Sixteen years later and things are different but no better. Cutting is now the head of the Five Corners and all the gangs answer to him. It is into this situation that an unknown man called Amsterdam returns  none other than the grown son of Priest Vallon. Seeking a fitting revenge for the death of his father Amsterdam makes sure he catches Cutting's sole eye and gradually is taken into his trust.Despite lukewarm reviews I decided that any Scorsese film is worth a look and gave GoNY a night of my time. In terms of plotting the film is essentially a revenge drama that sees Vallon trying to get close enough to Cutting to take him out in a fashion befitting the man. You might rightly point out that such a straightforward tale does not require 180 minutes to tell but it does when the film tries to make this much more of a sprawling affair that aims to bridge the cinematic gap between the western and the gangster films while also painting a rich tapestry of characters against a rich background of 19th Century New York. However it fails to do this on several levels and the end result is a film that feels a lot baggier than it really should have done. This is best seen in the characters because none of them really develop beyond the first impressions they give or a better example is the failure of the film to use Jenny in the critical way that she was clearly intended to be used.Scorsese may lose his way with the story but it is easy to forgive him because he does so well with the majestic historical sweep he gives to everything else. The sets look great the costumes look great and the dramatic flair he gives in delivery add so much. It is a real problem that he has not taken the characters and story along for the ride but I found his silver lining to be enjoyable even if his rather OTT approach did further take away from the realism of the people and the story. His approach is matched by the cast who are mostly enjoyable despite lacking depth. DiCaprio is more than the bland pinup I had feared he would be but he can't do much more than play the silent revenge card from start to finish. He is overwhelmed by DayLewis who has great fun in a fantastically OTT role that worked much better than I expected him to. Diaz is not that good and I felt she was miscast in an attempt to get credibility by working with Scorsese. The support cast is roundly good and features solid turns from Neeson Reilly Gleeson and many others fill out a strong cast.Overall this is an impressive film in terms of sweep and style but not in terms of story and characters  which is a bit of a problem in a film that pretty much lasts three hours. The skill of Scorsese and the presence of so many stars make it worth a look but it is hard to get past the problems in the way that the story is not as well done as it could have been even if the general historical sweep and spectacle makes it worth taking a look at.".

Yes the New York Draft Riots did happen just two weeks AFTER the Northern victory at Gettysburg demonstrating that the outcome of the War was anything but certain even after Lee had been forced to retreat to the south bank of the Potomac River.  Today many would find this surprising.The movie did take some license however.  There was no wholesale firing on civilians by Union soldiers.  In fact reported deaths after three days of rioting were less than onehundred.  Many of the dead were randomly selected blacks who were hanged and mutilated which was accurately depicted in the film.  Today many would also find this surprising because the schools teach that the North was good and the South was bad.  The truth is that blacks were subjected to inhumane treatment everywhere especially in the Nothern cities.There was also no firing by offshore naval vessels.  That was artistic license.  My source for all of the above is a doctoral dissertation that was published about ten years ago titled The New York City Draft Riots.The movie makes the important point that the North had run out of home grown manpower to fight the South.  Had it not been for Irish and German volunteers through 1863 and black volunteers in 1864 the North would have sued for peace.  The 1864 Democratic Platform promised to bring the War to a swift and speedy conclusion.Bravo to Scorsese for bringing all of this to light.  In the meantime the movie is about twenty minutes to long.  The brothel scenes the uptown scenes and some of the scenes in the catacombs struck me as slow and superfluous.  On the other hand the street scenes and the scenes of the random gangs of which I wish there were more were glorious. One thing Scorsese left out however  The mountains of animal and human waste in the streets!  Not long after his movie was released the History Channel produced a documentary on the Five Points area and it is staggering to consider the tons and tons of animal and human waste piling up in the streets and the thousands of gallons of urine running in the gutters. There were old photos of waste in the streets stacked six feet high. Needless to say infant mortality in such a fetid environment was about 50. Scorsese leaves this out and there is scarcely a horse in the movie.DayLewis does a superb job with a character that is unevenly developed.  He is a homicidal thug in the beginning a menacing but somewhat benign presence in the middle and a psychotic killer in the end.  It isn't really clear why he vacillates the way he does.  Bipolar I guess.  DiCaprio proves he can act and he exudes a manliness he did not possess in earlier films.  Diaz turns in a creditable performance.  The cast of thousands adds a nice touch to the film.I would never say this is a great film but it certainly is worth a look. Kudos to Scorsese for the herculean effort and a tip of the kepi for the poetic ending which reminded me of the ending in 1936's San Francisco.".

It's easily the most powerful film I've seen this year even topping the excellent White Oleander.  I have never seen a film portray poverty in the 1800's as well as this film did.  It also made me feel like I was there witnessing the poverty and brutality.  It's a film that makes us be thankful that times like those have passed and for us not to forget those who lived and died during those times.  It's also a film that's not afraid to show war in its total uglyness.  Martin Scorsese definately got his point across with this film but he didn't do it alone.  The cast were all excellent in their parts no bad acting here at all.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz showed they are more than just pretty faces.  Daniel DayLewis was magnificent as The Butcher a character whom you want to both love and hate.  Quite simply the best film I've seen all year and I hope it will get nominated and win many Oscars.  Even if it doesn't it's a true winner in my eyes. Nice to see that Hollywood can actually do something useful with a 100million budget for once.  This was playing at the theater the same time as The Two Towers... unfortunately most of the people in the long lineup went to see TTT... they sure missed out since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.  Although this film is rather long 2 hrs 47 mins I was so provoked by it that the time flew by. Gangs of New York.... A film that's not to be missed!!1010  Higly reccomended!".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all the movie is way too long. Parts of it are really boring.Then the story is not too interesting. Old story bad man kills father son escapes son seeks revenge son gets revenge. Most of the details that try to make the story interesting actually make no sense.First at the start of the movie the fight between the 2 gangs seems to respect some sacred honorable rules as if not fought by gangs by thugs and murderers but by noble samurai. In the first 2 minutes of the fight there is absolutely no blood on the ground on the clothes faces or weapons of the fighters although all of them are wielding knives axes swords and so on. Suddenly there is some blood on the actors but on the snow there is just a little pink paint. It looks really stupid because a fight in which about 200300 men take part and they all have knives and axes and swords there would be dozens of dead and the place would look like a butchery. Also the police could not ignore something like this.Then Day Lewis's character looks to be though out as a lovehim hatehim kind of guy. He is a monster but a monster who loves his country Hollywood BS and who respected the man he killed in battle DiCaprio's father Liam Neeson. Although DayLewis makes the most of this character the character itself looks surreal a gang leadergentlemanracistpatriotsadisticbraveilliterateintelligent butcher. This is actually what this movie is about. The story fades behind DayLewis's character.There are some other characters that seem to be in the movie just for the sake of it. The politicians the wealthy family that at some point visits The Points  the square where most of the action takes place. These characters have no role to play in the story yet they show up from time to time as if only to have something to fill the 2 and a half hours of the movie.The other thing that has no place in this movie is the riot. The riot and the main story have no connection. The riot does not influence the outcome of the story nor viceversa.The movie is barely watchable and if the weather outside is fine I'd suggest you rather take a walk in a park.".

Old story bad man kills father son escapes son seeks revenge son gets revenge. Most of the details that try to make the story interesting actually make no sense.First at the start of the movie the fight between the 2 gangs seems to respect some sacred honorable rules as if not fought by gangs by thugs and murderers but by noble samurai. In the first 2 minutes of the fight there is absolutely no blood on the ground on the clothes faces or weapons of the fighters although all of them are wielding knives axes swords and so on.

Not only is it pointlessly violent and I'm a guy who doesn't at all mind the occasional decapitation or disemboweling as someone is telling me a story but my god is this moving BORING!SPOILERS FOLLOW.Daniel DayLewis plays a Bill Sykessend up with a truly laughable makeup job and an accent that's as carefree as the wind. You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless miserable lives. Oh yeah since his legitimate front is as a butcher he occasionally throws a decent steak their way. Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz The Whore With The Heart of Gold because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough who inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth. Liam Neeson who croaks before the end of the first reel is one lucky bastard.After the first 20 minutes of course anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be REVENGE!! and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion. Granted Gangs might have made some use of the obvious Shakespearean themes but Scorsese doesn't even try to handle them. Thus though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father you wind up so bored wDiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up.In fact though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues the fact is Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil with differences in degree but never in kind. And if there are no good guys why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when for about the 11th time the streets yet again run gooey wblood and body parts?And yet Scorsese tries. Toward the end of the movie he picks up the nearest blunt instrument and bashes away at the plot until he's grafted an obvious hero DiCaprio and an irrelevant hetero love story DiCaprio and Diaz onto it. In other words Martin Scorsese has nothing but contempt for you. You're too stupid to realize that DiCaprio's character is a venal murderous little crook and you'll be mollified by a pretty romance between him and a sociopathic pickpocket prostitute. Because the history of America began between the sheets.This is the movie you'd get if Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lecter collaborated on an American history epic and it's about as cynical a piece of trash as I hope never again to see.".

I thought it was a load of     he replied  The actors looked like they were all going to burst out singing  I could see where he was coming from although I didn't disagree with him 100  . GANGS OF NEW YORK had some really extreme opinions from its audience a point reflected in the comments thrown at it on this site .I didn't think it was as bad as my dad made out but like I said I could seewhere he was coming from My major problem with the movie is the screenplay . the opening shot sees Bill  The Butcher  Cutting kill Priest Vallon in front of his son who runs away swearing revenge for his dead father . From that point onwards we know that the story will end years later with a confrontation between the two protagonists so there's no more dramatic twists for the story to take . Actually this in itself isn't too bad but what spoils the story is the way it's held up with the character interaction between Amsterdamn and Jenny Everdeane . Scorsese doesn't do romantic interlude very well and this movie proves it . In amongst this diversion there's something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is . If you bumped off someones father in a street fight would you adopt their kids ? I didn't think so This could have been an absolutely brilliant script and it is very good in places where we see how the gangs are structured  their ethnic mix and their political affiliations  Some are protestant with members who were born in America  some are catholic with many members born in Ireland  all are anglophobe and they all hate each other . We also see one of the most cynical episodes in American history where immigrants getting off ships at New York are immediately conscripted into the Union army unless they pay 300 dollars which eventually leads to the draft riots . When the movie concentrates on these parts of the plot it's a great film but becomes heavily bogged down by the character subplots If Scorsese had directed this 20 years ago with a fraction of the budget he had here this could have been his masterwork but he seems to have overawed by riches . Everything is just a bit too grandiose and operatic to be entirely convincing . Charles Dickens had visited the five points and is recorded as saying it was the worst place on Earth . Scorsese makes the streets a little too clean  a little too Hollywood grunge  a little too glamorous in spite of everything . Leonardo Dicaprio is a very underrated actor held back by his startling good looks but he's wrong as Amsterdamn and wasn't right for the part which should have gone to an unknown . Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting  however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis's other work Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies  and I'm somewhat happy about that because this movie isn't a crowning achievement for anyone  especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things Seven out of Ten".

Scorsese's name itself has become a kind of Open Sesame into the acceptance of people who ought otherwise to know better. I was never a fan even Taxi Driver seemed to me a kind of early essay in the pornography of violence that has now become the stockintrade of most Hollywood directors. At least Taxi Driver was technically accomplished wellfilmed wellacted welledited. Beyond the moderately impressive set designs and the pyrotechnics that appeal to fouryearolds of all ages Gangs of New York is not even an averagely wellmade movie. As for the acting Di Caprio runs the full gamut of his repertoire from A to B while Day Lewis is a Victorian melodrama villain who were he not terrorising hapless street urchins with his cutlery collection and unconvincing New York accent would be better occupied tying young ladies to railway tracks in the path of approaching steam locomotives. Anyone casting a liveaction movie of Wacky Races need look no further for Dick Dastardly!There is no editing no discipline no sense of internal form or tempo there is just one damn thing after another. These damn things are violence violence gratuitous sex and more violence. There is no serious attempt to build character nor any sociopolitical analysis of the immiseration of the various tribes of the Five Points beyond the sentimental exoneration of anyone who is not white AngloSaxon male heterosexual and Protestant and the vilification and calumniation of anyone who is. Straight WASP male  Boo!At the height of the draft riots I was reminded briefly of a far better movie bloated WASP boo! David Hemmings's attempts to maintain a stiff upperlip as his grand residence was besieged was a sillier rerun of the scene in Carry On Up The Khyber where the Raj feign indifference during tiffin to the invading natives.A rotten movie that glorifies anarchy and senseless violence.

This film may appeal to those who want to see a violent blood bath set in grimy surroundings and played out by Hogarthian degenerates but it is not in any way entertainment.  I kept waiting for Dante's Inferno to open up and swallow them into the fiery furnace.  The films plods unrelentingly through human misery and violence for more than two and a half hours.  Never once did I get the feeling that it may not be pleasant to watch but at least it was raising my consciousness.  This was just a film of violence blood lust and misery as repulsive as Kurasawa's The Lower Depths. I felt as if the director was making a film about depravity for the sake of depravity.  As if there should be a voiceover stating that In the Casbahslums of ShanghaiLimehouseParisBombay every vice is catered to. Murder drugs vice white slavery. No one asks questions no one knows your name you can hide or disappear or make someone disappear.  The opening voiceover from all those black and white films noire  Algiers Shanghai Gesture etc.  This is debauchery from the comfort of your cinema seat. Daniel DayLewis's ludicrous leering mustachioed Victorian melodrama villain robbed the film of any credibility and belonged to vaudeville. Far and away the only performance worth watching was Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed.  The overrated and unappealing Cameron Diaz and Leonardo diCaprio deserved each other.    I can now understand why comedies and musicals did so well during the depression.  Some of us go to the cinema to be uplifted and entertained. There is beauty in the world if you want to look for it.".

With Leonardo scowling Diaz giggling and Day Lewis doing his best De Niro this film takes itself far too seriously for the leadenhanded and juvenile treatment of a story which seems suspect the moment you think about it. Its a shame to see a director with such a great trackrecord try so hard to convince us that he's still 'got it'. Couldn't he have left this drekk to Jerry Bruckheimer?".

With Leonardo scowling Diaz giggling and Day Lewis doing his best De Niro this film takes itself far too seriously for the leadenhanded and juvenile treatment of a story which seems suspect the moment you think about it. Its a shame to see a director with such a great trackrecord try so hard to convince us that he's still 'got it'. Couldn't he have left this drekk to Jerry Bruckheimer?";

	schema:reviewBody "Are you kidding me? This film was nominated for Oscars? Of all the junk over the years that has been nominated and has won Oscars this has got to be one of the worst yet! First of all is the actors Leonardo DiCaprio has no business ever playing a tough guy kind of role. DiCaprio is so girlish that he is laughable as anyone who would be in a knife fight and should stick to roles where he plays either gay character or someone who is just very fem. DiCaprio seems right at home in a sappy love story such as Titanic or as a mentally handicapped person such as his role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. As if Leon wasn't bad enough we have to deal with 166 minutes of Daniel DayLewis looking like a bum and acting like a confused mime. I can't think of a movie where an actor or actress has failed more miserably in a part as Daniel DayLewis did in this movie he was in a word Laughable. Now as if the two main characters failing so utterly was not enough there are several other things which make this movie near unbearable. Of this list the first thing that comes to mind is the silly costumes which although somewhat authentic for the period were overdone and seen far too much. An example of this was the tengallon hats. Yes people wore them back then but in this movie almost everyone had one on which would be like someone 140 years from now making a movie which takes place in 2003 and the same percentage of people as were wearing tengallon hats in this movie were wearing baseball caps. The next most annoying thing about Gangs of New York was the music the same perpetual square dancing music played over and over again as if they just couldn't come up with something better. Moving right along we come to another very annoying feature' . the accents done by DiCaprio and DayLewis neither of which sounded anything like they should aren't actors by definition supposed to well ACT?! Let's face it here people if Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this movie along with Scorsese directing it but rather had an unknown set of lead actors and actresses with an unknown director orchestrating this whole farce this movie not only would have never gotten a single Oscar nomination but probably would have went directly to cable or video. The only upside to this whole fiasco was perhaps the cinematography and the story. This movie had a lot going for it but was ultimately doomed by the bad acting poor casting hilarious costume design annoying music and boat load of other things that sank this ship before it ever left the harbor . 3 out of 10 stars for this catastrophic calamity.".

This is such a movie. I was wary but I kept an open mind because it was a Scorcese film and sometimes his directing ability has the uncanny power to avert cynicism from his film.I call this film a mixed bag for the following reason It has one really good performance plus a few others that were okay good directing and okay cinematography but a very very poor script  and that script hurts a lot of the film.It should be obvious by now that Daniel Day Lewis's performance as William Bill the Butcher Cutting is the one I'm referring to  if anyone deserves an Oscar for their acting in this movie it's him.  Everyone else more or less does exactly what the script requires them to do.  Liam Neeson did quite well for his brief role as Priest Vallon and Brendan Gleeson did a good job as McGuinn a quiet subdued role for the only character to see through young Vallon's disguise.The stinker in this movie is the script.  First off what is this movie?  Is it a revenge drama?  A romance story?  A period political piece?  It never decides  it cannot.  Instead the script meanders through each of these possible threads and picks up and leaves off where it wishes.  This lack of focus sometimes lets you stop caring about some of the characters and I'm not really spoiling anything but the ending practically forces you to. Also the backstory of the beginning scene is never given so I'm still confused as to why the movie ended up where it did.  I chalk that up to a bad script that's in a hurry to tell the story.Scorsese at least has done his job in directing in his usual reliable way. I forgive him the two very obvious uses of artistic metaphor in visualization the blood on the blade and the bible falling into the water.  He deserves an Oscar at some point but I'm afraid it shouldn't be for Gangs of New York.  He has done better and will do better in the future.The last thing I have to nit about is the cinematography.  I think it was vastly overrated.  Most of the scenery felt confined to one area like all the action took place just in the actual spot of the five points. Manhattan seems like a much larger place than the one we saw in the movie.".

	schema:headline " Quirky comic thriller from the master director of third cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "This film comes from the cream of Cuban cinematic tradition. Released just three years after the revolution this is a more lighthearted approach from director Tomas Gutierrez Alea.The plot follows an Cuban exile who has returned to the island from Miami to locate his 12 English Chairs one of which his dying mother told him contains valuable jewels. However on his return he realises all of his property has been possessed by the government and so goes on the trail to find them. It turns out he is not the only person on the trail and he enlists the help of a younger man.I enjoyed the comic elements of this film. Gutierrez Alea best known for Memories of Underdevelopment here provides a quirky critique of capitalism through its very selfinterested protagonist and the people who are duped into his freedom fighting scheme. The film is ideologically socialist but Gutierrez Alea was also a critic of some Revolutionary policies and this film is not without selfirony.This film deserves to be seen by more people than appear to have seen it 35 votes?. It's a funny intelligent thriller that has no doubt suffered due to Cuba's geopolitical situation rather than its narrative and aesthetic achievements.".

Released just three years after the revolution this is a more lighthearted approach from director Tomas Gutierrez Alea.The plot follows an Cuban exile who has returned to the island from Miami to locate his 12 English Chairs one of which his dying mother told him contains valuable jewels. However on his return he realises all of his property has been possessed by the government and so goes on the trail to find them. It turns out he is not the only person on the trail and he enlists the help of a younger man.I enjoyed the comic elements of this film.

	schema:headline " A decent comedy..and the original.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a VERY novel way of telling the back story. So instead of showing the old woman hiding her jewels inside one of twelve chairs you see a cartoon do this inside the actual house used in the live action film. It's very cute and I love when a film goes about doing something differently.As I just said the story is about an old woman from what is now communist Cuba who has hidden her jewels so they won't be confiscated by the state. She tells her heir a nephew about this secret stash on her death bedbut by now it's too late. It seems that the government has already done some redistributing and all 12 of the chairs have been given to 12 different strangersand the nephew needs to hurry as he needs to track down the chairs before their secret is revealed. The story it seems is from a Russian novel about the postCzarist USSRgiving this film a very interesting pedigree.Overall this is a pretty decent comedy but not an outstanding one. I think the plot though funny rarely was THAT funny. I think it could have used a bit more humor and the performances seemed a bit too restrained. Not badbut not especially memorable.If all this sounds familiar to you it might be because you've already seen the Mel Brooks film The Twelve Chairswhich is a remake of this Cuban film. In fact this would seem like a good film to add to my Netflix queue as I remember my family adored the Brooks film. But I was only six when I saw it in the theater so it's not like I have much recollection of it. Perhaps if I do this I'll update my review of the Cuban original to explain how the two films compare.".
