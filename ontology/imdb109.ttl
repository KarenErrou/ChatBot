The plotting is so dumb that even the final reel's attempt to give the killer a motive is based on stupid logic.  The dialogue is just as bad and could come from any dtv movie.Mind you  it doesn't help that its delivered by actors who make planks look like they could do Shakespeare.  Peebles once did a few OK movies  those days are gone!  Here he is a cardboard cut out of a cop haunted by past' although he just walks round and looks shocked by the murders.  Remar is an OK killer  he's good at times and does well despite a poor character but the rest are just fodder for gory deaths.Overall this is poor  watch Se7en or Silence of the Lambs.

Yes there are lots of mediocre cop movies out there about good cops that get too personally involved in a homicide case and get kicked off the case by their superior then continue to investigate on their own. But this one has a somewhat new twist in that the killer seems to be a man who's already been executed for similar crimes. Another new twist is that his latest choice of victims are the jurors who voted to execute him. These two new twists keep the movie from being overly predictable and keep it entertaining. However I think the script should have kept secret until the end whether or not the killer is actually the executed man or not the answer is revealed early in the film and I think they should have made use of the suspense they would've generated by not telling us so soon. All in all this is not a great movie but it's not a total waste of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Am Anfang war das Licht or In the Beginning There Was Light is an Austrian 90minute documentary from 2010 so this one is already over half a decade old. Writer and director is P.A. Straubinger and this one here is easily his most known work which also has to do with the fact that he is far from prolific. Anyway with this film here he gives an insight into the subject of some people living without food maybe even without drinking and solely living off light. Or I should add allegedly because in my opinion this is all a huge scam. And actually it would be better not to provide the likes of Jasmuheen with further attention so they can get even richer and sell more books etc. And they can also not bait people into killing themselves because they believed in the concept like that lady in the woods. In Germany we have a proverb saying von Luft und Liebe leben and that's what the people in this documentary do but not just metaphorically like in the proverb. So yeah I am very skeptical and I don't believe in the concept no matter how many years of meditation may have preceded it. If it is really true then why won't they put these people for 10 days under permanent surveillance and see if they are not secretly having a meal? This would be the evidence then and then it also makes sense to run blood tests etc. to explore this unique phenomenon. But not before really scrutinizing them. So yeah overall I give this documentary a thumbsdown not because it was handled badly on the contrary for a first film it was pretty solid far from a failure really but I find the concept pretty revolting and not deserving of the attention. Another weakness is that it got too scientific in the second half. All in all I give it a thumbsdown. If you still want to see these 1.5 hours make sure you got a good set of subtitles as with all the languages included in here it seems unlikely you really understand everything else otherwise.".

When you think that there is no more surprises in the screenplay the plot has another twist. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Calafrio! Chill!";

Not only did it completely change in tone  from comedy to high drama  but it introduced plot elements that without being specific negated much of what I had just seen. Plot aside why a movie's creators would want a film to be so funny for the first two acts and so deliberately unfunny for the third act is bewildering to me. If movie sets up at the outset that it is a mystery and then does something really twisty at the end you can enjoy it. But the movie did not prepare me for how it resolved and so I felt cheated out of a great comedy. No Way Out with Kevin Costner does a similar thing in the last one minute of the film. My recommendation is that you watch this for the first two third and then hit the stop button. You will have a great time.".

You've read my comment and now you can't unread it....I'm sorry I'm drifting. Anyhow!! The story starts in an airport bar with an author talking with a man next to him. They start talking about his writing and his recent book Stranger Than Fiction. Then he starts to delve into the story which is basically about four twentysomethings that get involved in a murder and the perilous downward spiral their lives go in as an effect. It goes deeper than that much deeper but I'll spare you all the details only because I rambled enough before and am catching myself doing it again.As for my reactions...Well the movie didn't thrill me. First of all it was way too long for such a plotline. And as for the plotline...well I couldn't figure out at all where this movie was going! It starts as a thrust into treachery sort of tale but then it starts to get funny. Some of the humor is appropriate but if this isn't a comedy...then it didn't fit. But then it gets into this thrillercomedydrama thing and really gets confusing. By then I was starting to get tired and figured the end was near. But then it gets twisted then dramaticthen goes into this Part Two that seemed totally tacked on! It was almost like the Part Two seemed to be one of a few choices to be the last 30 of the movie. I don't know it was just getting too contrived then and sort of tense but by then I gave up on this one. There are a few good things. Good acting effective music an obviousyetnot twist in the end though the cast list gives it away a little bit and the way the movie would go into the alternate filmnegative sort of look was creative. But didn't save this messy film.Check it out for originality but I hate to say that it really isn't that good. So you be the judge.".

Good acting effective music an obviousyetnot twist in the end though the cast list gives it away a little bit and the way the movie would go into the alternate filmnegative sort of look was creative. But didn't save this messy film.Check it out for originality but I hate to say that it really isn't that good. So you be the judge.";

The journey brings them into many trials of existence which we modern beings very seldom come in contact with.  At points there scenes that capture a sense of humor that is so basic to our modern way of thinking but for these characters they are just discovering such things like the concept of laugher.  At other points of the film these brave men encounter situations that show the true brutal world of the survival of the fittest.  The manner in which these characters search for fire gives the viewer a true love for the characters courage and heroic nature.  For if they do not succeed it is surely the end of their tribe and for them.  The fire holds the key to survival with its warmth cooking function and most of all its ability to ward off stalking predators.  Fire is power for beings at this point in time.  Just as knowledge is for modern human beings.This film succeeds in it's proportionsdirection settings music great special effectsand acting.

Finally I rented 'Quest for Fire' on DVD and saw it on the big home screen. In fact I watched it several months ago and I'm commenting now because it remains in my mind.Experts can quibble about the realism. But for me this film makes an intelligent and credible effort to present a world of 80000 years ago. In this it raises good questions about who we are as a species. Human genetic code has not changed in that time and any one of the beings portrayed would be perfectly capable of using a computer as I'm doing now. Nonetheless they lived in a world without numbers without prices without trade without written language and without means to create fire. Everyone alive today had an ancestor who survived those conditions. 'Quest for Fire' is a mustsee for anyone curious about the human condition.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raw and at times brutal this story follows three primitive warriors who make a crosscountry journey in search of that most precious of natural elements ... fire. In prehistoric times having fire meant survival from the cold and protection from predators.In this film facial gestures hand movements general body language and mannerisms of the characters are all consistent with conclusions about early man as a result of thorough anthropological research. In lieu of modern language the film's dialogue consists of some 350 invented words and sounds also based on research. In addition an important part of the film is attention to detail in costumes and makeup for which the film won several awards. All of these technical cinematic elements combine to create a reasonably accurate visual and audio impression of mankind as it existed some 80000 years ago.As you would expect the film is shot entirely in rugged remote locations resulting in landscapes that are stunningly beautiful. Background music is generally lowkey and ethereal like what you might hear in a scifi film. There's lots of flute sounds which reinforce the simplicity of the time period.For all its technical achievements this film's main weakness may be the screenplay. When you take away the artifacts of modern life you're very limited in the kind of story you can tell. And that clearly is the case here with a plot that drones on with a monotony and repetition that can be tedious and at times difficult for some viewers.Although the story's entertainment value may be marginal Quest For Fire with its low tech cinematic style is interesting not only for its technical elements but also for its over arching theme of modern human's continuity with prehistoric man based on the element of fire.".

You don't need to know the languages to understand what is going on. The characters from different tribes don't know the other languages and they often act out what they need. This is a movie about the primal fight to survive and how even though they are forced to travel to find a new fire their experiences expand their horizons in ways they could never have anticipated. If their own fire hadn't gone out they would never have met the cannibals or the clay people who ultimately hold the key to their survival.At its core this is a movie about how although we may look different and have different customs we are all human and what we can learn from each other is irreplaceable.".

	schema:reviewBody "What I love about this film is the very plausible portrayal of the development of human traits in prehistoric man. The story centers around a tribe that has not yet learned to start a fire. They have to steal fire from other tribes or find it in nature. So much of their efforts are centered on keeping a fire constantly nurtured and if their fire goes out the entire tribe suffers the elements. However this is not a simple caveman flick. The filmmakers portray the development of human attributes such as humor and laughing connection between males and females beyond the pure sexual language development story telling crosspollination of ideas between tribes of different levels of advancement and at the end the awakening of a sense of the transcendent. I find the film to be a compelling drama even after 25 years and it does not seem at all dated. If you have even the slightest interest in early man this film is a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's probably the best and most accurate prehistoric men movie ever made as I write this barring any PBS or Discovery channel documentaries. As accurate as anything prehistoric can be since anthropologists are probably even worse than historians about agreeing on theories. Whatever is the truth it felt believable for that period. I thought at first it might devolve into cheap cavemen antics and the costumes for the second tribe seen seemed really lame but the movie grew a lot on me. It's actually a movie about the transition from ape to man condensed into a relatively short time for one tribe. It's actually more philosophical and emotional than one might initially think. What makes us humans instead of animals? Everything was filmed on outside locations with real animals sometimes modified to look prehistoric and it shows in the scope and authenticity. It felt strangely grim uncomfortable and disorienting to me which when I think about it is probably how those tribesmen going on the quest must have felt.They even had a famous linguistauthor Anthony Burgess invent a language for the ape men to communicate. There aren't even any subtitles. It was made so anyone in the world can see this and understand which is a feat in itself. The beautiful musical score certainly helped counteract the lack of intelligible words by conveying the drama of the times. The performances were very good and convincing especially the one by Rae Dawn Chong strange female covered in gray makeup who had the guts to be mostly naked throughout the film. Look also for Ron Perlman in his first role. From the commentaries the actors really suffered a lot during shooting for the sake of authenticity such as walking barefoot all the time. The story was simple but well told and meaningful. It felt a bit long at times for me so be sure you're up for it before starting your journey.Rating 7.5 out of 10".

To the best of my recollection Ika and her tribe never appeared in it so the filmmakers added that bit. The cinematography was beautiful and the Scottish locations helped get across the cold of Ice Age Europe. The struggle to survive really came across as well. The special animal effects were much remarked on at the time but look rather cheesy now. However I kind of like that. You really had to work at it back in the day unlike now when the computer will put anything at all onto your film. Ron Perlman looked seriously simian and you have to give him credit since he doesn't look that way normally. And this was the breakout role for Rae Dawn Chong who also nailed her very odd role. Worth checking out.".

Whilst the film does a good job of telling the story without a single word of any recognizable language the storyline is disturbing and disturbingly inaccurate at times particularly when our heroes stumble upon H. erectus gnawing on the arm of a stillliving H. sapiens or when the Neandertals had the urge for a little coital action. Still when one considers what was known by paleoanthropologists in the 80's when this movie was made some allowance can be madea tiny miniscule fraction of allowance.

The relationship in the tribes and their interaction between other tribes was very insightfull and realistic.How they did those Sabre tooth Tigers in 1983 without computer graphics is beyond me.The importance of fire at that time was life and death I would imagine so that makes this story all the more believable.

Seeing that their hungry he shares his lunch until they see the cop in the motor cycle and take off. Before you know it they're walking towards a mansion in some estate. they start to sing songs near the window hopping somebody will offer money but know one doesn't. they sneak in and notices that no ones home so they take advantage of it and sleep for the night. Then the house keeper shows up and catches all three sleeping at her masters house . She tries to call the police but the master arrives from a trip  played by Hans Stuw.This is how the story starts. He's sympathetic and gets them jobs as waiters at a near by court restaurant called Am Brunnen Vore Dem Tor. IngaPlayed by Sonja Zimmerman is the host. She has a problem her brother has been accused of a crime he didn't commit. Paul help's him out by hiding him until he's able to get him to his sister's place so she can hide him. Inge is in love with two men Paul and Fritz Wagner. The latter she met him during the war he's from Britain. He's visiting his parent's who are visiting the same place. He recent his dads either new girl friend or wife that was hard to decipher. Inge must have been an under ground anti Nazi spy during the war to meet Fritz.He must have been Working for the British secret service or else they would of never met.In the evening all the characters show up at the court yard restaurant. the minstrels are waiters hopping that they can sing also in that place. Buta band of local mandolins show up that stop them. a local band of harmonicas and accordions show up too. They battle each other out with music.Them all three minstrel go up to Inga asking them if they can start to play. She sings a song and they play this actress was in the 70's German revival of the stage musical my fair lady even though shes no Marni Nixon.Paul wants Inga bad but he doesn't want to hurt his best friend fritz. the house maid has fallen in love with one of the older and fat bald headed mistral and chases him for marriage.HAns Stuw doesn't seem to be much interested in Inge. It turns out that hes obsessed with her mother  he has a secret painting of her that he worships every day in her memory He was turned down for Inge's father. She doesn't know this yet. The village is having a celebration a centennial of a their town and a battle that happen in the Renaissance to the colonial times.Every body participates. The police catches her brother.After playing a hero in the paradeHans Stuw is about to go home and do something desperate.

Paul decide's to let go of Inge and let his German speaking British friend have her. She changes her mind and realizes that she was in love with Paul all along. this is a very colorful movie with colorful characters. the print that I got is a NTSC VHS version being sold by the 'German video language center. It's from a master video that was made before it was restored for the euro DVD version. The Agfa color isn't bad but its a bit dull.Kinowelt video thru Amazon.de has the restored to brilliant print version on DVD. But American VHS version isn't bad Up date  made a mistake again Willy Fritzes character does not have his wife with him . Whether he's divorce or not that is a question mark The British pilots sister is with fritz. But why is the character that Fritz plays last name is different? unless Murphy was the British pilot characters mother fist marriage then she got a divorce and married Fritz's character after he had the son an daughter. this is still confusing . 12908 One more time and no more up date 1210 08. Heli Finkenzeller does not portray Fritz's sister but Willy wife sorry. I looked at the titles in the movie more closely when it stated Willy Fritz Mr Murphy. Also the color is okay  In this copy they turned the color down a bit making it looked dull. I turned the color up 80 degrees temperature and it looked exactly like the DVD version.".

The main guy is supposedly the underdog of the society whom never has much luck than one night he meets the women of he's dreams they have a fight just before things go wrong. And he gets turned in to a vampire with a conscience. Which means he's gonna go around for the rest of the movie preaching about right and wrong and that you can not go around killing people just cause you're a vampire. Even though he does it him self sometimes He bitch and wines like he is in a Ben stiller movie. This gives me even less sympathy for him. Oh it's so hard being a vampire my conscience is telling me to stop If you like a vampire movie that moves at snail pace this might just be the movie for you. It's kind of like a movie about a vampire's struggle with he's inner self and he's conscience. It makes twilight seem Oscar worthy and they even have sparkling vampires how sad is that".

This is a story of relationships vampires only play a small part in the film but reflect the confusion and choices we make when choosing how to live and who we choose to spend our lives with. What would your choice be if you had to choose for eternity? More realistic than most films of the genre the main characters struggle with tentative connections that are sharply forced when an accident causes an irrevocable change of plans.The back and forth indecision of the characters and the uncertainty over the morality of their choices underlies the majority of the film and in this sense was both satisfyingly realistic and annoying. Most films in any genre have boy meet girl they fall in love and then do whatever it takes to be together for ever. You won't find this kind of romance here and sometimes it simply becomes irritatingif refreshing.Personally I found the ending unsatisfactory but more unpredictable than most films of this nature. As a result of this ambiguity some viewers will not like this film but if you can empathize with a pair of young people thrust into a different world that seems to force a foreverafter choice you'llif not enjoy then appreciate the storyline. The acting was low key but decent and the dialogue pretty realisticwhile nothing about the music or cinematography stood out that's actually the sign of a decent film.".

As in if your boyfriend suffered fatal injuries in a car accident would you be happy when your longlost bloodsucker father reincarnated him as a member of the living dead? It's great having your beau back but at the cost of him having to stay indoors all days and uncontrollably feasting on passing humans when the mood takes him? A guy can't just survive on stray cats  dogs alone ya know...I found the characters here compelling in the way they interacted with each other and the lowkey undertakings a refreshing change from the usual blood eruptions associated with the genre. It provides direct contrasts between vampires trying to cling onto whatever traces of humanity they possess to those who give into their base desires and see their former race as just cattle. It also raises an interesting quandary I'm going to live for eternity. Should I contact my old flame even though she's now YEARS older? All intriguing questions and explored in good detail.Sure there's the odd dodgy acting moment and bad special effect but so what? For the relative sum it must have cost to make it's a bit of a hidden gem. And the final shot is quite beautiful. 610".

After they have sex she rewards him with info as to the whereabouts of the missing Pullman. It's all so silly so inane... The same detective hugs McDowell Pullman's wife during the interview! In between all the absurd and farfetched goingson there are the obligatory deep European moments we have a black woman recite poetry  or modern poetry  which is so painfully PC not to mention pointless stupid and so very dull. After she finishes her pretentious little poem about her father playing with her vagina the stunt woman approaches her and says that she never met her daddy. How deep is that?! Later on a badlywritten black character raps more poetry and gets an applause for it we later get to see his penis which is also obligatory in deep European art films. What's the point of that fight in the bar?! Utterly pointless. And what's with that dialogue between Pullman and McDowell at the end? What's all that nonsense about? Dumb dumb dumb... The mark of every bad director is to have children behave like adults so why should Wim be an exception? The little Latino girl philosophizes about not having a chance to see her dead father but we can't always get what we want this coming from the mouth of a 7 yearold! She also says something in the last scene but by then I was almost halfasleep so I don't remember it.But what can one honestly expect from a person who makes a movie that is partly scripted by Bono?! in which he casts a rank amateur such as Milla Jovovich in a piece of garbage known as Million Dollar Hotel? It is monumentally ironic and arrogant that Wim makes a brief mockattack at Schwarzenegger early on in the movie the latter may be a bad actor but his contribution to the world of film is already about a hundred times that of Wim's.

In reality Wim should thank Satan with whom he must have a contract that he ever got a chance to direct at all let alone for Hollywood. As is plain to see I have used many exclamation marks in this review the movie is full of absurdities bad dialogue and is rather pointless.

	schema:headline " Violence would be preferable to this";
	schema:reviewBody "Wim Wender's The End of Violence is a rather disjointed and uninvolving piece of filmmaking. It wants to be a tale about how violence affects our lives and how once exposed to it we find ourselves fundamentally changed. It might actually succeed if it wasn't busy confusing the audience and boring them to death at the same time.As the film opens we are treated to a day in the life of Hollywood producer Mike Max Bill Pullman who is busy wheeling and dealing through multiple phones and computer connections all the while ignoring his wife Paige Andie McDowell. While he is out during the day he is kidnapped by two not quite bright hit men who are killed in a mysterious fashion and Mike Max manages to escape. He is found dazed by some Latino gardeners and Mike decides that he needs to hide from his old life to protect himself while discovering that violence which he has peddled in action movies is a bad thing. Meanwhile Paige has taken over her husbands company in his absence and developed a relationship with a recording artist named Six K. Todd Freeman who provides the love she was lacking in her relationship with Mike. Also meanwhile technical whiz Ray Bering Gabriel Byrne is busy putting the finishing touches on a hightech surveillance system that the government hopes to use to bring violence in the city under control. However Ray begins to suspect that the system is possibly being used for nefarious purposes and is trying to get someone to listen to him. And yet elsewhere still stuntwoman turned actress Cat Traci Lind is getting her big acting break in Mike's latest film and she finds herself somewhat smitten with detective Dean Brock Loren Dean who is investigating the disappearance of Mike.As you can probably tell from the above paragraph The End of Violence has a lot going on.

Take the plot thread of Ray trying to discover the truth about the surveillance system. It is revealed eventually that he has actually already been in contact with Mike about it with the hopes of revealing the system to the public but the film has so many pieces moving around that it takes forever to make the connection between those two characters.The film also features dreaded voiceover monologues that are just silly and pretentious. The antiviolence message what there is of it is also heavyhanded to say the least. In one scene Six speaks to Mike on the phone and gives us a long explanation about why violence is good and people revel in it. You can practically see Wenders on his soapbox while this scene is going on.I suppose this movie is supposed to be a thriller to some degree but there is little that is thrilling about The End of Violence. It is a monotonous bore of a film that comes to a rather abrupt ending without really dealing with all of the issues it seems to want to explore. Instead of an end of violence I'll take an end to this particular mess.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wim Wender's The End of Violence is a rather disjointed and uninvolving piece of filmmaking. It wants to be a tale about how violence affects our lives and how once exposed to it we find ourselves fundamentally changed. It might actually succeed if it wasn't busy confusing the audience and boring them to death at the same time.As the film opens we are treated to a day in the life of Hollywood producer Mike Max Bill Pullman who is busy wheeling and dealing through multiple phones and computer connections all the while ignoring his wife Paige Andie McDowell. While he is out during the day he is kidnapped by two not quite bright hit men who are killed in a mysterious fashion and Mike Max manages to escape. He is found dazed by some Latino gardeners and Mike decides that he needs to hide from his old life to protect himself while discovering that violence which he has peddled in action movies is a bad thing. Meanwhile Paige has taken over her husbands company in his absence and developed a relationship with a recording artist named Six K. Todd Freeman who provides the love she was lacking in her relationship with Mike. Also meanwhile technical whiz Ray Bering Gabriel Byrne is busy putting the finishing touches on a hightech surveillance system that the government hopes to use to bring violence in the city under control. However Ray begins to suspect that the system is possibly being used for nefarious purposes and is trying to get someone to listen to him. And yet elsewhere still stuntwoman turned actress Cat Traci Lind is getting her big acting break in Mike's latest film and she finds herself somewhat smitten with detective Dean Brock Loren Dean who is investigating the disappearance of Mike.As you can probably tell from the above paragraph The End of Violence has a lot going on. The problem is that little of it is compelling and because the film is busy juggling so many plot threads at the same time several of them seem like afterthoughts. The subplot featuring Paige's involvement with Six for instance has absolutely no emotional resonance for the audience because we barely know these people.

	schema:reviewBody "...or as I like to think of it THE END OF VIOLENCE is the greatest scifi crime thriller that never was.As always with Wim Wenders the plot is fantastic. But as always with Wim Wenders the movie isn't about the plot and those who expect to be carried by the plot will be disappointed. In the same way WINGS OF DESIRE had a great plot about angels but was not a fantasy in the same way UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD had a great plot about a high tech dream machine but was not about technology in the same way LISBON STORY had a riveting plot about a missing person but was not a mystery here we have the same Wendersian formula which he pulls off flawlessly.The plot if you're curious is about a futuristic God machine that can eliminate people with the push of a button. Designed ostensibly for crime prevention  surveillance the old to protect  serve  where have we heard that before? it gets out of control and takes murder  corruption to the next level of clinical perfection. Caught up in the game is Mike Max a movie producer struggling with his own intense xenophobia and paranoia which like a disease he himself spreads to society through his films.That's all I'll say about the plot because a I don't want to ruin anything and b like I said the plot is secondary. What's really important as you watch this movie is to pay attention to the thoughtprovoking dialogue the philosophical allusions and the overall metaphor of the situation. If you can tune into that stuff then you're set for a great experience.I'll give you just one example of the philosophy. There's a scene early on where they talk about the observer effect you might recognize it as the paradox of Schrdinger's cat which you can look up on wikipedia. This is the fundamental theme of the film the idea that even by impartially observing we change the situation or in some cases destroy it. As one of the characters says it's like flipping on the light to observe the darkness. What a poetic  appropriate analogy.This movie is choc full of that kind of stuff and you may miss it if you're expecting car chases and gunfire. No instead you get the ultimate antiviolence violence film and I gotta give Wenders a standing ovation on being the first director I've seen pull it off. A lot of movies in the past have carried a message of antiviolence yet the films sink to the thrill of showing violence themselves and often glorifying it the biggest example would be Norm Jewison's classic ROLLERBALL and this becomes confusing if not outright hypocritical. But in this case we get a chilling depiction of the epidemic of violence without showing any blood  guts to excite our savage instincts. It remains an intellectual film not visceral. Don't get me wrong this movie is plenty suspenseful and on more than one occasion it'll have your heart flopping like an electrified noodle. But it's all done by way of the mind. To me that's what makes this depiction of violence all the more effective  frightening the way it's so clean  neat like in a video game. And without any fuss someone's head could just go pop.This is the best film I've seen in a while. I'm only taking off a few points because I wished it was twice as long  had more monologues like some of the older Wenders films. But I have to say this film sticks to its objective and delivers a perfect product.".

	schema:headline " An Unexpected Movie with an Unexpected Ending";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a mainstream movie but that does not mean that it is bad. The End of Violence is a very good movie which has quite a lot within its frame work. It is somewhat slow and when watching it for the first time it seems that there are scenes in the movie that could have been left out they did not seem to add to the overall plot of the movie and that tends to put me off. These scenes though namely the poetry reading scenes do indeed add to the plot in a very subtle way and are very important in the development of the characters two of whom are minor characters in the movie. Even then the poetry that is read out depicts the major theme of the movie and that is the enemy that is within not the enemy without and the realisation of the characters that the enemy is not out there but in amongst us.When watching the movie we must constantly remember the title because that helps us understand what the movie is about. It works in two levels though in a social level and in a psychological level. The social level of the movie is about a new security system which can monitor all the city of Los Angeles. A man can sit in one room and see almost anywhere in Los Angeles. He watches crimes happen and he watches criminals get caught. The problem with this is that congress does not know about the system and if they found out about it then big problems would happen. They must keep it secret at all costs it will end violence but at the cost of people's privacy. This seems to reflect Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four where big brother knows everything.The psychological aspect of the movie deals with a film producer name Micheal Max. Everybody knows and loves this guy but he is not loved by all as he is abducted by a couple of hit men and was about to be executed. Micheal Max has an obsession with violence he says that when he was a kid he was scared of the movies and then he became a film producer. This suggests that he desires to master violence by controlling it in the forms of movies. Though he tries to master violence he cannot master his life. His relationship with his wife is falling apart as he just does not spend anytime with her. She begins by just wanting to leave and ends by taking everything.The plot of the movie comes out when he receives an email from somebody containing confidential FBI information. Then he is abducted and one assumes that it is because of the FBI document. This is someway true but the killers are nothing more than idiots. The film does not reveal who attempted to kill him or why but this document remains somewhat important though we are never told what it is. This movie never really wants us to be sure. It lets us make up our minds about things but does not tell us if we are wrong or not. What we are really doing is watching Micheal Max come to understand and conquer his fear of violence.There are three main male characters Doc a forensic scientist who is investigating Mike Max's disappearance Mike Max and Ray the operator of the surveillance system. The characters have little contact in the movie but are connected. There are three women that are directly connected with each of these characters and two of these women interact with one of the other males characters. Max's wife the first one speaks with Doc but her role is that she drifts further away from Max. The actress is loved by Mike as a friend but her role is that she builds a relationship with Doc. Then there is Sue the Mexican cleaner who works under Ray. They fall in love but at the end of the movie she exits with Mike Max after both have given up violence. The casting of the three male characters was done in a way that they all were similar in appearance. These characters were linked in this way and also in a way that they were trying to bring an end to violence. Mike Max has been discussed Ray is trying to bring an end through the surveillance system while Doc is a police officer trying to uncover the truth. It is interesting that the police are not interested in the truth they have their theory and are not at all interested in the truth.There is a lot more in this movie but to bring it up would mean watching it again and studying it closer. This movie is very good for those who like movies which make you think. The ending isn't conclusive and you don't realise it is there until you get there. It comes as a bit of a shock because there seems to be a lot of things unresolved but when you look back over the movie you realise that they have been resolved but not in the way you expect it to be. The movie tells you numerous times that it is not a typical Hollywood ending such as Mike Max's comment I hate those conspiracy movies where the beautiful woman gets killed. This is not a typical Hollywood movie and thus does not have a satisfying ending for those who want one.".

This is one of Wenders' great strengths his disregard for hammering things home.  He has such a poetic sense of subtlety that very few filmmakers have ever matched it.  To some this will feel like plodding and misdirection but it is a choice a very clear choice that works perfectly in what it tries to accomplish.There aren't any elements of End that I thought could have been improved much.  The dialogue seemed a bit rushed in spots but technically everything else is terrific.  The ensemble cast complements itself well there are some great cameos such as Sam Phillips accompanying a handheld tape player and the soundtrack ia gorgeous.  The themes are as rich as apropos as can be and the visuals are so well thoughtout they could have come from Kubrick.This is a slowpaced heavy convoluted film.  My vote for film of the year.".

To some this will feel like plodding and misdirection but it is a choice a very clear choice that works perfectly in what it tries to accomplish.There aren't any elements of End that I thought could have been improved much.  The dialogue seemed a bit rushed in spots but technically everything else is terrific.  The ensemble cast complements itself well there are some great cameos such as Sam Phillips accompanying a handheld tape player and the soundtrack ia gorgeous.  The themes are as rich as apropos as can be and the visuals are so well thoughtout they could have come from Kubrick.This is a slowpaced heavy convoluted film.  My vote for film of the year.";

But the movie seemed to be lost missing in action.But six months later I watched it on video and I realized I was looking at an entirely different movie.Then I watched it again...and again and again until I'd seen the thing ten times including one where I only listened to the film to see if I was simply addicted to Wim's luminous visuals.What you realize is that this film is cooking up some very threatening ideas about the quality and nature of love and the companion six degrees of violence and hatred. It is really about the way in which fear and love pulse in contrary and similar ways much like particle and wave dancing together.It's also a fantastic critique the confederacy of dunces and the manner in which we manufacture enemies to suit our paranoia.I must say that there are few directors that move me as much as Wim Wenders and I have to  confess that I have cried many times over the beauty and grace of some of the scenes and visuals in this movie. Much like Robert Altman or Atom Egoyan Wenders cares about people believes in their struggles and he creates tension that moves them at least temporarily to understand their natures more fully.A masterpiece if a masterpiece means your heart moves even slightly...PS Ry Cooder's soundtrack is brilliant!".

Instead the focus remains on human characters and interesting ideas. The characters include powerful film producer Mike Max played by Bill Pullman who has to some extent lost touch with his own humanity as he makes a fortune creating incredibly violent action movies his lonely wife Paige Andie Macdowell a hightech research scientist Ray Bering Gabriel Byrne who is also lonely and tending his ailing elderly father a nice cameo by Sam Fuller an overlysincere forensic detective named Lowell Lewis John Diehl and stuntwoman turned actress Cat Traci Lind. Interesting minor roles are played by Todd Freeman as a Hollywooddarling rapper and Solidad St Hilaire as a Hispanic maid who proves to be more than she first appears to be.Wenders places this ensemble in contemporary LA where Ray Bering is setting up an ultrasecret cuttingedge satellite surveillance network that promises to end the possibility of crime  or as rapidly becomes clear the possibility of privacy as well during testing phases it's telling how Bering finds himself snooping on people arguing or crying in their apartments. Some time before the beginning of the film Bering has met Mike Max and given him his name and phone number and the producer is clearly mulling over the encounter in the opening scene. Others somewhere are also aware of this meeting as becomes startlingly clear when two thugs attempt to kill Max  but are themselves mysteriously killed by outside forces before they finish the job. Max flees the scene and disappears from his former highprofile life.This is just the beginning of a story that turns many people's lives upsidedown and encourages us to examine our preconceptions about ideas such as violence law and order privacy the responsibility of art and how big business thrives on all of the above. Fascinating film but not one for those looking for car chases explosions and empty action melodrama.Ron Henry".

	schema:headline " Duvall at the Height of his power in GET LOW";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Duvall is one of the best American actors of the past half century. Witness his roles in To Kill a Mockingbird The Godfather I and II The Great Santini Apocalypse Now Open Range and a full TV resume including Lonesome Dove. In Get Low he gives a measured understated performance as a mysterious old hermit who makes an unusual life changing decision. This independent film is deceptively simple and honest. Yet it is done extremely well and leaves a deep feeling about life's regrets.After the brief image of a house burning down we flash forward to a rural setting in the 1930's to see an old home inhabited by a reclusive elderly man Felix Bush Duvall whose disheveled appearance and reputation are the stuff of rumor and legend. Are the stories about him true? Is he a killer? Haunted by visions of a woman he decides to arrange his own funeral before his actual demise. The funeral home is run by Frank Quinn Bill Murray and his loyal assistant Buddy Robinson Lucas Black. Felix wants to invite everyone who has a story about him to tell. He sweetens the pot by offering to raffle off his vast acreage of property. He also runs into an old acquaintance Mattie Sissy Spacek who has strong ties to him from way back. He later pays a visit to a preacher in another town in hopes of having him conduct the eulogy. As the plot thickens we find that Felix is hiding a painful secret that will have the town reexamining its prejudices and assumptions about a tortured soul who is struggling for his own redemption before it's too late.Novice director Aaron Schneider whose previous credits were as a cinematographer of various TV shows and movies does a solid job with a modest budget and a lean story and script by Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell.It's nice to see veteran actors like Duvall Spacek and Murray play older characters wrinkles and all with enthusiasm and conviction. Duvall does a splendid job of presenting a cipher of a man whose words are sparse and direct and slowly as the story develops begins to open up to reveal a complex person replete with feelings of guilt. There are reasons perhaps for why he is the way he is. Duvall is destined for an Oscar nomination and Spacek arguably deserves a nod for strong support. Bill Murray as the funeral director does a convincing job as a businessman who isn't quite a villain or hero. He is carving a nice career niche as a dramatic character actor aside from being a comedic superstar.The film successfully evokes the period of depression era small town USA. There are few items to quibble about however a violent break in at the funeral home doesn't really forward the plot and is never fully explained.There are similarities in Felix and the noble character in The Ballad of Cable Hogue. In both films the protagonist is an aged stubborn loner and in the end as his life is in its twilight the truth sets him free. Perhaps the lesson here is that each person has a story and some of the stories are not always evident. With Get Low we get to see the bittersweet tale of a broken heart. Your heart will be moved too.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. I am not familiar with director Aaron Schneider who apparently has done mostly cinematography work on TV for the past 10 years. He must feel like a lottery winner getting to direct his first feature film and having a cast with Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek.This is a very odd film centered on the story of 1930's Tennessee backwoods recluse Felix Bush played exceedingly no surprise well by Robert Duvall. We learn  slowly  that Felix has been in a selfimposed exile carrying enormous guilt over an incident from 40 years prior. The wonderful thing is that it takes us just about the entire film to discover what caused this guilt and how Felix has dealt with it.Over that 40 years the legend of old man Bush has grown with the town people. It is approaching Tall Tale status when he whips up on a local wiseass on one of his rare visits to town. When Felix realizes that stories have been concocted about him over the years he heads to local funeral home to arrange a funeral party where everyone can come and tell their stories. The local mortician is played by Bill Murray and I can best describe his personality as eager opportunist.While this appears to be a slow moving story it really isn't. The real motivation for the party a reconnection with the past and a cleansing confession all play a part in this fine story. Sissy Spacek plays a painful link to Felix' past as well as a key to this latestlast event.Three excellent performances by Duvall Spacek and Bill Cobbs really make this one work. Bill Murray and Lucas Black hold up their end by supplying a bit of humor and purity respectively though the story really belongs to Duvall. His ability to convey emotion with a grunt or facial expression is just amazing to watch.My only real complaint with the film is that it lasted about 2 minutes too long. The perfect ending had occurred and then we are dealt one final seemingly forced scene. A minor quibble with a film that kept me fully engaged.".

	schema:reviewBody "Get Low is in part considered a psychological drama it's also one of those films that can be classified as almost anything because the actors are able to add so many layers of interest with intrigue and comedy.Starring an almost unrecognizably old Robert Duvall and a Jarmuschstyled Bill Murray respectively as a hermit wanting to host his own funeral and a funeral home director wanting his business. On the surface it's a very slow drama because that is essentially all that happens Murray helps Duvall plan his own funeral. But we are saved from a tedious drama by the actors' comedic timings. There's a lot of dry humour that I found myself laughing outloud many times. The significance of the film is the psychology in its heart. Throughout Duvall drops hints as to what his character is all about. You find yourself thinking about who he really is and what he really means with every line he says. Robert Duvall just may be the best subtle actor.Get Low is very stylized. Set in the 1920s the director and cinematographer paid attention to the lighting casting shadows where they wanted them providing a dark atmosphere when needed to echo the times of the depressionera. I'll also call the humour stylized it's dry and it can take you a minute to make sure you got it right.The one downside is that the filmmakers may have made it a bit too artsy and not accessible enough because otherwise this could be up for every major award. At least we can rest assured that the Academy knows where to find Mr. Duvall.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Hollywood has consistently examined the angry young man his older counterpart is normally portrayed by a character actor in a minor role. Robert Duvall is no stranger to portraying offbeat aging male leads but here he accepts the ultimate challenge  drawing an audience in to examine the life of a selfmade hermit with a widely reviled yet barely explained past.Bill Murray and Sissy Spacek a dream team supporting cast also portray vintage folk with secrets of their own. This partly frontier western largely psychological mystery unravels slowly in scenes with little or no dialog. What dialog there is offers several levels of potential meaning through pregnant pauses illdefined sentence fragments and questions with no immediate answers. The viewer either chooses to fill in the blanks by closely observing peripheral elements in each scene or simply awaits a climax that ultimately explains everything. That scene never quite tells all but intentionally and inventively so. It's the former viewer for whom this film has been so meticulously wellcrafted to sidestep the clearly declarative and ultimately obvious. The score is a particularly captivating mix of period Americana and original music that resonates with the time and place  even when performed by a Polish orchestra or underappreciated U.S. folkcountry performers of our own era. In short GET LOW is a niche film that quietly rewards a cinemaloving audience for investing its full attention. Leave your smart phone at home for the best multitasking experiences are built into the work itself. The 2009 copyright date indicates Sony Classics after due deliberation acquired a hard sell that other studios overlooked.An early October Oscar season screening of this December U.S. release ended with much applause atypical for guild audiences. Almost half even stayed through the credits an indication that many involved in the film on all levels are worthy of namerecognition for your consideration.".

	schema:headline " A film of depth with outstanding acting";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not an expert movie critic or examiner by any means. But it seems to me from the comments to this date that many reviewers may have missed something very important to this film. True it has many aspects that lend to its quality. Most have noted the humor intrigue curiosity and some emotional and psychological ties. But the overriding foundation of the story was in the fear and dislike among the community for the main character Felix Bush and in his role relating to those people. What a great irony there where so many people over the past 40 years have grown up with various wild stories about some heinous things Bush did in his past. It's ironic because we don't really hear what most of those are. And then we find out at the end that he did in fact have a horrible incident in his past life. After Bush learns that an old acquaintance has died he visits the grave only to find a few flowers and a couple of cards left there. So he decides to plan a funeral party for himself and to invite everyone who has a story to tell about him to come. This means that he must come out of his reclusive home in the backwoods. As he does so we have some nice vignettes of humor with him and the funeral home owner and his employee. The community begins to warm up to him some and he to the community it seems. But by the day of the festive advancefuneral party it is clear that Bush did in fact have a dark and tragic past. By this time the viewers and most of the characters themselves in the movie begin to understand why this old hermit has lived alone for the past 40 years. He was escaping a dark past  or was he really trying to escape it? The unfolding of this simple question gives sense to the whole movie and to this eccentric hermit's life. And now for the first time we can all see the real humaneness the true personality and redeeming character of a man who has lived with memories of a lifelong nightmare. And we now see his real reason for wanting the funeral party for all to come to. The masterful script and directing didn't really give us any clues to help unravel the mystery. The wonderful backwoods setting and scenes painted a picture of a lonely man living withdrawn from the world. And the unfolding of the story slowly brings to life all the main characters as they relate to this most unusual time in their lives. The acting is superb by everyone. I agree with those who said Robert Duvall should be in the running for an Oscar. But I think at least two other actors should equally be in the running for supporting roles  Bill Murray and Lucas Black. Sissy Spacek Bill Cobbs and a handful of others also gave top notch performances. This is unquestionably the finest story with great character and outstanding acting of any movie I have watched that was produced in the past year. And it's nearly squeaky clean. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:headline " Old Codger's big 'reveal' at end disappoints";
	schema:reviewBody "Get Low has an original premise based on a true story. Back in 1938 in Tennessee a hermit an old codger of sorts decides to hold a funeral for himself while he's still alive. The hermit's motive for throwing the funeral is to finally hear all the bad things the townspeople have been saying about him behind his back for years.In the movie the hermit is Felix Bush played by Robert Duvall. He's got a long beard and has numerous 'no trespassing' signs posted at the entrance to his property. When he strolls into town he's always armed with a shotgun. A young bully tries to taunt Felix but he turns the tables on him by knocking him out. And oh yesFelix has a dark secret that has been the source of internal torment since he was a young man.Felix ends up conscripting funeral director Frank Quinn played by a rather tame Bill Murray to organize the funeral party. He's got a young assistant Buddy who ends up looking after Felix. The plot complications involve Felix changing his mind about the funeral plans. At one point he calls the funeral off later he nixes the idea of allowing the townspeople to bad mouth him at the funeral. Finally he decides to raffle off his property upon his deaththe townspeople will pay a small fee and one lucky winner will be chosen at the festivities.The problem with Get Low is that the main character never grows. Throughout the film Duvall plays a man who's perennially mad at himself. There's a lot of time spent building up to Felix's big confession at the funeral. First all we get are many hints. In Felix's heated confrontation with Mattie Sissy Spacek we learn she blames him for something he did involving her sister there's a weak attempt at comedy when Felix has a heart attack and Mattie suddenly has to pull back walking out on him instead ending up having to attend to him as he's passed out on the floor. There's also the Reverend Charlie Jackson a black preacher who knows all about Felix's dark past but won't tell I wondered how there was not one racist comment directed toward the good Reverend since this was supposed to be the Jim Crow South during the 30s.The entire Get Low storyline is predicated on Felix's confession at the funeral. Unfortunately the confession proves much more sentimental than surprising. It seems that Felix got himself involved with Mattie's sister. One night he goes over to see her and discovers that the husband had attacked her with a hammer knocking her out. The husband knocks over a lamp starting a fire and Felix is unable to save the woman he loves. Just as we saw in the beginning of the film Felix must jump out of the burning house and he's the only one to survive.Felix's confession is cathartic and the tears flow. He's finally gotten it off his chest. Nonetheless Felix's guilt trip feels misplaced. After all it wasn't Felix who was actually responsible for his lover's death. Nonetheless he beats himself up for years over the event. For a good part of the movie Felix's histrionics are played out ad infinitumyes we get the fact that he feels bad about what happened. But when the beans are finally spilled at the end we feel cheated since something much more dramatic is expected.Even Bill Murray disappoints here. Where was the irascible con man when we needed him? Instead Murray's Quinn opts out as a good guy who doesn't want to fleece anyone and ends up lending a helping hand to anyone he can.If there's anything positive here it's mostly in the set design and music. Like 'Bonnie and Clyde' 'Get Low' evokes the bygone era of the Great Depression and scores points mainly for atmosphere.Strip away all the histrionics and one finds that Get Low is simply about a depressed guy who finally feels better after getting something off his chest that he's bottled up for years. Where's the drama in that? Mr. Duvall did not get the Oscar nomination he was looking for and rightly so. Given the long awkward setup a sentimental ending is the only place 'Get Low' can go!".

Normally to get over 7.0 on this website is quite an achievement and demands attention. The only genre which doesn't do well on IMDb and is never a fair reflection of the quality of the film is 'Horror'. Anyway this movie is labeled as being 'drama' and 'mystery'. For the latter I would expect some tension and a bit of suspense. I am mistaken in regards to this film.Firstly a great performance by Duvalland Murphy is competent as usual. The problem is that this film is such a slow pace and after the first 20 minutes you suspect where it is going. And it goes there at an inexorable and tedious pace.So this review doesn't really contain spoilers because anyone with a brain will know immediately what is going to happen. And in a nutshell... Duvall is portrayed as a bad man but the audience don't know what he has done although the way it is played you'd think he'd killed and eaten several children. As the movie drags on you realize that the denouement is going to be him opening his heart and telling an audience of doubters that actually  he did nothing wrong at all and his only motivation was 'love'. Yes  it slowly turns from a story of intrigue to one of sickly sentimentality with the final shot of the film enough to make one vomit all over one's tshirt.It's a shame as Duvall is great but the lack of pace and the heaping on of the sugar does not suggest 'drama' or 'mystery' to me.An extra note Spacek is terrible. She has one expression throughout. Maybe all that chicken blood she endured in Carrie hampered her ability to act for the rest of her career.".

All of them are excellent.This is so beautifully filmed you swear you are right in the middle of rural America in the 1930s. Shotaftershot is a marvel. The story is slow but it should keep your interest as you wonder what Felix Bush Duvall is going to do at the end. You're never quite what he's going to say and do at any time actually which keeps the story intriguing.

That's the secret? Compare this to Kristin ScottThomas's secret in I Loved You So Long. OK when that was revealed it made me understand why she stoically stayed in prison and let everyone talk about her however they wanted to. This wasn't it. Why the vast majority of critics loved this movie is obviously due to my 5 rating beyond me.".

After 40 and some odd years he decides that the time has come for him to reveal his life's story and approaches funeral home director Frank Quinn Bill Murray to organize a funeral party in his name whilst still being alive.Cast and crew turn in a marvelous show based on true events about a guilt stricken old man who wants to come clean in his advancing years. The movie is well paced and features some fine acting performances by Murray Duvall and Spacek. The major downfall of the film however is that the story doesn't provide enough gravitas to carry the 100 minutes to a satisfying degree. We never get to know much else about the old geezer and there is just nothing happening to really complicate matters as they move along. I'd really like to give this movie extra credit for a job well done but the truth is that there's far too little pay off at the end to warrant anything higher. 65100".

	schema:reviewBody "Felix Bush is a hermit he lives all alone in the backwoods and he likes it that way. He has a sign that reads 'no trespassing' when someone trespasses he puts up another sign 'no damn trespassing'. One day a priest arrives to inform him of a death someone he knows. He then gets the idea to have a funeral party for himself while he is still alive. Saw an advanced screen of Get Low and if Robert Duvall were to stop acting now then he can be proud of his career. He surely will continue to act because he's darn good at it but with Get Low he manages to give a performance that is both emotional and real. The film is loosely based on real events and Duvall along with the supporting cast are able to bring this dry period piece to a rather enjoyable close. Get Low is something that many people will think is boring and it is at parts. If it weren't for the performance from Duvall then the film would be rated lower in my books. Bill Murray Bill Cobbs and Lucas Black all share the screen time but never do much to really hold a scene with Duvall. They are good but Duvall simply outshines them all. One scene in particular comes to mind and it's the most interesting part of the film itself near the end. Duvall gives a speech and it feels real you feel the humanity in his performance and speech as if someone's grandfather were telling them a story for the first time. Lucas Black's role could have been played by anyone. Unfortunately for Black he hasn't matured enough as an actor to make this role memorable or even important. I give him points for starring in a film like this more attempts like this and he might be enjoyable. Bill Murray channels his Broken Flowers role here. He saunters along and throws in the occasional smart ass remark. Sissy Spacek plays an old friend of Felix they have history together. Certain revelations are made in the film that put a heavy strain on their so called friendship. The film at first is about this man who wants to throw a funeral party but by the film's end it seems as if it was never about that at all. The most important scene is indeed at his funeral party but it's for reasons only revealed to the viewer at that particular moment. Felix has a secret a reason he is all alone now. The film doesn't really try to get us to guess what it is or care about it until really late in the story. Get Low looks great and is directed confidently. The film has a wooden golden glow to it. Very appropriate considering Felix is a carpenter of some sort. It plays well in the time line it's characters are in and never feels fake. There have been some talk about Oscars for this film. While I don't really think it has a chance in any department the only one that wouldn't surprise me is Robert Duvall. His honest portrayal of a broken man that hates himself should be recognized. Get Low is something that not many film goers will appreciate but those looking for good performances from veteran actors Black being the exception will find something to like in Get Low. I know I did.".

At the funeral party with plenty of extras in costumes and cars Felix reveals his crime which it turns out was not that bad after all. What almost made be throw up was when Felix died for real his girl friend of the deep past came to visit him as a ghost to guide him to heaven. Gag me with a spoon!

	schema:reviewBody "This darkbutglad tale of an old old man Felix Bush played by an old old Robert Duvall is a little too heartwarming when it should be really scathing but such is its story about the quiet redemption wanted near the end. Basically a hermit Duvall's character is a guy living in a selfmade cabin over forty years and something of a kind of dark legend in a small town in the South at least I think it's the South whereabout Tennessee I think. He knows he's near the end and he wants to prepare the funeral  rather a funeral party. Money is no object as long as a it can be pulled off by a Chicagoan funeral director played by a usuallyperfectdeadpan Bill Murray he has lines like I sold 26 of the ugliest cars in the middle of December with the wind blowing so far up my ass I was farting snowflakes into July and his assistant a grownup Lucas Black. Meanwhile Felix tries to reconcile with an old friend of his Mattie Sissy Spacek and a dark secret from the past.If you know how these movies go you can guess when the secret is revealed... aw shucks I'll say it it's in the big final speech. The film works like that giving us some very fine actors in some fine period clothes and fine production design though only Duvall and to a lesser extent Murray and Spacek have fullformed people to work with. Felix does reveal himself to be more than craggily hermit which is all well and good. It's only with the final climactic speech that the film really gets redeemed. There isn't much of a connection er catharsis about Felix's relationship or lack thereof with the town itself and only a little bit with a black preacher very capable veteran character actor Bill Cobbs. It feels like most of the characters Black's mostly are there to serve whatever is going on with the lead figure who as played in his usual emotional tact and perfect way of saying every line like it matters lifeordeath by Duvall.It's a pleasant film which is odd to note considering that it's about a man nearing the end of his days with a dark past unearthed and sins reopened the opening shot which is quite extraordinary with a house engulfed in flames and a figure running away from the house after jumping off the roof is a key to this but could have been more than just 'good' if it had more concern for its large ensemble. As a showcase for Duvall and Murray and Spacek it's worth recommending. As a really deep tale of loss and woe and death there have been better.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the surface Get Low converges upon the guiltridden life of Felix Bush who has decided to alienate himself for over forty years in an attempt to pay for his mysterious and supposedly unpardonable crime. This reclusive lifestyle leads many folks from the nearby town to believing in a plethora of stories wherein Felix Bush is disreputably or villainously portrayed. Willing to confess to the whole community and wishing to end once and for all the tall tales that plague his name Felix decides to arrange a funeral for himself by hiring Quinn funeral services owned by Frank Quinn Bill Murray and incites the townspeople to attend by holding a raffle whose winner would inherit this pariah's shelter and land. At the funeral Felix reveals the reason for his selfseclusion while the majority of his community tediously listens and counts down the minutes until the anxiouslyawaited lottery. Brief instances later the physical death of Felix Bush brings another funeral to life this time with fewer but truer attendants to bid adieu to this curious hermit who died twice. Getting lower into the ground unveils the critique that is launched against society's unfortunate tendency to carelessly mold any type of hearsay into unchallenged fact and spread it from mind to mind further intensifying the lie spawned by community. The initiative Felix Bush has of planning a funeral for himself while inviting all individuals who had been contaminated with one of society's lies about himself is symbolic not of his own death but the death of care and altruism that exists within the life of most individuals who exist passively in community. The rapaciousness of society is visibly accentuated by the stolid reaction of the townspeople who attend and listen to the heartfelt confession from Felix Bush and highlighted even further by their exclusive dissemination of joy only at the time of announcing the results of the raffle which reveals their truly egotistical intentions. The contrasting alternation between the lifestyles of a common citizen from the town like Frank Quinn who seeks the profit motive and the reclusive one lead by Felix Bush shows how a life devoid of societal pressures revolves around learning to harmoniously coexist with nature's gifts represented by the forestcovered location of Felix's shelter and his amiable interaction with the mule and focuses on reflecting about one's past actions and learning to above all pardon oneself first. The revelation of Felix's darkest secret of being incapable to rescue the love of his life from the devastating flames ignited by her draconian husband emphasizes even further the pure and benign nature of an individual surviving outside the grip of communal existence. The bottom line Get Low succeeds in grasping the viewers' attention right from the beginning by introducing a mysterious pariah that supposedly harms others in a variety of ways. Robert Duvall's talented performance exquisitely contributes to the audience's entertainment and the mystery sustaining this film. Though the middle acts focuses its efforts on rather tedious character interactions and Felix's secret may fail to impress those expecting a mindblowing hit Get Low is a film teeming with meaning that will never get low marks.".

He is so honest so real so human that the viewer can't help but be drawn into the movie.Sissy Spacek and Bill Murray are the other two main characters and they are both charming and the chemistry between them and Duvall is almost palpable.Lucas Black plays a young man who works for a funeral home and his job is mostly to drive Duvall's character around but don't think his part is small by any stretch of the imagination. I spent a lot of time watching young Mr. Black who can't help but smile or laugh when Duvall or Murray is talking. Watch him especially in the scene where Duvall's character is buying a new suit of clothes he laughs spontaneously at Duvall's comments to Murray and Murray's reaction. You just know this kid who has grown up to be quite handsome by the way used this movie as an exercise in learning and honing his craft by studying the experts.I have to agree with another poster who said the movie should have ended two minutes sooner than it did and I have a minor quibble in that Felix Bush's funeral guests were supposed to be all the people who had a story about him and we didn't get to hear even one of those stories from anyone but all in all this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.".

It is a film about how the abyss of the past transcends into the problems of the present. It is a story of transgeneration and transnational relations that gain extradynamics by the presence of the historical weight of the concentration camp of Auschwitz.In this sense the film is an amazing piece of storytelling because it catches the hesitations and irritations that we all  especially in my generation  have when dealing with our past knowing that in fact we are handling the questions and relations of today. Additionally Am Ende kommen Touristen has a very subtle way of mixing irony and cynicism attention and ignorance anger and joy closeness and distance without making it feel constructed or misleading. It is not very innovative in terms of filmmaking or cinematic narrative therefore 910 but it is a very honest story with fondly drawn characters respect for past and present and an appropriate ending that is really worth seeing  even more than once!".

Both performances were quite magnificent.The ordinary citizens of today's Oswiecim are reminded when they are asked where they come from that they live in a place whose name is associated with infamy but otherwise they live very normal lives and there seems to be no incongruity in the fact that the young people of Oswiecim dance the nights away in bars and pop venues just as young people do in other places. Some like the young woman who becomes Sven's girl friend Barbara Wysocka who are good linguists make a living out of conducting guided tours through the camp.I think it is an ALMOST perfect film sensitive bringing out the relationship between the two main characters with straightforward and ungimmicky filming. But without forgetting that there were many nonJewish Poles who also suffered in Auschwitz it is all the same somewhat astonishing that Jews are nowhere mentioned in the film. The old man presumably was not Jewish as a Polish inmate he had been given the job by the Nazis to collect the suitcases from the new arrivals. Repairing the suitcases for the exhibition is his mission in life. The only indication of the Holocaust is the fact that one can read the Jewish names on the suitcases.".

The difference seems to be that on one side you have the dramatic reconstruction of historical events with a clear message bad and good are clearly divided a hero stands up against state authority Schindler to save human lives etc.. 'Am Ende kommen Touristen' on the other side reflects on the problem that 'in real life' it's much more difficult to learn something out of the past. Moralistic reflections and statements  be it in movies or in real life  about the past have turned into repetitive selfrighteous clichs that have lost their meaning and their authenticity What does it mean to say 'Something like that should never happen again'? What political actions war for human rights etc. can be justified with past experiences? Why putting up an memorial on a site where once so many innocent people were killed when on the other side the present has changed so fast that the past has lost its meaning? In a way the films message is nihilistic there is no answer to the question of how the past relates to the present. There can be no lesson drawn from the past  rather the world has become too complex to be fully understood. And the science of history on the other hand has to solve the problem of relating the past to the present of persuading the reader that the past is somehow still relevant to the present. Though the film seems rather nihilistic in its political meaning it gives a rich insight in the often painful and desperate efforts of human beings who try to deal with those problems of the modern world and who try to find explanations of some kind. And after all the film gives hope in so far as in the end the protagonist returns to the memorial center therefore he is not just escaping from a hypercomplex world but tries to face it even though he hasn't found any definitive answers and can only listen wordlessly to the standardised reflections about the past of the teacher who talks to him in the bus.The formal style of the film underlines this enigmatic absence of meaning very successfully minimal use of music a very subtle dramatization e.g. the story is not about life or death an open end  all this reminds of the sophisticated style of Eric Rohmer.

Also one little line from the movie is still quoted by my brother and I all these years later  when Harris goes to make a tricky maneuver in his car he tells his passenger to put on her safety belt as he's about to do a Brodie and then yanks on the handbrake and spins the car in the middle of the road.

It's obvious that the filmmakers tried to save this in the editing room but the different tones still result in an inconsistent feeling. It doesn't help that each tone isn't very well done. The mystery angle isn't very clear and the comedy is painfully unfunny they even try doing a chase sequence Keystone Kops style. The movie looks a lot better than most other Canadian movies from the same period it obviously had an ample budget but its slickness doesn't hide its unsatisfying soul.

	schema:reviewBody "Am Himmel der Tag is a German movie from 2012 so this one will have its 5th anniversary next year. Lets talk a bit about the title here. The working title was Und dann war alles still and I do not like that one because it is a huge spoiler. But I think the title they went for is at least as bad maybe even worse as it sounds very pretentious and has little to do with the film's action. Oh well.. I guess they wanted a memorable title and they sure got it. I just wish they could have found something between these two extremely bad options. The English international title Breaking Horizons is only slightly better. But this is just one of not too many problems I had with this 85minute film. Director Pola Schirin Beck does a good job and the script by Burkhardt Wunderlich also works pretty nicely and keeps the audience interested. And then there is Aylin Tezel who gives a possibly careerdefining performance that had me glued to the screen for the most part. Admittedly her amazing looks also helped matter for sure.One of the best things about this film is how real and authentic it all felt. I never was under the impression that I was watching actors partially because they did a good job with their performances but also because the story was shown us in a way where I thought that it could all happen to anybody. A young woman has a onenight stand with a barkeeper becomes pregnant and struggles with friends and family because of the way she changes during her pregnancy and because she was about to go through the process of becoming somebody completely different in order to master the challenges ahead of her. But fate will change everything once again. Yes there were a few moments when I felt it was a bit odd for example that nobody at the celebration tries talking to her why she seems so unhappy. It was absolutely easy to see when they were singing and she was sitting there looking depressed. And I also did not care about the entire Martin story line but I guess they had to include it because otherwise the film may have run for 75 minutes only. So it is okay I guess. Maybe it was just my personal perception that these parts added nothing of value to the film. It's just subjective. Maybe others did not care about the parts with the neighbor. All in all the good easily outweighs the bad and Tezel does a very good job in carrying this film. I totally can see why Tezel and the filmmakers received a great deal of awards recognition for their work here. It is definitely deserved and the criticisms I mentioned should not keep you at all from checking it out. Thumbs up go see it.".

The scenery is brutal and gorgeous and the action is gripping. Unlike Touching the Void there seems to be a strong bond of trust between the climbers and the crew allowing us to see some spectacularly death defying footage in intimate closeup. The camera also manages to capture the spirit of place  the aloof ice princesses that are the Torres Del Paine in the Patagonian wilderness and the gentler charm of the Yosemite valley in late summer. There are very clear shots of the climbing routes I had not understood why that feature of El Capitan was called the Nose until I was staring up its right nostril!. This is not just beautiful mountains high adrenaline and ripped abs although there are no shortage of these. The relationship between two fiercely independent and competitive brothers sometimes striving for mutual goals sometimes conflicted always connected fraternally but not always happily make an absorbing psychological story within a story of the obsessive climbing fraternity. The minor characters Dean S. Potter Chongo and several who are given sobriquets like old school American climbers or no name at all I recognized the one they called 'Andy' was Andy Perkins provide some amazing footage and are complex and interesting people as well but the film wisely I think keeps its focus tightly on the Huber brothers and their attempt to break the speed climbing record for the Nose.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's a film about couple of worldclass athletes from Bavaria who never give up. What's rather cool is that they don't ever triumph in the film and that the footage on their attempts is all the more hairraising and expressive of the challenges they face for that. In addition camera placement whose details are never revealed shows a level of daring comparable to the climbers' physical feats. Its invisibility is a measure of its accomplishment. A DVD with making of details about how the film was shot as well as more mundane information about the logistics of the climbs and the shoot would be particularly welcome here. What we do get is a lot of rumination and some of the most astonishing footage of rock climbing at the highest level you're ever likely to see.Thomas and younger brother Alexander Huber are speed rock climbers and this film documents two attempts to set a record on The Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite with an attempt to cross a stormy but beautiful pass in Patagonia in between. Accidents abort the Nose record attempts. The Patagonian pass can't be crossed not surprisingly because of the weather.El Capitan is the gold standard of rock climbing and The Nose is its 1000foot central sheer upright front which at first seemed to climbers to be simply impossible. The first who succeeded in the attempt to scale it took 47 days in 1958. With modern methods and training it now normally takes those who succeed 23 days but the speed record is something under three hours. That gives you an idea of what kind of performance this isthe gap between good and excellent in this field. These climbers are in another world moving at a speed so scary and at a level of adrenalin so high once they're on their way with a good start on a good day that they move beyond fear. Not so in the days and hours beforehand though of course. And the El Capitan record attempts each begins with lots of dummy runs some of which take many hours longer than the record.Somewhat oddly since Alexander and Thomas do plenty of talking to the camera the film conveys little about their personal contexts beyond mounting climbing. Obviously this is disproportionately central to their world. But they do live in the real world somewhere actually quite near to each other. Clearly they're Germanspeaking and that's about all we hear them speak and they have a mother who cooks in a restaurantquality kitchenand objects to Thomas' continuing to risk his life though he's married with two children.There's also a handful of American climbers and exclimbers who talk to the camera about the sport and the Hubers. They provide interesting and sympathetic outlooks and a welcome relief from the obsessive intensity of the brothers. Obviously the Hubers have when they're at work on the rock a symbiotic level of coordination that is a key element in their ultimate success. But such bonding isn't without its element of psychodrama. Taking a break with other people helps make the film more relaxing to watch. The only serious misstep is the film's attempt to show a nightmare of falling one of the brothers has with fudged blurry footage. It's unnecessary and doesn't quite work. Beyond that one could only have wished for a little more personal context perhaps from their mother.You have to look somewhere else to find out a little about what else these guys do besides climb rocks. Alexander has a degree in physics but works as a mountain and ski guide and Thomas is also a mountain guide and plays in a band. This they themselves never mention. Rock climbing is their obsession their greatest challenge. But among their many ruminations are the points that they need to gain satisfaction from working alone tooThomas especially since as a climber he is overshadowed by Alexanderand that bravery in this one activity doesn't guarantee equal courage in the everyday challenges of life.It's a troubling paradox that Alexander was taught to climb by Thomas but has outstripped him as an athlete. He is also more meticulous as may befit a physicist more the planner. Thomas is more emotional more of a dreamer more impulsive and has this baggage of being bettered by his junior less celebrated in the pressand needing to chalk up some solid climbing accomplishments solowhich apparently he has done. The psychological complexity of the brothers' cooperation and competition is well depicted even if their ultimate motivationsand how it feels to be them in the rest of their livesare left unexplored. When the brothers fail in their two Nose record attempts in this film it's because of a pretty serious mishap each time. The footage can't show the full details but it does convey through its coverage of these moments how close to death the Hubers are working. It also shows how demoralizing failure is when you're so close to spectacular accomplishment. But as they say to each other after the second aborted try Now more than ever. And though the film doesn't show it they did set the record. It's just not a part of Danquart's footage. This is only one of a series of lacunae but we can't entirely fault the director for that maybe this way we get closer to what it is to be at the top. You have to keep trying. It's isn't easy even if you're the best and peak performances skirt the edge of failure nearly always. Darquart has caught the austerity of life at the top of the rock climbing world.".

	schema:reviewBody "With a few hours to spare and a selection of unfamiliar movie titles from which to choose I settled upon an early afternoon screening of 'To the Limit 2007' Pepe Danquart's impressive documentary on the art of rockclimbing. A coproduction from Austria and Germany the film follows the exploits of brothers Thomas and Alexander Huber as they attempt to break the speed record for The Nose a landmark climb on El Capitan Yosemite NP. Intimate and engaging the film practically swings alongside the climbers as they ascend the sundrenched granite monolith the ground an absurdlydistant treedotted stretch in the background. This footage is certainly not for acrophobics and I held my breath on more than a few occasions certain that as soon as those threadlike supporting ropes snapped both climbers were going to plummet to their deaths. But what these climbers lack in common sense they gain in courage and they wouldn't have it any other way. There's something to be admired in that.'To the Limit' follows Thomas and Alexander on three rockclimbing expeditions two attempts at Yosemite and a third in the frozen wastes of Patagonia Chile. That each of these ends unsuccessfully is basically irrelevant and indeed it is something of a misnomer to refer to their expeditions as unsuccessful since it's ultimately the experience and the adventure that counts. However I was happy to discover that in October 2007 the brothers did return to Yosemite and the speed record is now very much theirs. In the process of risking their lives the rockclimbers overlook some of the most breathtaking landscapes I've seen unspoilt wilderness stretching in all directions its wilderness dwarfed only by its incredible perils. While the brothers deserve full credit for their ambitious climbing efforts I am astounded at how well their exploits are captured by the filmmakers the camera itself dangling hazardously over hundreds of metres of air capturing the action from all angles.Of course there are a few moments when the film strays slightly from the desired path. The dream in which one of the men imagines himself tumbling from the cliffface tries too hard to be dramatic though I acknowledge that most climbers would indeed suffer from such nightmares. Also Danguart inserts a few too many intense slowmotion sequences which breaks away from the reality of the climbing and tends to cheapen it for the sake of a few musiccharged thrills. Despite these complaints I very much enjoyed 'To the Limit' particularly as one who has never been all that interested in rockclimbing. Comparisons will certainly be made with Kevin MacDonald's excellent 'Touching the Void 2003' though they really are quite different films whereas one uses reenactments to depict a true story of incredible survival the other is a very real look at the ordinary lifestyle of professional thrillseeking sportsmen. The two documentaries would make a excellent doublebill I think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Am Limit or To the Limit is a German sports documentary film from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Oscar winner Pepe Danquart and he has been pretty prolific in sports documentaries since pretty early in his career. However this one here about speed climbing may be my least favorite by him most certainly but not really because of the production values but rather because of the subject. I am not much of a fan of the higher faster etc. mentality and the Huber Brothers in the center of it all really embody this idea. Yet at the same time they are really as bland as it gets unfortunately. Also speed climbing is definitely a sport that is not fun to watch and there's a reason why you hardly read anything about it in the media in contrast to football tennis cycling or the US sports for example. Maybe they realized halfway into this 95minute documentary that it is a very unappealing watch and that's why they all of a sudden and completely out of nowhere included a rivalry plot twist that was on soap opera level. Not that the rest of it was any better but it sucked for different reasons mostly because of how generic forgettable and by the books it was. If you have seen one climbing documentary then you have seen them all in my opinion. It's pretentious talk about personal goals about making it for oneself and not to become famous etc. You get the idea. Besides I disapprove humans entering territory here that clearly isn't meant for them and have a negative impact on the local wilderness like the fleeing deer scene. So who should watch this. The answer is Nobody. The reason is it will not get you interested in the subject and if you are already interested then you will most likely want to climb a bit yourself instead of watch other people do so. We have reached the top Everest now lets see if we can get higher any faster. Who cares if we risk our lives. No thank you. One additional star for the beautiful landscapes and daring camera work. That's all. Highly not recommended.".

Helen Hunt continues to amaze me with her ability to take on tough roles adapting her core persona to fit each role.The portrait she painted in this film of the tough yet perceptively human police officer was beautifully executed. When the scene calls for quick witted timely delivered verbal intercourse she can stand toe to toe with any actor. Yet she is adept at the delivery of volumes of emotional response without uttering a word relying only on facial expression and body language. Without the commercials which by design kill the continuity of any good film This would have been a real edgeoftheseat nailbiter. I gave it a 9.0".

On the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface lied a cold hearted killer. Weber really took on the persona of a childlike young adult with an insatiable thirst to kill young boys.The entire movie was spectacular. Each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters. The production team did a phenomenal job with condensing days if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie.

But for some reason the people had great fear especially of an atomic 3rd world war which was in a way irrational. Am Tag als Bobby Ewing starb treats these subjects. A mother and her son move to some kind of hippie community new forms of living together also were quite popular near a nuclear power plant in rural northern Germany. The mother falls in love to the leader of the community. Her son who liked more to live in the city has problems to adopt the new lifestyle but he soon finds some friends. He hates the hippies and is more into drinking shooting with rifles and stuff. So the movie  which got some good renown by German critics move on. I personally felt some disappointment after watching this. For a satirical comedy the movie had to much depression in it as the community slowly decays. Also I did not like that there was sometimes so much distance between the mother and her son as if they were no relatives. I think the goal of the movie was to portray the atmosphere in the 80ies. In this it succeeds but the plot is a bit pointless and awkward. I think sometimes the more artistic German movie makers have a certain fear to give direct messages everything is subtextual a bit dogmalike which is why they have this boring touch for examples movies like Halbe Treppe or Erleuchtung garantiert. If you'd like to see a comedy about leftist communities I much more recommend Moodysons' Together which is way more funny and elaborated. The beginning of Together with the naked people seems to have inspired the beginning of this movie too.".

The community is part of a protest movement against the nuclear power station near the village. The mother immediately likes the life in the green community. The son doesn't but he makes friends with the villagerocker and the beautiful daughter of the mayor. So much for the plot. There isn't much plot. This film is more about characters and atmosphere. Great actors Peter Lohmeyer with long and dirty hair as Peter the chief of the community Nina Petri as Gesine can still make nude scenes with 42 without being ridiculous! Jens Munchow as the sympathetic funny but idiotic Rakete Gabriela Maria Schmeide as the overmotivated mother who does all the housework of the community... and of course Franz Dinda who gives a fantastic characterization of the shy and disorientated Niels. Super atmosphere the absolutely boring village the chaotic living of the greens. Although the movie shows the ridiculous and bizarre sides of the hardcoreecologists it always has a certain tenderness for them. And now not to forget Am Tag als Bobby Ewing starb is a very funny movie the screamtherapysequence the dinner with warm bread the Gandhihassaidline the gunshooting with Rakete etc. etc.. If you have the possibility go watch this movie. Possibly THE German movie of 2005.".

Not only did this film preserve on screen some of the most beautiful ballet dancing ever scene forever but it brought two Hollywood icons together for the first time who both turned in the Oscarnominated performances of their careers. As a matter of fact this is one of two films in Oscar history THE COLOR PURPLE being the other that was nominated for 11 Oscars but didn't win a single award. Nonetheless it is still a compelling and riveting melodrama which uses ballet as its backdrop. The film focuses on two women Emma Jacklin Anne Bancroft and Deedee Rodgers Shirley MacLaine who were both in the same ballet company many many years ago and were competing for the lead in a new ballet when Deedee became pregnant and Emma got the role and this is way their relationship forked and their lives went separate ways. Deedee got married to a dancer in the company Tom Skerritt had three children and runs a dance studio now but part of her still yearns to be a prima ballerina. Emma became the prima ballerina that Deedee wanted to be however Emma's life is all about work now...she takes class she dances and she goes home to her dogs. When Emma's dance company comes to Deedee's town they are reunited and both begin to quietly choices that they made. Thrown into the mix is Amelia real life prima ballerina Leslie Browne Deedee's daughter who may be a better dancer than her mother ever was and Emma begins to groom and pulls strings to get her in the company which causes further resentment from Deedee. This movie is about choices regrets crushed dreams and dreams fulfilled. Bancroft and MacLaine turn in grand performances and the dancing of ballet superstar Mikhail Barysnakov and Leslie Browne is outstanding even though every time Browne opens her mouth you want to stuff a sock in it. A beautiful melodrama anchored by supreme performances by two of the best actresses in the business.".

For anyone who's ever enjoyed a dance performance this is a mustsee...or mustOWN. Mikhail Baryshnikov recentlydefected and at the absolute peak of his extrahuman abilities is nothing short of breathtaking in this film. The first time he's shown dancing in the rehearsal studio invariably takes away my ability to breathe.I also admit that I like the stories which provide the framework for the dance performances. When The Turning Point was originally released I was about to turn 30. Now bumping my head on 60 I've seen the decisions transitions and forks in life's road which face all the film's characters and have a much greater appreciation for the truth of the film. Shirley MacLaine Anne Bancroft Tom Skerrit and Anthony Zerbe are as we'd expect excellent. The 18yearold Leslie Browne is lovely and a fine dancer. I'm particularly fond of Alexandra Danilova one of ballet's immortals as the matriarchal Madame Dhakarova. In the scene where she's coaching a muchyounger woman on the Don Quixote pas de deux she performs the role not only more correctly but also more playfully and flirtatiously than her student. It's a treat to see. I love dance see review of All That Jazz and I admit my bias freely. In addition to spectacular dance performances there are good human stories behind the 70's clothing and hair styles so watch this film at least once and decide for yourself whether you'll see it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had no knowledge or interest in ballet before viewing The Turning Point on HBO about a year after it was first released to theaters. The HBO promotions department concentrated more on the cat fight between Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft and less on the numerous ballet dances. I thought it was going to be an unintentional laugh riot. Boy was I wrong.MacLaine and Bancroft as former dance rivals do a great job separately and together. You sense the history of both characters and the issues that have colored the decisions they made. MacLaine's character Deedee getting pregnant and leaving the ballet company while with Bancroft's character Emma the veteran prima ballerina who never married and struggles to stay a ballerina not knowing when or how to gracefully end her career.Director Herbert Ross and screenwriter Arthur Laurents conceived an interesting albeit thin story within the backdrop of ballet. The lead actresses and the supporting cast including James Mitchell Anthony Zerbe Tom Skerritt as MacLaine's husband and especially Martha Scott as the blunt moneyminded owner of the ballet company do a very good job and in some ways improve on the material given to them.As far as the ballet dancers in acting roles well they are great dancers. To be fair hiring anyone with little or no acting experience and expect them to act in a major movie for the first time would be a challenge for anyone. Leslie Browne as Emilia Deedee's oldest who is in the process of becoming the next prima ballerina had a very tough task and when it came to the dialog I thought she did as good a job as she could. But when she was in her element namely in the dance studio and on stage she was wonderful. It's a shame that actressformer ballerina Neve Campbell was only four years old when The Turning Point was first released. Actingwise Campbell would have been a more convincing Emilia. But I digress.Mikhail Baryshnikov fared much better as the main male ballet dancerLothario. He oozed charisma on screen and his jumps on stage are breathtaking. Years after The Turning Point he has done some decent work in White Nights on screen and Sex and the City on television.Interestingly out of all of the nonprofessional actors I thought Alexandra Danilova who played Emilia's ballet teacher gave the most natural and less stilted performance. She seemed very comfortable essentially playing herself. I have a feeling that it has a lot to do with her real ballet experience of over 50 years when the film was released in 1977.The last time I viewed The Turning Point was in 2005. The material is still pretty thin but I do believe that if it wasn't for the strong performances acting and dancing the film would not hold up after all these years.".

They are fine especially Browne in a funny drunk scene but come on!  There was never much of a chance either would beat out the eventual winners Jason Robards and Vanessa Redgrave though if the truth be known I would have voted for Tuesday Weld in 'Looking for Mr. Goodbar' and Peter Firth in 'Equus.'".

	schema:reviewBody "I somewhat enjoyed this movie at the time mainly because of its ballet theme and it certainly boasts beautiful dance sequences with real life ballerinas Leslie Browne and Mikhail Baryshnikov. However the characters are pretty stereotypical and it's all basically middle aged naval gazing as to what life might have been and the road not taken.The story revolves around two women who have chosen disparate life paths both revolving around ballet. Deedee left the dance company years ago to marry a fellow dancer  raise a family but now runs a ballet school in Oklahoma. Emma remained with the company and became a prima ballerina but at the expense of any family life and her dance career is now waning. Deedee's daughter Emilia is also a ballerina. When Emma takes her on as sort of a protg and tries to advance her position within the dance company Deedee feels resentful.The cast here is certainly competent. Shirley MacLaine Deedee and Anne Bancroft Emma are both convincing as the two very different women. Tom Skerritt plays Deedee's husband Wayne though I prefer his interaction with Shirley MacLaine in their later movie Steel Magnolias. The young ballerinas Browne Emilia and Baryshnikov Yuri...well their main function is to dance. Their romance proved of no interest to me whatsoever. I found Emilia's drunken scene silly and noted another's comment that in a real life dance company she'd be severely reprimanded for this.This movie has some pretty stereotypical jealousies looking longingly at the life you don't have and wondering if you made the wrong choices way back when. Years earlier Deedee  Emma were competing for a lead role in their dance company when Deedee became pregnant  married leaving Emma with the role and a successful dance career. Now they are both looking back Deedee jealous of Emma's star career and Emma envying Deedee's family husband  three children while she has only her dogs for company. All these feelings are brought to the forefront as they watch the young Emilia at the beginning of her dance career and also romantically involved with Yuri. These doubts and regrets are not uncommon in middle age but the old career versus marriage  family theme just isn't very original.Also I found the cat fight near the end between the two women Emma  Deedee absurd and merely succumbing to the ridiculous popularity of cat fighting among cinema audiences. This did not add class to this movie which frankly might have been classier or any stars to my rating.On the whole it's a forgettable film. The entire glimpse into the world of ballet elicited some interest and the dancing is magnificent. Otherwise famous cast or not it's not really a movie worth bothering with unless you're madly keen on ballet. As another reviewer commented it isn't very involving and there's really no one to cheer for.".

Realistic sound is used to augment some tingling action sequences handled with superb control of crowds and effects. In some ways the story parallels The Enforcer 1951 but Dieterle's direction is beholden to noone. Although it does use the real backgrounds beloved of the semidocumentary artists this is no mere reportage approach. Dieterle has directed not only with style polish and finesse but at a crackling pace.Oddly the script has many subtleties which censors didn't notice at the time although wideawake audiences did which would partly account for the film's tremendous popularity particularly in Australia Holden staying the night in Smith's apartment for example but even more startlingly the explicit identification of the crime czar surely the most vicious ever to appear on celluloid as Jewish his name is Eichelberger and he gets most of his income from usurious moneylending and of his heroic opponent as a Gentile at one stage our hero even pointedly asks for a ham sandwich.The principals turn in most believable and arresting performances which just manage to keep a few tenuous steps ahead of the extremely able support cast led by Tom Tully Ed Begley and as thuggy a group of gangsters as any film noir fan could wish Don Porter Ted De Corsia Neville Brand.

	schema:reviewBody "1977 was a banner year for Herbert Ross two pictures he directed are among Oscar's five BEST PICTURE nominees one is THE GOODBYE GIRL 1977 with 5 nominations and 1 win for Richard Dreyfuss and another is this one the balletic drama THE TURNING POINT received a whopping 11 nominations but went home emptyhanded a record later shared with Steven Spielberg's THE COLOR PURPLE 1985 and in hindsight becomes the most overachiever apropos of Oscar nominations. DeeDee MacLaine and Emma Bancroft go way back when they are ballerinasandbestfriends the former jilted her budding career and got married with dancer Wayne Skerritt after she was preggy just when she and Emma were both up for the cardinal role in Anna Karenina. Due to DeeDee's dropout Emma procured the role and has remained as a prima ballerina for the company ever since meantime DeeDee and Wayne moved to Oklahoma City and run a dance studio raising their three kids. Years later when DeeDee's firstborn Emilia Browne is old enough to be picked up by the same dance company do DeeDee and Emma's separated life orbits begin to converge Emma has been devoted herself entirely to her career unmarried and childless what she has achieved is quite something in this feedingfrenzy and extremely ageism lineofbusiness but overthehill is a word she cannot temporize any longer at that turning point she confides to DeeDee that her body has compromised even though her spirit is still high on dancing.

	onyx:emotionText "1977 was a banner year for Herbert Ross two pictures he directed are among Oscar's five BEST PICTURE nominees one is THE GOODBYE GIRL 1977 with 5 nominations and 1 win for Richard Dreyfuss and another is this one the balletic drama THE TURNING POINT received a whopping 11 nominations but went home emptyhanded a record later shared with Steven Spielberg's THE COLOR PURPLE 1985 and in hindsight becomes the most overachiever apropos of Oscar nominations. DeeDee MacLaine and Emma Bancroft go way back when they are ballerinasandbestfriends the former jilted her budding career and got married with dancer Wayne Skerritt after she was preggy just when she and Emma were both up for the cardinal role in Anna Karenina. Due to DeeDee's dropout Emma procured the role and has remained as a prima ballerina for the company ever since meantime DeeDee and Wayne moved to Oklahoma City and run a dance studio raising their three kids. Years later when DeeDee's firstborn Emilia Browne is old enough to be picked up by the same dance company do DeeDee and Emma's separated life orbits begin to converge Emma has been devoted herself entirely to her career unmarried and childless what she has achieved is quite something in this feedingfrenzy and extremely ageism lineofbusiness but overthehill is a word she cannot temporize any longer at that turning point she confides to DeeDee that her body has compromised even though her spirit is still high on dancing. As for DeeDee all these years she has been mulling over whether her decision of quitting is the right choice and one particularly pestering thought that Emma might have intentionally advised her to get married when she was pregnant with Emilia so that Emma could snatch that role which paved the way of her subsequent ascendance to the top tier and pathologically wonders whether she was good enough to be picked over Emma if she had stayed.

I was busy raising a family when this was in theaters in the late 1970s but now was able to watch it on Netflix streaming movies.It is a story about dancers and families in ballet. It seems its whole inspiration came from the family of one of the cast members Leslie Browne whose family are all dancers and Ross the director is in real life her godfather. Nonetheless she is perfect for the role young beautiful and a fine ballerina.The leads are veterans Anne Bancroft as 40something Emma who is still a featured ballerina even though she is probably past the years where she should be performing and her old friend Shirley MacLaine as Deedee who was a competitor of Emma's those 20odd years ago and who chose to leave ballet and be a wife and mother.In fact her daughter is teen dancer Leslie Browne as Emilia showing so much promise that part of the family moves to NYC and stays in a small apartment inside Carnegie Hall for the summer so that Emilia can study. There she is noticed and appears destined for the career that her mother was never able to realize.Another dancer is 20something Mikhail Baryshnikov as Yuri one of the dancers in the company. He and Emilia dance together and also romance each other. Reliable Tom Skerritt is Deedee's husband Emilia's dad also a former dancer. The dancing is great because real ballet dancers are used. This is an oldfashioned drama and it was nominated for several awards. The old friends have old issues to settle the young dancers have to decide what their career choices will be. Good movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "First things first this movie takes place within the American Ballet Theater. The name American Ballet was chosen by George Balanchine a white Russian migr to the United States back in the 1930s when it was indeed probably the only major ballet company within the United States. However their use of this term now is certainly misleading. I believe an alternative and much more descriptive name is New York City Ballet that may in fact be the name they are legally required to use now due expiration of the original copyright though I would not swear to it. They are certainly very good at what they do but there are quite a few ballet companies within the United States nowadays and they are just as American as the group in New York City. And probably just as good. Their is an irony here in that the movie starts for some unfathomable reason in Oklahoma City which is I guess meant to show a place as far away from the Big City ballet as one can get. Perhaps in 1977 it was but nowadays Oklahoma City itself has a very good ballet company. The only major reason why I do not consider the OKC ballet company as good as the one in New York City is due to the shortage of funds they have encountered recently. The OKC ballet school is pretty good from what I have heard. Anyway the New York City Ballet is a top notch outfit but it is certainly NOT the only major ballet company in the United Statesdespite what this movie implies. Okay now that I have cleared this up I will now comment on this movie.It is a must see movie for people who like ballet and even other major dance forms. There are a few problems one is that Tom Skerritt plays the husband of a former ballerina of the company himself a former danseur with the company. Yet as good an actor as Mr. Skerritt is I find his performance in this movie far from convincing in this manner. Their son is shown as an up and coming dancer also with the company yet he disappears midway into the movie. What happened to him? I know the daughter is primary point of interest but what happened to her brother?? Other than these weaknesses it is a very good movie though it is somewhat surprising that it received 11 Academy Award nominations. Anne Bancroft was fantastic. In real life she never danced professionally nor took lessons yet she did a great job portraying an overthehill prima ballerina possibly based on Margot Fonteyn. Shirley McClain who did dance a lot  ironically is never seen dancing or even prepared for dancing. This is a chick flick no doubt about it but if you are male and interested in the behind the scenes of a ballet company you will find this interesting also. Speaking of males Mihail Baryshnikov comes close to stealing the show from the female leads. This movie along with The Nutcracker that he performed later in 1977 was the turning point in his career. Well worth seeing by anybody of either gender for this alone!!".

The relatively unknown JeanLoup Hubert has produced the kind of film that the overrated Godard could not turn out if you gave him a hundred years to be fair to the semiAmateur Godard he would probably have no interest in addressing the Human Condition in such a refreshing straightforward fashion. In terms of story it would be difficult to find something more basic  at one end of the spectrum a married couple living in rural Brittany have slowly grown apart since losing a child at the other end is nine year old Louis a city boy from Paris sent to spend a summer with the couple so that his mother an old friend of the wife may have her second child without the encumbrance of her first. In other words this is our old friend the bildungsromancomingofageritesofpassage movie the one we've seen so many times before but as I've said before it's all in the wrist. The tone is set from the first with a wistful haunting music track leading us into a nineteen fifties French countryside preserved in amber as Christine Pascal billed only as the mother of Louis entrusts her son Antoine Hubert to the care of her friend Marcelle Anemone and her husband Pelo Richard Bohringer. This is a French film and French film in a rural setting so we meet Marcelle as she is removing the eye of a rabbit with a knife as a prelude to skinning it. It's a great metaphor for the changes Louis will experience in the next few weeks you don't see this in Paris kid and it also prepares us the audience for an arguably alien lifestyle embracing outside privys and indoor chamber pots. Writerdirector Hubert he adapted his own autobiographical novel for the screen bravely cast his own son Antoine in the key role of Louis despite the boy's complete lack of acting experience and the experiment paid off handsomely. Nor can we argue that he found it easy to coax a performance from his own flesh and blood because he has coaxed an even better performance from Vanessa Guedi as Martine the tenyearold tomboy who teaches Louis so much in such a short time. Matching the performances of the two children are those of the two principal adults Anemone and Richard Bohringer both more than deserving of the Cesars they won as respectively Best Actress and Best Actor. I have been aware of this film for several years but have never been able to track it down until now when I finally located the DVD. On the initial viewing I was overwhelmed and I know it is one I will return to again and again. 1010".

I don't know why it's not available on DVD in the United States I know that it is available in Europe. The little girl in the movie is the perfect little tomboy and has loads to teach her summer friend about life. It's based in the 50s when worldly kids were actually kind of rare. Then there's the heartbreaking substory of a childless couple who haven't been intimate in years due to the loss of their own child. Louis gives them both the kind of love they've never known and they realize what's been missing in their lives. It's just a beautiful story and I would love for this film to be reintroduced in the United States for a new generation to discover and enjoy. There was an American remake done in the early nineties but it sucked royally compared to the original French film.".

Louis gives them both the kind of love they've never known and they realize what's been missing in their lives. It's just a beautiful story and I would love for this film to be reintroduced in the United States for a new generation to discover and enjoy. There was an American remake done in the early nineties but it sucked royally compared to the original French film.";

Marcelle is raped and beaten and consistently verbally abused by her husband Pelo. Yet because of the boy and the effect he's had on them supposedly they've realized again that they love each other and everything is alright in the end.

Not that the movie is downright bad but it wasn't properly what I expected.I loved the simplicity and beauty of the french rural scenario and the acting by Antoine Hubert as Louis and Christine Pascal as Claire Louis's mother. Christine Pascal was also a pretty woman it's sad to know that she committed suicide.The other actors Richard Bohringer as Pelo Anmone as Marcelle and Vanessa Guedj as Martine portray well their roles but their characters aren't very likable. My biggest problems with this movie are mostly because of these 3 characters.First off seeing Marcelle slaughtering a rabbit alive ain't pretty to view. Made me completely hate Marcelle's character from the very start. That part alone was enough to kill the movie for me. Second Martine was too naughty for her age. She was only a child she wasn't supposed to act sexually towards Louis like she often did. That is highly inappropriate for her age. Her actions were often puzzling.Third to see Pelo and Marcelle often arguing was unpleasant. Their discussions were often violent and sometimes went as far as domestic violence. This movie had a remake in 1991 under the title 'Paradise' which I may or may not watch someday. I'm not sure as my impression on the original wasn't the most favorable which makes me have even more reservations about a remake.".

Georges' interplay with corporate management guru Harry is dazzlingly handled  shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease.The Eighth Day puts similar Hollywood fare like Barry Levinson's Oscar winning Rain Man or Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump well and truly in the shade. At times it evokes the humour of Milos Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with shades of Dennis Potter thrown in for good measure.As the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie Harry Daniel Auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance. But it is matched by the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable set pieces  the shoe shop scene car showroom scene George's dance to Genesis's 'Jesus He Knows Me' the conference scene the fireworks scene. If you haven't seen it there's only one thing to do. Just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing. Better still buy this movie. Sheer genius.....".

Even with or perhaps because of little to no special effects to bedazzle you you are immersed before you know it. The spontaneity and sheer oddness of some of the scenes add to the charm of the film as does the tumultuous and unlikely friendship between a workaholic and a man with Down's syndrome. The Eighth Day gives you something to reflect on a pause from the fast paced lifestyles we are caught up in today.".

It's the kind of film that people should be making. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about. The ending is kind of silly though but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.".

Let me put my ten cents in with every comment I have read here immediately and state categorically that this film is a JOY. Okay you know going in that a major character is handicapped so you figure that at some point the movie is going to manipulate your emotions and you're ready for that but like most things it's all in the wrist and this one has an extra metatarsal. It is of course the salesman who spends his life lecturing on how to manipulate the buyer who is himself manipulated by Georges  nice touch naming him after the 'normal' one of the two buddies in 'Of Mice And Men' where the retarded Lenny is looked after by George  the irritating exasperating impossible lovable guy who walks into his life after Harry nearly ran into his. Okay to make this work you need to create a character who is the complete opposite of Georges a guy literally too busy making money and being successful to stop and smell the roses. A guy who misses his daughters dreadfully since his estranged wife  it's not clear if they are divorced or just separated  took them away yet is so busy that he completely forgets to pick them up and leaves them waiting alone at the train station who opts to attend a conference on his daughter's birthday you get the picture. Georges misses someone too. His mother who is dead. Time and again in his loneliness and hurt he conjures her up and we see the great love they shared. This then is the back story and the scene is set for what Hollywood used to call a 'meetcute'. Here Auteuil in despair his mind in a turmoil driving through the rain runs over something large which he failed to see. Turns out to be the dog that had attached itself to Georges who has lit out from his residential home after watching all the other residents being picked up by relatives. Now all that is left is for Georges to 'change' Harry to humanise him if you will and this he does in spades. This is a film chock full of laughter and tears and the fact that a leading French actress MiouMiou agreed to play what is little more than a cameo as Harry's estranged wife speaks volumes for the quality of the writing. Now and again the cynicism surrounding the gongs of filmdom especially the Oscars get it right and how appropriate that BOTH these superb actors copped the 'Best Actor' nod at Cannes. 1010".

After this odd encounter together both take turns heading towards each other's destinations but with heartbreaking results. However this journey allows them to find something they didn't know they were looking for.Let's get the flaws out of the way Certain scenes may feel a little dramatic but it still remains within the tone of the film never looking out of place. Even though Harry and Georges are the primary focus of the film some of the important supporting characters are poorly developed especially Georges's hating sister and Miou Miou's Julie.But those minuses aside is 'Le Huitime Jour' a road movie the landscapes are dazzling? Is it a study of two characters? Is it a 'buddy' movie certainly not the typical Hollywood kind? Is it a dramedy?It's poetry. The film in a way moves from one genre to another but it flows beautifully. The balance in humour and intensity is first rate. The jokes work well and the timing is just right. I did find the ending to be a tad too dramatic.What Georges shows the viewer is that while people desire similarities it is our differences that make us unique. Yet that is the very reason why Georges is rejected by the 'real world'. What Harry further shows is that none of these supposed similarities that people look for in each other matters because acceptance respect being open to possibilities and being true to oneself are what will bring the greater joy.'Le Huitime Jour' is stunningly filmed and wonderfully acted. Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil are superb. Duquenne delivers a very natural performance and Auteuil is terrifically restrained. They are well supported by Isabelle Sadoyan Michele Maes and the two actors who play Harry's daughter.'Le Huitime Jour' engages you right from the start. It's funny intense enlightening and reaches straight for the heart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us. The Eighth Day takes up this theme Compare Rainmaker. In this film Harry Daniel Auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with Georges Pascal Duquenne a Down's Syndrome child on the run. Winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example Georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasn't enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down's Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the Paradis fun park. The most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back Georges gives the driver a rude salute.

This is true cinema which touches the heart.  There are very moving scenes where Georges proposes to Nathalie where Georges cradles Harry's head in his arms where Georges keeps calling for his dear Mom where Georges teaches Harry to laugh..I felt there was a profound message in the film that life is beautiful the very presence of grass Did you know it cries when you cut it? the trees overhead the song of birds the little insects  all nature's miraculous creatures.

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone we meet influences our thinking modifies our ways a little bit of that person rubs off onto us. The Eighth Day takes up this theme Compare Rainmaker. In this film Harry Daniel Auteuil a businessman expert in sales psychology meets up with Georges Pascal Duquenne a Down's Syndrome child on the run. Winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges relates his theory on the creation of the world and in the closing scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry. For example Georges who is completely uninhibited demands a pair of expensive shoes and hasn't enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I liked the scene where the Down's Syndrome group on a trip to the Art Gallery escape on a bus and gatecrash the Paradis fun park. The most humorous of all the embarrassments is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a horsefloat on the highway and looking back Georges gives the driver a rude salute.

	schema:reviewBody "The Eight Day is really one of a kind! It doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to teach us about life's simple beauty and beautiful simplicity but there's something in the way it's done that is just too weirdly daring to ignore. Sure the film sins sometimes by sentimentality but there's more to enjoy in that atypical and powerful journey from Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael.It starts with a young man named George Pascal Duquenne he has Down syndrome and the film opens with a voiceover narration that leaves no doubt about it. It's a succession of little poetic vignettes echoing the chapters from the genesis no religion here each day is about some beautiful bit of randomness created by God and I had no problem accepting that George was the eight day's creation. The film even confronts the offensive slur Mongoloid to its own origin and we see from George's vision the Mongols as a civilization of horsemen and conquerors nothing to belittle.And George as his own destiny's conqueror decides one day to go looking for his mom. He lives in an institution where he's got friends even a love interest who dances ballet and people who treat him nicely but he still puts on his 'Sunday dress' takes his luggage and leaves. It's easy to get overanalytical and talk about existential impulses but this is a film where I think the right angle of discussion is never Why? but Why not? The Down syndrome is integral to that approach not to mention its emotional impact.Indeed here's a disease where we expect a certain pattern of behavior many of them to be 'embarrassing' but we're not in George's mind and we can never really tell whether it's a manifestation of the syndrome or his colorful personality. So we start to look at his behavior under a different scope as the handicap is never played as a 'gimmick'. George knows his difference and each effort he makes to fit in the world inevitably crashes into its reality. There's a heartbreaking moment involving a waitress where we feel his devastation without blaming her reaction.That's the power of The Eighth Day it transcends the limits of the handicap but never at the expenses of common sense by sugarcoating it. And it accomplishes this feat by showing that there's something in the core of that syndrome that can inspire people goodness attention simplicity and a little bit of madness. It's tricky to make such a point without being condescending or patronizing but this is where George's colead plays his part. We have to see another man who can benefit from George's presence.This man is Harry perfectly sane mentally and physically. Played by Daniel Auteuil Harry's a motivational speaker for young executives to be working for some corporate nightmare named Future Bank all in gray walls and black ties and suits. When we first see Harry he's caught in the same weekly routine regurgitating every day the same rhapsody how to smile to be convincing selfconfident. Everyone's drinking his words but we don't two reasons a this 90's speeches have become a clich by now and b it's so repetitive we suspect Harry doesn't even believe his own crap.In a way Harry is also entrapped in a series of patterns that deprive his life from a substantial meaning. In reality he's divorced he can't see his children and it's very fitting that he meets George at a moment where he was teasing death. The man was at the verge of a breakdown and it's George who tries to help him looking at the bright or at least simple side of life. This sounds like the premise of Rain Man with Tom Cruise being replaced by a mix of Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko and DFens but George is no Raymond Babbit his intelligence is different.I can say it's from the heart but it wouldn't be true because George suffers a lot on that level. The tragedy of George is that he's never got not even a parcel of love back while he's got so much to give the only member of his family who can take care of him dismisses him because she feels she has the right to live her life. That was a scene of raw intensity and honesty because once again we can't blame the rejection and it's pivotal moment that cements the friendship between George and Harry.The Eight Day becomes a poignant and funny buddy road movie where you can feel the bond growing between the two men. A young man with visions of Latin French singer Luis Mariano popping out of nowhere and a corporate victim with no visions whatsoever. How can that friendship be possible? As viewers we're confronted to that question as well. There's a moment where George goes all berserk in a shoe store I guess I would have bought whatever he needed so he can shut up but boy would have I loved to experience one minute of silence lying silently on the grass. Sometimes the film does take you places.Of course there's another side of the coin the story cleverly dodges. Anyone going through Harry's phase would immediately lose his job. Sure you got all the time to admire a ladybug still that won't but I don't think it will make you much a happy person in the long term. We should all go a little mad sometimes but brief madness would be more befitting. Maybe the film goes deliberately overthetop with its own material some situations are unbelievable and unrealistic some normal characters act in a very weird way to warn that after all this is all just a fable.But this fable has some heart truth and greatness about it and the chemistry between pals Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil both winners of the Cannes Festival's Prize really make the film!".

It's a succession of little poetic vignettes echoing the chapters from the genesis no religion here each day is about some beautiful bit of randomness created by God and I had no problem accepting that George was the eight day's creation. The film even confronts the offensive slur Mongoloid to its own origin and we see from George's vision the Mongols as a civilization of horsemen and conquerors nothing to belittle.And George as his own destiny's conqueror decides one day to go looking for his mom. He lives in an institution where he's got friends even a love interest who dances ballet and people who treat him nicely but he still puts on his 'Sunday dress' takes his luggage and leaves. It's easy to get overanalytical and talk about existential impulses but this is a film where I think the right angle of discussion is never Why? but Why not? The Down syndrome is integral to that approach not to mention its emotional impact.Indeed here's a disease where we expect a certain pattern of behavior many of them to be 'embarrassing' but we're not in George's mind and we can never really tell whether it's a manifestation of the syndrome or his colorful personality. So we start to look at his behavior under a different scope as the handicap is never played as a 'gimmick'. George knows his difference and each effort he makes to fit in the world inevitably crashes into its reality. There's a heartbreaking moment involving a waitress where we feel his devastation without blaming her reaction.That's the power of The Eighth Day it transcends the limits of the handicap but never at the expenses of common sense by sugarcoating it. And it accomplishes this feat by showing that there's something in the core of that syndrome that can inspire people goodness attention simplicity and a little bit of madness. It's tricky to make such a point without being condescending or patronizing but this is where George's colead plays his part. We have to see another man who can benefit from George's presence.This man is Harry perfectly sane mentally and physically. Played by Daniel Auteuil Harry's a motivational speaker for young executives to be working for some corporate nightmare named Future Bank all in gray walls and black ties and suits. When we first see Harry he's caught in the same weekly routine regurgitating every day the same rhapsody how to smile to be convincing selfconfident. Everyone's drinking his words but we don't two reasons a this 90's speeches have become a clich by now and b it's so repetitive we suspect Harry doesn't even believe his own crap.In a way Harry is also entrapped in a series of patterns that deprive his life from a substantial meaning. In reality he's divorced he can't see his children and it's very fitting that he meets George at a moment where he was teasing death. The man was at the verge of a breakdown and it's George who tries to help him looking at the bright or at least simple side of life. This sounds like the premise of Rain Man with Tom Cruise being replaced by a mix of Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko and DFens but George is no Raymond Babbit his intelligence is different.I can say it's from the heart but it wouldn't be true because George suffers a lot on that level. The tragedy of George is that he's never got not even a parcel of love back while he's got so much to give the only member of his family who can take care of him dismisses him because she feels she has the right to live her life. That was a scene of raw intensity and honesty because once again we can't blame the rejection and it's pivotal moment that cements the friendship between George and Harry.The Eight Day becomes a poignant and funny buddy road movie where you can feel the bond growing between the two men. A young man with visions of Latin French singer Luis Mariano popping out of nowhere and a corporate victim with no visions whatsoever. How can that friendship be possible? As viewers we're confronted to that question as well. There's a moment where George goes all berserk in a shoe store I guess I would have bought whatever he needed so he can shut up but boy would have I loved to experience one minute of silence lying silently on the grass. Sometimes the film does take you places.Of course there's another side of the coin the story cleverly dodges. Anyone going through Harry's phase would immediately lose his job. Sure you got all the time to admire a ladybug still that won't but I don't think it will make you much a happy person in the long term. We should all go a little mad sometimes but brief madness would be more befitting. Maybe the film goes deliberately overthetop with its own material some situations are unbelievable and unrealistic some normal characters act in a very weird way to warn that after all this is all just a fable.But this fable has some heart truth and greatness about it and the chemistry between pals Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil both winners of the Cannes Festival's Prize really make the film!";

	schema:reviewBody "I came across this film by chance on television many years ago. I'm glad I saw it it's a beautiful Belgian film that has such warmth and tears of humanity in it. The film is based on two men who meet and become friends Georges an autistic person who has spent most of his life in an institution leaves to visit his family and encounters Harry a successful businessman who has neglected his family. The performances by their actors Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne are wonderfully passionate and complement each other very well they make such a perfect couple that both actors shared a Cannes award for their acting. The film parallels the French literary classic The Little Prince where two different characters travel and bond together. One is steeped in the harshness of reality and learns to appreciate kindness and the wonders of life the other is a childlike figure who follows fantasy and learns about maturity and sacrifice of adulthood. In both tales the two must part ways in a bittersweet ending alas as one is far too unreal to last long in the world but at least his presence has changed the other's life for the better. The two actors are so good that one nearly overlooks the director who gave them a great setup. The direction and story both done by Jaco Van Dormael provide a wonderful yet reasonable setting that blends magic and reality in a masterful and subtle manner.I only saw this film once but it has stayed with me throughout the years. It's one of those special films that everyone should watch.".

	schema:headline " Veteran actors prove they can still hack it on Golden Pond.";
	schema:reviewBody "Mark Rydell's On Golden Pond was a surprise hit in 1981 finishing third in box office grosses after Rocky III and E.T. Such an occurrence was unheard of in Hollywood considering the key players in the film Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn  each had not had a hit film in almost twenty years and were both hardly spring chickens in the business. Both these veteran actors proved they could still make it in Hollywood among young starlets and triumph. Still when you see On Golden Pond you sense that their teaming together for the first time in their careers is purely a special occasion an opportunity of a lifetime that few actors in their seventies receive. They in turn have left us with a wonderful showcase of movie talent a film of warmth good humor and love. It always amazes me when I read that Henry Fonda had only received two Oscar nominations during his career one of which he earned for this film. Like his good friend Jimmy Stewart Fonda was rarely a boisterous actor. He had a natural ease to his acting a gift for making audiences believe that every word he uttered was truth. Now in his final screen performance as Norman Thayer Jr. Fonda had to reach deep into his own personal experience and his advancing years to create a character who struggles with his own mortality. Norman is a grouchy curmudgeon who has memory lapses and heart palpitations. He has a loving and cheerful wife Ethel Hepburn but a difficult relationship with his only daughter Chelsea Jane Fonda. He and Ethel journey back to their cottage on the lake for what may be their last summer. Immediately Norman comes face to face with his old age and his inability to remember what should be familiar sights. I especially like the scene where he gets lost in the woods looking for strawberries and scares himself when he is unable to find his way back. Ethel has such faith in him sure he will get back on that horse and be as valiant as he once was. What more could you want from a wife? Chelsea arrives after many years away from her parents bringing with her a new boyfriend Dabney Coleman and his son Billy Doug McKeon. You can sense the tension between Chelsea and Norman the minute she walks in the door. This reunion is fascinating not only because we can never tell where the difficulty lies in their relationship but also the fact that these problems also exist on and off the screen. The fatherdaughter relationship between Henry and Jane was also very turbulent ever since Jane began her protests in Vietnam much to the chagrin of her father. This collaboration of the two was meant to mend fences between them. Not often do the personal lives of actors collide so eloquently in Hollywood but here it seems just about right. The sequence where Norman and Bill Coleman attempt to build a conversation is originally conceived and acted so naturally. He carefully asks Norman if it would be alright if Chelsea and he sleep together in the same room at the cottage. Of course Norman makes this confrontation as difficult as possible making Bill nervous and jerking him around. Ironically Bill comes back at him not allowing Norman to use him in petty mindgames and hoping they would become friends which is obviously not an easy task. This is an unsettling turn for Norman and the audience but it is necessary for the story to progress and for Norman to respond accordingly to the other characters in the story. Ethel and Norman volunteer to let Billy stay with them for the summer while Chelsea and Bill head off to Europe. Billy is not pleased with the arrangement at the outset but gradually bonds with Norman through learning to fish on the pond. While Billy is not necessarily an original character it is fascinating to see him try to understand Norman and in turn how Norman learns to associate with the son he never had. It is a learning experience for both of them even though they are many generations apart. Many reviewers have remarked that ON GOLDEN POND uses a conventional story and revives it with great performances from the cast. It is interesting to note that the screenwriter Ernest Thompson altered his own play in order to escape a bit of the conventionality that the film medium required. The framework may seem as original as an old shoe but the added touches in the script and its delivery give this film a certain magic that only classical Hollywood films possessed. Fonda has a great way to end a career with this role placing himself completely within Norman's world and searching within and through the role for his own solutions to life's problems. His Oscar was given to him for more reasons than mere charity. Hepburn is delightful as Ethel working so well with Fonda that it does not seem as if they are acting. For a couple of old Hollywood actors who never even met before this they each prove they are true masters of their craft. Jane Fonda takes a supporting role this time incorporating some of the same motives as her father into her part and as a result delivers a special performance. Mark Rydell is one of those directors that often gets left off the list of the alltime greats but proves once again here he is a masterful storyteller. In this project he allows both the visual elements of the pond and his actors to make magic a truly memorable combination.  On Golden Pond is not an epic but what it accomplishes runs close to epic proportions. It is very rare that a stageplay converts so well to the screen like this one. On Golden Pond is vibrant emotional and so heartfelt it is impossible not to like unless you are a curmudgeon like Norman Thayer. It is also unique that great actors such as these will agree to try again for Hollywood glory so late in their careers. It is up to us viewers to experience this wonder before the chance is lost and these thespians finally close up the cottage and head off to their retirement.".

	schema:headline " Warm reflective touchingly basic human drama with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn offering treasured performances in their twilight years.";
	schema:reviewBody "On Golden Pond is simply an oldfashioned testimonial to longlost youth and facing one's mortality and in its simplicity becomes a lifeaffirming valentine to those who feel that time has become the enemy  a seemingly ageless universal perception.  If not for the magnificent acting duet between Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn this lovely sentient piece would have been ignored by most moviegoers.  But buoyed by these two acting legends it manages to circumnavigate the heavy mawkish waters  rising far above and beyond anybody's expectation.  Earning a whopping ten Oscar nominations Ernest Thompson's reflective screenplay won one of those Oscars but for me it's Dave Grusin's soothing glistening score that is the stronger selling point here adding immeasurably to the film's ruminative tone and gently rustic surroundings.Henry Fonda plays brusque cantankerous Norman Thayer a onetime college professor approaching his 80th birthday with a mixture of anger cynicism and fear as he shows signs of losing his faculties.  Norman is not a particularly kind or considerate gent.  Abrupt callous remote and illequipped to offer nurturing support of any kind living with Norman must have been quite an ordeal for those growing up under his roof.  As a means of selfpreservation their only child Chelsea has long estranged herself from the family unable to emotionally come to terms with her unhappy unhealthy relationship with her father.Fonda offers the most affecting endearing performance of his durable career.  He manages to use Norman's undesirable traits to his advantage investing in his character a gruff charm and cynical sense of humor that is totally winning.  He melts away the harmful negative elements as Carroll O'Connor managed to do for Archie Bunker and makes Norman not only funny and entertaining but loveable.  As a result Fonda becomes the glowing centerpiece of On Golden Pond' and it is this portrayal along with his Grapes of Wrath' Tom Joad that will remain indelibly etched in our hearts and minds for decades to come.Kate Hepburn is his Ethel a loving pragmatic anchor who obviously has played an important role in the lifetime success of this complicated man. Devoted to a tee Ethel understands and compensates for the weaknesses of her husband.  She valiantly assuages his deepening fears with goodnatured kidding feigned hopelessness and careful but subtle guidance.  She is Dulcinea to his Don Quixote.  As a lioness would shield an endangered cub she has automatically assumed the roles of caregiver protectorate and confidence booster without pause or grief.  Only for Ethel does Norman step out of his shield of emotional armor and display a genuine affection that is lost to others including himself.  Hepburn absolutely radiates with warmth and vitality providing the film with a necessary center.  Though less flashy and substantive both she and Fonda were Oscared for their work here with Hepburn winning a recordbreaking fourth 'Best Actress' award. Incidentally this was their ONLY screen pairing yet they work together as if they've known each other all their lives.Fifteenyearold Doug McKeon manages to hold his own among the star power here as a young resentful upstart whose dentist father Dabney Coleman is romantically involved with Chelsea.  Forced to play out the rest of his summer with the old folks while his father and girlfriend spend quality time together he learns a delicate lesson or two as he develops an unlikely bond with Norman.  Coleman himself has one edgy amusing scene as he tries to gracefully deal with an overly wry Norman.Surprisingly the weakest story link involves Norman's strained relationship with daughter Chelsea played by Hank's own daughter Jane Fonda Oscarnominated.  The familial situation obviously parallels their own reallife lack of connection but the scenes seem strangely shallow and selfserving as they forge through some mucky emotional moments as if striving for reallife closure.  What should have been insightful and compelling comes off forced and distracting particularly on Jane's part.Henry Fonda's own physical frailty at the time of shooting adds a special poignancy to the film.  Ironically Hepburn won her second Oscar in 1967 for playing another wifely Rock of Gibraltar in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' The ailing Spencer Tracy died shortly after the completion of that film. Fonda would pass away a few months after winning his only Oscar.A most welcome and satisfying diversion that touches with its unpretentiousness On Golden Pond' is a lovely lovely little film that should resonate for ages to come.".

For Norman he learns not to take life for granted by enjoying it.  He also learns not to be so crotchety and not to dote on death.  His daughter Chelsea learned to forget about her differences with her father and to love him while she can.  Katharine Hepburn also gives a brilliant Oscarwinning performance as Ethel Thayer Norman's devoted wife.  She helps him in more ways than the audience realizes because she tries to make him feel young which is what he needs. On Golden Pond is a wonderful movie with a combination of drama and comedy that makes for an entertaining experience.  I recommend this movie to everyone!".

	schema:headline " Walter and Norman are one and the same";
	schema:reviewBody "On Golden Pond is a film that proved to me that acting is a beautiful thing when it comes from some of the veterans and the greats.  I have always had the opinion that most acting from the 60's and earlier is one dimensional and flat.  But then I saw this film and I realized that I was watching two of the best from any era.  Fonda and Hepburn are absolutely stunning in here and they so richly deserved to win their Oscars that year.  And not only am I mad to see that Chariots of Fire beat out Raiders of the Lost Ark but it also beat this film out as best picture and that is a shame and a crime.On Golden Pond reminded me a little of my relationship with my grandfather. It's not that we didn't get along because we did but at times it was a little strained simply because of the age difference.  But Billy soon learns that Norman Thayer Jr. is not just an old man but he is a guy that has a lot say and he can offer him so much and of course they become friends.  So we all know how the movie is going to end up but it is the execution that is the strength of the film.  We watch as these two grow together.  We sense that they are becoming more at ease with each other and when we finally see our two guys catch that guarantuan fish named Walter by this time we are pretty much sure what they are going to do.  And it's kind of funny to draw parallels between Walter the fish and Norman the crusty old man.  But both have been around the pond for years.  Norman's life wouldn't be the same if his quest for the fish was never there.  Perhaps the same with Walter perhaps he has enjoyed alluding Norman for all these years.  But now the game is up but it doesn't have to be.  Norman caught him perhaps that's all that should matter.  You can draw your own conclusions from that analogy.  But I like the way it comes out.On Golden Pond is a treasure.  It is sweet tender and honest.  You will never see a performance better than the one Henry Fonda gives in this one. And this made me want to go out and rent some of the films that the two screen legends were in before and I have to admit that their early work is impressive.  But it is here that they shine like never before.  So my recommendation is this.  If you are young and would never imagine seeing a film like this because it doesn't have someone like Sara Michelle Gellar or Arnold Schwartzenegger in it then take the take advice of someone who had the same preconceived notions when I was 15.  No Sly no Spielberg?  Hey forget it not my cup of tea.  But this will give you a new appreciation of film.  It really is that good.And for those of you that have seen it remember this line? Wife's name is Ethel Thayer thounds like I'm lithsping dothsn't it?   What a great film.".

	schema:headline " Reflective twilight year musings on aging  relationships";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an extremely well crafted film although I believe a little overrated from a sense of nostalgia for its beloved talented and now aging stars Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. Of course the cinematography is magnificent with lovely country scenery and beautiful lakeside vistas all well incorporated into the emotional aspects of the picture.The movie brings the viewer into what is probably the last of many summers spent at their Golden Pond cottage by retired professor Norman Thayer an ornery old codger and his cheerful loving wife Ethel. Their semi estranged 40 something daughter Chelsea Jane Fonda comes to visit in honor of her father's 80th birthday bringing her new fianc Bill. The younger couple leave Bill's young teenage son Billy with Chelsea's parents while they jaunt off to Europe for a couple of weeks on holiday.It's a film that is character driven and all about relationships. For me the most moving is that between husband and wife. Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn give brilliant Oscar winning performances as the aging Thayer couple Norman and Ethel. Their relationship the love support and comfortable banter is so amazing on screen it is impossible to believe they aren't actually married in real life. Norman has become quite frail and has troubling health concerns both physical heart palpitations and mental some memory loss. Mind you this film is all a bit depressing with Norman's anxieties about his mortality no comforting faith mentioned here unfortunately and of course his aging. Ethel is jovially comforting especially when he gets a little lost in the woods while they are out picking strawberries together. This scene is beautifully done by both spouses. He's a sympathetic but crotchety character to say the least yet she always manages to deal with him affectionately.Also the relationship between Norman and the fianc's young son... Although Billy has earlier been rather miffed at being stuck with these old folks for the summer Norman develops quite a touching grandfatherly relationship with him as the two go fishing together and so forth. The only relationship that doesn't come off well here is the strained father  daughter one between Norman and Chelsea that presumably is meant to reflect the real life tensions between Henry and Jane Fonda. Frankly Chelsea seems more like a self absorbed teenager or 20 something trying to find herself. By age 40 she should have done so and become a genuine support to these elderly parents of hers. I really like Jane Fonda in some of her roles but this particular character hasn't much depth and is little asset to the movie. Hopefully at least making On Golden Pond together helped to mend any real life fences between the two Fondas.In any case the film examines skillfully the aging process from the very personal perspective of a loving couple going through it and as such is a movie not to be missed.".

She is one of the greats and this film has proof.This is a film I would definitely recommend to others.  It is light hearted and dramatic all at the same time.  Watch this film it will entertain you.";

Indeed we can most certainly relate to Henry Fonda while Katharine Hepburn is more then an incredible actress. In this film the mix of drama and comedy from her as a character shows why she won that record breaking fourth Oscar statuette.I'll just say the story in a nutshell. Jane Fonda and her father did not get along. Jane however wanted one last chance for a close bond to her father and bought the rights to the play On Golden Pond. In the film the Oscar winning performance by Henry Fonda his only in a career spanning decades. Jane fully deserved her Oscar nomination for her exceptional and of course very realistic performance. In the actual film the chemistry of Hepburn and Henry Fonda is perfect. This film really to try to put into words is a really touching gem that makes you feel so uplifted. Your spirits soar and any relationship that can be amended and is anywhere near as strong in the film From Hepburn and Fonda shows us what acting can do.Oscars abound critical praise and very likely the last of the old fashioned melodramas Mainly because acting has moved on a generation from these sorts of films. The sentiment and feel is perfectly placed and the storeys clicked so much like the Fonda Father Daughter relationship. It is a warm intelligent character based film that i would advise everyone to see at once!".

Rarely I have seen such a eye captivating piece of film. And set to the gentle breezy thought provoking music makes it nothing short of perfect.  Reduced to a single plot line this movie would sound rather silly. It is one of those films in which the lead actors already supercede the brilliance of the writing. This of course could be expected from two of Hollywood's best loved veterans. There were things in the movie I could see coming due to experience but the amount of plot turns was amazing. There was also enough direction good in the sense the director achieved getting what he wanted but without interfering too much with the performances.Henry Fonda in his final performance as the cranky lovable Norman made me sit up and take notice in his only Oscar deserved role. I had seen him previously in earlier films like The Grapes of Wrath and 12 Angry Men but I disliked both of them. His pivotal performance in the interaction of the 13 year old Billy was incredibly funny moving and something that many people could relate to because of the generation gap. The film truly captured the spirit of Katharine Hepburn not very much unlike the loving cheerful Ethel herself. At least twice in her legendary career she was passed over for two Oscars she deserved for The Philadelphia Story and The African Queen. It was great of the Academy to hand Kate her last well deserved award.  The other support actors managed to do a pretty great job. The exception was Jane Fonda for her performance as Chelsea. It may or may not have been her fault but her acting was pretty weak regardless of the script. Underneath it all there are messages. Things that we could help mend but with our continued prejudiced beliefs never happen. The example of this was the tense relationship of Norman and Chelsea a problem staring them in the face but could have been solved if only there were a little faith. In real life we don't have to look much further than our front door to find these things. On Golden Pond has taken its place as one of my favourite movies. The nominations and Oscars it received that year was well deserved. I love the movie mostly through the fact that violence and special effects are not needed to drive it too typical of movies right now. It was made at a time when these things were too sadly emerging so it was really a breath of fresh air amongst sameness. The movie was wholesome indeed but it had something else. It was compelling drama and real to life honesty and humanity are all that is needed to make it a movie great. And its all these elements for which it should be credited. Rating 910".

	schema:headline " Lifted above mere sentimentality by the strength of the acting";
	schema:reviewBody "On Golden Pond was the surprise hit of 1981 the second highest grossing film of that year after Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yet it is not the sort of film for which one would normally predict great boxoffice success. It is about as different a film from Raiders as one can imagine. Whereas Spielberg's blockbuster is a testosteronefuelled actionadventure On Golden Pond is a quiet reflective drama about an elderly couple spending the summer by a lake.The film was adapted by Ernest Thompson from his play of the same name. Remarkably given his theme of old age Thompson was still in his twenties when he wrote it. Although attempts are made to open the action up by including scenes shot outdoors there is some very attractive photography of the New England scenery it clearly betrays its origin as a stage play with its limited number of characters and preponderance of dialogue over physical action.The central characters are Norman aged eighty and Ethel aged in her late sixties Thayer who spend every summer at their second home on Golden Pond a lake in New Hampshire. The word pond in American usage can clearly mean a far larger body of water than it does in Britain. The plot focuses on the relationship between Norman and Ethel and their daughter Chelsea who pays them a visit together with her fianc Bill and his twelveyearold son Billy. Were women of Jane Fonda's generation ever named Chelsea? I though that only began to be used as a girl's name in the sixties.Jane Fonda purchased the rights to the play as a vehicle for her father Henry doubtless because she saw in the turbulent relationship between Norman and Chelsea Thayer a reflection of the equally difficult reallife relationship between the Fondas. Norman is in many ways the most important character in the film. It is clear that he has always been a difficult man to get on with and age does not seem to have mellowed the cantankerous old man at all. He bickers constantly with his longsuffering and more placid wife Ethel although it is clear that despite their verbal battles they have a deep affection for one another. You old poop! might not normally be regarded as a term of endearment as used by Ethel about her husband it becomes one.The fatherdaughter relationship between Norman and Chelsea is clearly more problematic although the roots of their estrangement are never made clear. Possibly Norman resents his daughter for not being the son he longed for but never had and he make his dislike of her new fianc all too obvious. What serves to bring father and daughter back together is the special bond which grows up between Norman and young Billy whom he and Ethel look after while Chelsea and Bill are away on vacation in Europe. Norman might not have a son but Billy although not related to him by blood is the grandson he always wanted so they can go on fishing trips together. Chelsea's first marriage which ended in divorce was childless.The film stars not only Henry Fonda as Norman but also another great cinema legend Katharine Hepburn as Ethel and both won welldeserved Oscars for their performances. Fonda's award seems to have come as something of a surprise in the course of his long career he had received only one previous acting nomination for The Grapes of Wrath in 1940 and the year before making On Golden Pond had been given an Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. Such awards are often interpreted as meaning we're sorry that you've never had a real Oscar and are never likely to get one so please accept this consolation prize with our apologies. This was to be Fonda's last film he was to die a few months after receiving his award. In Hepburn's case this was her fourth Best Actress award setting a record which still stands. Jane Fonda was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but missed out possibly because she already had two Oscars on her mantelpiece and the Academy thought it would only be fair to spread the honours more evenly.On Golden Pond can at times be rather sugary but for the most part it is lifted above mere sentimentality by the strength of the acting. During the seventies the cinema had become increasingly youthobsessed a trend which was to continue throughout the eighties and indeed is still continuing today. It therefore comes as a refreshing surprise to come across a film from this period which stars in its leading roles two actors in their seventies. Like Ordinary People which won Best Picture the previous year this film is a drama which explores in a sensitive and sympathetic manner the difficulties faced by ordinary human beings doing their best to cope with life. 710".

He bickers constantly with his longsuffering and more placid wife Ethel although it is clear that despite their verbal battles they have a deep affection for one another. You old poop! might not normally be regarded as a term of endearment as used by Ethel about her husband it becomes one.The fatherdaughter relationship between Norman and Chelsea is clearly more problematic although the roots of their estrangement are never made clear. Possibly Norman resents his daughter for not being the son he longed for but never had and he make his dislike of her new fianc all too obvious. What serves to bring father and daughter back together is the special bond which grows up between Norman and young Billy whom he and Ethel look after while Chelsea and Bill are away on vacation in Europe. Norman might not have a son but Billy although not related to him by blood is the grandson he always wanted so they can go on fishing trips together. Chelsea's first marriage which ended in divorce was childless.The film stars not only Henry Fonda as Norman but also another great cinema legend Katharine Hepburn as Ethel and both won welldeserved Oscars for their performances. Fonda's award seems to have come as something of a surprise in the course of his long career he had received only one previous acting nomination for The Grapes of Wrath in 1940 and the year before making On Golden Pond had been given an Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. Such awards are often interpreted as meaning we're sorry that you've never had a real Oscar and are never likely to get one so please accept this consolation prize with our apologies. This was to be Fonda's last film he was to die a few months after receiving his award. In Hepburn's case this was her fourth Best Actress award setting a record which still stands. Jane Fonda was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but missed out possibly because she already had two Oscars on her mantelpiece and the Academy thought it would only be fair to spread the honours more evenly.On Golden Pond can at times be rather sugary but for the most part it is lifted above mere sentimentality by the strength of the acting. During the seventies the cinema had become increasingly youthobsessed a trend which was to continue throughout the eighties and indeed is still continuing today. It therefore comes as a refreshing surprise to come across a film from this period which stars in its leading roles two actors in their seventies. Like Ordinary People which won Best Picture the previous year this film is a drama which explores in a sensitive and sympathetic manner the difficulties faced by ordinary human beings doing their best to cope with life. 710";

I would venture those who thought this film was mushy and silly are very young people and most probably should study it to see how they will be  they hope !  in their own elderyears. I'm there already but feel just like Hepburn acts ageless.....This WAS the most endearing role of Fonda's career  he was an opinionated man in reallife and chose his roles well to fit his ideals. Perhaps Tenticles was just to pay the rent. Can't understand how some people didn't enjoy his role in The Grapes of Wrath  gripping tale which didn't call for overthetop acting. This movie was a little cleanedup for how the depression really was. On Golden Pond reflected the simplicity of his offscreen life  he could be seen almost daily tilling a big vegetable garden next to his home in Beverly Hills yet. It wasn't one of the snobbish houses  just nice. A bit of trivia some of Hollywoods biggest stars did not live in mansions  Lucille Ball for instance  not far away from Fonda.I truly am stumped that ANYONE could denigrate Hepburn's career. One user painted her as a hard woman  smart would be better. She could have married Howard Hughes but knew his life was full of baggage. Her career withstood without scandal the open secret that she was madly in love with Spencer Tracy who was hard to love. That she won four Oscars should demonstrate she knew which roles to choose and how to bring them to life not just deliver them. WE ALL could take lessons from her on how to be true to yourself but also be principled.Jane Fonda was much like her dad in that she was opinionated and fearless in expressing her opinions. Too much already about all that War stuff !!  take a very good look at They Shoot Horses Don't They and you'll see this lady is a skillful actress. Maybe it and Klute are too old for today's users ? Doug McKeon gets billing over Dabney Coleman? Hmmmmmm......how did THAT happen ? I don't recall seeing McKeon in one other film  made more? I was in a Mark Rydell film and can attest  as most people recognized  his directing was brilliant because he did exactly as folk said get the best and let them do their roles. If Ernest Thompson won an Oscar for his screenadaptation from his Broadwayhit then that attests he knew his theme and made it better.What a magical cast! combined with a beautiful score and clearcut cinematography. Hepburn and Fonda had actingexperience under their belts and also knew what aging entailed. As one user wrote younger people should get to know their grandparents better. Fonda's candor and delivery were a perfect match for Hepburn's supportive love  brilliant acting! I found Jane's edginess for her role to be a natural  Billy was the perfect example that her dad wanted a boy perhaps as rebellious as Billy was.All of this put together into a tale of lives grown goldenly ripe is failproof no matter what film it was upagainst. True there won't be too many more movies from Hollywood like this film because there aren't any actorsactresses left to do them  maybe Streep. Pitt and Jolie ? PLEASE ! I completely overlooked the shadow of the 'copter showing the scene goofs pointedout  unimportant. There weren't any other goofs. Indeed this film will live for ever because it preserves on media which can let us watch it overandover again  which I do. Everyone should  simplicity except for those who need all the action in today's films is the best  tell me like it is. 20outof10.....".

The only really annoying scene was the last one where one police officer asks the son What did your father do? to which he replies My father saved our lives.

Such is true with The River Wild a predictable but entertaining river rapids adventurehostage drama. Streep incorporates her role with strength humor and even a bit of vulnerability.  Backed by the menacing Kevin Bacon and the refined David Strathairn the ultimate everyman...that's a compliment Streep holds her own in a genre that one doesn't necessarily think of when her name comes to mind.  One tremendous scene involves Streep reminding her captor Bacon of the dangers of the upcoming waterfallrapids system known as The Gauntlet...Streep whispers determination and threats promises of anger and doom directly into Bacon's ears with a quite rage only to be turned to an edgeoftears monologue when her family comes to mind.  Bravo to Curtis Hanson's preL.A. Confidential film 1997's SHOULD HAVE for Director and Picture.

I don't know how much was Streep how much stuntdouble and how much effects but her character emerges as a convincing woman of action who is also an anxious mother.Kevin Bacon is very effective as a regular guy who just happens to be a psychotic criminal in his off moments John C Reilly plays his weak shifty sidekick and Joseph Mazzello is the son who initially finds Bacon more fun than his dad. It is David Strathairn though who for me takes the male acting honours as a distant seriousminded husband and father who gets going when the going gets tough  though luckily through thick and thin he never loses his glasses! There is more than a touch of Deliverance and the ending is preordained but the film is entertaining and gripping throughout and is aided by some breathtaking Rockies scenery beautifully shot.

I really don't know but I tell you one thing if I ever meet Kevin Bacon I will tell him he gave an outstanding performance in this movie. And while I am in his company I will NEVER turn my back on him. He just spooks me out and will always do so. what greater compliment is there? I thought this movie was extremely well cast. I know the ending is predictable but the best thing about this movie is that it is believable. Anyone of us could have been stuck in that situation. Ever go up an elevator with a person who you feel uncomfortable with? If the elevator gets stuck... what do you do? This is basically the same as the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Curtis Hanson's box office hit 'The River Wild' is wellshot and even gripping in parts but what really stands tall in this thriller and balances the film even when it dips are the performances by it's talented starcast. The story involves a family on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals in the wilderness. 'The River Wild' which has been written by Denis O'Neill offers some gripping moments that truly manage to hold your attention. The characters are nicely presented and executed. But I would like to point out that the writing in the latter hour tends to drag a bit. The film surely could've been shorter by at least 1015 minutes. And I believe if it had been trimmed it's impact would have only enhanced. Curtis Hanson's direction like always is efficient. Cinematography is Striking. Editing is fair. PerformanceWise Meryl Streep is superb as expected. She carries the film on her shoulders and delivers with ease in each and every scene. Kevin Bacon makes a really interesting bad guy and proves his potential as an actor. David Strathaim is firstrate. John C. Reilly is good. Joseph Mazzello supports well. On the whole A decent onetime watch that offers strong performances to sail it safe.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched The River Wild mainly for two reasons. The first one was incredibly talented young actor named Joseph Mazello while the second was Kevin Bacon also very good and underrated actor in my opinion. I expected just an average thriller or something like that but this movie managed to surpass my expectations. Though it wasn't a great or Oscarworthy movie I found The River Wild mostly good and entertained worth seeing movie. The story is concentrated on average dysfunctional family with workaholic father who have almost lost a contact with his wife and two kids. They undertake a raft journey on vacation to celebrate their eldest son Rourke birthday and in the same time trying to save their dying marriage. This at first calm and beautiful journey gets unexpectedly dangerous when the family meet on their way two strangers played by Kevin Bacon and John C.Reilly who also for their own reasons go to a journey with the same route. The story is not flawless and has some plot holes but overall it's not bad written. Well maybe it's quite predictable but I don't think that such predictability harmed the movie too much. The acting overall was pretty good. To my surprise somehow happened that Meryl Streep became a weakest part in this excellent cast ensemble. I think she was a bit unconvincing as careful mother as well as a strong rafter. Another problem is that her character Gail is not developed as much as the movie needs it. For unknown reasons she got even a Golden Globe nomination for this movie but anyway The River Wild definitely is not among her best works. David Straithairn is much better playing Gail's husband and Roarke's father. Kevin Bacon is brilliant as evil psychotic villain while John C.Reilly gave decent performance of his diffident weakwilled sidekick. And finally Joseph Mazello the most talented actor among entire casts in the movie. His part didn't give him many opportunities to show his talent but in those short moments his acting was beautiful and he was able to overshadow others. Despite all these very good performances the most exceptional thing about The River Wild is not the good acting but a beautiful scenery and excellent cinematography that have captured it. Even only this terrific scenery filmed somewhere in Oregon is enough to make this movie worth seeing. It's simply beyond my words. Finally it is worth to mention nice score written by Jerry Goldmith with excellent main theme.In the conclusion The River Wild is not great but quite a good movie with good casts acting and one of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. My grade 75 or B.".

However when Gail and Tom begin to feel uncomfortable with their guests they try to slip away unnoticed  only for Wade to pull a gun and insist that Gail will help them proceed downriver and cross the legendary Gauntlet.I first watched this when it came out in the cinema and I remember enjoying it. However noticing it back on television recently I couldn't help but be a little uninterested in it and wondered if I had just false memories of how good it really had been and so decided to watch it again and see. After a slow opening the film gets down to business with the two boats getting together and gradually going to the conclusion that we know is coming but enjoy heading towards anyway. The film delivers its straightforward plot well in the early stages using the fatherfigure conflict well even if it ignores the heavy feminist subtext to generate the tension while the later stages is more of a simple hostage thriller sort of affair. This aspect is still quite enjoyable even if it is not as tight as it really needed to be and as a nonrafter I wasn't sure how intimidated I was meant to be by the load of water that was the gauntlet.As a result the film is a little talky but the cast are able to deal with it and it is really only the clunky slow start that suffers as a result. I'm not a big fan of Meryl Streep and I didn't think she was totally fitted to the material given her but mostly her performance was natural enough to be convincing. Strathairn plays second fiddle to Streep but he is still enjoyable as he delivers an insecure character. With these two big names in the lead it would have been easy for them to dominate but it is Kevin Bacon that steals the film with a charismatic performance that he easily turns into menace  hardly his greatest performance but he makes more of it than others have in the past. Mazzello is a typical 'cute kid' American actor but he is good enough for this material and he is pretty good in the first half when he is given the material. Reilly and Bratt add some wellknown faces to the mix but really neither has that much to do.Overall this is not a great film but it is good enough to be worth seeing once. The action is not typical for this genre and the novelty value of it makes it seem more interesting. The film looks good and it is tense enough to do the job while the plot gets past the slow start to deliver an interesting set up and a solid enough series of set pieces with a good cast and director onboard sorry!.".

	schema:reviewBody "The River Wild isn't among the best or most exciting thrilleraction movies ever made but it's a very well made one by acclaimed director Curtis Hanson and with a great cast.A movie set entirely on a river with as the central piece of the movie a family complete with kids and a dog. How exciting does that sound? It sound like a 'based on true events' Hallmark type of movie. But don't be fooled. The River Wild is a movie that has plenty to offer despite its very restrained concept and settings of the movie.The movie is also more original than you perhaps would expect. The movie also does a fair job at keeping things sort of a mystery for a long time. I especially like how 'the bad guys' try to set up the family against each other to create disorder and different camps of which they can profit from for their own benefit. It's perhaps not as good and prominently executed as it could had but nevertheless the movie gets points for the attempt that also I must say mostly works out due to Kevin Bacon's fine role.Watching this movie sort of makes you think what a shame it is that Bacon doesn't really play villainous roles anymore. He only played these sort of roles in the early '90's though he had an obvious talent for it. Not that he plays crappy roles now but nevertheless it remains a shame he doesn't play more often the bad guy. He is perfectly good in his role in this movie. He knows to portray a likable character that you're also able to hate at times. A real achievement. But also credits have to go to Meryl Streep who plays a fine strong female lead and other great actors such as David Strathairn Joseph Mazzello and John C. Reilly.Despite that it's not the most exciting movie in its genre it still is one that is always fast going and never boring to watch. The movie mostly features nature action set on the river. So it's a pretty original movie in its genre but I don't know movies set at mostly the same locations are just never among my favorite or most exciting ones to watch such as for instance in my personal experience also was the case with movies such as Speed and Phone Booth.The movie is of course a great looking thanks to its nature settings. Also the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is really worth mentioning.It's just a fine movie that is perfectly put together and has a great cast but it's just not the finest exciting genre movie thinkable and it perhaps is also a bit too simplistic also due to its restraints.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

It stars Meryl Streep as Gail Hartman an expert camper and whitewater rafter who is stuck in an increasingly stale marriage to Tom David Strathairn. For her son Roarke Joseph Mazello 13rth birthday they decide to go out into the wild for a weekend. They come across two other rafters Wade and Terry Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly who take an interest in the boy. At first it appears they have an agenda they provoke Tom's jealousy as Gail is drawn to Wade possibly because he reminds her of herself as a young girl. But Wade becomes a menace. He's a wanted theft and he forces the family into a precarious situation. They must cross extremely dangerous waters to get to their destination and fight off these baddies. This hard experience ultimately brings the family together. Tom who changes from a weak father to hero is a rather interesting transformation to see on film and he is played well by David Straithairn a fab actor who is unfortunately underrated. Meryl Streep appears to be doing a film she would normally not attempt. She proves her versatility as a cool natureloving mother and does not possess any of the Hollywoodfed glamour for this role. She is convincing as a middleclass American wife. The cinematography is stunning. The rapids are gorgeous and exciting to look at the grand scenes of mountains and forests rocks steep cliffs. The music score is also lovely. A great film from the 90's by a director who's had fine and differentthemed films in his repertoire.".

The River Wild is truly insulting.";

Unfortunately to these two great performances comes the under performed. John C. Reilly is basically a sidekick thug to Bacon.

	schema:reviewBody "There is a subgenre of the romantic comedy known as the comedy of remarriage. Such films generally deal with a divorced or estranged couple or a couple whose marriage has been going through a difficult patch rediscovering their love for one another. They were especially popular in the thirties and forties but there have been a number of recent examples such as Sweet Home Alabama and Did you Hear about the Morgans? The River Wild can be seen as a thriller of remarriage. Like Did you Hear about the Morgans? it deals with a bigcity couple whose marriage is in trouble but who manage to save it while on a trip to a rural part of the American West. The difference between the two films apart from the fact that the motive for that trip is quite different in each case is that Did you Hear about the Morgans? tells its story in the form of a comedy The River Wild in the form of a serious thriller. Tom and Gail a middleclass Boston couple are having marital problems. Gail a teacher of deaf children feels that Tom an architect spends too much time at work and neglects his family. Gail is originally from Idaho and decides to take her young children Roarke and Willa on holiday to see her parents who still live in that state. Gail is also an expert at whitewater rafting and before her move to Boston worked as a rafting guide on a local river. The river wild of the title the filmmakers may have chosen this unconventional word order to avoid confusion with Wild River the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan. She decides to take Roarke on a holiday rafting trip down the river Willa who stays with her grandparents presumably being too young to come along. At the last minute Tom joins them and the three set off on their trip together. Near the beginning of their trip the family meet two other rafters Wade and Terry. At first the two men appear to be friendly but Gail slowly becomes suspicious of them and she and Tom decide to leave them behind. The attempt fails and Wade pulls a gun on them. It transpires that the two men are criminals who have just committed a robbery and are using the river as a means of escape they need Gail's rafting skills to get them past the Gauntlet a particularly dangerous stretch of river. The rest of the film tells of the family's efforts to thwart the robbers and of how their shared danger helps to mend the relationship between Gail and Tom. The film marked something of a new departure for Meryl Streep previously often seen as a rather serious cerebral actress. Although she had made occasional ventures into comedy in films like SheDevil and Death Becomes Her this was her first appearance as an action heroine. It is not the sort of role which she has reprised since 1994 but she makes the most of it here she even apparently performed most of her own stunts. David Strathairn more often seen in supporting roles here achieves leading man status as Tom. There is also a good performance from Kevin Bacon generally a reliable villain as Wade at first friendly and plausible later a raging psychopath. John C. Reilly's Terry seems almost likable by comparison. Curtis Hanson is not a particularly prolific director in a career lasting nearly forty years he has only made fourteen films. Some of those however especially in the thriller genre have been good ones such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and the excellent neonoir L.A. Confidential. The River Wild is another example of Hanson at his best even though there are occasional implausible moments some of the characters especially Tom the bespectacled nerdishlooking architect occasionally perform feats of strength or agility more often seen in superhero movies. The basic story family menaced by violent criminals may be an overfamiliar one but it is certainly handled in an exciting manner here. Curtis's direction is brilliant this is one thriller that is genuinely worthy of the name moving along at a cracking pace. The scenes on the river especially when Gail is taking the raft down the Gauntlet are heartstopping. The cinematography of the beautiful wild scenery of the Pacific NorthWest is magnificent. The River Wild must count as one of the bestmade thrillers of the nineties. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "spoilers hereinYou can tell that a movie has some problems when less then halfway through it you can recite the rest of the plot word for word. This was the case for The river wild. The overall gist of the movie was not displeasing but the plot was horribly predictable. Average everyday family with parents not quite getting along on vacation meets friendly strangers who begin to seem slightly creepy and surprise! They turn out to be convicted criminals who need the experienced rafter mother in the family to get them across the river to their getaway car. The father tries to protect his family but is shot at and presumed dead. but he's not! He just has the extraordinary ability to hold his breath underwater for 5 minutes! The rest of the cast continues down the river until later on when the father makes a surprise appearance saves his family the main bad guy gets shot conveniently by the mother who earlier in the movie swore to kill him and after doing so shows absolutely no emotion of any sort. Hmmm... and the hapless henchman is taken to jail. The family now lives happily ever after with both parents now getting along marvelously with lots of kissing too! and the young impressionable son agrees to not talk to strangers anymore.The plot is fiendishly predictable and boring and the characters are ones that are often used as well the athletic courageous intelligent protective and pretty much flawless mother Meryl Streep her loser husband David Strathairn who later on in the film gets to show that he does have some good qualities as well! including some pretty impressive fighting moves! Was this guy a boxer in college or what? Then there's their young son Joseph Mazello who says that he's not afraid then proceeds to scream a lot. And the villains the main criminal Kevin Bacon who runs the show and manages to pass himself off as charming and likable despite the fact that he's secretly a very evil pervert and his bumbling uneducated and much friendlier sidekick John C. Reilly who tries to make friends with the kid says that he 'don't wanna go back to jail' and that he 'never knew anybody was gonna get hurt!' Yawn.This movie is riddled with thoroughly average acting with the exceptions of Kevin Bacon as Wade he's so good at being villainous! and despite his age Joseph Mazello as Roarke giving a similar role but much better performance than in Jurassic Park. Nobody else's performance stood out that much although nobody did that bad of a job just nothing spectacular. Personally I would have expected Meryl Streep to have done a better job she's renowned for being an excellent actress but I wasn't particularly swept away by her performance.The setting was perfect and the scenery was beautiful  it really complimented the movie and the camera work showed it off perfectly with lots of zooming out to demonstrate the whole scene then zooming back in to focus on the actors again. Definitely a high point. Unfortunately this was ruined by the theme song to the movie which although started out beautiful was terribly overused and started to really grate on the viewer's nerves after it was replayed sometimes by different instruments which didn't really do much for the 50th time or so. It would have been much better and more successful at keeping the audience awake had they varied the music a little bit.Overall it wasn't a bad movie and it was handled well enough but they were stuck with a storyline that had been used way too many times before which flattened the mood.

	onyx:emotionText "spoilers hereinYou can tell that a movie has some problems when less then halfway through it you can recite the rest of the plot word for word. This was the case for The river wild. The overall gist of the movie was not displeasing but the plot was horribly predictable. Average everyday family with parents not quite getting along on vacation meets friendly strangers who begin to seem slightly creepy and surprise! They turn out to be convicted criminals who need the experienced rafter mother in the family to get them across the river to their getaway car. The father tries to protect his family but is shot at and presumed dead. but he's not! He just has the extraordinary ability to hold his breath underwater for 5 minutes! The rest of the cast continues down the river until later on when the father makes a surprise appearance saves his family the main bad guy gets shot conveniently by the mother who earlier in the movie swore to kill him and after doing so shows absolutely no emotion of any sort. Hmmm... and the hapless henchman is taken to jail. The family now lives happily ever after with both parents now getting along marvelously with lots of kissing too! and the young impressionable son agrees to not talk to strangers anymore.The plot is fiendishly predictable and boring and the characters are ones that are often used as well the athletic courageous intelligent protective and pretty much flawless mother Meryl Streep her loser husband David Strathairn who later on in the film gets to show that he does have some good qualities as well! including some pretty impressive fighting moves! Was this guy a boxer in college or what? Then there's their young son Joseph Mazello who says that he's not afraid then proceeds to scream a lot. And the villains the main criminal Kevin Bacon who runs the show and manages to pass himself off as charming and likable despite the fact that he's secretly a very evil pervert and his bumbling uneducated and much friendlier sidekick John C. Reilly who tries to make friends with the kid says that he 'don't wanna go back to jail' and that he 'never knew anybody was gonna get hurt!' Yawn.This movie is riddled with thoroughly average acting with the exceptions of Kevin Bacon as Wade he's so good at being villainous! and despite his age Joseph Mazello as Roarke giving a similar role but much better performance than in Jurassic Park. Nobody else's performance stood out that much although nobody did that bad of a job just nothing spectacular. Personally I would have expected Meryl Streep to have done a better job she's renowned for being an excellent actress but I wasn't particularly swept away by her performance.The setting was perfect and the scenery was beautiful  it really complimented the movie and the camera work showed it off perfectly with lots of zooming out to demonstrate the whole scene then zooming back in to focus on the actors again. Definitely a high point. Unfortunately this was ruined by the theme song to the movie which although started out beautiful was terribly overused and started to really grate on the viewer's nerves after it was replayed sometimes by different instruments which didn't really do much for the 50th time or so. It would have been much better and more successful at keeping the audience awake had they varied the music a little bit.Overall it wasn't a bad movie and it was handled well enough but they were stuck with a storyline that had been used way too many times before which flattened the mood. Although there was some decent acting which helped excellent scenery and cinematography and a good climax with the passengers of the raft struggling through the 'gauntlet'. For all you nature lovers Kevin Bacon or Meryl Streep fans out there this is for you! For everyone else...leave this one wallowing in the shadows before it drags you under with it's tedious undertow.6.510";

	schema:headline " Another minor classic with Boris and Bela";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s the names of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films. After being Universal's first monster in the seminal classic Dracula Bela Lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent sadly this last factor would also led him to be typecasted during the 40s. In the same way Boris Karloff's performance in James Whale's Frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster. Of course it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen and the movie that united them was 1934's The Black Cat. This formula would be repeated in several films through the decade and director Lambert Hillyer's mix of horror and science fiction The Invisible Ray is another of those minor classics they did in those years.In The Invisible Ray Dr. Janos Rukh Boris Karloff is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of Andromeda. While showing his invention to his colleagues Dr. Felix Benet Bela Lugosi and Sir Francis Stevens Walter Kingsford they discover that thousands of years ago a meteor hit in what is now Nigeria. After this marvelous discovery Dr. Rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to Africa looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor. This expedition won't be any beneficial for Rukh as during the expedition his wife Diane Frances Drake will fall in love with Ronald Drake Frank Lawton an expert hunter brought by the Stevens to aid them in their expedition. However Rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip as he'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor.Written by John Colton who previously did the script for Werewolf of London The Invisible Ray had its roots on an original scifi story by Howard Higgin and Douglas Hodges. Given that this was a movie with Karloff and Lugosi Colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up. One element that makes The Invisible Ray to stand out among other horror films of that era is the way that Colton plays with morality through the story. That is there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices. In many ways The Invisible Ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions guilt and revenge.A seasoned director of lowbudget Bmovies filmmaker Lambert Hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for Universal Pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles. Thanks to his experience working with limited resources Hillyer's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains and The Invisible Ray was not an exception. While nowhere near the stylish Gothic atmosphere of previous Universal horror films Hillyer's movie effectively captures the essence of Colton's script as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward scifi. Finally a word must be said about Hillyer's use of special effects for an extremely lowbudget film they look a lot better than the ones in several Amovies of the era.As usual in a movie with Lugosi and Karloff the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality. As the film's protagonist Boris Karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes. As his colleague Dr. Benet Bela Luogis is simply a joy to watch stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was. As Rukh's wife Frances Drake is extremely effective truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress. Still two of the movie highlights are the performances of Kemble Cooper as Mother Rukh and Beulah Bondi as Lady Arabella as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time making unforgettable their supporting roles. Frank Lawton is also good in his role but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast.If one judges this movie under today's standards it's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience. However that would be a mistake as despite its lowbudget it is remarkably well done for its time. On the top of that considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept it's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate. One final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive Dr. Rukh and the cold Dr. Benet as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors.While nowhere near the Gothic expressionism of the Frankenstein movies nor the elegant suspense of The Black Cat Lambert Hillyer's The Invisible Ray is definitely a minor classic amongst Universal Pictures' catalog of horror films. With one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror this mixture of suspense horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Karloff and Lugosi  Together again! This is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much. It's not an allout horror film like the duo's previous two hits The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when revisited.The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the Laemmles' reign at Universal he found himself helming this and the Laemmles' final horror film Dracula's Daughter. Both are crisp cleancut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.Just as Lugosi went wild in The Raven much needs to be said of Karloff's hamming in The Invisible Ray. The one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that Karloff's character Rukh acts so madly before he is poisoned by Radium X that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing. This is very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining  He's basically a loony right from the start. There isn't any real transformation. Same here. Halfway through Karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind. I still enjoyed his performance though just as I did Lugosi's overthetop antics in The Raven.Meanwhile Lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as Rukh's rival in science Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukh of which I am in alignment with horror film writer John Soister on  And if he Rukh touches anyone? the inspector inquires. Lugosi hesitatingly replies in a way that only Lugosi could deliver They die. Just as Lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments.Therefore Karloff and Lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of Karloff pared off against the cool logic of Lugosi. Karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes Lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one. He only had one more chance Ninotchka.The Invisible Ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true Karloff and Lugosi fans. It is one of those films that improves on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker more horrific pairings they had. The special effects by the always innovative John Fulton are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films. The scene in the end when Karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film. A terrific fun film!".

	onyx:emotionText "Karloff and Lugosi  Together again! This is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much. It's not an allout horror film like the duo's previous two hits The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both's talents and is a fun film when revisited.The Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the Laemmles' reign at Universal he found himself helming this and the Laemmles' final horror film Dracula's Daughter. Both are crisp cleancut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements.Just as Lugosi went wild in The Raven much needs to be said of Karloff's hamming in The Invisible Ray. The one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that Karloff's character Rukh acts so madly before he is poisoned by Radium X that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing. This is very similar to the complaint people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining  He's basically a loony right from the start. There isn't any real transformation. Same here. Halfway through Karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind. I still enjoyed his performance though just as I did Lugosi's overthetop antics in The Raven.Meanwhile Lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as Rukh's rival in science Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukh of which I am in alignment with horror film writer John Soister on  And if he Rukh touches anyone? the inspector inquires. Lugosi hesitatingly replies in a way that only Lugosi could deliver They die. Just as Lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments.Therefore Karloff and Lugosi's interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of Karloff pared off against the cool logic of Lugosi. Karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes Lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one. He only had one more chance Ninotchka.The Invisible Ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true Karloff and Lugosi fans. It is one of those films that improves on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story complements the darker more horrific pairings they had. The special effects by the always innovative John Fulton are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films. The scene in the end when Karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film. A terrific fun film!";

Not quite as memorable or as successful as their previous efforts THE BLACK CAT 1934 and THE RAVEN 1935 both suggested on Edgar Allan Poe in which the horror relies on their characters of good versus evil THE INVISIBLE RAY often classified as a horror film because of Karloff and Lugosi is actually a science fiction story with three separate chapters. And of the three only the African expedition described below in Part II is the slowest as well as its longest. PART I Set in an isolated castle somewhere in the mountains as the thunderstorm rages Doctor Janos Rukh Karloff is a middleaged but brilliant scientist with a young wife Diana Frances Drake and an elderly mother Violet KembleCooper who is not only wise but blind. Rukh prepares to reveal his latest discovery to a group of scholars Doctor Felix Benet Bela Lugosi Sir Francis Stevens Walter Kingsford along with handsome young Ronald Drake Frank Lawton and Lady Arabelle Stevens Beulah Bondi as spectators. Rukh demonstrates his discovery of the invisible ray being a beam of light which he could follow back in time and space in order to see what has happened in the past. He then provides visual proof that a giant meteor struck the Earth in Africa many millions of years ago and that this meteor is composed of an unknown element that may have substance more powerful than radium. After this demonstration Rukh and the scholars prepare to go on timely expedition to darkest Africa. PART II While in Africa Rukh separates himself from his expedition especially his wife and discovers the ancient element called Radium X intending to use it for the purposes of atomic medicine. He is soon contaminated by Radium X and realizes that not only does he glow in the dark but brings death to whatever he touches with the first victim being his dog. With the help of Benet an antidote is prepared for Ruhk in which he must take regularly. In the meantime Diane feeling neglected by her husband finds comfort with that Ronald Drake who now loves her. PART III Rukh's discovery of Radium X proves successful in which the ray used by the scholars cures blindness. Rukh uses this experiment to cure his mother from her eternal blindness and upon getting her vision back she doesn't like what she sees in her son. With the radiation becoming too powerful Rukh's mind soon becomes effected becoming less rational. He then accuses Benet and the others of theft even though Benet assures him that he he will get full credit for his work. Rukh is even more upset when he learns that Diane now loves Drake thus as in Agatha Christie's acclaimed mystery novel And Then There Were None Rukh prepares to kill off those he felt betrayed him one by one and with each death comes the destruction of statues that stand on the side of a London church.THE INVISIBLE RAY is very much a production that predates the science fiction fantasies of the 1950s. Special effects here are first rate compliments of John Fulton with one particular standout scene in Africa where Rukh's machine focuses on a giant boulder and with the strength of the invisible ray the boulder disintegrates into powder. With Karloff's knowhow into holding his viewer's interest throughout the film's 81 minutes this production presents itself on a more elaborate scale than THE RAVEN for example. It also features a soothing but memorable music score by Franz Waxman. Although Bela Lugosi as a European scientist supporting a little beard around his mouth has little to do his role is essential to the story. On the lighter side is character actress May Beatty in her humorous characterization as the nosy gossipy cockney landlady.It seems interesting to note however that with this third installment of KarloffLugosi films that Universal didn't attempt to team these two masters of horror to fulfill the trilogy in having them paired in another Edgar Allan Poe based thriller something like The TellTale Heart for example but as with the aforementioned predecessors it would have been more Hollywood than Poe. THE INVISIBLE RAY however is in a class by itself but hardly gets the recognition it deserves.THE INVISIBLE RAY once a frequent late show or Chiller Theater replay on commercial television decades ago played sporadically on the SciFi Cable Channel in the 1990s during the late night hours where vampires and ghouls were its only viewers. It was revived again thanks to Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere April 5 2006. It was also available on video cassette and later DVD compliments of MCA Universal. ".

That's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!The Invisible Ray' is part horror part drama and certainly part scifi. For a movie made in 1936 the scifi elements were a good deal ahead of their time.  The mixture of horror drama and scifi are a perfect blend while the acting on the part of Lugosi and Karloff couldn't be better.Director Lambert Hillyer captures a lot of elements that James Whale did so often.  What I'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot.  The scene with the gargoyles outside of Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood.  It's a standout moment in the film which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.As with The Black Cat' and Island of Lost Souls' I can't understand why this film has yet to be released on DVD.  When you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to DVD it's that much more puzzling.Anyway watch this film if you get the chance.  When it's released on DVD grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your DVD library.".

	schema:headline " A Hodgepodge Science Fiction  Horror Film That Works Well";
	schema:reviewBody "Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi made many films together but on the whole interestingly enough Karloff usually is the better man of the two. The real exception is The Black Cat 1934 where Karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and Lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. But more usual is Black Friday where whatever his motive Karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while Lugosi is a murderous thug. In The Raven Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough. Rarely are they both negative characters totally. In The Body Snatcher Karloff does kill Lugosi but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him.The one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film which I feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies I have mentioned. In it Karloff's Dr. Janos Rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the official scientific community for his theory that a rare form of Radium is in Nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. He has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi and has another scientist a Frenchman named Dr. Felix Benet Lugosi Rukh's young wife Diane Frances Drake and a friend and protge of the Stevenses named Ronald Drake Frank Lawton.Before they leave Rukh is warned by his mother Violet Kemble Cooper that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy. He tries to dismiss this but he is worried by what she says his scientific standing and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.What he gets is a disaster. He finds the substance but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity. He finds that he is slowly burning up and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. He's actually built up a friendship or understanding with Benet who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for Rukh to use to counter the danger. But there are two things that are unbeatable here. The antidote can only last for a certain amount of time and has to be replenished. And the radioactivity has affected Rukh's brain. He is increasingly jealous of Diane's friendship with Ronald encouraged unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella and he is equally upset that due to his having to pretend to have died  the effects of the radioactivity are like that Benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that Radium X is giving to man. Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives ending with his own.The film certainly picked up on science to an extent. Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium. Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out. The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition. Of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of Africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled Englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon.On the other hand Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England. During the Whitechapel Murders Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper. It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. But the idea did not die. Jules Verne used it in his novel The Brothers Kip in 1899 and here Dr. Benet uses it. As this is a science fiction story he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.The film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. The other performances are good as well in particular Ms Kemble Cooper. She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone's frightening sister Jane Murdstone in David Copperfield. Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.".

Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium. Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 but some idea of it was coming out. The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a curse on the expedition. Of course with the idea of a cursed expedition on the continent of Africa for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago financed by a titled Englishman we have entered archeology not physics or geology paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon.On the other hand Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England. During the Whitechapel Murders Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper. It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. But the idea did not die. Jules Verne used it in his novel The Brothers Kip in 1899 and here Dr. Benet uses it. As this is a science fiction story he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.The film is good on many grounds the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. The other performances are good as well in particular Ms Kemble Cooper. She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone's frightening sister Jane Murdstone in David Copperfield. Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Invisible Ray is an exciting story about an overworked scientist who works effortlessly in his Carpathian castle looking for secrets of the universe.  Boris Karloff plays the scientist Janos Ruhk who travels with a band of other scientists to Africa for the spot where an unidentified element landed centuries ago.  Karloff is very good as the scientist who accidentally poisons himself with this new radioactive element.  Karloff is obsessed with the idea that his fellow travelers amongst them the stately Lugosi as Dr. Benet are after his honors and secrets of this new find. Because of this Karloff goes on a maniacal murdering spree of his former friends.  There are many good elements in this film most dealing with the rather interesting story of science gone amok.  Lugosi is good too although his role is not very big.  I must agree with many that this pairing of the horrific duo is a second to The Black Cat.  Nonetheless this is a fine Universal science fictionhorror film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Invisible Ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife. His already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.Lugosi plays the consummate professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends. This was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well. It is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is French. The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well. Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made. And they are also as forward reaching and always will be. This is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again. I saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and I could easily sit through it five more times. The acting is marvelous and the science is amusing. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not as famous as some of their other collaborations such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh a weird scientist who lives in the Carpathian mountainsnear where the Dracula character's home town. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benetwhose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles as the Carpathian role seems tailor made for Lugosiespecially with his accent. However despite this unusual twist the two still did excellent jobs. Karloff's was definitely the lead role but Lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal personsomething he didn't play very often in films!! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah as other scientists especially Benet think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. However over the course of the film Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine don't you hate it when that happens?. While this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad Rukh was NOT a onedimensional killer but complex and interesting.This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. You can really tell that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a biggerbudget film instead of the cheap quickies both Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. Good stuff.".

It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah as other scientists especially Benet think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. However over the course of the film Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine don't you hate it when that happens?. While this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story the plot was well constructed the characters nicely developed and the mad Rukh was NOT a onedimensional killer but complex and interesting.This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. You can really tell that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a biggerbudget film instead of the cheap quickies both Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. Good stuff.";

After discovering the exposure to the element has made him radioactive and lethal to touch Rukh turns to Benet for help. Benet creates a temporary antidote for Rukh and then promptly steals his research and presents it to the scientific community which praises Radium X's healing properties. Enraged by this and his wife Frances Drake leaving him for another man Frank Lawton Rukh fakes his own death and uses his lethal touch to seek revenge against those who have wronged him.Another good KarloffLugosi film. This one is an early foray into science fiction by Universal. Karloff is marvelous as always. Lugosi gives a fine surprisingly restrained performance. More proof that he was a better actor than he's often said to be. It's also a credit to the script that his character doesn't go the clichd route of becoming a full villain. Actually that's one of the more intriguing things about this movie. There are no clearcut black  white heroes. Though the narrative often portrays Karloff as the villain the good guys consist of two adulterers two thieves and an obnoxious old crow. That's to say nothing of a mother who betrays her son even after he restored her sight! As to the rest of the cast Frances Drake is gorgeous and does a good job with a somewhat difficult part. Her legendary braless bounciness early in the movie will brighten anyone's day. Poor Janos was making the wrong discoveries sadly. Frank Lawton is as exciting as dishwater. To be fair these types of parts are always a hard sell. At least he's no Lester Matthews in Werewolf of London. Beulah Bondi is best in small doses as the butch buttinsky Arabella. Exceptional turn by Violet Kemble Cooper as Karloff's mom. Walter Kingsford is funny as Arabella's husband.Great sets decent effects good cast and a smart script with interesting ideas. Not the best of Universal's 1930s horror films or even the KarloffLugosi pairings but a very good one nonetheless.".

The story is a little predictable while the supporting characters are underdeveloped and not very interesting and I'm not sure whether some of the scientific ideas while innovative at the time are as easy to grasp or as relevant now as it was. These are just personal preferences though and The Invisible Ray was still enjoyable even with those personal reservations. It is a very nicelooking film original at the time and holds up now with a great Gothic atmosphere beautifully constructed sets and nicely done special effectseven from a presentday perspective. The photography fits with the mood very well as well. The Invisible Ray is atmospherically scored the script is literate and the film moves quickly with few pacing lulls. The directing from Lambert Hillyer is efficient and neatly setup I also detected a little bit of a James Whale influence which I liked. There are some actors who don't really distinguish themselves in roles that don't really allow for them to shine properly. Frances Drake and Violet KembleCooper are good though while the topnotch performances of genre masters Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are the film's best asset. I do prefer their performances and chemistry in The Black Cat but what really makes them worth watching here is how effortlessly charismatic they are and how they are in roles that actually suit them and their acting skills. In conclusion very entertaining with great lead performances from Karloff and Lugosi. 710 Bethany Cox".

When I purchased the Boris Karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role Tower of London The Strange Door. The Invisible Ray however is part of the Bela Lugosi collection and here it's actually Boris Karloff who overshadows Bela! This actually would have been a great title for the Boris Karloff collection instead! Bela Lugosi's character is quite possibly the most goodnatured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old Karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here. The Invisible Ray features three main chapters. The first one set in Dr. Janos Rukh's Carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewer's patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film. Dr. Rukh Karloff demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues among them Bela Lugosi as Dr. Benet how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a selfmanufactured device. The scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite Rukh and his lovely wife Diane along for an expedition in the heart of Africa. There Dr. Rukh isolates himself from the group discovers the essential element Radium X to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself. The third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting statues and a surprising climax. Karloff glows in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch. The narrative structure of The Invisible Ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining. The story is rather farfetched but nevertheless compelling and director Lambert Hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense. Boris Karloff is truly fantastic and so is Lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time. Their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing Boris.".

The only other memorable science fiction film from 1936 is Things To Come a visionary film that travels 100 years into the future.  The Invisible Ray shows Bela Lugosi Dracula  Boris Karloff Frankenstein in roles very different  a departure from their signature identification stamps. Karloff is the visionary  somewhat mad scientist that really loses it as he slowly falls apart after exposure to Radium X . Lugosi in complete contrast is the balanced good doctor scientist that develops a counteractive to keep Karloff's radium poisoning in check for a short time as it wears off  he must have regular doses at certain times or he'll quoting Lugosi's line Crumble to an ash as only Lugosi can deliver a line. Bela as Dr. Felix Benet is a sharp contrast from Count Dracula his facial hair  beard gives him a radically different look  virtually removes his vampire image. He really shows his range  versatility here  he wasn't just Dracula he was a great actor. He got to show his versatility again in his next teaming with Karloff as the crazed shepard Ygor in Son Of Frankenstein in 1939.

Janos Rukke was the first of his many mad doctor roles he would play  Bela also did his share of mad genius doctor roles later in the 1940's. The scenes of Karloff glowing in the dark from Radium X is very impressive special effects  still holds up today. The film gets better with age  never gets old  a film I can watch over  over.

	schema:reviewBody "I wouldn't give many films a score of ten unless they were truly outstanding not just better but in a whole different league. It is a grade reserved for the likes of if I may indulge in a little subjectivity Tarkovsky's Stalker Kitano's HanaBi In the Mood for Love' by Wong Karwai Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc Ozu's Tokyo Story and very few others. It is more than mere technical brilliance topclass acting superb plot or camerawork. What each of these films possesses is sheer humanity simultaneously painful and lifeaffirming.Eureka deserves to stand proudly in such company for Eureka is a film that is so human it makes most others seem either shallow overwrought or just pretentious. Eureka's plot is a simple its action dialog and soundtrack is sparse camera movement is minimal. The sepiatoned photography is indeed a marvel to look at and each of the actors performs with such restrained naturalness that they don't seem like performances at all. The result is a film that is less like a story being told and more like an experience that is undergone or a journey shared. If there is any 'art' involved it is in producing a film so fragile yet so accessible so desperately and painfully human out of material so grueling and alien to most of us fortunate viewers. And in this respect the movement of Eureka mirrors that of the protagonists the three traumatised survivors of a bloody bus highjacking. They are a brother and sisterand the bus driver himself. In the wake of the tragedy after some months of wandering and inactivity they are drawn back together and set out on a bus.As may be gathered this film is very much about the aftermath of tragedy about how certain experiences may mark one off from the rest of society and how with silence stillness and human company and most importantly the passing of time some form of healing may be glimpsed. And it is just a glimpse. Though the final scene is indeed moving there is no big payoff anymore than there might be in life itself. There is only the artistry of the film itself to transfigure the story and it does this with such quiet unobtrusive sympathy that to call it 'artistry' seems almost to malign it. I haven't seen Aoyama's other films so I can't say whether he is destined for a Tarkovsky Dreyer or Ozulike elevation to the cinematic pantheon but this film is a refreshing example of the kind of deep humanity of the best directors the best artists one that marks a perfect 10 off from all the rest.".

	schema:headline " A beautiful meditation on the problem of evil";
	schema:reviewBody "Eureka tells an enormously soul searching and moving story about three people's attempt to find meaning and purpose after experiencing a grizzly busjack i.e. a bus hijack. Thus its subject matter and the problem with which it deals is as old as philosophy itself finding meaning and hope in a world where such senseless acts of violence and evil occurs. The three characters are Kozue girl and Naoki boy who are middle school aged siblings and Makoto who is the driver of the hijacked bus. They are eventually joined by the children's collegeaged uncle Akihiko who also provides some memorable comedic moments. There's not too much dialog in Eureka as Kozue and Naoki are mute throughout much of the film as a result of their trauma but we can sense the confusing and searing emotions that lie just beneath their silence. Director Shinji Aoyama wisely lets the story and the characters unfold  develop at a very deliberate and slow pace eschewing quick cutting and montage in favor of carefully crafted compositions within the vast cinemascope frame. Due to its realistic style at times Eureka feels like a documentary. Having said this however I can also say confidently that many will be put off by Eureka simply due to its epic running time  3 hours 37 minutes minus the credits. But let me just remark personally that although it is long Eureka definitely feels a lot shorter after it's over than most 2 hour Hollywood films. In fact I don't think that Eureka would have worked as a 2 hour filmfor roughly the same reason that a Reader's Digest version of War and Peace wouldn't be as powerful as the fulllength novel. Don't get me wrong Eureka is demanding this is a thinking person's film but it is not overly daunting. This is a daring film that asks a lot of its viewers but which delivers much by way of emotional payoff to those who persevere. Eureka eventually turns into a kind of existential road movie as the four characters try to start over by taking a trip on Makoto's new bus. And although I won't give it away Eureka has an ending that is truly beautiful quietly moving and charged with a glimmer of hope. Finally although it is rarely heard in the film the original musical score by Aoyama and Isao Yamada really adds emotional resonance whenever it plays. It's unforgettable and simultaneously beautiful and elegiac. Overall I consider Eureka to be a great example of humanistic filmmaking in the tradition of Kurosawa and Ozu. Only time will tell whether or not it will be considered a masterpiece but in my book Shinji Aoyama has created one of the truly unforgettable films of 2001.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amazing film.  The reviews posted   at the time of this writing  on the IMDb page are sad because I don't think the writers were ready for what kind of movie it is. Stephen Holden's pan in the New York Times is especially foolhardy and thoughtless. It helped to have a little advanced word in order to brace myself. As it stands it should have defeated Dancer in the Dark at Cannes last year handily. And if I see a better movie this year it'll be something for the history books.It's not for the faint of heart. It's three hours and thirtyseven minutes long in black and white and in Japanese. And it's very slowmoving. The cinematography is beautiful but that may not be enough for folks to hack through nearly four hours.But the extreme length and slowness is not unjustified. It opens with a horrifying traumatic event that provides an emotional undercurrent that informs the remainder of the story in much the same way as Saving Private Ryan did let that not discourage the antiSpielbergers and as the film progresses the event becomes a memory part of the characters' and ours too. And the slowness isn't really slowness  it's the playing out of events and interactions as they would happen in real time the story spans a few months I believe perhaps even a year and maybe more.What's the freaking story? I hear you ask...well here goes. The opening sequence which will undoubtedly inspire comparisons and contrasts to The Sweet Hereafter as will the entire film shows the hijacking of a commuter bus by a businessman pushed over the edge. As the scene unfolds he has already killed a few passengers the police are surrounding the bus and he has used newspapers to block all the windows.Without revealing too much the bus driver and two teens  a brother and a sister  survive the incident. The driver Koji Yakusho star of Shall We Dance? and The Eel is shaken deeply and leaves his brother and parents to wander. The youths' mother runs off with another man and their father dies soon after in an auto accident  with insurance payments they can live but there is no one to watch over them.I could go into more of the plot  and most critics will I'm sure  but that isn't really necessary. The key to the movie is that the events seem to be played out as they would in real life and that the movie camera just happens to be there to catch them and tell the story. Sure this is the goal of all narrative films but with Eureka the process seems to have been reinvented and renewed. The film is longer than most but not a moment is wasted it's one of the most efficiently edited movies I've ever seen. Every shot nuance glance spoken word everything has a reason for being.There are some who say the movie is too somber too gloomy. It isn't really. It's somber sure but it doesn't strain for it. There is humor  deadpan mostly  and great joy too. And if you love great cinema there is even greater joy!".

I have had such feelings twice in recent months from Japanese cinema first with Koreeda's wondrous After Life and now with Aoyama's Eureka. Not every film that affects me in this way is a masterpiece like After Life. Some like The Piano Teacher melodramatically rely on their power to disturb. I suppose Eureka comes somewhere between lacking perhaps the formal perfection of a recent masterwork such as the Vietnamese At the Height of the Summer but enveloping me in a way that I found far more engrossing. How else to explain two viewings on consecutive days of a film of enormous length 3.5 hours that I was never once tempted to fast forward! The answer must lie partly in the mesmerizing power of the story it tells partly with the involvement I feel with the characters and partly in the way the director has created a highly personal vision of a complete world. Basically Eureka is about the traumas of three survivors of a bus hijacking the driver and a teenaged brother and sister pair of passengers that has resulted in the massacre of all the others involved. After a prelude depicting the cathartic event that triggered their emotion turmoil we home into their lives two years further on. The bus driver unable to find any resolution to his mental and physical state through involvement with his own family seeks out the youngsters whose family life has been ruined with a view to expiating his guilt as a survivor by helping them in whatever way he can. Eventually he buys a bus on which they can embark on a journey possibly to escape what has happened to them a journey with most of the odds stacked against it as he is in failing health a parasitic intruder has to be taken on board in the form of the teenagers' basically unsympathetic cousin and their travels take place against a disturbing background of several killings of young women. Thus after nearly two hours into Eureka we are experiencing a road movie with a destination so hazily defined it is hard to believe it will ever be reached. Only two of the protagonists make it to a conclusion where the soft almost sepiatoned photography suddenly bursts into colour suggesting a transforming redemption. On a first viewing I was puzzled by the denouement of the serial killings which seemed psychologically if not physiologically outlandish but I have come to accept this as one tragic consequence of trauma in a masterly work that so successfully fuses elements of great films as diverse as L'Avventura and Kings of the Road with something of the singleminded gaze of that greatest of living directors Theo Angelopoulos.".

If you are looking for the definition of that art you wouldn't just findbecause it doesn't exist. You have to see this movie to venture into the world which is way beyond cinema and storytelling.Each character has just defied the very fabric of artificial situations that are cinematic and have stepped into the horizons of real world much real that what we see now. Shiniji's brilliance is not only in the way he picked up the situation and silhouetted it with ever so beautiful backdrop but also in that fact that he hasn't compromised on the lines of letting the movie talk with its aura of silence. Many great directors would have been tempted to use the brilliant characters of Naoki and Kozue to speak up their frustrationa usual ploy in American and European Cinema to reassure their directorial capabilities but Shiniji's belief in the movie and its characters was much more intense than both his audience and himself.Now a little about the movie. Eureka centrally addresses the condensed emotions of people who go through a catastrophe which might not be fatal physically but is absolutely draining mentally. The eventual darkness of body and mind that leads such people to imagine heinous crimes like murder without knowing the true essence of its legitimacy. It deals with complete disintegration of human psyche to unwanted darkness. But it also shows the inevitability of human victory of life and happiness over death and darkness. Eureka tours the human roadmap of complete disillusionment and back to reclaim its lost grounds.Naoki and Kozue though being kids display a true situation that can drive even kids to craziness. Though not being dumb words have not been their respite. The killing emptiness within woven with their apathetic vocals drilled them to their core and they became immune to popular practice of existence. Talking and involving with others were a waste for nothing in the world could bring them what they lost. And if you ask what they lost they cant describe it I cant describe it and neither can Shiniji. We can only feel it.Makoto together with the kids was also a subject to the catastrophe. It hit him so hard mentally that he lost himself to isolation. But he regrouped and returned to his home just to find that things have changed around him he could not justify but accepted it because he could find himself a reason to it. He visits the kids and they form a small family in which no one has to say that they care for each other they just have to feel.I can go on for this movie for the rest of my life but if you are alive you will see it.".

The movie moves along at a snail's pace on Sunday  at 90 minutes most movies are just coming to their explosive and or dramatic climax but at that point I was still wondering what Eureka was about. 2 hours later the movie finally finishes  and I was still wondering what it was all about. EUREKA is a movie of epic length that raises other challenging questions like Why is it 3.5 hours long? Why is it black and white? Is this all going somewhere? and Is it nearly finished yet?. Clearly director Shinji Aoyama wants his movie to make us think. And in 3.5 hours of black and white imagery and minimal dialogue your mind certainly does have ample opportunity to wander. Maybe I should have checked the Director's Statement that is included on the UK DVD before watching the movie. Then I'd have known what he was trying to say and could have spent my time deciding if he said it effectively instead. Whether that would have been more fun or less I don't know though.Not to say that I didn't enjoy watching EUREKA  for most of the run time I did. It's very well acted has some good cinematography and is generally quite unusual. I'd have preferred it to have been shorter though or had more going on  even colour photography would have helped to keep my attention on the screen with a little less effort. I do think it's a good movie though but... it just didn't need to be 3.5 hours to make its point or build its characters. Or maybe it did need 3.5 hours to do that but Shinji Aoyama used his time badly  because at the end I still didn't really have a grasp on who the characters were 'deep down' or what the point of sharing their story with us was. Perhaps it's just that it's a movie aimed for better minds than mine to truly appreciate though. Certainly the length and style are going to keep any hopes of mainstream appreciation at bay.".

But there were many other close calls which could have proved fatal as well.First let's talk about the colour. Just because a movie is shot in bw doesn't mean that it is magically elevated to artistic status. On the contrary I feel that modern bw film must earn its right to be bw. This movie failed in that department. There is no use of shadows sharpness or contrast which are the primary appeals of the monochrome medium. Instead the whole movie has a soupy fuzzy bleached appearance like an old VCR tape that you left on the dashboard for too long.Obviously the director was trying to make a statement with this visually unappealing use of browns. If the movie were any shorter than 3.5 hours then I could have forgiven it. But unfortunately it didn't make the cut.Next let's talk about theme. Sure it has a compelling theme sort of like the other Japanese film from the same year Suicide Club dealing with the contagious nature of evil. I do have to give this film applause for handling the subject much more poetically than the pop trash flick Suicide Club. Yet I have to turn around and fault the director for dragging the same message out for too long. The effect was a watering down of an otherwise powerful message. Again we tip from magnificent to annoying.Lastly I'll mention some of the cinematic techniques and scene compositions. In a word wow. There are a few shots which must've taken 100 takes to get them right and with that I am impressed. But you have to realize that I am impressed simply as a film nerd who looks for that sort of thing. Beyond the gimmickery of a wow shot to impress the film nerds I didn't see much poetic meaning to these indulgent scenes. Quite often they went nowhere. Unlike Tarr Werckmeister harmnik or Bresson Pickpocket or even Hitchcock Rope who used long scenes to build momentum to a miniature climax each time this director uses long scenes which ultimately lose coherence and end on a totally meaningless note. Another reviewer compared this film to Tarkovsky and I have to say that's right on the mark both directors share the same annoying tendency to film things that don't necessarily relate to the work but are simply neato things to do like Tarkovsky's obsession with zooming in on peoples' earlobes for 23 minutes.I love Japanese cinema. I love the challenging philosophy of films like Rashmon the poetic complexity of films like ShikiJitsu and above all the focused clarity of films like Warai No Daigaku. Japanese cinema is art with a backbone. Unfortunately this film lacks that backbone which has been the defining characteristic since the days of Kurosawa. Without it the film becomes just another desultory rambling impressionistic soup.Unless you're a big fan of Tarkovsky Paradjanov and other ambling Russian directors I advise you to avoid this film. If on the other hand you like your films orchestrated and carefully designed  la Kurosawa Orson Welles Robert Bresson or even the latter day greats Wim Wenders and Takeshi Kitano then skip this and instead spend your 3.5 hours trying to hunt down a copy of Kwaidan by Kobayashi.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to write a review of Eureka without mentioning its extreme running time.  At 3 hours and 37 minutes director Shinji Aoyama takes his time to tell a story of new beginnings following an indefinite and stagnant period of trauma.  Given the subject matter however Eureka would not have the same effect had it been told in 2 hours.  This is a movie about 3 characters each in different stages of a recovery process and to afford them less time to do so would be unfair.Eureka opens with two teenage siblings Kozue and Naoki played by reallife sister and brother Aoi Miyazaki and Masaru Miyazaki boarding a bus.  Right after the last of the opening credits the scene jump cuts to a jarring shot of a bloodstained hand the camera moving away to reveal a corpse in the middle of a parking lot with the bus in the background. Within a few moments we realize that one of the passengers has taken the bus driver and Kozue and Naoki hostage after having killed the other passengers and before being gunned down himself by a SWAT team.This traumatic incident renders both children mute and the bus driver Makoto played by Koji Yakusho restless and nomadic.  2 years pass and Makoto seeks out Kozue and Naoki after finding out that their father has died and their mother has abandoned them leaving them to fend for themselves. The children permit Makoto to stay with them and he fulfills the role of father figure.  They are later joined by a collegeage cousin Akihiko played by Yoichiro Saito checking up on the children during a semester break.  Akihiko's presence provides Eureka with interesting chracter dynamics given the fact that up until his arrival Makoto does not have anyone to talk to since the two children are mute.  What follows is an existential road trip once Makoto decides to get his life back on track by purchasing a small bus and inviting the kids on a journey of promise and healing.Probably the best asset of Eureka is the camera placement.  This movie is a series of long takes and long shots.  There are few if any closeup shots of the characters.  Normally I find this style of filmmaking challenging and frustrating since it places us away from the characters but it works very well here.  The long shots do place us away from the characters but at the same time we are given enough room to interpret what we see on the screen.  It is a different kind of documentary technique than the more closeup and sharply edited documentary style present in Amores Perros another movie from this year that I consider to be a masterpiece but it is no less effective here in Eureka.  It is also mandatory that I mention the lush blackandwhite cinematography as well.Eureka certainly demands the viewer to keep his or her attention span intact.  The long takes of each scene as well as the long periods without dialogue take some getting used to but eventually hopefully the viewer will find himselfherself in the film's rhythm.  Trust me the viewer will be rewarded by slowly being transported into the characters' world.  After spending 3 hours and 37 minutes with Makoto Akihiko Kozue and Naoki they will feel like new and dear acquaintances.".

I was quite moved  to the point of tears  by the end. It looks and feels like no other movie I've seen shot in a shifting sepia tone with very little dialogue and long silent takes. It's an intimate epic. Sort of a Japanese version of a Terrence Malick film. A young brother and sister and a bus driver are the only survivors of a random busjacking by a madman. The three retreat from the world. But two years later the bus driver seeks out the brother and sister  living alone and mute despite their youth  and the long slow process of healing begins. As much as I liked a lot of it certain plot twists felt clunky or heavy handed as did some of the dialogue. A movie so based in unspoken emotion loses something when the themes suddenly become too literal in word or action. But those are things that might bother me less on a second viewing when I was more prepared for this unique odd challenging film.".

There are moments of depth colour and real warmth to this section of the film which were largely lost later on.In the end while this film is beautifully rendered from end to end and largely dramatically satisfying at some point the director and editor between them just lost a sense of the movement of the whole piece and got obsessed with fully fleshing out every aspect of every reflection of every character. This is still a niggle more than a catastrophic issue but it does reduce the impact of the dramatic conclusions.I'm not sure honestly where this film fits but if you are looking for a very long immersive experience of visual beauty and a rich steady poetic form of film it's undeniably excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "Shinji Aoyama's Eureka concerns three people branded by a traumatic event a busjack who then try to cope with their issues by reliving the path with a new bus. The protagonists are two siblings Naoki and Kazue mute ever since the accident and the bus driver Makoto. Eureka is a fascinating but exhausting experience  it lasts over 35 hours.It is shot in a sepia tone for its entirety except for the very final shot which is in color. In the end Makoto and Kazue overcome their scarred past and start a new life. The scene where Kazue throws away some shells named after the most influential people in her life thus making way for rebirth is followed by an enlightenment of sorts both in the terms of transition from sepia to color and from traumatic stress to a better life. This may be why this movie is called Eureka. The flow of the movie is very meditative and memorable. There are many moments of pure silence and of little to no action. It moves very slow but has a hypnotic ring to it and you can't help but feel drawn to it after being confused in the beginning. Aoyama uses multiple repetitive or cyclical patterns all throughout the seesawresembling thing by the window constantly going up and down Makoto turning the lamp on and off continuously or the scene where he drives around and around on his bike with Naoki. It all seems very realistic and like a window to someone's life and in the end makes you feel a lot more for the characters not to mention the acting is excellent as well. The performances are just incredible.Aoyama's movie contains many panoramic shots which stay still for a long time and follow the characters around but there are also many recurring motifs like bottles of water or the starry decoration hanging by the rear bus window. Some shots are unforgettable like the one at the beginning when the busjacker points the gun at the children with his dying breath. The occasional scenes with strong dramatic value are made even more powerful by the movie's slow pace. The music isn't always there but when it is it fits the scenes beautifully with its celestial atmospheric quality.Eureka does go on for a bit too long but it is truly one of the most unique cinematic experiences you'll encounter. It's a film well worth watching if you have time to kill or are into slowpaced movies.9510".

But nobody seems able to tell me WHY it is so long. There is one scene where the bus pulls out of a diner's car park and drives up the road that extends into the distance over the hill and out of sight. Fixed camera wide shot no cuts. It takes 2 minutes 40 seconds  why? We know where the bus is going and the frame is not particularly interesting to look at. Maybe there is a deeper meaning to such antiediting statements that I am missing but it looks like Aoyama just couldn't be bothered cutting the thing properly. Two stars for the cinematography.".

It's about Marcela a South American living in Spain and facing mild discrimination because she's an immigrant taking jobs away from Spaniards. She lives with Nelson. Nelson is a man with a plan he's got a gang of guys who steal dead flowers from the garbage heap then Nelson cleans them up and sells them to local wandering flower sellers. His goal is to have a real flower shop he's working out of their oneroom apartment with delivery trucks. He plans to call the store Marcela's Flowers.However they aren't making enough money to pay the rent and their refrigerator breaks down. So Marcela takes a job looking after a dying man named Amador. Amador and Marcela have some conversations as time goes by and he tells her his theory of life which she rejects out of hand. Then a problem arises. Amador dies. Marcela is to be paid at the end of each month she looks after Amador and he didn't live even that long. She needs the whole month's wage to pay off the new refrigerator. Marcela decides to just continue as if Amador were alive intending to collect the full month's pay on the assumption that his daughter won't come back to visit which is entirely possible then worry about the discovery of his longdead body when that time comes.The great thing about the movie is Marcela's growth during this time of trouble. Magaly Solier plays Marcela and she's wonderful as the poor immigrant who needs money and can't get a break. The key to the story is Amador's putting together of a picture puzzle another thing that Marcela rejects why not just buy the picture  it's the same thing? However Amador's rejected advice includes the idea that you have all the pieces of the puzzle of your life handed to you at birth and you just have to figure out what they are and put them together to see the big picture. Watching Marcela puzzle through her life in those few weeks is sad humorous and heartening. Director Fernando Leon de Aranoa does a very good job with a very good cast. He also wrote the screenplay. I highly recommend this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is undoubtedly the best film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own work a wry fable free of the leaden polemics that so marred Things To Come.Roland Young  who played the title character to mischievous ghosts Cary Grant and Constance Bennett in the 1937 comedy Topper  is outstanding as George Fotheringay a mousy store clerk who must come to grips with the sudden gift of almost unlimited power. He can literally do anything  except change the human heart as he finds when he commands his beautiful coworker Ada to fall madly in love with him and she merely laughs in his face. Incidentally George is Wells' middle name and Roland Young bears more than a little resemblance to a younger H.G.Mischa Spoliansky's score is by turns droll and lighthearted complementing the story perfectly as George struggles to make sense of his newfound abilities. He learns the danger of an unguarded word when he tells an officious constable who wants to run him in for disturbing the peace to go to blazes leading to a hilarious bit in which the constable finding himself instantaneously transported to the nether regions of brimstone and hellfire tries to keep calm and take notes about the incident while his notepad smolders. Fortunately George isn't the vindictive type. As soon as he realizes what he's done he rescues Constable Plod from the Inferno. Although just to be on the safe side and give him some time to cool off George also teleports him to San Francisco.Since he makes no secret of his miracleworking George is bombarded with advice from his coworkers and various worthies on how he should use his powers. His boss wants to sign him to an exclusive contract establishing a chain of miracle stores featuring instantaneous delivery with free healing clinics offered on Tuesdays and Fridays to allay George's discomfort with exploiting his talent solely for monetary gain.Mr. Maydig  a Baptist minister and amateur philosopher played to prim perfection by gaunt character actor Ernest Thesiger  advises George to bring the Millennium to end war and disease and poverty. George cooperates with Maydig to the extent of fulfilling a Biblical prophecy converting the prized antique cutlery collection belonging to a local representative of the gentry Sir Ralph Richardson into what his butler describes with a visible shudder as agricultural implements. Even worse at Maydig's insistence George adds injury to insult by turning all of Colonel Winstanley's fine whiskey into nonalcoholic temperance water. The butler George Zucco gets another of the best lines in the movie. Accused of having done something to the Colonel's tipple he's the picture of wounded innocence as he responds Sir! I'd as soon poison a baby as tamper with good whiskey!Next morning after meeting George and seeing further proof of his unlimited power the Colonel naturally concludes this mildseeming clerk is a dire threat to the established order. Taking matters into his own hands Winstanley almost succeeds in assassinating George triggering the climactic sequence in which George declares himself invulnerable and immortal and decides he will remake the world to his own plan starting now.What happens next is too weird and wonderful for me to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film except to observe that it's not the typical absolute power corrupts absolutely denouement that modern viewers have come to expect. The Man Who Could Work Miracles is a wise funny and humane comment on the human psyche a film which can be enjoyed many times and still seem fresh with each viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "What would a world without want be like?  The answer has been the subject of countless stories not a few movies  every sensitive soul's nighttime sighing for ages.  H. G. Wells poses the question by having godlike beings give a department store clerk George McWhirter Fotheringay that ability  watching it evolve as he bounces from adviser to adviser from the sexy girl he desires to a retired British Army man.The film is a treat especially for those of us accustomed to  maybe a little bored by the Star Trek treatment of absolute power conferred on lowly mortals.  I don't know much about the history of science fiction in the movies but Wells goes about everything he wrote the script based on his novel with the fabulous in mind while adding purely scifi touches which I won't give away.Fotheringay is no bleedingheart aching to turn the world into a painless utopia nor is he a selfish powerhungry perve but a nondescript man who takes his time to figure out just what has happened to him before bringing everything to a head.  In the meantime we're given what amounts to a funny English comedy of manners as well as a peek into a time  place where science fiction took a different direction.  For example if you found out you had miraculous powers would you tell anyone?  I don't think I would.   if you told anyone wouldn't you imagine the authorities pouncing on you at the first opportunity?  Not so in 1930's Essex!The ending seems Gene Roddenberryesque  perhaps the Star Trek creator admired  shared Wells' humanism but the film shines with neato special effects some cool stuff for the time  a wonderful performance by Roland Young.  A mustsee for those who like their scifi earthbound  thoughtprovoking.My subject line by the way refers to anarchy as a form of government in which there are no governments just selfgovernment I don't mean it in the common usage of disorder or chaos.  The movie touches on the idea that without their lives being controlled by those in power who have a vested interest in people needing money  goods people might find other ways to spend their time  like for example in creation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay much has already been discussed about the philosophical merits of this film and the deep profound underlying morals within and the gentle yet omnipresent humour laced throughout The Man Who Could Work Miracles. I agree it is there but to varying degrees of success. Who knew H. G. Wells did the script himselfI didn't know he was even still alive then. Because he did you knew it would have some kind of social message  and it does. What would we do if given complete absolute power? Can mankind given this power effectively change? Will mankind come to some communal consent as to the betterment of the species as a whole? Well being the true Machiavellian at heart philosophically that I am  I knew the answers to these questions as posed by Wells who by this time in his life seeing Europe yet again on the fringe of war in 1936 must have come to the same conclusions. But Wells to his credit leaves the viewer the opportunity to decide what heshe thinks with little prodding from the script. While the movie has a lot of hokey dialog and contrived plot sequences I enjoyed it overall and its message of  whatever it is to you goes here. The acting is charming at the very least. Roland Young is always good and he portrays Mr. Farthingay with great affability and anonymity. Young is one of the best things about the movie as he stumbles in his fashion through the dialog and the scenes with calculating indifference as only he can do. The supporting cast is ably aided with the likes of Ralph Richardson Joan Gardner Joan Hickson George Zucco and as two godlike spirits watching earth  George Sanders looking incredibly young and Torin Thatcherfrom The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad fame. The best outside of Young is Earnest Thesiger from The Bride of Frankenstein and The Old Dark House fame playing a minister named Mr. Maydig who wants Young to do only good beneficial things for mankind  at least it appears so ostensibly. No one and I mean no one can deliver a line like Thesiger! Words from his mouth are music to my ears. There are some problems with the film. Much of it comes off as forced and not very amusing. The script ends really in a muddle of a mess. How about the ridiculous music and the title sequence at the beginning of the film. What was up with that huh? But despite these shortcomings see The Man Who Could Work Miracles for what it is  a thought picture that has a message presented in a lighthearted fashion.".

He doesn't know where he got the powers from or why and at first he doesn't use them for anything more than simple tricks. Gradually he starts to realize the gift he's been given and decides to use his power for the greater good. But he isn't sure how to do this so he consults several respected men in the community and gets wildly different suggestions. A delightful fantasy comedy with a script cowritten by H.G. Wells adapted from one of his short stories. It's leisurelypaced and welldirected. Amazing special effects for the time particularly when you consider this wasn't a Hollywood production. Roland Young wearing a toupee is perfectly cast. I can't imagine another actor from this time playing this part so well. The rest of the cast is terrific with a few recognizable faces in the mix including Ernest Thesiger and in a small role George Zucco. Ralph Richardson steals the show as a blowhard colonel quite put out by Fotheringay's miracles. A shirtless George Sanders plays one of the 'gods.' One of my favorite scenes is when Fotheringay tells a policeman to go to blazes and winds up sending the man to Hell! The policeman's reaction while there and Fotheringay's subsequent attempt to fix the situation are hilarious.Reportedly Wells intended the film to be more preachy like his script for Things to Come the year before. But thankfully director Lothar Mendes and coscreenwriter Lajos Bir chose to focus more on the comedy and getting the points across that way. The result is a funny movie but with some big ideas that gives you a lot to think about.".

To us he usually played an impeccable gentleman usually of diffident uncertain and shy personality but occasionally showing a roguish personality as Uncle Willy in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY or an unscrupulous villainous one as Uriah Heep in David COPPERFIELD or even a murderous one as in the killer in THE GREAT LOVER. His best remembered starring part was as the spooked banker Cosmo Topper in three movies but his best performance may well have been as George Fotheringay in this film THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES. In this film he was the average little man  the man in the street if you will who is given extraordinary powers by the Gods and proceeds to demonstrate how human beings cannot handle great power. H. G. Wells' amusing fantasy shows how power without wisdom or control is never a safe commodity. Young is the sort of person we meet everyday. He is harmless. He is acceptable. He is forgettable. In short he is one of us. He is unable to even make a dent with a girl he's interested in Joan Gardner. But once he gets power he can't succeed in doing much with it. He is able to frighten some friends in a pub during a philosophical chat. He can cause personal amusement and enjoyment in his room but it does annoy the landlady particularly all of the animals he now has for pets. He tries to find a fast way of ending poverty by creating money out of the air  much to the dismay of the local banker Laurence Hanray. He tries to rid the world of weapons much to the anger of the local military man Ralph Richardson in heavy makeup. Richardson is also annoyed that his liquor is now juice or cider. In the end stalked by Richardson and the others who find more to fear than to accept in Young's sudden powers Young decides he has to protect himself. He makes himself master of the world but when he decides to show himself as the center of the universe by stopping the earth's rotation he nearly destroys the earth. Only sheer accident prevents total disaster.The film is not flawless. When Young makes himself world dictator he tells off the rulers of the world whom he has brought together at his new court that they like the furs and feathers they wear. This is typical of Wells  he always thinks that the finery and trappings of power are the goals of powerful people and not a side issue. It is even pushed to extremes in his other scripted film THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME when Ralph Richardson as the Boss wears a costume of furs and feathers. Young also lacks real imagination which is an odd lapse for Wells. His common man heroes like Mr. Polly do have a degree of imagination. Fotheringay's idea of economic curing is to wave his hand and out pops a ten pound note to the dismay of the banker who starts talking about inflation!. But he could do it on the sly passing flawless cash around by mail without any problems. He's just not swift enough to do it quietly.But that is a minor quibble. The film is on the whole a joy as fantasy and as a field day for Roland Young. I give it a 10 as an example of exciting cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit to a soft spot for this film which is very probably the best movie version of an H.G. Wells story ever done. Not surprisingly the writer was still around when it was made and was involved in the production.Today many people regard Wells as a sciencefiction writer but he was also a historian and philosopher. The Man Who Could Work Miracles is more of a fantasyparable on the subject of power and the human condition than it is science fiction. Nevertheless Alexander Korda had his production company go all out in the depiction of the film's miracles. They are still effective despite the fact that this film dates from 1936.The story of what happens when an anonymous nobody is suddenly given absolute power to do anything still resonates. The setting may be 1930s England but the attitudes of the sort of characters with whom the protagonist interacts would probably be little different today. After all businessmen still think like businessmen bankers like bankers clergymen like clergymen policemen like policemen and soldiers like soldiers. In that regard the world hasn't really changed all that much a fact that would have come as little surprise to Wells. Considering the plethora of special effects it seems somewhat surprising that this film has never been remade. That's not to say that this production could probably be bettered. Roland Young is spot on as the common vulgar fellow upon whom absolute power is suddenly and randomly bestowed. The only possible complaint with casting him in the part is that he may perhaps have been a bit too to play someone the other characters are constantly addressing as Young Man. The other members of the cast are likewise excellent particularly Ralph Richardson in a hilarious turn as Colonel Winstanley the character who inspired cartoonist David Low's Colonel Blimp.To anyone who has never seen this movie I can only recommend that you take the first opportunity that presents itself to see it. Despite the passing of years since it was produced The Man Who Could Work Miracles remains unique.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every time somebody somewhere publishes one of their 100 BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME I look hopefully to see if this film made the list  finally?  and have been disappointed so often that I no longer try. The good news? The production team took an HG WELLS classic  a very tricky writer to bring to the screen if you consider how many times they have fumbled his time machine story  and nailed it the very first time. Yes I know it is Black and White and the Special Effects are the best you can do for 1931 and the only real name is Richardson's but PSHAW I say. These criticisms are trivial. The script the adaption is nothing short of brilliant. The direction is brilliant bringing a sort of friendly whimsy to a story which on its surface more properly belongs in an AGENT OF SHIELD episode. After all this is about a normal everyday man granted ABSOLUTE POWER. The acting is superb Roland Young fit the bill perfectly. He was known for playing meek characters and through his career the only other major role that cinephiles remember him for is Topper. In case you have NOT seen this I don't want to spoil it for you other than to say that this may be be the only chance you will ever get to enjoy this wonderfully presented morality tale in its purest form. The reason for this caution is that to the best of my information the Wells family has over the years consistently refused to sell the rights no matter how much money was thrown at them. It appears they belong to the school of thought which suggests if something is done right first time there is no need to do it again. The scene in particular where Young's character becomes so befuddled dealing with the quirks of the world's leaders that he literally stops the planet from spinning is priceless and unforgettable. And BTW the way Young's character deals with his secret crush Joan Gardner playing Ada Price would be as irksome to the fairer sex today as it no doubt was then. The only difference is that today it is easier to voice your complaints. One of the best films ever done of one of the best stories ever written.".

After all this is about a normal everyday man granted ABSOLUTE POWER. The acting is superb Roland Young fit the bill perfectly. He was known for playing meek characters and through his career the only other major role that cinephiles remember him for is Topper. In case you have NOT seen this I don't want to spoil it for you other than to say that this may be be the only chance you will ever get to enjoy this wonderfully presented morality tale in its purest form. The reason for this caution is that to the best of my information the Wells family has over the years consistently refused to sell the rights no matter how much money was thrown at them. It appears they belong to the school of thought which suggests if something is done right first time there is no need to do it again. The scene in particular where Young's character becomes so befuddled dealing with the quirks of the world's leaders that he literally stops the planet from spinning is priceless and unforgettable. And BTW the way Young's character deals with his secret crush Joan Gardner playing Ada Price would be as irksome to the fairer sex today as it no doubt was then. The only difference is that today it is easier to voice your complaints. One of the best films ever done of one of the best stories ever written.";

Wells story about a mild mannered typical Englishman Roland Young who suddenly discovers he has the gift of miracle giving. Basically most of it is magic i.e. turning lamps upside down raising beds off the floor erasing freckles off of a coworker but as he realizes the consequences of the power he has having sent a British policeman off to blazes then to San Francisco which alerts the world to something afoot he begins to get a bit carried away. He finds he can't make the girl he loves fall in love with him but he can turn whiskey into temperance water and weaponry into agricultural gear. As more people find out about his gift he begins to go off to places like a reallife Austrian gentleman was doing over in Germany....Three mystics wearing more glossy foundation than Tammy Fay Baker are the ones responsible revealing that H.G. Wells had some interesting theories about the world outside of our own and some ideas that may not have pleased Christians. Having worked with London films on Things to Come Wells is certainly a great storyteller of the supernatural. Young best known for his role as Cosmo Topper in three films gives an excellent performance as the man gifted beyond reason. Ralph Ricardson is also outstanding as the military man whose booze is tampered with. George Sanders is instantly recognizable as one of the three mystics. This film has many comedy elements but is a serious look of humanity and what kinds of harm human failing can bring on if power falls into the wrong hands. Can you imagine the impact this could have if updated towards today? With all the advancements particularly in technology the world has seen in the past 75 years since this was made not bit by bit as the immortals think it should be there is a great message and warning that could be told if the film were to be made correctly with the author's intentions.".

One of the gods to prove a point points a finger at George McWhirter Fotheringay Roland Young out at night en route to a pub.George frankly doesn't do much with his new gift. He turns a lamp upside down makes kittens and rabbits and fruit appear cleans up his station at the haberdashery where he works takes away a coworker's Joan Hickson freckles dresses the beautiful Ada Joan Gardner in jewels  his goals don't seem very lofty. The only thing he can't do is change people.George seeks advice from several people his boss who wants George to harness his power only for the store Ada who believes he should heal people and finally a vicar Maydig Ernest Thesiger who says We'll start the Golden Age tomorrow afternoon  an age in which there would be no disease no want for funds no war. To which George asks yes but what will people DO?This is a delightful film that raises obvious questions which the viewer has to answer for oneself. The god at the end of the film sums up my feeling. Nothing changes overnight if they change at all.Standouts in the film are Young Thesiger and of course Ralph Richardson as a colonel whom the vicar wants stripped of his sword collection and his alcohol. When he finds out that he's sober because of George he wants to kill him. George Zucco is his butler uttering the immortal words Oh sir I'd sooner poison a baby than tamper with the alcohol.Joan Hickson known to millions as Miss Marple was a young character woman here and plays Effie. Joan Gardner was discovered by the film's director Alexander Korda and actually married his brother Zoltan in 1930. She retired shortly after this film and stayed married to Korda until his death in 1961.Roland Young does an excellent job as a common man in an extraordinary circumstance. He has a slightly confused vulnerable quality.Wells was prescient in many things and his ideas always thought provoking. The Man Who Could Work Miracles is no exception. Exceptional special effects for its time and an intriguing story make this film something to see.".

He tries all sorts  he conjures up a rose bush in the middle of the road he sends a policeman to hell then has a change of heart and sends him to San Francisco instead he changes the Colonel Winstanley's Ralph Richardson whiskey to water makes himself invincible so that when Winstanley shoots him he doesn't die etc. However he cannot make the woman he fancies love him. Eventually he creates a palace filled with the celebrities of the day and orders them to change the world for him. However this has disastrous consequences as he goes a step too far.The film starts well and is quite amusing as Fotheringay discovers his powers and starts working a few miracles as described above. However it loses it's pace and becomes quite wordy. We don't want all the chitchat  we want to see more miracles. Also the cast aren't very good. Roland Young is fine in the lead role but unfortunately Ralph Richardson gives one of those obvious British twit performances as the Colonel and this makes the film drag. He's meant to be funny but provides no humour at all. The women are especially insipid in this film.It starts well and even though it seems to go nowhere for a while it's still enjoyable. It will also leave you thinking what you would do if you had the powers to make anything happen.".

However this has disastrous consequences as he goes a step too far.The film starts well and is quite amusing as Fotheringay discovers his powers and starts working a few miracles as described above. However it loses it's pace and becomes quite wordy. We don't want all the chitchat  we want to see more miracles. Also the cast aren't very good. Roland Young is fine in the lead role but unfortunately Ralph Richardson gives one of those obvious British twit performances as the Colonel and this makes the film drag. He's meant to be funny but provides no humour at all. The women are especially insipid in this film.It starts well and even though it seems to go nowhere for a while it's still enjoyable. It will also leave you thinking what you would do if you had the powers to make anything happen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Wells put a great deal of his hopeful philosophy as well as his despair into this fantasy. He seems to have expressed the hope more than once that if the world's VIPs could be assembled around a big table peacefully they could create the conditions for Utopia without too much trouble. In this tale with Fotheringay's miracles he shows that even if that could be achieved there is inertia to contend with. Utopia cannot be achieved in an afternoon so Fotheringay's impatience defeats him. To give the world leaders time to plan he orders the Earth to stop rotating. Physical inertia rather than figurative inertia takes over and you can understand the result of that. Fotheringay survives to put things back where they were before the gods gave him the power of miracles. Back in the bar where it all began he sighs I'll never get the chance to improve the world now. One of the gods thinks mankind can still achieve Utopia gradually. Even in a sort of despair Wells was ever the optimist.Roland Young creates a very believable Fotheringay who gradually changes from a bumbler with no real idea how his suddenly acquired miraculous power can be used for good into a man determined to mold the world the way he wants it. Alas he is a simple man without enough knowledge and must depend on others for advice. Of course they let him down. Ralph Richardson's character a retired colonel now a magistrate embodies those others. He can't imagine a world better than the one he is in. The cast work is excellent and believable special effects illustrate the miracles. A few eyes may pop when shopgirl Ada is changed in a flash into Cleopatra like Claudette Colbert in the movie as Fotheringay orders.The Man Who Could Work Miracles as Wells wrote it is actually his attempt to encapsulate the gist of his monumental oeuvre The Work Wealth and Happiness of Mankind into a charming fantasy parable that could reach the average person better than his immense tome on political economy. It always seemed to me that of the three great philosophers of political economy the other two being Karl Marx and Adam Smith Wells was the most accessible writer. The trouble was I think that because he often employed ScienceFantasy to reach the public many did not take him seriously. Those three great writers trying to design a politicoeconomic Utopia all made the same mistake. All assumed that at bottom all human beings are decent and caring if you just eliminate want. They all overlooked the fact that the folks with the most drive and ambition and the ability to put formulae into operation are usually the ones with the least decency honesty integrity and sense of public responsibility. I wonder what old Adam Smith would think of the Enron mess for example or old Karl Marx of the former Soviet Union and comrade Stalin. As for Wells I don't know of any attempt to implement his essential technocratic Utopia but no doubt the result would have been equal failure.".

MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES the 1895 Book has been outofprint for decades and evaded scholarly attention to a surprising degree.Who wrote the Screenplay? Film Credits state scenario and Decalogue by H.G. Wells the Book is subtitled A Film by H.G. Wells. Film production reference works mention that Wells was assisted by Lajos Biro 18801948 a Hungarian  Hollywood Scriptwriter who served as scenarist for producer Alexander Korda. Wells never mentioned Biro in print although he did referred contemptuously to William Cameron Menzies and Lothar Mendes directors of his Films. MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES was released shortly after THINGS TO COME. It was directed by Lothar Mendes a far worse director even than Menzies dull beyond words H.G. Wells 213. Korda's associates argued that the Script of MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES was really not Wells' work but was Scripted by Lajos Biro and that H.G. Wells interfered little with the development of the story 167. Biographer Karol Kulik went further Since Wells's presence throughout the former Film's production THINGS TO COME had demanded constant patience conciliation and accommodation from the Filmmaker Korda kept Wells away from the Film as much as possible. Although Wells received sole screen credit for the Script Lajos Biro was the responsible party. As with the earlier THINGS TO COME there was a basic disagreement between Korda and Wells although their personal relationship seems to have been cordial. In MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES Korda was interested in comic situations special effects and theater. It is significant that his working title for the Film was The Miracle Maker. Wells was interested in social and political ideas which weigh the Film down. Wells had less influence on MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES than on THINGS TO COME despite his thorough dissatisfaction but he did try to make his presence felt in spite of the attempts to bypass him ...I shall go back to do MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES cut and clean it up  for most of it is shot already. I'm a little disillusioned about Films industry. They could be magnificent Art but has to be learned...A second question What is the text? The two versions Film and Book differ considerably. The Book contains much material omitted from the Film and many changes of Scenes were shifted in place. So was the Book closer to Wells's intention and the Film Script was Biro's? Although Stover tries to force a theme between the original Short Story THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 1898 and the Movie MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES 1937  it is obvious the Short Story and the Script are enormously different in theme.The Short Story was what Wells called a single sitting story. It seems reasonable that the important little possibility in the Short Story was the Cataclysm resulting when the rotation of the world was stopped for an instant with a little satire on religion. The Book's title can be interpreted as indicating the new direction which Wells attempted to remake an old story. The ShortStory title calls attention to the actions of an individual in the Past. It might be restated as The Man Who Was Able To Work Miracles and What He Did with some emphasis on the protagonist. Restated again Mankind Could Work Miracles If It Really Tried. This is fortified by the optimistic last words of the Player when the Elemental Powers argue about the Future of Mankind Come back here in an age or so and you shall see... No one has ever questioned that Wells' Elemental Powers at the Prologue are four not three the Master the Observer Indifference and the Player. Why are the elemental powers nude males and why do they ride horses? Is this a theatrical image of Biro's making? What exactly did Wells mean by Elemental? Is he suggesting the traditional elements or occult elemental forces? Is there any principle behind the differences between the two texts Film and Novel beyond brevity? There are so many major things wrong with this bad Book that it may seem nitpicking to call attention to minor examples of carelessness but they should not be ignored Wells was not in control of two Films. It is curious that in 2004 three major Hollywood Production companies announced their proposed remake of this very unsuccessful project.

Charlie imitates the style of all things American that he saw in movies. When he spots luscious Pupa a prostitute working on the side of the road adjacent to a construction project he is inspecting from a helicopter he can't pass the opportunity to take her with him to Milano where he installs her in his apartment. Charlie sees in her like all the other women that attract him a Rita Hayworth of his boyhood when he used to fantasize about the screen goddess.It is because this attraction to beautiful redheaded women that will be his own downfall.Directed by Giorgio Capitani and based on a novel Collared by Cornell Woolrich this film is a comedy that capitalizes on its two stars even if there is no love between them. Sophia Loren comes out best. She must have been in her forties at the time and looked sensational. Mr. Mastroianni's Charlie is a more flashy part. The only problem is that his character is obnoxious and our sympathies are with Ms. Loren.There is a great chase scene at the end all over the city of Milan.".

The ambiance is luxurious Switzerland and French intelligence headquarters or college's libraries  for spying is done not only by your common 007type of agent but by people above all suspicion.Ventura plays a retired agent living a peaceful life with a younger loving German woman who's teaching in France when he is called into active service again  very much against his will. When he finally starts suspecting all people around him  minus those who fall dead after he makes the first moves into knowledge...  it will be too late. Too late to avoid discovering the unthinkable truth and too late to get back to his peaceful retirement.The dark end may not please all viewers but it is actually a signal of the times the movie was made  and now that you are a quarter of a century past that you may notice that it was a forewarning against the all encompassing spying and intruding on people's lives from those people up there who are above all suspicion!".

But Grenier has a secret he used to be a field agent for the French secret service SDECE. However as the years went by he certainly don't expect a wake up call any longer. He couldn't have been more wrong Similarly as with CIAagents once SDECE always SDECE He's played by a somewhat grumpy tired looking Lino Ventura.It all starts with a RAF style execution of a passenger in a tramway by a leftist terrorist group. From then on Grenier gets caught in a whirlwind of events leading to several other violent deaths. The where's and when's of these events are announced in a cool voice by a narrator. Several other spy movies use a similar semidocumentary approach others use a telexmessage for the same purpose. The first victim is Henri Marchand another SDECEagent played by Bernard Fresson. Many Americans will remember him as the French commissaire Barthlmy in French Connection II with his funny clashes with Popeye Doyle Gene Hacklman.Grenier soon realizes that he might not live very long anymore. But who is the spider in the deadly web around him ? Is it the mysterious and cold Richard played by Bruno Cremer ?of Maigretfame. Or is it JeanPaul Chance a slick Swiss high official from the Justice Department who seems to be extremely well informed by whatever Grenier is doing. Chance is played by Michel Piccoli who clearly enjoys irritating the Greniercharacter. Who's systematically knocking out several pawns on the international chess game and why ? In the end the French former agent will manage to shed some light into some dark corners. What he doesn't realize is that the gun pointed at his back is hidden in another shadowy corner. Or is he ? Not a bad movie but by far not as good as Le silencieux 1973 also with Ventura. Maybe the movie doesn't really manages to create a real mysterious atmosphere of clear and present danger as for example La septime cible manages to do in a better way. The way the secret agents communicate with each other also has something laughable it all looks so terribly boyscoutish. It also made me seasick to see how sparkless the GrenierGretz couple apparently had become. They were clearly at the brink of a total burn out before death took its toll In fact the whole movie has something extremely depressing the tired looks of Grenier his moody interactions with his business collaborator his secretary and his wife and every one involved in the story. The soundtrack consists of a sober efficient but also somewhat depressing march yet another Morricone creation. Even the landscapes of Switserland surely wouldn't be the ones I would use to attract more tourists".

I wonder how Americans look at the film nowadays visa'vis the events of 911  which is perhaps the only reason why it ever saw the light of day on DVD in the first place!As it stands INVASION USA is both hysterical and unintentionally hilarious  never more so than when a car is caught in the flooding of Hoover Dam hit by a nuclear bomb! and a cowboy hat is seen floating on a branch as the sole remnant of its Texan owner! Also worth mentioning are the fact that when the U.S. Senate is besieged it's seen to be peopled merely by doddering statesmen while the intermittent 'appearances' by the American President addressing the nation are taken from a vague solitary angle! Equally queasy is the fact that handsome leads Gerard Mohr a cynical TV reporter and Peggie Castle are drawn together at such a precarious time while the middleaged bartender keeps mixing drinks as if his life depended on it  apparently oblivious to the ongoing calamities! Needless to say the unnamed Soviets are depicted throughout as unemotional sloganspouting caricatures.The best thing about the film is the brief but typically riveting performance by Dan O'Herlihy incidentally years later he'd appear in a genuine Cold War classic i.e FAIL SAFE 1964  not least in view of the twist ending brought about by his particular line of work. In the DVD supplements much is made of the fact that the film features the two actresses who played Superman's Lois Lane on TV  Noel Neill and Phyllis Coates  but their contribution is at best negligible! also on hand as a newscaster is character actor William Schallert who's said to have made more Atomicrelated titles than anyone else the top 100 such efforts compiled by Conelrad are listed with a brief synopsis for each one on the Synapse DVD itself in an interview included on the disc Schallert speaks of his brush with Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL 1958 where he was proposed for the role later played by Maltese actor Joseph Calleia  whom Schallert mistakenly thinks was an Italian! Oh well it's near enough I supposeAs can be gathered therefore the extras are quite nice being pretty comprehensive about the whole Cold War aura which pervaded the first two decades or so of the postwar era though I've only very briefly sampled the two radio programs which play backtoback as an Audio Commentary to the film. One of the most telling comments in the extras comes from O'Herlihy himself  when he went to Russia in the late 1960s to film WATERLOO 1970 he was met by such an inefficient people that he couldn't fathom how their threat was ever taken seriously! Noel Neill then overhypes the film's impact  I mean saying it blows PEARL HARBOR 2001 out of the water is not much of a feat is it?

The story is pretty simple as a group of strangers are sitting in a bar when the news breaks that the Soviet Union have invaded America. Before long most of America has been hit with an Atomic Bomb.INVASION U.S.A. is considered by many to be one of the worst movies ever made but I think that's rather extremely. There's no question that there are some very bad things in the picture but at the same time it manages to hold you attention no matter how bad things get. I think the biggest problem with the film is the fact that its budget was so low that they really weren't able to do anything good with the picture.I say that because even though the film is only 72minutes long I'd say a third of that is made up of stock footage which obviously makes the picture look cheap. There are so many scenes where it's either stock footage or projection stuff that you can't help but not be frightened by anything you're looking at. The entire point of this picture was to frighten you into thinking that the Soviet Union could strike at any moment but without the drama there's just not much here. To make matters worse there are some unintentional funny moments including a scene where the Hoover Dam is bombed and a family gets taken out by the water.There are some decent performances here including Gerald Mohr and Dan O'Herlihy. Character actor Tom Kennedy is also on hand playing the bartender. Another problem I had with the story is the fact that America pretty much falls without any issue. I mean as easy as it was for us to be taken over it would be impossible for America to beat anyone. Still INVASION U.S.A. isn't nearly the bomb some make it out to be.".

For a low budget film it actually made good use of the available resources.I suspect most of the criticism is not based on the film itself but its supposed political failings. However the politics of a film are not a reason to pan it. We recognise the Battleship Potemkin as a great film despite it being communist propaganda. The same applies to Triumph of the Will as Nazi propaganda. Less successful but no less political films such as Schindler's List are rated on their merits irrespective of their message.Invasion U.S.A. adopts a narrative that is close to documentary. It does not include irrelevant romantic distractions or complex subplots. It is rather more of a war film than an anticommunist work.The enemy is not clearly identified. They look and sound rather more like Nazis than Reds. The identity of the enemy is not as important as the message that America needs to be ready to defend itself. I would have thought that the message that a country needs to be vigilant is as correct now as in 1952.The course of the invasion and its successful outcome were refreshing after watching too many gung ho American films where the US heroes always prevail. This film shows the reality that the USA could have been invaded by the Soviet Union in 1952  if they had been the Soviets would almost certainly have won the war. Russia had a narrow window of opportunity before the USA developed too many thermonuclear weapons and invasion would be too costly. There were Soviet invasion plans prepared.I wonder when we will see an American film about a successful Taliban or ISIS attack on the USA with the message that the USA needs to be prepared.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was the early 1950s. J. Parnell Thomas of The House Unamerican Activities Committee was accusing everyone in sight who had any measure of public visibility with Communist allegiance. He went after Hollywood in a series of highly publicized hearings resulting in the arrests and convictions of the Hollywood Ten for invoking their Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination... just before Thomas himself was hauled before a Grand Jury to answer fraud charges. In a moment of high irony Thomas himself invoked the Fifth Amendment before he was convicted and imprisoned.It was the time of Tail Gunner Joe McCarthy who charged that Communist influence in the State Department and Army had caused us to give away China. He recklessly charged that Communists had infiltrated nearly every aspect of American life... strictly in the name of enhancing his own political power base. In the Army hearings McCarthy was finally unmasked as an unprincipled charlatan by Army counsel Joseph Welch and he was subsequently censured by the Senate for unethical conduct. Joe McCarthy subsequently died of alcoholism.Besides these men... Richard Nixon J. Edgar Hoover Roy Cohn and many others in positions of power shrieked the gospel of anticommunism demanding that Americans surrender Constitutional rights in the name of defeating this new enemy.It was a time of fear where American opinion could be easily manipulated. Partly for financial gain and partly to spare itself from further attacks by the Thomases and McCarthys Hollywood became a willing tool for the use of politicians a propaganda machine that produced a number of sensational films that capitalized on the anti Red hysteria.Some of the more notable Hollywood efforts were the major studio film BIG JIM MACLAIN starring John Wayne and James Arness and a Bmovie effort THE RED MENACE whose opening credits graphic showed an octopus wearing a hammer and sickle logo using it's tentacles to embrace the entire world.Pretty heavy handed stuff but it was effective for the political manipulation of a frightened American populace. It kept McCarthy off of the studio's backs... as well as made a few Bmovie bucks.Along with these heavy ideological films came INVASION USA a mythical war and adventure movie. Of the whole lot THIS is the most interesting of the Red Scare films and it's the ONLY one that's ANY fun at all! Ed Wood must have LOVED this film it clearly taught him the cinematic techniques he was to later make famous. As a cost cutting measure the film makes GENEROUS use of stock footage mostly Public Domain stuff from military sources.To make American planes into enemy ones they just printed the stock footage BACKWARDS so that UNITED STATES AIR FORCE on the planes came out REVERSED and it looked sort of like Russian Cyrillic lettering.In newly shot scenes where stock footage couldn't be used set decoration relied heavily on the local ArmyNavy store! There are literally TONS of military surplus equipment on the sets.The fact that enemy troops were dressed in American military surplus uniforms was explained neatly by saying that they were infiltrating in disguise! As another cost cutting measure the cast is ENTIRELY made up of B list talent who would work for Actor's Equity scale. The amount of over the top hammy acting has to be seen to be believed! To throw in a touch of sex a drunken enemy soldier tries to ravage a blonde American beauty who chooses instead to kill herself by diving out of a window! The script is absurd but for frightened audiences of the time it was plausible... it bore out all of the dire threats that politicians had been making. Hedda Hopper's review of the film said It will scare the pants off you! and so it did. Bombing raids on San Francisco the Hoover Dam destroyed by a missile attack and New York City hit with an atomic bomb were enough to scare the pants off of ANYBODY.For sheer kitsch value I give it a ten.As a warning of what propaganda feeding the political hysteria stirred up by unethical politicians can accomplish it ALSO gets a ten.As moviemaking it gets a four.".

It was more like a supercheapie public service announcement for the militaryindustrial complex. If you fast forward through most of the stock WW2 battle scenes which are endless and slow down for the story scenes it's a mildly amusing exercise in whatif? science fiction  doofy and utterly implausible but good for some wry smiles. I mean you gotta love that the hypnotist fortune teller is named Ohman. It's also kind of interesting that many many more serious biggerbudget invasion and terrorist plot films since this one have followed a pretty similar storyline if more competently. Add the general atmosphere of paranoia post911 and this thing is worth a look with the FF button to the metal.".

As such I was suprised to find that Invasion USA was not a bad movie.  Perhaps this post 911 world makes us all a bit more paranoid about an external enemy so that this deeply paranoid McCarthyism influenced film doesn't seem too ridiculous.  The film seeks to relay the message that if America lets its guard down we are vulnerable to attack.  While full scale invasion seems unlikely we all learned a painful lesson that we are vulnerable.  Is this a great movie? No.  The usage of stock footage is excessive and the subject is overly preachy.  The film plays out almost like a morality tale in which each character ultimately meets their doom as a result of America's laxness. Invasion USA is a deeply paranoid film from a different time whose only purpose is to relay a message but its a message we should all keep in mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my earliest memories in life is seeing this film as a dark frightening image from childhood. All I could remember was the sight of a man spinning a brandy glass and otherwise much chaos and destruction. Some years ago I found a copy of this film on the 5.00 rack recognized it and bought it. It was a thrill of intellectual interest. This film is in the grammar of the 1950s genre of film. And yes there is a 1950s grammar of film. Because studios seldom gave money to make films that where geared toward the Saturday matine or the drivein little money was given to the producers. Therefore stock footage had to be used as well as the techniques of theater. This is fine so long as these tools are used with enough creativity to tell the story of the film. Such is the case with this film. Invasion USA when viewed today begs the knee jerk clich observations too often given about any 1950s film. The clich notions to which I refer are that 1950s films are cold war relics that reveal anti Communist Paranoia and are McCarthyridden. One usually finds variations and elaborations on these thin ideas which we are supposed to accept a priori. Such retroactive assumptions are intellectually dishonest or at best reveal that the person offering such jerrymade matrix interpretations is innocent of any good grasp of history or the desire to engage in critical thinking. This film takes an antiCommunist position. What is wrong with that? I can think of many reasons why that is right. I suppose it would receive many kudos as an enlightened film if it was pro Communist. Invasion USA simply looks at the Cold War and other issues of the day the Marshall Plan income tax rates and personal responsibility and within a tricky plot context reveals what would happen if it turned hot. The military moves by the Soviets are strategically accurate and the special effects are very poor. But they exist well enough to tell the story which is all that counts. I was not aware that Mystery Science Theater 3000 worked their banal act through this film. This is unfortunate because besides being totally unaware of the difference between a good film and a bad one that show is devoid of any wit. For people who can have a reasonable open discussion on the subjects this film presents they should find it rewarding. However its effect is all but destroyed by the reality of 91101.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a darn shame that INVASION USA was such a poorly made film as the film did have a couple things in its favor. First the idea for the film of a Soviet invasion of America while rather ridiculous was also pretty interesting. It's an interesting what if sort of concept. Second while many of the actors were amazingly lame there were a couple quality actors in the cast as well. While not household names Gerald Mohr and Dan O'Herlihy could definitely actor and both had wonderful voices. Despite a script written by marsupials they tried their best and gave the film a tiny bit of respectability. Unfortunately everything else in the film was such a mess that these factors manage to keep the overall score to a 2! Yes folks it's THAT bad! The film begins with an incredibly obvious scene in a bar where the people all seem more like caricatures than real people. Each person there has a variety of excuses not to do their best to protect America from foreign devils. However to teach them all a lesson a mystic O'Herlihy uses mass hypnosis to show they what it would be like if their beloved nation were destroyed due to their indifference.The biggest problem with the film is the budget. It's obvious they had very little money so at least half to twothirds of the film consisted of stock footage of an invasion. Many times photographs of US cities were shown and then explosions were cheaply superimposed over top of itand looked nothing like an exploding city. As for the action footage the trouble was that much of the stock film was hopelessly out of date by 1952 as much of it was from WWII. In fact the naval footage is almost all from the War in the Pacificand featured Japanese planes that were now obsolete making kamikaze attacks on ships. Apart from this with only a few grainy clips of MIG15 fighter planes the rest of the clips all showed American airplanes supposedly attacking America! So the enemy consisted mostly of B29B50 bombers the B50 is an updated version of the 29 as well as Saber and Starfighter jets. This was never explained and telling who was who was practically impossible. However with the footage of enemy soldiers the film explained that the reason they looked EXACTLY like American soldiers was because they were deliberately doing that to confuse us!! Oh and by the way the reason I say enemy is that although the film obviously is about a Soviet attack on America not once were these enemy nations nameda very strange omission to say the least.Based on what I've said so far you'd probably assume the film isn't worth watching. Well that might be true for the average viewer but there is a certain silly appeal in watching it. In other words the film is so bad that it's entertaining because you might just find yourself laughing at either the film's incompetence or how over the top it becomes near the end. In particular you just have to see the scene where the pretty lady is attacked by slobbering perverted soldiersI know I found myself laughing out loud!! By the way the DVD for this film is excellent. I like the way it was packaged as well as the extras. While the interviews with some of the actors were done in a rather cheesy manner some of their insights are interesting and it's very surreal to see that Noell Neal actually seemed to like the film and think it was well made!! Also a short film from 1962 RED NIGHTMARE is actually better made and a much better example of the socalled Red Scare era than the featured film.FYIFor trivia nuts out there this film has small parts for BOTH Lois Lanes from the 1950s TV showNoel Neill and Phyllis Coates though they do not act together in the movie. Look closely though as each part is rather small. Neill is the lady at the airline desk and Coates is the wife of the rancher who almost immediately snuffs it when she enters the screen.".

Then this movie came up as part of an informal project where a group of science fiction film fans tried to retrace the history of SF films by watching every film listed in the amazing book Keep Watching The Skies in chronological order. I wouldn't have voluntarily watched Invasion USA again but I figuredHow bad could it be?Pretty bad as it turned out.Even making allowances for the original 50's culture this movie was aimed at and for the fact that's obviously a red scare movie this little nugget is pretty hard to swallow. The movie relies heavily on stock footage to carry the action. The problem is that the live scenes and story the director tries to relate to all this canned film is about as convincing as Monty Python's skit about The Townsford Women's Guild Recreation of the Battle Of Pearl Harbor. The movie tries to turn endless scenes of American WW II battle footage and shots of US airplanes and US Army training film into a story about an alien invasion. And it simply doesn't work. The result is a storyline almost totally lacking in logic coherence and believability unidentified enemy aircraft that are clearly P38s A Bombs being dropped from enemy planes onto tranquil scenes of airfields with all their planes sitting placidly on the ground rather than scrambling to meet the attack they know is coming...in fact A Bombs being dropped all over the place  including New York! without a single consequence to the environment  or a retaliatory missile launch. The initial framing sequence is so badly contrived and played out  not that I blame the actors Dustin Hoffman couldn't make these scenes work that you almost root for the 2D cardboard characters to meet the dooms they all rush off to once war is declared. The film was barely 75 minutes but it seemed much longer. My brain screamed for credible dialog and a plot that made sense and better acting and well almost anything that this movie was missing in spades. And did I mention It was allllll a DREAM! The ultimate cop out for a movie plot and the final insult to my sensiblities. One bright spot both of the actresses who played Lois Lane in the Superman TV series had walkon parts  it was nice to see them getting other work. And that's about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw INVASION USA first in theatre in I think 1958 a Saturday Afternoon Special and slightly later on television. Boy! Did it blow a thirteen yearold's hair back! America unprepared. Atomic bombers coming over the Pole. The R.C.A. Building sliding into ruin. Street fighting. Enemy soldiers in American uniforms. A screaming woman with most of one mammary showing leaping to her death to escape . . . you know what. And that ENDING  blow the boy down! The whole weekend I was in a daze.It is a pity that one compares the enormity of two years ago to a cautionary message in this propaganda film. Perhaps if the United States were not spilling so much unnecessary blood in Korea as she would in the next decade in IndoChina the unnamed Enemy would not have gotten a leg up so easily. Please do not compare INVASION USA to 11 September an insult to the latter the least of which is that this S.F. story tells a frontal assault while the Tragedy was pure and simple subversion.This film is a pathetic attempt by Hollywood to show how much of a Team Player the industry was  after coming apart like wet cardboard for the previous five years under Government scrutiny. I understand there was a 1980s movie of the same name which I will not see a celebration of the Cold War revival of that heady decade. America under the heal. See the N.R.A. paranoia in RED DAWN. Check into Grenada or Panama anyone?Final noncinema note Want an excellent 1950s anticommie thriller? WHEN THE KISSING HAD TO STOP by Constantine FitzGibbon. It was all set up for a film in the early '60s but the project fell through to the disgust of the talented British novelist.".

A screaming woman with most of one mammary showing leaping to her death to escape . . . you know what. And that ENDING  blow the boy down! The whole weekend I was in a daze.It is a pity that one compares the enormity of two years ago to a cautionary message in this propaganda film. Perhaps if the United States were not spilling so much unnecessary blood in Korea as she would in the next decade in IndoChina the unnamed Enemy would not have gotten a leg up so easily. Please do not compare INVASION USA to 11 September an insult to the latter the least of which is that this S.F. story tells a frontal assault while the Tragedy was pure and simple subversion.This film is a pathetic attempt by Hollywood to show how much of a Team Player the industry was  after coming apart like wet cardboard for the previous five years under Government scrutiny. I understand there was a 1980s movie of the same name which I will not see a celebration of the Cold War revival of that heady decade. America under the heal. See the N.R.A. paranoia in RED DAWN. Check into Grenada or Panama anyone?Final noncinema note Want an excellent 1950s anticommie thriller? WHEN THE KISSING HAD TO STOP by Constantine FitzGibbon. It was all set up for a film in the early '60s but the project fell through to the disgust of the talented British novelist.";

But it wasn't this terrible menage of cut together stock footage and drab acting that mesmerized one when watching the MST3K version. For me it was the immensely creepy short that preceded it called 'A date with your family'. This has to be the most horrifying Stepford children outing of the whole hideous collection of 50's shorts that MST3K showed throughout their ten year run. A repressed obsessive compulsive family try valiantly to subjugate their personalities so that they can have a tepid dinner date with their family. Truly spectacularly creepy moments include the narrator saying that the son seats his Mom at the table as though she were his 'best girl' and this same guy saying that son should compliment both his Mother and sister so that they will want to 'continue pleasing him'. But the funniest part of this whole bizarre thing is the part where said narrator comments that the two boys act as though they are genuinely glad to see their Father. At which time Mike says They're not of course. The movie itself is so boring and chock full of stock footage that you have the urge to fall asleep in front of it despite the quips. The only part I can remember with amusement is the fact that the invading 'enemy soldiers' speak English with barely a trace of an accent even among themselves. Ummm...were we being invaded by Canadians? The Maple leaf is the Red Menace right?".

Apaches are joined by a Comanche party and both of them attack the fort at a spectacular scenes . At the end  Indians besiege the fort and occurs a breathtaking epilogue by means of arrows  shootouts  explosions and cannons.This WesternAdventure results to be a pleasant episode about one of the series of popular German made Western  featuring the duo formed by valiant Old Shatterhand who agrees to help Indians against White traitors and immortal Winnetou  both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures  shootouts  explosions  exciting combats  largerthanlife characters and impressive scenarios . Furthermore  a lovely support cast such as Daliah Lavi as a gorgeous  exotic Mestiza  the American Guy Madison  Spanish Gustavo Rojo  Italian Mirko Ellis and Gojko Mitic who is one of the most famous and most loved actors in East Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe and starred a lot of Indian roles . WinnetouPierre Brice repeats  as usual his excellent and immortal role to be continued in a TV series. Lex Barker scores especially high marks  though he plays as a serious and intelligent frontiersman . Enjoyable relationship between Old Shatterhand and Winnetou is quite match . Pierre Brice is sensational as Winnetou  he is descendant of old French nobility  after enlisting as volunteer to the French Army and fighting in Indochina he attended acting lessons and got a first small role in some film . In 1962 a German producer searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival. He got the role and portrayed Winnetou in ten more movies with his costar Lex Barker as Old Shatterhand. These very successful productions made him a superstar in Germany winning several awards such as Bambi or the Golden Otto of teenager magazine Bravo. Furthermore  received Germany's Cross of Merit First Class as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . Although appearing on countless other movies and TV shows he will always be best remembered as Winnetou whom he also played at the Bad Segeberg open air theater.The highbrow Lex Barker who like his costar and good friend Pierre Brice started a singing career and released several records and played most part of series  Apache gold 1963 by Harald Reinl Apaches last Battle 1964 by Hugo Fregonese Last of renegades1964 The desperate trail Old Surehand 1965 directed by Alfred Vohrer HalfBreed 1966 by Harald Philipp In the valley of death1968 by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland  he plays with mirth and liking manner as Among vultures and Winnetou and Surehand .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one  Old Firehand in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . The film displays a colorful cinematography in Superpanorama 70  filmed in Atelier Spandau Berlin Germany studio and location Krka Falls Krka National Park Croatia  Krute Popovo Polje Tresbisnica riverYugoslavia Ulcinj Montenegro . Catching  sensitive musical score though with excessive use of synthesizer by Italian Riz Ortalani  replacing Martin Bottcher  series' ordinary  being eventually substituted in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Artur Brauner Productions  still successfully working was professionally directed by Hugo Fregonese . Hugo was an Argentina director who emigrated to Hollywood then became technical adviser on latino themes at Columbia Studios in Hollywood and subsequently under contract at Universal from 1950 to 1952 filming Man in the attic with Jack Palance  Blowing wildwith Gary Cooper  Decameron Nightswith Joan Fontaine  Harry Black and the tigerwith Steart Granger . Spent the rest of the decade in Europe directing Eurowesterns as Savage Pampas and potboilers as The Death Ray of Dr. Mabuse  Terror as Dracula vs. Frankenstein before finishing his career back in the country of his birth . Rating  6  acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia and Croatia.".

This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures  shootouts  explosions  exciting combats  largerthanlife characters and impressive scenarios . Furthermore  a lovely support cast such as Daliah Lavi as a gorgeous  exotic Mestiza  the American Guy Madison  Spanish Gustavo Rojo  Italian Mirko Ellis and Gojko Mitic who is one of the most famous and most loved actors in East Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe and starred a lot of Indian roles . WinnetouPierre Brice repeats  as usual his excellent and immortal role to be continued in a TV series. Lex Barker scores especially high marks  though he plays as a serious and intelligent frontiersman . Enjoyable relationship between Old Shatterhand and Winnetou is quite match . Pierre Brice is sensational as Winnetou  he is descendant of old French nobility  after enlisting as volunteer to the French Army and fighting in Indochina he attended acting lessons and got a first small role in some film . In 1962 a German producer searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival. He got the role and portrayed Winnetou in ten more movies with his costar Lex Barker as Old Shatterhand. These very successful productions made him a superstar in Germany winning several awards such as Bambi or the Golden Otto of teenager magazine Bravo. Furthermore  received Germany's Cross of Merit First Class as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . Although appearing on countless other movies and TV shows he will always be best remembered as Winnetou whom he also played at the Bad Segeberg open air theater.The highbrow Lex Barker who like his costar and good friend Pierre Brice started a singing career and released several records and played most part of series  Apache gold 1963 by Harald Reinl Apaches last Battle 1964 by Hugo Fregonese Last of renegades1964 The desperate trail Old Surehand 1965 directed by Alfred Vohrer HalfBreed 1966 by Harald Philipp In the valley of death1968 by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland  he plays with mirth and liking manner as Among vultures and Winnetou and Surehand .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one  Old Firehand in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . The film displays a colorful cinematography in Superpanorama 70  filmed in Atelier Spandau Berlin Germany studio and location Krka Falls Krka National Park Croatia  Krute Popovo Polje Tresbisnica riverYugoslavia Ulcinj Montenegro . Catching  sensitive musical score though with excessive use of synthesizer by Italian Riz Ortalani  replacing Martin Bottcher  series' ordinary  being eventually substituted in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Artur Brauner Productions  still successfully working was professionally directed by Hugo Fregonese . Hugo was an Argentina director who emigrated to Hollywood then became technical adviser on latino themes at Columbia Studios in Hollywood and subsequently under contract at Universal from 1950 to 1952 filming Man in the attic with Jack Palance  Blowing wildwith Gary Cooper  Decameron Nightswith Joan Fontaine  Harry Black and the tigerwith Steart Granger . Spent the rest of the decade in Europe directing Eurowesterns as Savage Pampas and potboilers as The Death Ray of Dr. Mabuse  Terror as Dracula vs. Frankenstein before finishing his career back in the country of his birth . Rating  6  acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia and Croatia.";

	schema:reviewBody "Old Shatterhand is a collaboration between four European countries and a Germanlanguage film from 1964 so this one is already over 50 years old. It is the third installment of the Karl May Winnetou series and among the most famous films from the series. The title here implies that Old Shatterhand played by Lex Barker is the star of this film but this is not really true. The result is just that Winnetou has less screentime which means Pierre Brice is not featured prominently really in here even if he has more scenes than in latter films. This could be fine as Brice is not the most talented actor under the sun but sadly the story is so mediocre and forgettable that it's just never an interesting let alone compelling watch. At over two hours this is possibly the longest film from the Karl May franchise and this turns into a major problem as the movie drags a lot on many occasions and at some point it just felt as if it would never end. If you know these films a bit then you will know that the visual side costumes sets cinematography is always worth seeing but also that the plot and story are hardly realistic or well thoughtthrough. The character elaboration could have been so much better. There are a handful actors in here like Battaglia and Wolter and others who appears in a whole lot of these Karl May films but these are also not good enough or don't have enough to work with in order to really elevate the material here. If this is what was considered a quality film over 50 years ago then I can only say it has not aged well at all and I am glad we have better films in terms of quality and quantity these days. A disappointing watch and worth seeing only for the most diehard Indian western film fans. I do not recommend it. Thumbs down.".

Here he is Wee Sonny MacGregor a popular young entertainer on television whose variety show has mostly elderly viewers who think of Sonny as the son or grandson they always dreamed about. Unfortunately for Sonny one Nigel Dennis Dennis Price publishes THE NAKED TRUTH a tell all scandal sheet like Confidential or despite their disclaimers The Enquirer. Mr Dennis has a nice somewhat legal offer. If you will help defray the expenses of his magazine he will refrain from publishing details of what you don't want known. In his best intelligent scoundrel style Price reveals to dear Wee Sonny that he knows about the large amounts of rent money Wee Sonny has been making with some rotting tenements in London. The audience for Wee Sonny would not feel very comfortable with his image knowing about this.Price has similar pieces of information regarding Peggy Blount playing an Agatha Christie novelist  apparently one of her plots may not have been so original. Also TerryThomas as Lord Mayley is not as respectable as he lets on  he seems to have had several affairs his wife does not know of although Georgina Cookson  Lady Mayley  has her occasional suspicions. Soon all three are considering the last resort for dealing with blackmail  doing in the blackmailer. Their problems are more than dealing with a brainy adversary. Blount tries to commit a murder after all she's an expert in killing as a creative writer only to come a cropper all I'll say is Price ups his demands for payment as a result. TerryThomas seems to keep stumbling into the schemes of Blount and Sellers to his own discomfort.Best is Sellers though  he is certain he can commit the perfect murder because he is a master of disguise. His assistant Kenneth Griffith keeps warning him that he has a tendency to overact but Wee Sonny dismisses this. He tries to spy out Price playing an elderly dock expert and only annoys the latter and makes TerryThomas suspicious. He flusters a gun shop owner by appearing as an Edwardian style country squire ordering enough ammunition for a regiment not for a hunt. My favorite moment is when he tries to impress possible IRA members by speaking to them as a fellow member in perfect Welsh.How they finally get rid of Price and his demands is as funny as one can expect given the rest of the film. It is a comedy that will pay handsome dividends of laughter.".

Sellers is also brilliant as another victim no doubt an early forerunner of the infamous Inspector Clouseau. The film also stars Peggy Mount Joan Sims and Shirley Eaton.The whole film is rather silly no part more so than the ending but is very entertaining and very funny as the bungling victims try to kill either themselves or their tormentor each with an equal lack of success.".

The film begins with several people committing suicide or at least attempting it. You have absolutely no idea why this is happeningit's like an epidemic! However whatever the causes they are awfully funny and never has suicide seemed so full of laughs. It later turns out that the reason for all this mayhem is because a horrid man is blackmailing people. In fact the guy has a huge file on lots of people though the film centers on four of themfour who are so desperate to keep their naughty business private that they contemplate taking extreme action.Most of the movie consists of three of these four victims deciding that the best possible course of action is to kill the blackmailer because if they don't pay him off he promises to publish a tellall magazine detailing their peccadilloes. Seeing these folks planning and repeatedly botching the murder is pretty funny...and very very dark.Ultimately however the murder plans are scrubbed as the blackmailer is caught by the police. But what if he spills the beans? What can they do to stop this man from talking?! This all leads to an immensely clever final portion of the film when over 300 blackmail victims all work together to end this nonsense once and for all! The final scene is particularly enjoyable though the gunshot at the very end was unnecessary and even a bit dumb.In this film there are many nice performances though the one that stands out the most is Peter Sellers. He plays a TV star who changes costumes and personalities constantly as part of his job...as well as the plot to stop the blackmailer. In many ways it's like a precursor to DR. STRANGELOVEgiving Sellers ample opportunity to try out his many accents and impersonations.Overall a very funny and clever comedy that is so good because it's so different.".

Some of the shots are definitely too dark though even if set at nighttime in that it is hard to see what is happening.

But what if someone has uncovered something decidedly unflattering that the person concerned does not want to be revealed. Welcome to the delightful black comedic premise of late 50s 88 min comedy film The Naked Truth. With his typical iconic roguish person it's another excellent performance from that British cad Terry Thomas as Lord Mayley. His pivotal scene exemplifying the premise occurs during his conversation with Nigel Dennis played with well educated unscrupulous brilliance by Dennis Price when he looks over a copy of the scandalous publication initially salivating at the prospect of what he might read. His demeanour soon changes when he finds that surreptitiously he is the main object of intrigue. For me good though he is he is easily overshadowed by the acting genius of Peter Sellers whom excels as television audience favourite 'Wee Sonny McGregor' a fake Scots entertainer with an ability to create a wealth of characters. Amongst the ones we see are the elderly canal boat inspector and a quite ridiculous over the top Irishman no wonder he gets punched by a Dublin pub customer for taking the micky! Also worthy of praise is Peggy Mount as the anxious desperate authoress Flora Ransom and her extremely nervous daughter Ethel played by Joan Sims. Delighted to finally nab a DVD copy of this bright and breezy comedy which benefits from a jaunty moving incidental music score earlier this week and was pleasantly surprised that you also get an approx 2 min trailer which perfectly captures the manic mood of a movie whose premise is as relevant today as it was on its original release. Definitely one of the best black and white British film comedies and is well worth adding to your collection!".

Unscrupulous publisher 'Nigel Dennis'  Dennis Price  plans on launching a scandal magazine in Britain. Entitled 'The Naked Truth' it will implicate highprofile public figures in major financial or sexual scandals. Among the victims are toff 'Lord Henry Mayley'  TerryThomas  bestselling mystery writer 'Flora Ransom'  Peggy Mount  model 'Melissa Right'  Shirley Eaton  and television presenter 'Wee Sonny McGregor'  Peter Sellers . To save their reputations each must pay Dennis 10000. Naturally they don't want to do this so they concoct separate plans to do away with the blackmailer. Much of the first part of the picture is concerned with these varying murder attempts which range from blowing Dennis up to knocking him out with a Mickey Finn before tossing him in the Thames. Needless to say they all fail and the wouldbe killers then pool their resources in order to stop Dennis from telling the naked truth.It is a sprightly black comedy in the mold of 'The Ladykillers' deftly written by veteran comedy scribe Michael Pertwee  cousin of Jon  and well directed by Zampi  it turned out to be one of his last pictures  he died in 1963 . The cast are marvellous particularly Sellers whose 'McGregor' keeps slipping into disguise including an old man with a 'creeping alopecia' problem and who sounds like 'Willium Mate Cobblers' from 'The Goon Show' along with a country gent who could be a distant relative of 'Hercules GrytpypeThynne' from the same series. McGregor's television show  which resembles a geriatric version of 'The X Factor'  was allegedly inspired by a real one starring Wilfrid Pickles. Popping up in minor roles are Joan Sims as Flora's nervous daughter 'Ethel' Miles Malleson as a befuddled vicar Wilfrid Lawson as a veteran soldier with a fondness for playing a pennywhistle and Kenneth Griffith as McGregor's confidante.Funniest moment  the finale in which all of Dennis' victims  including a scout master  band together to spring him from police custody culminating in an airship escape. If the final gag is a little predictable well it hardly matters.Second funniest moment  McGregor trying to buy gelignite from I.R.A. terrorists. His convincing Irish accent is let down when he tries to speak gaelic and instead utters the name of a Welsh town  'Llanfairpwllgwyn...etc. etc.' !".

To save their reputations each must pay Dennis 10000. Naturally they don't want to do this so they concoct separate plans to do away with the blackmailer. Much of the first part of the picture is concerned with these varying murder attempts which range from blowing Dennis up to knocking him out with a Mickey Finn before tossing him in the Thames. Needless to say they all fail and the wouldbe killers then pool their resources in order to stop Dennis from telling the naked truth.It is a sprightly black comedy in the mold of 'The Ladykillers' deftly written by veteran comedy scribe Michael Pertwee  cousin of Jon  and well directed by Zampi  it turned out to be one of his last pictures  he died in 1963 . The cast are marvellous particularly Sellers whose 'McGregor' keeps slipping into disguise including an old man with a 'creeping alopecia' problem and who sounds like 'Willium Mate Cobblers' from 'The Goon Show' along with a country gent who could be a distant relative of 'Hercules GrytpypeThynne' from the same series. McGregor's television show  which resembles a geriatric version of 'The X Factor'  was allegedly inspired by a real one starring Wilfrid Pickles. Popping up in minor roles are Joan Sims as Flora's nervous daughter 'Ethel' Miles Malleson as a befuddled vicar Wilfrid Lawson as a veteran soldier with a fondness for playing a pennywhistle and Kenneth Griffith as McGregor's confidante.Funniest moment  the finale in which all of Dennis' victims  including a scout master  band together to spring him from police custody culminating in an airship escape. If the final gag is a little predictable well it hardly matters.Second funniest moment  McGregor trying to buy gelignite from I.R.A. terrorists. His convincing Irish accent is let down when he tries to speak gaelic and instead utters the name of a Welsh town  'Llanfairpwllgwyn...etc. etc.' !";

	schema:reviewBody "The Naked Truth a.k.a. Your Past Is Showing is a good example of the dividing line between bad and awful. While never quite unpleasant it is also a comedy that isn't funny a caper film that isn't clever and a showcase for talents who never manage to rise off the ground even if they don't fall flat on their face.Nigel Dennis Dennis Price is a journalist with a special calling. He selfpublishes a magazine called The Naked Truth revealing the seamy underbelly of celebrity life in preSwinging stillnaughty London. He makes a special offer to those he gets the dirt on like TV personality Wee Sonny MacGregor Peter Sellers Come across with a sizable donation to a charity called the Distressed Journalists' Association sole beneficiary Dennis himself and we won't tell England the sordid details of your private lives.But I haven't got 10000 pounds protests MacGregor.Spoken like a true Scot Dennis replies. But where has the bonnie accent gone?The presence of Price immediately reminds one of the classic Ealing comedy Kind Hearts And Coronets which Price starred in to great effect. Though given the same kind of weaselly character to play lashing out against the upper classes he's not nearly as good here. In part that's because Price here is more detached and harder to pull for but mostly because The Naked Truth doesn't have the craft of Kind Hearts when it comes for making the audience care about its array of base characters.What makes Naked Truth more of a failure is the presence of Sellers just gaining his chops in screen comedy and a year or so away from launching one of the most fertile fiveyear periods any screen actor ever had. He's not bad here just a wasted opportunity. MacGregor dons an assortment of disguises trying to gain the upper hand on Dennis the first of many such multiple roleplays for Sellers but the laughs are few and faint.That's a problem throughout the movie actually. Michael Pertwee's script is full of double takes and misheard words but few laughs especially as it starts things off with a suicide and a suicide attempt. Director Mario Zampi has a hard time shooting dayfornight scenes and lets Peggy Mount play to the cheap seats in an overly broad performance as a mystery novelist. Poor Joan Sims as her daughter overacts even worse reminding one of how comedy is a business of degrees. Zampi does shoot some arresting floorlevel shots now and then but he doesn't do much for his cast from Price on down.What's good about The Naked Truth? TerryThomas in what amounts to a nominal lead performance as another of Dennis's blackmail victims louche Lord Mayley inhabits his character with his usual playful verve. Like tomdarwin noted here in an earlier review TT was a bit of a onenote Johnny but played his one note well. He does so here especially in exchanges with Price and Sellers and with Georgina Cookson as Lady Mayley about as amiable a henpecker as you'll find on screen. The score by Stanley Black is busy but game. You wish you were having as good a time as he is here.The Naked Truth is neither funny nor witty but there are moments of engagement here or there. Mostly though it's a chance to appreciate that British comedy wasn't always so golden even in its Golden Age.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wonderful and wacky comedy pairs two of the best British comic actors of the 20th century. In their quite different characters Peter Sellers and TerryThomas are hilarious for their antics. Thomas is Lord Mayley and Sellers is Sonny Macgregor. They are joined by Peggy Mount as Flora Ransom and Shirley Eaton as Melissa Right. These are just a pittance of the number of people across British society that have come under the spell of blackmail by Nigel Dennis. Dennis Price plays the straight man Dennis and he is perfect for the role that he played a number of times in comedies. The tool of blackmail is threatened publication of some embarrassing or troubling thing of a person's past in Dennis's tabloid magazine The Naked Truth. While Lord Mayley finds it interesting and fun to read some of the dirt about other people he's horrified to think of his past foible becoming known. The plot for this film is wonderful and the crisscrossing of paths by the principles being blackmailed  before they get together is hilarious. A very good supporting cast contribute to the comedy. Georgina Cookson as Lady Mayley and Joan Sims as Ethel Ransom are especially good. This is a very funny comedy that's sure to generate much laughter for adults. One of my favorite scenes is the lot of people drinking the Mickey Finns that Flora has made in all her liquor supply. Another is Sonny Macgregor in the gun shop when he orders 1500 12guage shotgun shells for a day's rough shooting. Here are some funny lines from the film. For more humorous dialog see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the film. Nigel Dennis Don't bother to kick me out.Lord Mayley How do I look Lucy? Lady Mayley Very chick. Lord Mayley Chick? Thought the word was chic. Lady Mayley Yes darling it is but not when applied to you.Lord Mayley Your mustache Sonny Macgregor Oh yes sir. I I got the creeping alopecia sir.

Flora Ransom The word is hanged dear and you won't be.Ethel Ransom Oh my what have you done? Flora Ransom What have I done? You have murdered an innocent bystander that's what.Lady Mayley I'll get Maria to lay out your frogman's suit.Lord Mayley Never seen her before. It's a lie. Lady Mayley What is?

Lady Mayley Not all there I'm thinking.Sonny Macgregor Are you crazy? We've just been killing ourselves trying to murder him. Lord Mayley Good heavens. Sir Hutton Eastbrook.

	schema:headline " Funny and often savage comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "While those looking for a rather typical 50s British comedy will not be disappointed this film also offers some more biting social commentary than usual. An ensemble cast plays out a zany caper story about a creepy amoral grifter Dennis Price and a group of assorted loonies who try in various ways to undermine his attempts to blackmail them. It's not dissimilar from other excellent comedies of the era such as Lavender Hill Mob and Kind Hearts and Coronets but this film from the Rank Organization lacks the dry quality of the Ealing Films. Also there is no presence as compelling as Guinness' in the best Ealings. Peter Sellers secondbilled below Terry Thomas who as usual has perhaps one too many scene with certainly one too many eye roll of course tries his best to steal the film and every scene in it and Peggy Mount is very funny as a mystery writer intent on acting out her own story. But none of the characters are given the chance to really center the film and as a result it comes off with less heart than the very best films of this type.Sellers plays a kind of corrupt game show host in danger of being exposed as a slumlord to the very elderly audience who adore him. I thought that was a nice if obvious bit of social statement. Neither Sellers nor any of the other people being blackmailed is a lilywhite innocent so you wonder as you watch it whether Price's character will get his comeuppance or not. That gives it more suspense than some comedy but not really enough to make it compelling. Still it's a quality film with good contributions from everybody.".

	schema:headline " A thoroughly Russian Mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "I have just seen this film at the Renoir in London and found much to enjoy. At first the basic storyline of the father looking for a haven and the boy for a world of adventure and freedom seemed slowmoving but the early long takes gave the viewer time to absorb the landscape and the pointofview in particular the boy's slow awakening to the reality of his situation. His ability to 'see everything from above' demonstrated to the forestdwelling girl early in the film when he drew a map of a terrain unknown to him was an early signal of his superior grasp of reality and an introduction to the main metaphorical cluster of the film. The use of birds glider and flyingpaper imagery rang the changes on the visual representation of the boy's yearnings a galaxy of Dostoyevsian largerthanlife and twiceasunpredictable Russian characters met along the way added intrigue and ethnic authenticity to the storyline. The bizarre minor characters contrasted with the downtoearth ordinariness of the tensions between the father and son. Their habitats were astonishing and yet completely acceptable within the heightened realism established in the early scenes  the railworker's shed with the lavatory doubling as a vodka store  the tumbledown mansion whose roof the father stayed to repair with disastrous consequences the hillside oxroast with flying sparks visible for miles and a suddenlylooming lorrydriver big as Brian Blessed hefting the boy across his shoulders with a triumphant cry of 'Meat! and a chill echo of 'Texas Chain Saw '.The Amazonian silent 'Xenia' for all her 'sweatiness' complained of by the boy was given a similarly apocryphal persona.

	onyx:emotionText "I have just seen this film at the Renoir in London and found much to enjoy. At first the basic storyline of the father looking for a haven and the boy for a world of adventure and freedom seemed slowmoving but the early long takes gave the viewer time to absorb the landscape and the pointofview in particular the boy's slow awakening to the reality of his situation. His ability to 'see everything from above' demonstrated to the forestdwelling girl early in the film when he drew a map of a terrain unknown to him was an early signal of his superior grasp of reality and an introduction to the main metaphorical cluster of the film. The use of birds glider and flyingpaper imagery rang the changes on the visual representation of the boy's yearnings a galaxy of Dostoyevsian largerthanlife and twiceasunpredictable Russian characters met along the way added intrigue and ethnic authenticity to the storyline. The bizarre minor characters contrasted with the downtoearth ordinariness of the tensions between the father and son. Their habitats were astonishing and yet completely acceptable within the heightened realism established in the early scenes  the railworker's shed with the lavatory doubling as a vodka store  the tumbledown mansion whose roof the father stayed to repair with disastrous consequences the hillside oxroast with flying sparks visible for miles and a suddenlylooming lorrydriver big as Brian Blessed hefting the boy across his shoulders with a triumphant cry of 'Meat! and a chill echo of 'Texas Chain Saw '.The Amazonian silent 'Xenia' for all her 'sweatiness' complained of by the boy was given a similarly apocryphal persona. All were separated by muddy fields and clawing shrubland which the camera allowed us to experience as visually alienating at a distance and unbearably uncomfortable up close.

The albatross lives by the sea. This spontaneous birdwatching incident portends of a lag in their long journey as the roads to Koktebel will be bumpy roads when the old man's demons return to circumnavigate the engineerIgor Csernyevics and his sonGleb Puskeaplis from their goal of reaching the seaside town in Crimea. The albatross is not only a seabird it's also a byproduct of human frailty that greatly hinders accomplishment.From the outset of the journey in a scene aboard the train the filmmaker privileges the boy in profile who stares at the everchanging tableaux outside of the boxcar. Starting off at an objective distance the stationery camera approaches the boy until we're more intimate with the geography of his face. As the boy is being singled out for viewer sympathy the filmmaker surreptitiously assigns blame towards the father in due part to these found facial nuances effectuated by the maternal camera. Although the father refuses alcohol from their first benefactor near the train station the collegeeducated widower reverts to fullblown alcoholism during their second major detour from the road a tempestuous worklodging arrangement with a drunken Stalin sympathizer. The optimism on the boy's face is a telltale sign of the twofold journeythe geographical and the personal that they're embarking on in which the father's road to recovery encompasses the road to Koktebel.Soon after being kicked off the train by a cordial provincial train conductor the boy finds himself staring at an outhouse while the syncopation of electronic music emanates from a small boombox hanging on a tree. This dialectic of aggressive music and the silent countryside is suggestive of futurism in which contemporary life as expressed by the relatively cacophonic sounds provide an unlikely soundtrack to the pastoral setting. Futurism proclaimed that a roaring car that seems to be driving under shrapnel is more beautiful than the Vixtory of Samothrace. When the teenaged girl emerges from the outhouse the boy later in the day demonstrates his own brand of futurismindependent of the Italian and Russian movements when he tells the girl I can see everything from above and covers his eyes with a single hand as a prelude to his flair for astralprojection. In the next scene we see a god'seye view of the village.

On a path in the dark among the denuded trees and wild foilage he puts another hand across his eyes keeps it there for a beat then resumes his walking. Upon arriving in Koktebel the symbolism of the birds reveals itself as an albatross tries to steal the bread from out of the boy's possession while he sits alone on the lonely dockthe end of one but not two journeys. He grabs the seabird by the neck asserts control with a chokehold before conceding to its beating wing and cry and releases the avian machine to the sky. In the final scene the viewer sees what was behind the boy's hand during his sojourn another god's eye view in which the father approaches then sits down next to his son at the end of a pier.

	schema:headline " This is not a good film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Koktebel is a very poor film made by obviously inexperienced directors. It centres on a father and son as they make their way from Moscow to the Crimea. Without money they have to hitch lifts get work when they can and rely on others' generosity. The film has enormous potential that is almost completely wasted by the directors. The cinematography which clearly could make a film like this wonderful is bad. The directors take the 'banale detail' camerawork to a new level in a clear imitation of better Russian directors like Tarkovsky or Sokhurov but carry it off badly so that it becomes boring and sentimental. This is a real shame since the Russian landscape is exceptionally beautiful in its sparseness and this is hardly captured at all. The directors are probably trying to show the the point of view of the 11yearold protagonist but it results in a pretentious and cloying film. Neither the script nor the acting are so bad but the directors make unfair demands on the child actor playing the son spoiling what would have otherwise been a solid performance. There are occasional good scenes but the narrative lacks continuity and is horribly selfconscious social stereotypes appear from the wings making it seem like the directors have a ticklist of emotions they want to convey. The continual use of music not a bad but an inappropriate piece by Chick Corea compounds the sentimentality of the film. Avoid it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Koktebel is a very poor film made by obviously inexperienced directors. It centres on a father and son as they make their way from Moscow to the Crimea. Without money they have to hitch lifts get work when they can and rely on others' generosity. The film has enormous potential that is almost completely wasted by the directors. The cinematography which clearly could make a film like this wonderful is bad. The directors take the 'banale detail' camerawork to a new level in a clear imitation of better Russian directors like Tarkovsky or Sokhurov but carry it off badly so that it becomes boring and sentimental. This is a real shame since the Russian landscape is exceptionally beautiful in its sparseness and this is hardly captured at all.

	schema:reviewBody "'Amar' is very much a typical film of the 50s. The screenplay though interesting is very flawed leaving several plot holes. The editing is quite messy in places. In the first half it moves at a sluggish pace but in most of the second half it jumps from scene to scene at a rapid pace that actually ended up confusing me. Even though it is a very melodramatic the background score is extremely intrusive. Songs are very nice but excessive and really stretch screenplay it's a long film. Characterisation also suffers. The Jayant character at times seems evil and at times seems kindhearted. Even Nimmi's character suffers due to poor writing. She's a very poor but cheerful hyperactive wild village peasant. When she gets raped by none other than the man she's attracted to we see her pain and confusion but later she is shown to fall in love with her rapist something that was quite common in older Bollywood films. This may be because she forgave him when Amar admitted to her at her wedding ceremony that he didn't have the guts to admit the truth but a lot more was needed to show the development of her feelings.A few scenes have been brilliantly shot. For example the scene at Sonia's wedding ceremony with the three main leads the scenes between Nimmi and Madhubala and the scene where Nimmi hides underwater to save herself from the evil Jayant. Performances are great too especially the two leading ladies. Though one might say that Nimmi is loud and tends to go overboard I thought she played the character with complete ease and did nothing short of a fine job. Madhubala does an equally wonderful job. One of the other things that stand out is the contrast director Mehboob Khan shows between these two characters. One is that of a wealthy calm gentle and helpful lady and the other a poor but cheerful energetic young lass. Dilip Kumar does well in most parts but sometimes he seems to have difficulty with his emotional expressions. However he conveys Amar's guilt with gusto. So what really do stand out are the performances and the nice songs but they're too much. I'd recommend it to fans of the actors. As for Mehboob Khan his unforgettable 'Mother India' stands on a much higher pedestal than 'Amar'.".

It starts out playfully enough with unrefined milkmaid Sonia played by Nimmi chatting to her farmyard animals to some wondrous photography in a studio forest and studio house sets  the lighting was sometimes mesmerising sometimes laughably melodramatic. And that's also the main problem with the film itself the underlying theme veers wildly from serious social commentary and a study in guilt and contrition to incongruous slapstick  while the beautiful music by Naushad and poetry from Badayuni provides a stable continuity impeccably sung by Lata. Rafi got only the one song in here the oftrepeated main theme and moral instruction Insaaf Ka Mandir Hai but my favourite was Ek Baat Kahoon with Asha singing for Nimmi at the fair a wonderful tune accompanied by whirling dancers and much activity.Madhubala seldom looked more beautiful than when she flared her nostrils in contempt or anger so pity poor Dilip and his already mixed emotions whenever that happened in here! So many questions can be asked by the finish sweaty Shankat was a nasty character yet what were we supposed to think of all his genuinely altruistic motives as the picture unfolded? Was Anju's selfsacrifice and selfeffacement meant to appear so profound? Would Amarnath really let his social standing slip? And would Sonia have let him? Did the mob let them live to decide? Not that it mattered but what happened to her father and stepmother? However even with all these and other unanswered legal and moral questions it's an engrossing and entertaining journey and well worth watching and weighingup.".

The running time 145 minutes is far too long for the slight storyline and is padded out with a neverending stream of songs that add nothing to the primarily tragic story.

The editing is also extremely untidy almost irritating at times and renders certain elements of the story ambiguous to say the least.AMAR like many Indian movies of the period relies heavily on spectacle. It's therefore a shame that it was filmed in blackandwhite  no doubt an economic not artistic decision  because in BW it is visually a sometimes cluttered movie and one that relies on a Cinderella storyline that would undoubtedly be enhanced by colour despite its relatively negative stance.This is a movie written for Indian audiences so it's probably impossible for a western viewer to attempt a fair review  their tastes are different to ours having seen half a dozen Indian flicks over the past few weeks it's clear that that country's audience demands musical interludes in the majority of its tales unless the BBC season has been hopelessly skewed and leans towards fairytale plots.   Nevertheless there is one outstanding scene in this movie in which Sonia the peasant girl having eluded Sankat the village bully crawls around the bottom of a pond to avoid the steps of Sankat as he searches for her.   Her moves are concealed by the thunderstorm that rages overhead the whole episode may be intended as a homage to silent cinema but this being a 50s Indian movie it's impossible to be sure and the ingenuity evident in the filming of this scene epitomises what is so frustrating about Indian cinema of this period nuggets of sublime creativity hidden within a surfeit of hyperbole.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amar Akbar and Anthony are separated from their family and from each other as small children and each is raised separately and in a different faith. Amar is raised a Hindu and grows up to become a police officer Akbar is raised a Muslim and grows up to become a Qawaali singer whilst Anthony is raised Christian and grows up to be a small time hoodlum.Most of the movie is focussed on the character of Anthony which is fine by me since he is played by Amitabh Bachchan  surely the most charismatic actor India has ever produced.As adults none of the brothers have any idea of their familial origins but believe their parents to be dead. To make matters worse each parent thinks the other is dead and both think their children are dead. It must be said that they didn't go to great lengths to discover this but the film would hardly have worked if they had so that's one piece of disbelief that has to be suspended. It's not the last one as the film is wholly guided by a series of coincidences that gradually has the various members of the family crossing each others paths. I suppose one is encouraged to believe that these coincidences are orchestrated by the fates or a higher power but putting it down to dramatic convenience worked just as well for me.Also brought into the plot are the loves of the three brothers for the requisite romance and feminine wisdom. The boys are lucky enough to have secured the affections of a bevy of beauties and the actresses add a nice touch of glamour and colour to the film. In addition to and intersecting with these we have the evil villain of the piece carrying the terribly intimidating name of Robert.At 175 minutes Amar Akbar Anthony has plenty of time to flesh out its characters and develop the plot in a well paced fashion. The movie goes through many different moods and emotions but after the first 15 minutes of melodrama the tone is generally kept light and pleasant.As well as the romance and drama the movie has a few moments where it shifts into action territory  Anthony especially has a knack for getting into a scuffle. The fights are very imaginatively choreographed but terribly executed looking very staged and faked. This all adds to the fun of them though. There's also the songs of course though not too many  especially in the first half of the film. Some of these are very catchy and the dance choreography cheerfully engaging.Although it has something of an ensemble cast there is no question that the movie belongs to Amitabh. His character is the most complicated and interesting and his performance the most subtle and engaging. He gets all the best lines too. He won the best actor award for this role and it is largely for his performance that the movie is considered an Indian classic.Like many Indian movies that run in the three hour range there's something in AAA for everybody and Amitabh's charisma especially means that it never grows wearisome. Although the first half an hour didn't have me terribly engaged the film does just keep getting better and better and more imaginative as it progresses. I had to constantly keep upgrading my rating for the film as I watched. By the time the movie reaches its climax it has managed to weave everything together so well that I was thoroughly delighted to be watching it.Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Amar  Akbar Anthony whenever I hear any of those three names I think of one of the greatest movies I've seen. I'm 15 minutes into the movie and I'm already in tears I couldn't believe a movie like this had so much impact at the first 1520 minutes. This movie was all around a good movie and is a must see. It starts out with a poor male  female who have three children and the poor man is in trouble seeking out some way to get money for his wife's sickness plus food for his children. When he goes to Robert he begs and the emotion he put into that movie was so heavy you could feel the pain the poor man was going trough. Robert was actual one of those guys that made me say Just kill this guy already. Usually I like negative rolls and support the negative rolls but Robert was doing a amazing job. The poor man escapes from the sharp claws from Robert he leaves with a car which was filled with gold. He stops by his house to find a sucide letter from his wife so he takes his kids and drives off to somewhere then put's his kids in some random park. The bad guys start chasing him so Robert tries to lose em but get's tied up in a car accident which he survived I must say that was a very fake part in the movie but every movie has a flaw eh? Oh well anyways he finds the gold which surprisingly isn't burned and runs around the street with it trying to avoid the cops. He goes to the park to see that his kids are nowhere to be found he starts yelling Aman..? He dosen't yell the other two names so it's him screaming AMAN! Akbar was raised by a Muslim by the time he found the child he was going to drive home but to see Akbar's mom in the street then the Muslim guy takes her to her home but she's blind! She has no idea she is in present with one of her kids. Anthony faints at a local church and Amar was found by a police officer. All three of them grew up with pride of there religion so here we are somewhat 20 years later.The mom loses bunch of blood then is rushed to her hospital but what the kids don't know is that they are brothers and they really don't know there real mother nor does the mother know her kids due to her being blind. So Amar Akbar  and Anthony all end up at the same place in the hospital because they have the same blood type of there motherNO DUH!!! so they donate blood all to there mom then here comes the opening cerdits with a very touching song. We get to the journey of the three young men and we find out that Akbar  Anthony are very closeWell at least in the first half so anyways Anthony always refers to the old woman as his mother and so do the other two I think. Anthony also calls Akbar  Amar as his brothers but let's get back to there real dad it seems his the evil guy now LMFAO! But Robert get's away with bunch of gold and Anthony somehow helps him out for a little bit in the movie but what happens? Will Robert regain control of money and power again? Will Amar Akbar Anthony find the truth? Will the mom ever be able to see her children again? Watch the blockbuster to find out.Also the girl who fell in love with Amar did horrible acting at first she said she stole money because there family was poor but she looked like she was giving false informationworst crying in a movie I've seen I wouldn't believe her no matter what but it turns out she told the truth. I was shocked..".

The plot was not original but how it is packaged is extraordinary.The story for those who don't already know is about three brothers who get separated from their parents and how their lives intertwine. One is brought up by a Hindu one by a Christian and the other by a Muslim. Years later they meet when they give blood to their real mother they don't know that yet. Their FatherKishenlal is seeking vengeance on Robert who he blames for separating his family. Coincidentally he is also bringing up Jenny Robert's daughter who he stole from him. Cues heaps of fun for all ages. The songs also deserves a special mention all of them are perfect. My personal favourite was the title song. This was a huge hit when released and it my opinion remains of Manmohan Desai's best films. All the three heroes performed well however on the downside there was not much scope on the heroines. Another downside was Jeevanin my opinion he is not good as the main villain. Pran and Nirupa Roy were superb as the parents. Coincidentally 4 years later Manmohan Desai made Naseeb another one of my favourite movies. Wonderfully done well done Manmohan Desai.".

	schema:reviewBody "Manmohan Desai never mixed logic in his films but made good entertainers especially in 1970s AAA was the first film with Amitabh Bachchan. The film is another film on long lost and found theme The film is treated more on a lighthearted note Amitabh's character called Anthony who is a rogue and runs illegal liqour business however he is brought up by a priest. while Vinod Khanna playing Amar is brought up by A Policeman and he becomes a tailor while Rishi gets brought up by a Muslim tailor. The first half is more on the romance of all 3 characters and some funny scenes between Vinod Khanna and Amitabh. Strangely all three hardly interact much while AB and Rishi have a cordial friendship AB and Vinod Khanna have 23 scenesThere is also a scene where all 3 give blood to the motherwatch it to believe. The film also has villain Jeevan with a big gang and also Hercules There are several scenes to remember like ABVinod fight AB drunk actwhich was shot without the director just by AB and Kader Khan who was dialogue writer The first scene of AB and Pran. There are many songs however in fact 2 songs My Name and Humo Tumse come within a short gap yet the film is entertaining and keeps you entertained throughout It does get lengthy but those days films were made mostly which were 3 hours. Direction by MDK is good Music by LP is memorable be it Kishore's My Name is Anthony Mohammad Rafi's duets Parda and Sai Baba the combo song Humko Tumse which for the first time brought Mukesh Rafi and Kishore in one song The title song too is good.Amitabh Bachchan is simply terrific in his role it seems second skin In the same year he starred in Parvarish with MDk where he had a cop role This film also won him his first best actor award. Rishi Kapoor is good too in his act Vinod Khanna is good in a serious role in the same year he and Amitabh worked in Parvarish where they played diverse roles. Amongst heroines Shabana Azmi is okay Neetu Singh is fun loving while Parveen Babi is good Pran is good as usual Jeevan is good in his own style Ranjeet Yusuf Khan Nazir Hussain are all good Nirupa Roy is as usual".

	schema:reviewBody "Heidi is a Swiss Germanlanguage movie from 1952 so this one has its 65th anniversary this year. It was directed by Luigi Comencini and written by a whole lot of writers who adapted Johanna Spyri's famous original work. This 95minute film here is a relatively early version of the known story about a young girl who has to move to the city but suffers because she belongs to the mountains. But it is by far not the earliest. I think one problem here is the lack of color for me. The cinematography costumes and more from Heidi really scream for color and it elevates the material by so much and actually around that time there are already many color films out there but this one here is in blackandwhite. This is probably also one reason why I like the later Austrian version more than this one here. Another may be that the actress who played Heidi did very little for me here and same goes for the actor who plays her grandfather. It was a nice little surprise to see Theo Lingen in here even if he doesn't have a great deal of screen time at all but the clear standouts here were the ones who played Klara and Frulein Rottenmeier I guess and they stayed somewhat memorable to me. Apart from that however nothing really did and that's why I have to give this one here a thumbsdown. It also did not feel as much from the heart really compared to other Heidi films like the one I already mentioned or also for example the very recent one starring Bruno Ganz as the grandfather. A bit of a pity but I think you should skip this one here and check out one of these.".

	onyx:emotionText "Heidi is a Swiss Germanlanguage movie from 1952 so this one has its 65th anniversary this year. It was directed by Luigi Comencini and written by a whole lot of writers who adapted Johanna Spyri's famous original work. This 95minute film here is a relatively early version of the known story about a young girl who has to move to the city but suffers because she belongs to the mountains. But it is by far not the earliest. I think one problem here is the lack of color for me. The cinematography costumes and more from Heidi really scream for color and it elevates the material by so much and actually around that time there are already many color films out there but this one here is in blackandwhite. This is probably also one reason why I like the later Austrian version more than this one here.

	schema:reviewBody "A chance encounter in a coffee shop between two people both of whom are seeking their own identities one literally one figuratively leads to a relationship seemingly beneficial to both but for different reasons in Amateur' written and directed by Hal Hartley.  A man Martin Donovan wakes up one morning lying on his back in a quiet outoftheway street in New York City all he knows is that he's bleeding from the back of his head and is suffering from total amnesia.  He has no identification on him he has no idea who he is or how he came to be on that street.  Dazed he stumbles into a small coffee shop and sits down at the counter.  He tries to order something but the only money he has is Dutch and he has no idea why. A young woman also sitting at the counter and working on a laptop computer observes his plight and notices the blood on the back of his neck.Her name is Isabelle Isabelle Huppert asking for some water she cleans his injury and buys him something to eat.  Isabelle it turns out is a former nun having only recently left the convent after fifteen years. Rather lost herself she is attempting to make a living by writing pornographic stories for a magazine.  A selfprofessed nymphomaniac though she is still a virgin she also feels that she has a specific purpose in life a destiny she has yet to fulfill though she has yet to figure out what it is.  But she believes that meeting this man is a sign perhaps he's a part of whatever it is she has to do.  So she decides to help him which just may lead her to the answers she is seeking about her own life as well. As with all of Hartley's films this one has a somewhat mesmerizing effect which he exacts with a unique style of presenting his story that has to do with the look and feel of the film the deliberate pace he establishes and most especially the manner in which his actors deliver their lines.  His performers speak with a rather stoic matteroffact understated rhythm that is engrossing in itself very similar to the kind of cadence David Mamet employs in his films.  But Hartley's method is even more pronounced so that when one of his characters does have an emotional outburst the underplaying that surrounds it significantly underscores the impact of it all.  Few directors have such a unique style that so vividly identifies their work  Mamet is one Ingmar Bergman another the three of them being part of a very select group.  And though this particular film is not perhaps one of Hartley's best it is still pure Hartley with aspects that are certainly engaging and memorable beginning with his main character Isabelle.  Talk about an offthewall character!  And yet within the context of the story she comes across as quite real and believable which says something about Huppert's ability as an actress as well as Hartley's expertise as a director.Huppert gives a very credible performance here convincingly conveying that sense of confusion Isabelle obviously harbors deep within about her own life and where she's headed.  She makes you realize that beyond anything else that's happening this is essentially a person searching for a place to fit in which is why she makes such a connection with this stranger this man who really has no idea of who he is or where he belongs.  And Huppert certainly makes Isabelle someone with whom it is easy to empathize.Donovan a veteran of many of Hartley's films is very effective here also with a very pensive understated performance that clearly indicates an honest sense of this man's bewilderment as does the very real caution with which he approaches his situation as he attempts to reorient himself and get on with his life.  And Hartley develops the relationship between Isabelle and this man in real time there's no instant love affair here as happens so often in cinematic renderings of similar situations which gives a ring of authenticity to the story bizarre as it may get.The supporting cast includes Elina Lowensohn Sofia Damian Young Edward Chuck Montgomery Jan Dave Simonds Kurt and Pamela Stewart Officer Melville.  No one can capture a sense of disenfranchisement any better than Hartley as the characters in Amateur' so aptly illustrate these are people perpetually on the outside looking in and yet there's something about them with which you will be able to relate as well as sympathize .  And that's part of Hartley's magic making you realize that in the end we're not so different from one another after all.  I rate this one 710.".

	schema:headline " Offbeat funny drama from a true original";
	schema:reviewBody "Hal Hartley is just my allout favourite auteur director brought me through my teens and helped form my world view. When he makes a film you're in for something that is at the very least interesting and at best moves you creates a new world out of the one you're already in shows you the art in life. That sounds pretentious and some might think his films are too but that's just the kneejerk effect that comes with overexposure to rubbish presented as if it's art. But one good Hal Hartley film cures a soul wearied with too much dross. Amateur is up there with Trust and The Unbelievable Truth if you have any time at all for films which are offkilter intelligent and which depart from the linear norm. They're also very funny in a lowkey way. His actors are usually regulars skilled at his unique poetic and rhythmic script style. His America is intriguing a place painted with the eye of a true original and presented with a rigour entirely absent from many more recent socalled independent American films. Another reviewer here noted the strong European flavour in his work this is quite right and if you enjoy a varied experience of film I can't see how you wouldn't like his best. The plot of Amateur is crazy and contorted like a dance with a fascinating premise and a weird logic of its own. Martin Donovan here is Hartley's muse he perfectly captures the rapid deadpan delivery and manages to be charming and mysterious dangerous and vulnerable with minimal changes in expression. Why his career has stayed largely smallscale is beyond me. Perhaps he goes about his work too quietly perhaps his jaw isn't chiselled enough I don't know.But Isabelle Huppert is outstanding as the struggling porn writer fresh out of the convent. Says her scumbagwithaheart publisher of her attempts The problem is it's quitebad. It's poetry and don't you try and deny it. And it is poetry heartbreakingly so. She looks out at the strange world uniquely innocent with her big solemn eyes and you instinctively feel with her and wish her a knight to watch over her. And of course this being Hal Hartley's world her protector arrives uniquely flawed. He could be Grandma or he could be the Wolf. Excellent goodlooking and intriguing.".

	schema:headline " Offbeat mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a mystery that seems to want to satirize mysteries in general and while I had a little trouble with the script its the presence of Isabelle Huppert that adds the interest to the film. Story is about a former nun named Isabelle Huppert who meets a man Martin Donovan with amnesia and helps him out. There is also a French porno actress named Sofia Elina Lowensohn who was the one that pushed the man out the window and gave him amnesia. She meets Edward Damian Young who is hiding out from corporate gangsters and they seek some floppy discs with pertinent information on them. Sofia steals the discs and tries to get money from the gangsters but they doublecross her and grab Edward whom they recognize. Meanwhile Isabelle and the man try and figure out who he is and they find a connection to Sofia and find her in trouble with gangsters chasing her. Film is directed by independent veteran Hal Hartley and he adds some very unusual touches to the script and the characters. The gangsters chasing everyone were former accountants and they talk like accountants even when they are about to torture someone. But the heart of the film is Huppert and I have always found her fascinating to watch. In this film she appears to be very docile and timid but at the same time we can see that she craves excitement and love. In some of the scenes Huppert has nothing to say and she just allows her gaze to wander off and I found these moments very effective as she seems to be thinking of something relevant in her life. Even when she does nothing she's interesting to watch and its one of the reasons why she is considered on of the best actress's in the world. Also Parker Posey appears as a punk girl and Tim Blake Nelson pops up as a detective. Offbeat film mat be to different for the casual viewer but fans of Huppert should take a look.".

First part of the movie was Chabrollike and it's a complement second is more action but far from modern American action movies that I don't like.  This change is well made it has reasons according to the development of the plot.    spoilers including end of movie !!  The movie shows a few days that make a whole life for two main characters. Isabelle was lethargic almost in a hibernation living in a nunnery and later waiting for things to happen now she feels she found the purpose of her existence to fulfill the task she has been given by Holy Virgin and starts living.  At the end of the movie she succeeded in doing it her possible lover is killed she is left empty and seems emotionally dead.  For Thomas the situation is even more extreme suffering complete amnesia it's as if he was born on the beginning of the movie and physically dies at the end.  His death is absurd though he was a criminal ruining many lives he is punished for crimes he because of amnesia doesn't even know he did. And it makes this execution as pointless as in Easy Rider or Blue Soldier.Photography was better indoors than outdoors restaurant in the beginning Sofia and the rose or empty room where Edward was tortured good camera angles in country house when Edward looks for Thomas.  In a borderreality movie like this some use of slowmotion or Hamiltonlike soft photo could be expected but maybe it would look to much like a dream Isabelle or nightmare Thomas or too profane so the director didn't do it. Interesting use of carefully chosen objects like a lamp in empty room it seems to be the guy's only possession in a place he uses to make love and now it is used for violence for torturing.  spoilersfree part  I don't know how many people will enjoy this movie.  It's not like old French crime movies Delon Belmondo Ventura or modern American action movies so if you expect it be careful.  Maybe you'll like it I did.  But I like Chabrol and old filmnoir movies so if you're closer to my taste and if you prefer visual beauty and mood instead of action and dynamic change of scenes this could be a movie for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are certain films that remain powerful over time. Many years from now I stumbled over this movie by chance when zapping through the TV channels. I remember well that the zapping came to an end immediately as I was fascinated by the movie from the 1st second. It then turned out that I had missed only the first 3 minutes as the first scene then was a man with no memory stumbling into a NY coffee shop where he meets Isabelle Huppert what the hack was she doing in an American movie! a young wannabe writer who is offended by the waitress for sitting there all day long and not consuming enough while writing. She feels sorry for the lost man and takes him home to her place where she warns him to be careful for her being a nymphomaniac. When shortly later we get to know that she is an exnun and still a virgin then the positive weirdness of the movie has already become obvious.The rest of the movie is about the search of the man's forgotten past which turns out to be an unpleasant and violent one. As a consequence the movie turns into a gangster movie a bit like film noir but still different. It remains bizarre with meant to be pornographic stories being poetry complaints about a square stiff thing being called a floppy disc yes it is a film from the 90's or a female police officer who is just too warmhearted to deal with the harshness that life brings into her office.Usually I am not such a big fan of stories with someone suffering from amnesia but in this case it is really well done. Martin Donovan does a good job in showing how his character is torn between the curiosity in revealing his past and the anxiety to find out what a bad character he used to be and maybe still is? If you intend to find a weak point in the movie it may be the clumsiness of the killers which is a bit unbelievable. Be it! It is still 9 out of 10 points.".

The story evolves around a nun who leaves the convent because she believes that she is a nymphomaniac. But yet she's never had sex. She decides to start writing pornographic stories for a porn magazine to vent her sexual frustration. Soon she meets an injured man who has amnesia. Little does the nun know but this man has ties to the porn industry. She has a spiritual revelation and decides to help this man find out who he is. This leads them both into trouble with hired assassins and crazed accountants. A wild story indeed...Most mystery films focus on the identity of the bad guy. This film instead chooses to explore the bad guy's identity. The film opens with him laying unconscious on a cobblestone street. He awakes but has no idea who he is. With this premise the audience always knows who the bad guy is. He is in almost every frame of the feature. The rest of the film sets about discovering who the bad guy is. Most scenes are arranged as artfully as a painting the actors understand and enlarge Hartley's vision and the music ranging from Liz Phair to Pavement is excellent. Great characters dialogue and nice tips of the hat to the human condition with some good laughs as well.Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read every comment posted in regards to Anatomie 2 and I am strapped to find a positive review of it. I do understand why people have not enjoyed this movie but I don't know if those people really got it'.Anatomie 2 is not trying to live up to it's predecessor instead it is attempting to evolve to a grander more intelligent film. The first movie came directly to us via the Slasher Genre this movie is presented as a more sophisticated Thriller. This also means that there is a great deal less of the gore fx.It is really good to see German films reaching a grand audience over the past few years. Once upon a time Wim Wnders was about the only name people knew from German films. Now we have so many great films from the Fatherland. Films like Run Lola Run Anatomy and Goodbye Lenin! Hopefully none of them will be tainted by Hollywood remakes. I did not like this film nearly as much as the first Anatomie however it doesn't deserve half of the back lash it has received. It still remains a great and suspenseful piece of German cinema. A lot less shock and gore but probably more suspense and panic than part 1.. I give this movie 8 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have read every comment posted in regards to Anatomie 2 and I am strapped to find a positive review of it. I do understand why people have not enjoyed this movie but I don't know if those people really got it'.Anatomie 2 is not trying to live up to it's predecessor instead it is attempting to evolve to a grander more intelligent film. The first movie came directly to us via the Slasher Genre this movie is presented as a more sophisticated Thriller. This also means that there is a great deal less of the gore fx.It is really good to see German films reaching a grand audience over the past few years. Once upon a time Wim Wnders was about the only name people knew from German films. Now we have so many great films from the Fatherland. Films like Run Lola Run Anatomy and Goodbye Lenin! Hopefully none of them will be tainted by Hollywood remakes. I did not like this film nearly as much as the first Anatomie however it doesn't deserve half of the back lash it has received. It still remains a great and suspenseful piece of German cinema. A lot less shock and gore but probably more suspense and panic than part 1.. I give this movie 8 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Sequel on par with the first";
	schema:reviewBody "This 2003 movie is the sequel to the original from 3 years earlier and as the first film is one of Germany's most known films abroad this is probably one of Germany's most known sequels abroad. The writer and director is Austrian Stefan Ruzowitzky again later an Academy Award winner in the Foreign Language category. But there are changes too. First of all the lead actor is Barnaby Metschurat this time and he did not appear in the first film. Franka Potente returns too but only has a supporting role this time. Also this film does not have that many horror aspects as the first such as severed fingers or stuffed humans. It's really more of a psychological crime movie.However I have to say that I was not impressed at all by Metschurat. He looks like a young Ludwig Trepte to me and has equally little dramatic range. There is a reason why almost all the supporting players in this movie have bigger careers in 2015 than him. This includes Herbert Knaup Frank Giering no bigger career obviously but more known August Diehl Heike Makatsch the Mhring brothers Martin Brammbach a personal favorite and especially Hanno Kofler who plays the protagonists wheelchairbound brother in here and is really a rising star right now. Another difference between this film and the original is that in there the real villain was not the powerful greedy old man but his young assistants. Here the number one villain is easily Herbert Knaup and Makatsch to a smaller extent and he proves once again that he is a very talented actor. He carries this film from start to finish especially in those moments when Metschurat's shortcomings become painfully clear. Knaup and Potente already played in Lola rennt together and it brought him a German Film Award win.The runtime is fairly identical with the first film only slightly longer but still under the 40minute mark. All in all I would say this is on par with the original. Both are decent thrillers but there really is no greatness attached to any of them. Sadly this one here has the far worse lead performance but the cast as a whole is better this time. So it stays basically the same. Recommended for people who enjoy thrillers or are just curious in general about German cinema.".

There is a reason why almost all the supporting players in this movie have bigger careers in 2015 than him. This includes Herbert Knaup Frank Giering no bigger career obviously but more known August Diehl Heike Makatsch the Mhring brothers Martin Brammbach a personal favorite and especially Hanno Kofler who plays the protagonists wheelchairbound brother in here and is really a rising star right now. Another difference between this film and the original is that in there the real villain was not the powerful greedy old man but his young assistants. Here the number one villain is easily Herbert Knaup and Makatsch to a smaller extent and he proves once again that he is a very talented actor. He carries this film from start to finish especially in those moments when Metschurat's shortcomings become painfully clear. Knaup and Potente already played in Lola rennt together and it brought him a German Film Award win.The runtime is fairly identical with the first film only slightly longer but still under the 40minute mark. All in all I would say this is on par with the original. Both are decent thrillers but there really is no greatness attached to any of them. Sadly this one here has the far worse lead performance but the cast as a whole is better this time. So it stays basically the same. Recommended for people who enjoy thrillers or are just curious in general about German cinema.";

At any rate rather than give away any of the mysteries or ruin the suspense I will just say that this movie progresses in a logical and dark manner.

The movie itself follows different characters and a totally different story this time which is actually a positive thing until its last third came along.I was actually very pleased with the movie at first and thought it was a much better movie than the first one. Thing that it did way better was that it wasn't trying to be an horror movie this time but instead went with a more thriller and even sciencefiction type of approach. It suited the concept story and atmosphere of the movie well and it made it way more pleasant to watch and follow compared to the first movie.So what went wrong? It actually was the final third of the movie that almost completely ruined the movie for me. The movie suddenly started to take such a ridicules approach with its story that I suddenly felt detached from anything to was happening in the story and from all of its characters. I won't say that it ruined the movie completely but it did ruin a lot for me.Another thing that the movie did not handled very well was its main character. Problem I had with him was that in the first half of the movie or so he was still involved with the 'bad guys' and kept working with them even though as a viewer you of course already know that these are the 'bad guys' and no good will come from their experiments. Thing is he stayed involved and friendly with them for far too long so when he finally starts to turn his back on them and fight back it feels a bit forced and somewhat unlikely even. It doesn't even really make sense once you start thinking about it. He could had so easily gone to the police or some of his superiors at the hospital and all of the mayhem would had stopped immediately. Instead he puts his own life and that of others on the line to put a halt to things.It's so disappointing since the movie was well on its way to become a way better movie than its predecessor and a pretty good movie of its own. Now I really wouldn't rate it much better than the first one and I'm glad there isn't a third movie yet.510 httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In due credit at least it does go for a different angle but in doing so. It totally missed the point in what made the original film effective in what it set out to do. The premise has a complicatedly overheated and radical vision which did gain my interest to only have trouble keeping it. This is when it becomes overpopulated with ludicrous assumptions meandering pockets and very corny theatrics. There's very little room for intensity suspense action and even menace. Without these aspects there's just no bang for your buck here. Those things made the original entertaining especially how creepy sterile and gruesome it could be. None of this even occurs on this outing and it registers as just another systematic thriller with comic Scifi brushes.The verbose script is carefully structured with it dealing with the chemistry of body enhancements junkie addiction and even touching on the immigrants' plights. But it does skip out on the fun and no real surprises are integrated into the fodder. While the story does seem to rush along this is more towards Stefan Ruzowitzky's slickly accomplished direction. He illustrates quite an unique style and has a higher budget to work off but considering that it didn't too much for the film's final outcome. Screaming throughout is an upscale rock soundtrack interwoven into the humming musical score and agile camerawork has an untamed air to it. Editing is thick and fast by trying to be ultrahip and mixing it slowmotion when they decide to up the film's ante. After a impressive opening that grabs hold it doesn't really hit its straps until a good 75 minutes have past. Performances are above par. Franke Potente returns but only in a minor role as the policewoman who's trying to convict the wrong doers of medical trade. In the lead Barnaby Metschurat is sincerely likable and naturally good as Joachim. The beautifully capable Filipina Rosie Alvarez is innocently sweet as the concerned and caring nurse Lee. Heike Makatsch stuns in her intoxicatedly sexy turn as Viktoria one of the interns in on the experiment. Herbert Knaup is perfect as the egotistically clinical Professor MullerLaRousse.While removing itself far from it predecessor with an expansively formidable if preposterous.  concept it does lack the edge and atmosphere to simply leave this one to be quite a lacklustre medical Scifi thriller.".

This doctor hits it lucky and meets some very important doctors who are very famous and is accepted into their hospital. After being in the hospital for a brief period of time he meets a young female doctor who asks him to strip naked and even grabs his private parts for a sex experiment. As the film progresses there are very weird experiments performed and plenty of drugs are being used constantly through out this hospital. Some parts of the hospital are nothing but Butcher Shops with plenty of blood and gore plus plenty of cuts being performed on human bodies. The only female in the picture is very hot to trot but is very ugly and old.".

With few allies such as his mentor John Newton a slave ship captain turned repentant priest who penned the great hymn Amazing Grace Prime William Pitt and Olaudah Equiano the erudite former slave turned author Wilberforce fruitlessly fights both public indifference and moneyed opposition determined to keep their exploitation safe.

A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is an inspiring story based on a legendary historical British Member of Parliament William Wilberforce. During the late 18th century and early 19th century a very young Wilberforce is elected to Parliament and over the course of several decades leads the fight to ban slavery.Today this seems like an easy obvious and intuitive decision. But this was not so 200 years ago. The film clearly explains the entrenched economic motives and the political motives for slavery. Wilberforce starts out as almost a force of one and slowly builds abolitionist momentum by brilliant oratory political maneuvers and appealing to his fellow man's better nature.Ioan Gruffudd is totally believable in explaining to the audience the complexity and heroism of Wilberforce. Wilberforce over the course of his life is sickly and strong religious and worldly naive and romantic and idealistic and practical.During the course of this mostly political story we get to see the immense cruelty shown to the captured Africans turned into slaves. We are shown the slave sailing ships where the captured are treated inhumanely and die of starvation neglect disease and filth. Man's inhumanity to man was never worse.Wilberforce is a great man of history even though mostly forgotten today. He respected his fellow man regardless of their station in life. He was always willing to sacrifice his life and health to help others. And his compassion and spirit was always masked by his humility. He is a hero for all ages.This is a period piece and you are lost in it because of the attention to detail. The sets art direction and costumes allow you to totally suspend disbelief and be moved by the story.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

The older actors though Michael Gambon and Albert Finney were shameless scene stealers but one can hardly fault them for their excellence. There were many things to like about this film. It was gorgeous to look at brilliantly capturing the look and sound of a sumptuous age. The pacing and editing were fine though the device using flashbacks for most of the film occasionally led to a moments confusion about when a scene was supposed to be taking place. And the story itself is quite inspirational. A note for my Canadian readers and the Canadians who attended the TIFF screenings. The film mostly covered the struggle to outlaw slavery in Britain itself though they did touch on Wilberforce's efforts to have it outlawed throughout the British Empire. This continued in the years after the conclusion of the film and a Bill to do just that was passed in 1833 a month after Wilberforce died. So the film we watched was very much about our own history and the story of the abolition of slavery in Britain directly affected the eventual abolition of slavery in Canada.".

Why do I think Oscar when I think of his part? Every moment he was on screen drew you deeper and deeper into identifying with William Wilberforce until at the end when he finally achieves his life's work you want to clap right along with the people applauding him on screen! When he suffers you suffer right along with him. From the wry twist of his lips to the pain and devastation in his eyes to the fervent body language as he makes point after impassioned point you are right there living Wilberforce's life.The most charming parts were fodder provided by the fabulous screen writing and brought to electric life by Ioan Gruffudd as impassioned Wilberforce Benedict Cumberpatch as driven and farseeing William Pitt P.M. Romola Garai as Wilberforce's zesty and feisty wife Barbara and the surprisingly fantastic delivery by Jeremy Swift as Ioan's longsuffering wise butler. Jeremy has a way of delivering a comic line with a punch to your chest that bursts into laughter! Benedict and Ioan have clear chemistry as friends with a vision for the future. You can't help but believe these two would choose to be brothers if they could. But the best and most connected relationship was between Ioan as Wilberforce and Romola as his wife. You could feel the way they were already together even while their characters were still protesting on screen.Michael Apted riveted the audience bringing to life politics in a way that made you wish you could run out and find a cause of your own to champion. Again I say Oscar. I have rarely attended a movie where the audience clapped to the point of hurting their fingers with the thunder they were creating for so bloody long! Entirely throughout the actor credits the audience applauded only varying the volume for those performances they particularly appreciated. Ioan Gruffudd Benedict Cumberpatch Romola Garai Jeremy Swift Michael Gambon and Albert Finney.All in all a tour de force movie that should impact everyone with the IMPORTANCE of trying to change that which is NOT RIGHT.Congratulations to everyone who worked on Amazing Grace. Truly wonder was on screen today.".

You can't help but believe these two would choose to be brothers if they could. But the best and most connected relationship was between Ioan as Wilberforce and Romola as his wife. You could feel the way they were already together even while their characters were still protesting on screen.Michael Apted riveted the audience bringing to life politics in a way that made you wish you could run out and find a cause of your own to champion. Again I say Oscar. I have rarely attended a movie where the audience clapped to the point of hurting their fingers with the thunder they were creating for so bloody long! Entirely throughout the actor credits the audience applauded only varying the volume for those performances they particularly appreciated. Ioan Gruffudd Benedict Cumberpatch Romola Garai Jeremy Swift Michael Gambon and Albert Finney.All in all a tour de force movie that should impact everyone with the IMPORTANCE of trying to change that which is NOT RIGHT.Congratulations to everyone who worked on Amazing Grace. Truly wonder was on screen today.";

	schema:headline " The redemption story of something terrible into something beautiful";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure this past week of seeing a prescreening outside of Washington D.C. of the movie Amazing Grace starring Reed Richards...err...Ioan Gruffudd as William Wilberforce  the famous British Christian politician that helped end the slave trade in Great Britain in the early 18th Century. The movie progresses through Wilberforce's life from about the time he begins his crusade against the slave trade in Parliament in his early 20's to the time it is eventually abolished. Everything in between is composed of all the hardships victories and relationships he goes through in the meantime. At some points the story can be a bit yawn inducing but the film consistently seems to add just the right amount of humor or political intrigue to keep it afloat more on the pacing below. There is a love interest Barbara played by the quite attractive and dynamic Romola Garai who keeps Mr. Fantastic...err...Wilberforce on track and encouraged. You get the feeling he would've never made it through the hard times without her which is probably the case for most successful men as they say. The film does delve into evils of the slave trade but it doesn't focus specifically on it much like Amistad did focus on it. It seems to keep the main goal in mind abolishing that heinous evil. This gives the film a glass half full feeling instead of a glass half empty one. You find yourself cheering for the good guys instead of seeking the heads of the bad ones.You may be thinking they should've just called this film Amistad The Prequel but that would do it a great disservice. Where Amistad succeeded in many ways such as exposing the horror of the slave trade in much more visual and visceral detail and containing great acting by Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins I feel you ultimately left the theater not really feeling much better about anything. In fact I'd say you may have left if feeling worse maybe even shameful andor guilty. Amazing Grace doesn't feel like that. In fact it's not even really a feel good movie it transcends that status. It's really a do good movie. You almost feel personal empowerment from the story like you want to go out and change some social injustice yourself! Sure we don't all have the political clout of a William Wilberforce but we do have a voice. And I think that's why Amazing Grace stands above previous social injustice films like it. It feels organic instead of static. It feels like it could apply to today instead of some time long forgotten. It also appeals to everyone black white or whoever. One AfricanAmerican in the audience mentioned how he was impressed and encouraged at how passionate these white men were for the plight of the slaves. You also realize that slavery wasn't just an American problem it was a world problem which further emphasized the fact that the social injustice we see today isn't just a fillintheblank problem it's a world problem.I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment very much on the technical aspects of this film but don't let the religious overtones fool you into thinking this is another technical mess like so many in the past. It is on par with any period film of its kind from Hollywood in almost every way acting set design costume design story etc. One thing I found a drawback to it was its pacing though. It starts off fairly tepid and though it builds up it seems to go through a cycle of building up and then falling back down again. This could ultimately be a good thing though because if you can keep your focus throughout the film you'll be in for a very powerful ending that evokes positive emotions you didn't think you had and I think the cyclic nature of the film's progress enhances the fulfillment the ending provides. I also found the time period jumping around within the film to be a bit confusing at some points like some scenes I didn't know if they were in the past or present. The representative at the screening said the movie would be playing on about 850 screens nationwide on its opening weekend Feb. 23. Though this is small compared to most major movies it is a pretty good amount for a smaller movie like this. I recommend going to see it if you're interested in a movie with depth passion character goodness virtue and victory. Does it entertain? Sure. But it seems to do a little more also. You can't say that about too many movies these days. You won't leave wishing you had that 8.50 back. In case you're wondering about the title John Newton the composer of the famous hymn 'Amazing Grace' played powerfully by Albert Finney was a contemporary and friend of William Wilberforce. John Newton was also a reformed exslave trader.".

	schema:headline " An exceptional film about an exceptional man";
	schema:reviewBody "What follows is the text of a letter I composed for my parish bulletin I am a priest and pastor of a University Parish in Tucson after having seen Amazing Grace. I often recommend movies to my parishioners but seldom write a fullfledged review. This weekend I made an exception for an exceptional movie.Dear FriendsIt is a movielovers' favorite weekend Oscar weekend. So I beg your indulgence as I offer not just a movie recommendation but an actual review of the remarkable movie I saw on Friday. I had been hearing about it for several weeks and looking forward to its opening in Tucson. Amazing Grace tells the story of William Wilberforce a young American Revolution era British Parliamentarian who waged a threedecade legislative battle to end Great Britain's involvement in the African slave trade Slavery was outlawed in England six decades before our civil war. Among those who had influenced this remarkable Englishman was John Newton the slave ship captain turned evangelical preacher who penned the lyrics of arguably the best known sacred song in the world which also lends its title to the movie. Newton had known Wilberforce as a child and in the film serves as his conscience when the task is unclear or proves daunting..This is no schmaltzy feelgood biopic. Everything about it is compelling. It is beautifully written and directed. The cinematography and filmediting are superb. The costume and sets are exquisite. And the acting is topnotch. Ioan Gruffudd the young Welchman best known for his excellent portrayal of C.S. Forester's seafaring hero Horatio Hornblower in eight madeforAE movies 19982003 brings great depth and passion to his portrayal of this complex hero of social justice. Gruffudd's star is on the rise. Awardwinning actor Albert Finney graces this picture as an aged and eccentric Newton. The cast is rounded out by a gaggle of veteran British character actors who lend profundity to this compelling story. In addition to the cinematic elements that make this one of the few movies I have seen that I consider to be worth the 9 it costs to see a movie these days it is firstrate storytelling! And Wilberforce is a hero whose story must be told. He grappled with one of my favorite issues the place of faith in public life. As a young man the rising political star began to rediscover an intense faith that had lain dormant for a time. His fire of conviction that something must be done about the slave trade was fueled by this reemerging faith. As he struggled with whether he should use his oratorical talents a politician or a preacher he is convinced that he can use his popularity as an MP to do God's work by actively advocating for the voiceless slaves. The movie presents the story of a man who finds a perfect balance between his faith and his public lifeeach shaping the other in the face of a clear vocation. That his secular realm is that of politics and the time is one of great fear and institutionalized injustice gives this period movie much relevance in today's world. I hope every person of faith watches this movie. I especially think that it is pertinent for our student parishioners who may be struggling with the same issues as Wilburforce. While I fear it would bore younger children it would be good for older children and teens. It opened on Friday at the El Con Cinema. I will be organizing a parish outing to see Amazing Grace in a couple of weeks. Whether you go then or another time I recommend this movie as a great Lenten exercise. I loved it and consider it one of the most socially relevant films I've ever seen. Amazing Grace has long been one of my favorite sacred songs but I will never hear it the same again. Peace Fr. Bart".

	schema:headline " Decent movie of a great story";
	schema:reviewBody "Most people probably have vaguely heard of William Wilberforce without knowing too much about his life. The power of his story and the power of the central issue the abolition of slavery carries this movie that veers from artful to clumsy.The movie can be confusing as it moves back and forth between phases of Wilberforce's life. Often I found myself wondering for a few moments When is this? Also much of the political intrigue has to be inferred since the backgrounds of the various players  particularly Wilberforce's adversaries  are not adequately explained.However the performances are quite good some bordering on excellence. Some might argue that the villains are too simplistically presented but on an issue like slavery it is expected that the opposition would be completely unsympathetic just as Nazis are rarely presented with any hint of sympathy.I am sure the writers took some liberties with history. By the way the tune we now associate with the hymn Amazing Grace did not become the melody for John Newton's famous lyrics until after Wilberforce's death.I just watched this movie at a private screening for attendees of the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington DC clergy are a natural audience for this movie. The reception was favorable but this was an audience for which the moralizing of the story would naturally resonate. I'm not sure it will attract a very broad audience  this is a movie that may well find its niche on DVD being shown in high school history classes and at church gatherings.It is a nice historical period piece. It is largely due to subject matter reminiscent of Amistad with similar pacing.Should you see it? It depends on whether you like this TYPE of movie. If this genre historical drama interests you this is quite welldone. It might even inspire you to read more about Wilberforce. Go see it. If you are in search of movies that teach lessons about good values and perseverance in fighting for what's right go see it.But if you have no idea when the French Revolution occurred relative to our War of Independence and if it doesn't come naturally to you to remember that the newborn U.S. was allied with France against Britain during that period  and if you don't care  this movie might not be your idea of a fun time.If I were the producers I would add one of those scrolling text historical introductions to the film before final release though it is probably too late.".

	schema:headline " Touching biography about William Wilberforce responsible for a bill which abolishes the slave trade";
	schema:reviewBody "The idealist William Wilberforce finely played by Ioan Grufudd along with Rhomas Clarkson Rufus Sewell and a group of antislave trade maneuver his way through Parliament endeavoring to end the British transatlantic trade that would lead to a great victory . Wilberforce helped by his lifelong friend and future P. M . William Pitt Benedict Cumberbatch will fight to get their purports for social justice . Wilberforce encounters the inspiration in newfound love interest Romola Garai to rejuvenate the battle with new ideas . After many attempts to bring legislation forward over twenty years he is eventually gets a bill being passed through Parliament in 1807 in which abolishes the slavery the British empire forever.This is a bicentennial tribute to William Wilberforce and his parliamentary bill abolishing the slave trade . Thoughtprovoking and moving film dealing with interesting issues  including fidelity to historical accuracy and detailed moral battles . Ioan Gruffudd is good as obstinate  romantic parliamentary member who battles relentlessly injustices  he does a dignified portrayal about a great man . The prestigious cast shows their awareness of the contemporary impact about the brooding themes and are allowed to step out of period detail . Special mention to Benedict Cumberbatch as his lifelong friend Prime Minister William Pitt and N' Dour realizing an enjoyable portrait of an exslave . All of them are quietly upstaged by Albert Finney as a repent  remorse exslaver . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Michael Apted  he's director producer of several successes such as The word is not enough Gorillas in the mist  Class action Nell Enigma  Chronicles of Narnia II  The voyage of Dawn Treader among others . Rating  Above average and worthwhile seeing  the whole family will enjoy this film .It's a very likable biography and enormously appealing for students and scholars . Overall this is a really nice movie . If you are familiar with the history then you will like this splendid film .This is a biopic well based on historical events  adding more details over the largely described in the movie are the following  William Wilberforce 24 August 1759  29 July 1833 was a British politician philanthropist and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade. A native of Kingston upon Hull Yorkshire he began his political career in 1780 eventually becoming the independent Member of Parliament for Yorkshire 17841812. In 1785 he underwent a conversion experience and became an evangelical Christian resulting in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform. In 1787 he came into contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of antislavetrade activists including Granville Sharp Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twentysix years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807.

Not so folks  next time you're in Westminster Abbey you might check out the large abolitionist monument dedicated someone whose fight against the slave trade predated that of Wilberforce and was widely recognized during his liftetime Charles James Fox.Yes that same Fox so inaccurately identified in the film as a tame follower of Wilberforce agonizing over the slavery question and finally swayed by the young man's eloquence. Truth is Fox  whose proAmerican proFrench Revolution antislavery and antiabsolute monarchy sentiments put him at odds with George III during nearly his entire political career  was a phenomenon of the age in the words of a contemporary and one of Parliament's most eloquent speakers on a range of causes that certainly rivalled those of Wilberforce.He was also only 10 years older than Pitt something you'd never guess from the frightwig makeup Michael Gambon wears.You can understand why such scripting decisions are made Wilberforce has to be young and sexy to be attractive and his more priggish attitudes he often urged Parliament to pass laws prohibiting all amusements on Sundays and was appalled at what he deemed Fox's immorality his drinking gambling and womanizing have to be eliminated. It's a shame because Wilberforce was all the more interesting for being a complex human  but it's so much easier to make him terribly young eager and dashing and all other politicians of the day old and timid.Other strange egregious errors Fox was not a lord nor would you find any lords among Wilberforce's fellows in the House lords do not sit in the House of Commons. The character identified as the king's son the Duke of Cumberland would have been about 12 years old at the time of the movie's action. Pitt was prime minister for some 20 years yet his cautious political trimming was at least partly responsible for the slave trade continuing as long as it did.It was a pleasant enough film and rousing in parts but I prefer my history more redblooded and reflective of real human beings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Commemorating the abolition of slavery roughly 200 years ago seems a suitable occasion to make a movie but how to go about such an awesome task? Director Michael Apted Gorillas in the Mist has opted for classic style following the fortunes of inspired young parliamentarian William Wilberforce. Eschewing a more analytical or leftwing approach he has probably made the right decision.As credits open an MP stops his carriage on a wet and windswept road to intervene with commoners who are severely beating a horse. Wilber's kindness is not just to animals including a pet hare but to the poor and needy who he often invites for breakfast and lunch  much to the exasperation of his overworked cook! But Wilber is torn between politics and church. His mentors persuade him that he can do most good  particularly in the fight against slavery  if he enters government.Wilber's best friend is William Pitt the Younger soon to become Prime Minister. But many MPs  not to mention the Crown  have vested interests in the nasty but lucrative slave trade. Wilber's adviser and hero is a John Newton Albert Finney a clergyman who used to be a slave trader until he repented of his ways. John has also authored the eponymous song which we are treated to at regular intervals. Wilber is soon to meet the delectable Barbara  and we kind of guess that for all their protestations there can only be one conclusion there. After all we're told A single man will wither away in rooms that smell of feet and armpits.So our plot is driven through surprisingly colourful halls of Westminster with two burning questions 'When will Wilber get slavery abolished' and 'When will Wilber get Barbara?'Amazing Grace is a big glossy period piece in that tradition where you are carried along seamlessly by a story and don't ask questions  which usually means it's all the more important to ask them. Wilber is the allgood hero asserting moral righteousness in a moral vacuum and will eventually get the girl as well as triumph on behalf of civilisation. Generic films like this are the most subtle at reinforcing traditional values whether we like it or not because we accept the message without thinking about it.On the 'message' front apart from 'slavery is wrong' we have Wilber inspired by God frequently in the form of uncontroversial spider webs and other aspects of nature. This tends to make us think that religion per se is good when in fact the Church of England has publicly apologised for its involvement in the slave trade saying the Church was At the heart of it. When emancipation took place in 1833 compensation was paid not to the branded slaves but to their owners  the Bishop of Exeter and three colleagues for instance being paid nearly 13000 in compensation for 665 slaves.Marriage is also held up as one of the 'given' goodnesses when in fact it is one of the principle mechanisms used in countries where slavery still goes on and in this form girls are sold off and married against their will even before their teens.Many historical details go unchallenged specifically how slavery was abolished which is dealt with in a very simplistic and not entirely accurate manner. The idea that slavery is something solely inflicted by white men on black men women and children is not questioned  something that is still a source of sadness to black Americans tracing their ancestors in Africa only to find that Africans were willing accomplices. True the Africans enslaved between tribes as the result of civil strife were not treated in the inhuman way that they were by white men but in 1872 long after abolition the king of Asante wrote to the British monarch asking for the slave trade to be renewed.So can a relatively sugary film about such devastation of human life be justified? 85000 Africans a year crossed the Atlantic to work on plantations that made Europe rich. Should a more careful portrait have been painted? Oscarnominated cinematographer Remi Adefarasin envelops us in a lush reassuring panoramic of politics and country houses served up in goodenoughtotouch sets and artisticallylit woodlands  not a trace of brutalised slaves anywhere. Costumes by Oscarwinning Jenny Beavan Gosford Park recreate the period in all its finery rarely stepping outside the delicately quiffed locks of the upper classes. On one level this is the world that Wilber has to convince. No television news programmes or gruesome photographs  the camera would not be invented till a few years later. But there is another reason and one which to my mind justifies many of the film's apparent shortcomings.Emancipation from slavery is a subject that needs to be a part of our international consciousness at every level. Every adult. Every schoolchild. A more graphic story would not have gained the rating that will enable both adults and children to enjoy the movie. An intellectual examination would have alienated mass audiences. A 'worthy' docudrama would not have got people out of their houses. This is one example where classical filmmaking is surely justified. The official website comes with educational downloads and links to charities where you can take action against slavery today.Amazing Grace is a story of the triumph of the human spirit over its own follies. The techniques used by its protagonists will be inspiring to other rights groups campaigning for change. The story is a little predictable in outcome and the moral magnificence of the main characters a bit overdone but it utilises all the expertise of modern mainstream cinema to make its point in a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable way. Amazing it is not but only the cynical will refuse to grant it the grace it deserves.".

	schema:headline " Let's hear it for Wilbers";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has been described as stolid too many parliamentary speeches but I would rather say old fashioned. It is very much a reprise of the earnest 1940's style of biopic exemplified by A Song to Remember about Chopin and The Al Jolson Story. Michael Apted as a director tends to produce poetic documentaries the SevenUp series and prosaic feature films Enigma and even his Bond effort The World is not Enough. Here though there is a literate script from Steven Knight Dirty Pretty Things the story doesn't come across as well as it might partly as a result of tinkering with the timeline 1797 to 1783 to 1797 to 1806.More crucially we really don't know at the end how William Wilberforce managed to turn round the opinion of those who mattered on the Slavery Question though we get glimpses of his tactics. We meet some of his supporters like Thomas Clarkson a clergyman of revolutionary tendencies former slaver John Newton and exslave Oloudaqh and the clever Chancery lawyer James Stephen. They are obviously very committed but there has to be more to it. Who collected the 390000 signatures on the petition produced in Parliament? One gets the impression that antislavery was a mass movement and Wilberforce brave and resolute as he may have been was just the toff who kept on introducing the antislave trade bill in the House of Commons  a toff whose subsequent career did not show him to be a friend of the working man.As the toff in question Ioan Gruffud is just fine though he's so reluctant to touch his lovely sweetheart Barbara Spooner Romola Garai that one marvels that he has so many descendants. The lack of love scenes is probably attributable to the policy of the producers the Anschutz film group of keeping their films G or PG. Apparently such films make more money than MA or horrors R movies. Anschutz is controlled by a Colorado billionaire of conservative inclinations and evangelical beliefs.On the basis of this film the protagonists of slavery were not terribly smart. The thrust of Wilberforce's attack was not so much on slavery itself as the deplorable conditions under which it was conducted. If the slavers had cleaned up their act and accepted a bit of regulation they could have gone on for another 50 years. Instead they just bribed MPs who eventually had to support abolition to get reelected.One proslaver featured in the film is William Duke of Clarence who later reigned briefly but not too badly as William IV 183037. In reality quite a handsome man who had spent 10 years in the Navy he is portrayed here by Toby Jones as a malevolent dwarf obsessed with gambling. Anachronistically but for dramatic purposes he is shown as a member of the House of Commons William did threaten to stand for the Commons once his father George III bought him off with a Dukedom remarking I well know it is one more vote added to the opposition..It is true however that he opposed abolition having West Indian sugar interests himself..The role of Wilberforce's old school friend the child prodigy Prime Minister William Pitt who became PM at 24 played with feline charm by Benedict Cumberbatch is rather intriguing. Publicly Pitt had to be very cautious on the slavery issue but he and Wilbers are shown as very matey indeed in private running around the lawn together in their underwear. The effect of casting studmuffin Ioan Gryffud as Wilbers leads the viewer to wonder whether they might be something more than just good mates  something they may have missed back in Boulder Colorado.There are lots of fine performances here including Nicholas Farrell as Wilber's cousin Henry Thornton Rufus Sewell as Thomas Clarkson Michael Gambon as Charles James Fox and especially Albert Finney as John Newton the exslaver turned Evangelical Anglican priest and composer of hymns. He not only wrote Amazing Grace but also Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken which somehow finished up with Haydn's music for Deutschland uber Alles.Wilberforce in fact only got to first base in the abolition of slavery his 1807 Act merely prevented transportation of slaves in British ships. It was not until the year of his death 1833 some time after he had retired from public life that slavery was abolished more or less in the British Empire. The British taxpayer picked up the tab to compensate the slave owners for the loss of their property  20 million pounds at least a billion in today's money. The slaves got nothing.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film has been described as stolid too many parliamentary speeches but I would rather say old fashioned. It is very much a reprise of the earnest 1940's style of biopic exemplified by A Song to Remember about Chopin and The Al Jolson Story. Michael Apted as a director tends to produce poetic documentaries the SevenUp series and prosaic feature films Enigma and even his Bond effort The World is not Enough. Here though there is a literate script from Steven Knight Dirty Pretty Things the story doesn't come across as well as it might partly as a result of tinkering with the timeline 1797 to 1783 to 1797 to 1806.More crucially we really don't know at the end how William Wilberforce managed to turn round the opinion of those who mattered on the Slavery Question though we get glimpses of his tactics. We meet some of his supporters like Thomas Clarkson a clergyman of revolutionary tendencies former slaver John Newton and exslave Oloudaqh and the clever Chancery lawyer James Stephen. They are obviously very committed but there has to be more to it. Who collected the 390000 signatures on the petition produced in Parliament? One gets the impression that antislavery was a mass movement and Wilberforce brave and resolute as he may have been was just the toff who kept on introducing the antislave trade bill in the House of Commons  a toff whose subsequent career did not show him to be a friend of the working man.As the toff in question Ioan Gruffud is just fine though he's so reluctant to touch his lovely sweetheart Barbara Spooner Romola Garai that one marvels that he has so many descendants. The lack of love scenes is probably attributable to the policy of the producers the Anschutz film group of keeping their films G or PG. Apparently such films make more money than MA or horrors R movies. Anschutz is controlled by a Colorado billionaire of conservative inclinations and evangelical beliefs.On the basis of this film the protagonists of slavery were not terribly smart. The thrust of Wilberforce's attack was not so much on slavery itself as the deplorable conditions under which it was conducted. If the slavers had cleaned up their act and accepted a bit of regulation they could have gone on for another 50 years. Instead they just bribed MPs who eventually had to support abolition to get reelected.One proslaver featured in the film is William Duke of Clarence who later reigned briefly but not too badly as William IV 183037. In reality quite a handsome man who had spent 10 years in the Navy he is portrayed here by Toby Jones as a malevolent dwarf obsessed with gambling. Anachronistically but for dramatic purposes he is shown as a member of the House of Commons William did threaten to stand for the Commons once his father George III bought him off with a Dukedom remarking I well know it is one more vote added to the opposition..It is true however that he opposed abolition having West Indian sugar interests himself..The role of Wilberforce's old school friend the child prodigy Prime Minister William Pitt who became PM at 24 played with feline charm by Benedict Cumberbatch is rather intriguing. Publicly Pitt had to be very cautious on the slavery issue but he and Wilbers are shown as very matey indeed in private running around the lawn together in their underwear. The effect of casting studmuffin Ioan Gryffud as Wilbers leads the viewer to wonder whether they might be something more than just good mates  something they may have missed back in Boulder Colorado.There are lots of fine performances here including Nicholas Farrell as Wilber's cousin Henry Thornton Rufus Sewell as Thomas Clarkson Michael Gambon as Charles James Fox and especially Albert Finney as John Newton the exslaver turned Evangelical Anglican priest and composer of hymns.

Michael Gambon and Albert Finney also deserve high praise for their outstanding performances and added a clever further dimension to the plot.Overall 'Amazing Grace' was a simply stunning picture beautifully filmed and wonderfully portrayed.

	schema:reviewBody "I loved this film. It has just the right amount of excellent production values great acting attractive young stars  some distinguished older ones  and a magnificent history lesson. When I think of slavery I generally focus upon the Americas or ancient civilizations and have never been totally aware of the importance of slavery to the economies of such European countries as England and France during the Eighteenth Century. Amazing Grace  taken from the hymn written by John Newton who was a former slave trader  is the story of William Wilberforce 17591833 who tirelessly fought for social reform and the end of the slave trade in England.Wilberforce was a dynamic man and an extraordinary orator who entered politics as a very young man. He campaigned for many causes including the reformation of manners and the Society for the Suppression of Vice free education for the poor the introduction of Christianity to India the foundation of the Church Mission Society and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals but his greatest accomplishment was probably his campaign against the slave trade leading to the Slave Trade Act in 1807 and eventually the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833.The film basically covers his life between 1785 and 1807 ending with the triumph of passing the Slave Trade Act. Ioan Gruffudd is exciting as a young Wilberforce who is so passionate about nature God and justice for the common man. He is depicted as a man who has not allowed his position and wealth to soil his humanity. Gruffudd gives us a Wilberforce we would all like to know and with whom we could share a genuine friendship.One of Wilberforce's lifelong friends was William Pitt who remains to this day the youngest Prime Minister of England. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Pitt as a lasting friend and practical political guide to the more idealistic Wilberforce. I have only seen films in which Cumberbatch plays selfish prigs and it was a great change of pace to see him in this role.Romola Garai is extraordinary beautiful and witty as Barbara who would become Wilberforce's wife. In reality she was seventeen years his junior and didn't take as much interest in politics as depicted in the film but by all accounts she was a special woman who swept a fairly confirmed bachelor off his feet.Add numerous other wellknown persons in British history  along with a goodly number of odd characters  and you get a superbly entertaining and strikingly beautiful film. A love story between two attractive and extremely likable people loyal friendships and an enlightening lesson in history  what more could you ask for two hours of your time?".

Gorgeously mounted chockablock full of Alist stars but deadly dull and on a topic that could have made for a great picture. My companion dozed off on several occasions and only having recently read Vincent Carretta's biography of Olaudah Equiano sustained me. So it was jarring to find Apted uncritically depicting Equiano's assertions that he was of noble birth in Africa. One of the most pathetically laughable scenes is one in which lawyer James Stephens throws out a critical legal term and then explains that it's Latin Hellllooo? They've established earlier in the scene that only the abolitionist faithful have come to the meeting and all educated Englishmen of the time would know Latin probably even selfeducated Equiano. Stephens' remark is for the benefit of 21st century audiences but surely there was a less ridiculous way to impart that. By the end of the film I think I was actually cringing and wondering how much of what I was seeing was accurate.".

Gorgeously mounted chockablock full of Alist stars but deadly dull and on a topic that could have made for a great picture. My companion dozed off on several occasions and only having recently read Vincent Carretta's biography of Olaudah Equiano sustained me. So it was jarring to find Apted uncritically depicting Equiano's assertions that he was of noble birth in Africa. One of the most pathetically laughable scenes is one in which lawyer James Stephens throws out a critical legal term and then explains that it's Latin Hellllooo? They've established earlier in the scene that only the abolitionist faithful have come to the meeting and all educated Englishmen of the time would know Latin probably even selfeducated Equiano. Stephens' remark is for the benefit of 21st century audiences but surely there was a less ridiculous way to impart that. By the end of the film I think I was actually cringing and wondering how much of what I was seeing was accurate.";

The film is written by Tarantini too and some sources mention that also Dardano Sacchetti the man responsible for many Fulci scripts worked as a writer in this film uncredited. Still most of Sacchetti's screenplays are much better and professional than this so I think he didn't do too much for this film after all.In DINOSAUR VALLEY Michael Sopkiw BLASTFIGHTER 1985 2019 BEFORE THE FALL OF NEW YORK 1983 etc. stars as our Indiana Jones like hero who collects dinosaur bones and sells them to those who pay him much. He travels to Brazil and is willing to search for the bones there. There he gets to know an older doctor and his daughter who are also going to the jungle alongside a photographer his two almost naked female models and a traumatized Vietnam veteran and his more than annoying and paranoid wife. Now that sounds a hilarious cast doesn't it? It is as wild and laughable as it sounds so the fanatics of trash cinema will love DINOSAUR VALLEY.After their plane crashes unbelievably funny scene by he way! the fun and the so called plot begins. The most interesting thing in the cast is easily Suzane Carvalho who belongs to the most memorable beauties I've seen in any of these exploitation films of the 70's and 80's. She plays the part of the doctor's daughter and her beauty steels the whole show. Her eyes are like chocolate balls waiting to be eaten. There are some other beauties in films of this kind like Uschi Glass Umberto Lenzi's SEVEN BLOOD STAINED ORCHIDS 1971 Glory Annen Norman J. Warren's PREY 1978 and Olivia Hussey Brian TrenchardSmith's outrageous BLOOD CAMP THATCHER aka TURKEY SHOOT 1981 but Suzane in DINOSAUR VALLEY is easily the most beautiful angel of all.Sopkiw is as bad as can be expected and that goes to the acting in general in this film too. The acting is so bad at times that one might wonder if they did it in purpose because it seems unlikely that somebody really acted that bad while trying to act good and believably. That of course adds to the enjoyment this junk gives and DINOSAUR VALLEY is easily to these jungle adventures CUT AND RUN 1985 THE CATHERINE MILES STORY 1986 TREASURE OF THE AMAZON 1985 etc. the same as Ivan Katansky's ridiculous Italian sleaze fest BEAST IN HEAT 1977 is for nazi exploitation and WIP films. All those who've seen BEAST really know what I'm talking about.DINOSAUR has plenty of gratuitous sex nudity and gore which can also be expected from these films. The sex and nudityometer is very high and there are some shots of naked females that go farther than I expected so the makers noticeably wanted to deliver the goods big time with this film. The same thing is with the gore as there are the usual scenes of blood letting and people being killed in gory manner as the dangers of the jungle like piranhas and leeches attack the unhappy travellers as well as the hungry cannibals who happen to live there too. Also they soon find out that the jungle is terrorized by some sleazy slave ring led by a fat and horny dirtbag whose fate in a film like this isn't too hard to guess.Pretty much all the characters in the film are more or less disgusting and evil and there are some unbelievably sleazy scenes like the relationship between the war veteran and his wife as well as the laughably lusty men who trapped in the jungle surrounded by different dangers don't seem to be able to keep their eyes off the almost naked females and thus giving the camera man an excuse to give couple of close ups! Can it be even more exploitative and overthetop sleazy than this?!The settings in the Brazil jungles are very nice and beautiful as can be expected and that is perhaps the only positive and noteworthy cinematic achievement that can be found in this film. The water and trees are shot very lively and peacefully and it creates a nice atmosphere and the overall beauty of nature is pretty stunning and even the loathsome characters and goingson cannot disturb that. The music score the synthesizer one is also worth mentioning and it is very simple but effective in the tradition of Carpenter's HALLOWEEN score.After all DINOSAUR VALLEY is almost perfect exploitation trash romp but the viewer really has to understand and love the genre in order to come to this conclusion. If you try to show this film to anyone with normal taste for cinema you are guaranteed to be recommended to visit a mental hospital to get some help because these films are so far away from what is considered as acceptable or correct in mainstream and normal cinema. I give DINOSAUR VALLEY 610 as a fan of this cheesy genre.".

	schema:headline " Superb jungle adventure  so daft it's awesome!";
	schema:reviewBody "In order to cash in on the success of Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox this film has been released under the title 'Cannibal Ferox 2' and personally I can't understand why they would do that  because how could anyone resist a film with 'Massacre in Dinosaur Valley' as its title? That title is somewhat misleading as it refers to a section in the Amazon where there are fossilised dinosaur remains and so unfortunately there are none of the giant beasts in this film. It's hard to deny that this jungle adventure is a bad film but it's a LOT of fun and I don't hesitate to name this film as one of my favourites of the Italian cannibal subgenre for that very reason. The film is more along the lines of adventure flicks such as Sergio Martino's Mountain of the Cannibal God than disgusting gore flicks like Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox. The plot follows a palaeontologist who hitches a lift to Dinosaur Valley. However the plane ends up going down  and then we follow the palaeontologist along with two fashion models a professor's daughter a Vietnam Vet and some guy with a moustache as they try to get out alive.The main reason why this film works is because of a hilarious lead performance from Michael Sopkiw. His performance is half Kurt Russell and half Treat Williams so as you can imagine every scene he features in is a treat. He's not believable in the slightest as a palaeontologist but he plays his role as a 'courageous' American perfectly and his action scenes are carried off well. The film features all the sex and gore that is synonymous with the Italian cannibal films. The gore isn't as strong or relentless as in some of the others but the scenes that do feature are more than worthwhile for the gore fan. There's a lesbian sex scene which is always nice and most of the female cast end up baring their breasts. Director Michele Massimo Tarantini does a good job of creating the jungle setting as the locations look realistic thus making it easy to believe that the characters really are in a desperate situation. This film won't do much for people who are expecting a sick gore fest but providing you go into Massacre in Dinosaur Valley knowing that it's a somewhat tongue in cheek adventure film there's a lot of fun to be had. I know for sure that I'll find myself enjoying this one again.".

	onyx:emotionText "In order to cash in on the success of Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox this film has been released under the title 'Cannibal Ferox 2' and personally I can't understand why they would do that  because how could anyone resist a film with 'Massacre in Dinosaur Valley' as its title? That title is somewhat misleading as it refers to a section in the Amazon where there are fossilised dinosaur remains and so unfortunately there are none of the giant beasts in this film. It's hard to deny that this jungle adventure is a bad film but it's a LOT of fun and I don't hesitate to name this film as one of my favourites of the Italian cannibal subgenre for that very reason. The film is more along the lines of adventure flicks such as Sergio Martino's Mountain of the Cannibal God than disgusting gore flicks like Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox. The plot follows a palaeontologist who hitches a lift to Dinosaur Valley. However the plane ends up going down  and then we follow the palaeontologist along with two fashion models a professor's daughter a Vietnam Vet and some guy with a moustache as they try to get out alive.The main reason why this film works is because of a hilarious lead performance from Michael Sopkiw. His performance is half Kurt Russell and half Treat Williams so as you can imagine every scene he features in is a treat. He's not believable in the slightest as a palaeontologist but he plays his role as a 'courageous' American perfectly and his action scenes are carried off well. The film features all the sex and gore that is synonymous with the Italian cannibal films. The gore isn't as strong or relentless as in some of the others but the scenes that do feature are more than worthwhile for the gore fan. There's a lesbian sex scene which is always nice and most of the female cast end up baring their breasts. Director Michele Massimo Tarantini does a good job of creating the jungle setting as the locations look realistic thus making it easy to believe that the characters really are in a desperate situation. This film won't do much for people who are expecting a sick gore fest but providing you go into Massacre in Dinosaur Valley knowing that it's a somewhat tongue in cheek adventure film there's a lot of fun to be had. I know for sure that I'll find myself enjoying this one again.";

Tarantini has crammed the film with every exploitation element and clich you can think of. Massacre in Dinosaur Valley lacks originality any semblance of good acting and anything approaching taste. Technically the movie doesn't fair much better with some really bad looking special effects and poor editing. But if you can get past all the film's shortcomings as I did it's a lot of fun for fans of cheesefilled Italian exploitation type movies. Maybe I was just in the right frame of mind but I had a great time with it.Actually my biggest complaint with the film has nothing to do with the list of previously mentioned problems. My biggest gripe is the look of the cannibals. If you've seen Cannibal Holocaust the Granddaddy of cannibal films you'll understand what I mean. The cannibal tribes in Cannibal Holocaust look authentic at least to my untrained eyes. They're dirty unkempt and wild looking. The cannibals in Massacre in Dinosaur Valley on the other hand look like actors. They look like they showered shaved and had a fresh haircut on the way to the set. In addition the cannibal village in Cannibal Holocaust is something completely alien to our modern society. It fits the look of the cannibals. Here the cannibal village reminded me of one of the headhunter sets from Gilligan's Island. A little more authenticity would have really helped Massacre in Dinosaur Valley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be fooled by the misleading title. This is a serviceable jungle adventure flick which manages to be rather more entertaining and less grisly than earlier entries in this particular Italian subgenre. Think of it as INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM meets MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD and you'll be on the right track. All of the clichs are present and correct in this enjoyable yarn which kicks off with a bus load of sweaty people bouncing down a dirt track while an amusing tropical song plays over the credits. From here we are introduced to the various sleazy characters who will variously get bitten beaten eaten tortured and murdered in a variety of ways within the next hourandahalf.Anyway after being introduced to the film's hero as he gets amusingly beaten unconscious by two huge guys in a bar the plane takes off and predictably crashes. One guy loses a gallon of blood from his skull while another thinks that he's Crocodile Dundee and ventures into the wilderness with the others trailing behind. Various pitfalls await including some snakes quicksand a nasty bunch of piranhas who chew off a man's leg and of course the longawaited cannibals. The heroines get captured and stripped big surprise there didn't see that one coming and then it's up to the hero to save the day.This guy obviously models himself on Indiana Jones and spends the film doing all manner of goodnatured things. In the film's highlight he attacks the cannibal camp and blasts about a hundred of them with his shotgun before escaping. But is this the end of the film? Not likely. The surviving trio then fall foul of an illegal smuggling cooperation run by a Gunnar Hansen lookalike which is mining in the hills. Gunnar proceeds to have his wicked way with the women while an extra from a blaxploitation movie indulges in a little lesbianism. The hero tied up with the pigs cunningly contrives a means to escape using friction burns he causes his wrists to bleed and the hungry pigs immediately chew the ropes away frees all the native slaves and blows everything up in sight including the whole camp and all of the bad guys before escaping on a helicopter with his girlfriend. The end.There are many individual scenes in this film to enjoy. For example the showdown between the chief smuggler and the film's hero played by a woodenjawed Italian nobody. Watch the hero get shot in the leg and later forget about the wound as he runs through the jungle. Another highlight sees a suspiciously perverted character get his leg half chewed off by piranha before being shockingly executed by the group's leader who has no time for wounded people in his party. This same leader later becomes a pin cushion for the cannibals and their blow pipes and has his beating heart devoured by a hungry native. It has to be seen to be believed. Eagleeyed viewers may spot ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST's Alexandra Delli Colli losing her clothes on the trip through the jungle.Well as you can see it's certainly an actionpacked and fastpaced film with a lot happening all the time. There's a high dosage of excessive gore and nudity although never as shocking as in earlier entries and as an adventure film this manages to be frequently thrilling. It may not be a brilliantly made film and normal mainstream viewers would likely be put off by the poor editing and bad dubbing. The attempts at characterisation are frankly pathetic and a little digging below the surface will expose just how shallow this movie is... but for fans of cult Italian exploitation films this is an enjoyable affair and well worth tracking down and I can safely say that I enjoyed it a darn sight more than most of Lenzi'sDeodato's offerings.".

For those who survive it is a fight to get back to civilization through pirhanas jungle animals flesheating pigs cannibals and a slaver who is running an illegal mining operation. The film is wildly overacted and the dialogue atrocious but the location photography is noteworthy and the ladies are the kind all heterosexual men dream of. The film verges on camp so you might as well laugh along with it. The gore quotient is soso the few special effects pathetic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some of my fellow fans of Italian HorrorExploitation cinema and the Cannibalsubgenre in particular seem to regard Nudo e Selvaggio aka. Massacre in Dinosaur Valley 1985 as a particular highlight. While Michele Massimo Trantini's film is definitely fun to watch I am personally not too enthusiastic about it. What makes this film fun is both its incredible schlockfactor and the fact that it combines elements from various subgenres. While the film is obviously a Cannibal flick and also marketed as such it isn't anywhere near as disturbing as nor otherwise comparable to the genre classics by Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato. This film is more like a gory adventureaction film that includes Cannibals and even employs comedy elements.The film actually begins like a silly 80s slapstick comedy with goofy jokes staged fistfights stereotypical characters and some female eyecandy. A bunch of drifters stranded in a Brazilian village all require a flight to a certain savage and 'forbidden' area in the Amazon jungle the 'Dinosaur Valley' which is still inhabited by Cannibals. Needless to say that the slapstick comedy is soon over and the film turns into bloody survival exploitation. Still the film is tame compared to almost all other Italian Cannibal flicks from the 80s.The characters are eccentric and their actions often incredibly stupid but the film is entertaining from start to finish though never creepy or suspenseful let alone shocking. The highlight in the cast is obviously the ravishing Suzanne Carvalho who plays Eva the sexy daughter of a famous scientist. Michael Sopkiw who might also be known to fans of Italian genrecinema for playing the lead in Sergio Martino's 2019  After the Fall of New York is wellcast in the lead as a shotgunwielding anthropologist. The rest of the characters include two luscious nudemodels a sleazy photographer and a married couple with slight marital problems  he is an insane 'Nam vet she is an alcoholic pain in the ass who does not even stop annoying her husband and mocking his impotence once they are surrounded by hungry cannibals.The film is fun enough to watch but in my opinion it is only recommendable to my fellow enthusiastic fans of Cannibal flicks andor schlock Horror. Those who haven't seen any Cannibal films so far are welladvised to watch Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece Cannibal Holocaust 1980 followed either by Deodato's own Ultimo Mondo Cannibale Last Cannibal World 1977 or Umberto Lenzi's Il Paese Del Sesso Selvaggio Deep River Savages 1972 Mangiati Vivi Eaten Alive By The Cannibals 1980 and Cannibal Ferrox 1981. When you've seen all the Deodato and Lenzi flicks you can throw in this one though there are still a few other Cannibal flicks that I'd probably recommend over Dinosaur Valley. Unlike most other Cannibal flicks this one doesn't involve any animalkillings so some people might actually prefer it though it probably isn't their genre in general. Overall Massacre in Dinosaur Valley is highly entertaining though nothing essential in my opinion.".

It has it's fair share of gooey goodness but compared to the majority of movies in this genre it's quite tame. Massacre really has more in common with Raiders Of The Lost Ark except with a lot more T and A and much lower budget. The good Massacre is very well shot and competently directed and has aged well because of this. The women are smoking hot and showed plenty of skin even got a brief girl on girl scene in the vein of Ilsa. The action rarely stops and I wasn't bored once. Finally what I enjoyed most about this film was leading man Michael Sopkiw who makes a very likable hero and had the talent to go on to do big things. Saddly things never worked out for him. Nonetheless he gets props from me for his obvious talent. If you get the DVD it has a new interview with Sopkiw who talks in depth about the film his career and what he's doing now. The only negative is the lack of extreme gore although it does outshine many of it's predecessors in other areas.".

The plot was OK but I had to register an account here because people are saying that Sopkiw's character was the hero. He was not!First off sometime in the movie a car breaks down but we're never told why. In a deleted scene we find out that it was because a chubby guy sat on the bonnet and blew the tyres. Yes that's plural  tyres. No not just two. Four. A guy sits on a car  that he was sitting INSIDE in a previous scene  and blows all four tyres. WTF?Next they're in the jungle and there's cannibals around. A guy makes a fire so he can steam off some leeches from one of the women. Another woman yelps because she sat next to a snake. The guy has a go at her because she could give their position away  as the smoke from HIS fire billows everywhere!So this guy gets half his leg eaten by piranhas. Our 'hero' jumps in the water and nurses the wound! Then some other guy kills the wounded guy because otherwise he'd die a slow and painful death. Our 'hero' didn't like this he must have wanted the poor guy to suffer so he starts a fight  and they decide to jump into the piranha water to have this fight...Later the two girls have been separated from the rest and kidnapped by cannibals. Our 'hero' catches up and spies from behind a rock. Meanwhile a cannibal chief has started to cut open one of the girls' chests. Our 'hero' decides that now might be a good idea to do something so as we hear the poor girl screaming in the background he starts to load his gun taking all the time in the world!Our 'hero' and the two girls then get taken captive by some evil miners. The 'hero' is tied up in a pig pen as the leader of the miners takes one of the girls into his cabin to rape her. As we hear he screams and the commotion from inside 'hero' decides that now might be a good time to escape and escape he does. And hides. That's right he leaves her in there and doesn't appear until the next day. Nice move. You must really hate these women!Now for the showdown between the 'hero' and the minor leader. Imagine two men standing ten feet apart one holding a spear 'good' guy and one holding a gun with one bullet left bad guy. There is a rattlesnake next to the man with the gun. Make your choice our fearless 'hero' says. Well I don't know about you but if I was the bad guy with one bullet left I'd step away from the snake and shoot the other guy. This doesn't happen of course. He shoots the snake and the 'good' guy shoves the spear through his chest.Finally and let's overlook that the remaining girl has been put into a cage with 2foot gaps that she could easily slip through our 'hero' creates a diversion sending all the miners out of the camp bar the main bad guy whom he kills. Now he can finally rescue the girl whom he has already let be raped throughout the night right? Wrong. He decides to spend his time lying dynamite at the entrance to the camp for when the miners return. And return they do and when they see their leader dead on the ground and the girl still in the cage they start shooting at her. Bullets ricochet off and split the wooden bars as our 'hero' is casually sitting back next to the detonator. Moments go by and I saw at least two bullets hit inches from her head. We flick back to our 'hero' who is casually sitting back in a chair smoking a cigarette as we hear more bullets being fired right at the girl then finally he decides to push the detonator painfully slowly to blow up the remaining bad guys.At least he releases her from the cage. You'd expect her to be so pee'd off at him now having let her be raped the entire night and sat idly by as a dozen men shoot at her but no she says she loves him and they kiss!Man he must REALLY hate that woman.".

Having an archaeologist does mean you've got an Indiana Jones inspired movie This is an exploitation film with a mainstream feel . The difference is that there's little thought given to events that happen on screen being given much consequence later on in the movie . For example a female character is raped and yet the next day she shows little trauma at her ordeal . This type of sexual violence is typical of the exploitation genre and leads to dismissal from a mainstream audience . It's also a dumb movie featuring a lack of internal continuity where a minor character gets killed by a school of piranha but when the hero enters the water all the killer fish seem to have miraculously disappeared In short this is a dumb exploitation film that will have little appeal to anyone who doesn't like the genre . That said it has better production values than most of its peers and the gore is fairly restrained which gives the film a relatively mainstream feel".

Look at this line up of comedy vets John Landis The Blues Brothers Trading Places Animal House among so many others Joe Dante Gremlins Innerspace Matinee Robert Weiss TV's Police Squad! Carl Gottlieb cowriter of Jaws AND The Jerk as well as newby Peter Horton of thirtysomething fame. This anthology features some real groaners to be sure but surprisingly hits more times and with more genuine laughs than would be expected.

This picture has several clinkers of flat comedy Landis's opener nearly stops the film dead with the alwaysunfunny Arsenio Hall but hits with so many other vignettes that it's easy to get into the groove of this shortbutsweet skewer of 80's latelatenight TV. The standout segments in this comedic buffet are abundant but the best of them belong to Dante Weiss  Gottlieb the UniversalInternational Invisible Man short with Ed Begley Jr. his hilarious run at the Leonard Nimoy In Search Of chestnut as Bullshit Or Not? with pitchperfect host Henry Silva the stayfortheendcredits 1930's Reefer Madness health scare jewel starring the late great Paul Bartel and Carrie Fisher or the crossedcircuit tributes to BOTH the Siskel  Ebert show AND the old Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts featuring a dream cast of vaudeville and 50's Vegas comics that has to be seen to be believed. Landis's standouts include a no soul infomercial featuring David Alan Grier and BB King a funny hospital sketch featuring Landis players Griffin American Werewolf Dunne and Michelle Into The Night Pfeiffer ! and a respectful nod to the earlier Kentucky Fried Movie wrapup featuring an interactive video that stars Marc McClure UltraVixens cult director Russ Meyer and Andrew Dice Clay. Highest marks though go to the runninggag Amazon Women On The Moon which lovingly  hilariously  mocks everything from This Island Earth to Robot Monster complete with film splices and gorgeous oversaturated Eastmancolor. If you have ever loved crappy TV the Universal Studios backlot or any of the directors who have contributed to this dog's breakfast of SNLinspired skits written by two ex Carsonera Tonight Show writers take a look at this one.

In this film they make fun of those crazy ads and programming by doing outrageous spoof ads interspersed with an old 1950's B movie with a lot of projection problems.Any couch potato with a good sense of humor and a memory of the 70's  80's television programming should enjoy this one!

	schema:reviewBody "This is not subtle comedy.  This is not a thoughtprovoking parody of everyday life.What it IS is a broad inyourface farce that goes anywhere and everywhere to grab your funny bone.  And in most instances it works.The movie is loosely constructed around the premise of late night television complete with a grade B 50's style scifi film providing the central nexus around which the movie is built.  Skit changes are presented as channel switching or commercial breaks.  Because of the skit nature of the movie the changes between set pieces can be abrupt and each piece will succeed or fail on it's own merits.  Amazon Women on the Moon hits fortunately far more times than it misses. POSSIBLE SPOILERS One of the funniest pieces of the film is the initial segment featuring a very physical performance by a young Arsenio Hall.  My sides hurt from laughing during this segment and helped set the mood for the rest of the film.A pre In Living Color David Allen Greir turns in a hilarious performance as Don NoSoul Simmons.  His facial expressions and physical mannerisms are perfect for the role.  You almost feel as if you should find your wallet to donate to the Blacks Without Soul foundation.  I also got a great chuckle out of watching a 70's era pimp in full HuggieBear outfit touting the benefits of driving a Volvo Station Wagon.The Two forms of ID skit is both funny and prophetic considering this movie was made in 1987.  Anyone who is familiar with googling a potential date will see more than just a hint of irony here.Carrie Princess Leia Fisher and Paul Eating Raul Martel also turn in all too accurate performances spoofing the old educational films of the 50's. Anyone who has seen Reefer Madness will get a kick out of this.Overall this movie is fun to watch especially with a larger group of friends when you want to sit around and just have a hearty mindless laugh. There's something here for everyone and it's just plain fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie fairly soon after it was released. I didn't enjoy very much of it other than the segment at the beginning with Arsenio Hall. In the meantime I've become quite a big fan of B movies and a lot of the people in this film are now near and dear to my heart. I think I have a better understanding of what they were trying to do in this film now but I don't think on the whole it was very successful. The film remains fun for fans of B movies but not nearly as funny as I think it tried to be.It's certainly watchable as it is fastmoving and features many memorable faces from not only B movie lore but popular culture at large. For example in the same segment you can see legendary exploitation director Russ Meyer Faster Pussycat Kill Kill! and standup star Andrew Dice Clay. The film's epilogue features Carrie Fisher of Star Wars fame and directorcharacter actor Paul Bartel Eating Raoul in a funny spoof on educational style exploitation films. Monster movie fandom icon Forrest Ackerman appears as the President in the extended scifi sequences Phil Hartman does a sports announcer voice Arsenio Hall is a man terrorized by his own apartment Lana Clarkson now famous for very undesireable reasons in connection to Phil Spector is an amazon woman B.B. King urges tolerance and sympathy towards Blacks without Soul Henry Silva appears as himself to spoof Jack Palance's television gig in Bullsh or not and so on and so forth. You could have a pretty good time watching this movie just trying to spot random celebs who came from the B movie world and others who became big stars later Michelle Pfeiffer for example.But the bits and pieces don't add up to a good film and the film fatally fails to walk the tight line required for a B type movie even an expensive one with big stars between its camp and its serious side. The scifi segments in particular fall pretty flat and I have to imagine would fail to amuse anyone but geeks like myself who recognize some of the inside jokes. Surely the outer space scenario being depicted is ridiculous but it actually looks and feels quite a bit like an older scifi film specifically the late 50s Queen of Outer Space without having much of its charm or the sense of innocence about it. With something like the Zuckers' Airplane you can see how cheezy the disaster movies they were spoofing were but at the same time the film itself was more outrageously campy and silly than any real disaster film. But with this film it feels like the filmmakers felt the source material was goofy enough that the laughs should follow from simply a reproduction of some of the genre's original camp elements  they failed to take it to another level where it would become funny in its own right.A lot of the other segments fail to take off as well or overstay their welcome. The bit in the hospital the bit about Two IDs.... a lot of these parts just take a long time and end up having no punch line. The majority of the sketches are basically funny premises beaten into the ground and done in a selfserious style that wastes the opportunities for humor. I just do not feel this movie's conviction  it seems like they were afraid to be too zany but they were also trying really hard to seem irreverent while in fact the film rarely strays into controversial territory.".

	schema:headline " Well I Liked It";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a mostly funny sketch comedy movie with some hits and some misses that obviously will divide the audience. The two sketches that are total stinkers  Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg sketch about a woman running a different kind of credit check on a blind date. This was my least favorite sketch. Up until this point I was laughing steadily at the movie but here I didn't laugh once. Really derailed the movie's momentum.  The comedy roast funeral with a lot of old comics like Steve Allen and Rip Taylor. Terribly unfunny and it goes on forever. Very painful to sit through.The funniest sketches  Opening sketch with Arsenio Hall as an accidentprone man having the worst day ever in his apartment. Lots of old school slapstick comedy that won't be to everyone's tastes but I laughed out loud through the whole thing.  The Pethouse Video sketch mocking vacuous centerfolds. In addition to being funny it features the gorgeous Monique Gabrielle walking around naked the whole sketch.  Henry Silva sketch mocking In Search Of type shows  A man has his life reviewed like a movie by two Siskel  Eberttype critics  Son of the Invisible Man  Teenager trying to buy condoms with frustrating results  Video date sketch with Marc McClure  Amazon Women on the Moon sketch that lovingly mocks 50s scifi. This one runs throughout the film and is very amusing particularly if you're a fan of those types of films.  Another running gag Lou Jacobi as a man zapped into his television and appears in various sketches throughout the movie looking for helpAs you can see there's more good than bad. The rest of the sketches in the film are brief but chuckleworthy. The only two that are absolutely terrible are the ones I listed above. Make sure you sit through the credits for the Reefer Madness spoof with Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartel. It's worth it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a mostly funny sketch comedy movie with some hits and some misses that obviously will divide the audience. The two sketches that are total stinkers  Rosanna Arquette and Steve Guttenberg sketch about a woman running a different kind of credit check on a blind date. This was my least favorite sketch. Up until this point I was laughing steadily at the movie but here I didn't laugh once. Really derailed the movie's momentum.  The comedy roast funeral with a lot of old comics like Steve Allen and Rip Taylor. Terribly unfunny and it goes on forever. Very painful to sit through.The funniest sketches  Opening sketch with Arsenio Hall as an accidentprone man having the worst day ever in his apartment. Lots of old school slapstick comedy that won't be to everyone's tastes but I laughed out loud through the whole thing.  The Pethouse Video sketch mocking vacuous centerfolds. In addition to being funny it features the gorgeous Monique Gabrielle walking around naked the whole sketch.  Henry Silva sketch mocking In Search Of type shows  A man has his life reviewed like a movie by two Siskel  Eberttype critics  Son of the Invisible Man  Teenager trying to buy condoms with frustrating results  Video date sketch with Marc McClure  Amazon Women on the Moon sketch that lovingly mocks 50s scifi. This one runs throughout the film and is very amusing particularly if you're a fan of those types of films.  Another running gag Lou Jacobi as a man zapped into his television and appears in various sketches throughout the movie looking for helpAs you can see there's more good than bad. The rest of the sketches in the film are brief but chuckleworthy. The only two that are absolutely terrible are the ones I listed above. Make sure you sit through the credits for the Reefer Madness spoof with Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartel. It's worth it.";

	schema:headline " An authentic parody on latenight telly that works despite some forced and silly sideskits.";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess it was perfect timing that I watch this late last night because it goes handtohand with its overall context and what it's trying to come across as. This starstudded production with the likes of John Landis and Joe Dante directing some of these gags and segments come up with a compilation comedy that lampoons latenight American TV. The main focus is on a Zgrade 1950's Scifi film called 'Amazon woman on the moon' but it's the small comedy sketches of infocommercials that flooded proceedings. The majority of the film is filled with these comical ads and pointless interruptions and breaks with the zgrade feature more so in the background. Which is quite sad as from what get out of this flick is a correct parody on latenight telly and some of it is mildly entertaining. It's just sometimes the one idea gimmick had me smiling while other times it had me rolling my eyes. Some skits worked with their ingenious side gags and selfreferential humour while others totally missed the point by overplaying its hand or they were rather thin. Some of my favourite segments would be the Video date Don 'no soul' Simmons Murray in videoland critics corner and bullsh!t or not. Plus the zgrade mocking of 'Amazon woman on the moon' is neatly setup and done with great effect with its dodgy sets awful dialog wooden acting women in skimpy outfits with Sybil Danning appearing choppy editing and the many pointless interruptions that go through the flick. They just nailed it! The whole parody is interesting and it works in small slabs but the whole execution was rather uneven and downright hectic. Maybe too many directors spoil the brew? As some segments and gags just don't fit in with others that being the context or that of the humour. The narration is all over the place but that was intended by mocking these type of productions and the clever script is done with enough panache and wit. You'll notice a lot of familiar faces popping up throughout like Rosanna Arquette Griffin Dunne Michelle Pfeiffer Steve Guttenberg Dick Millar Ralph Bellamy Arsenio Hall Phil Hartman and many more. But just don't think it's finish when the credits start rolling as there's another sendup following involving Carrie Fisher called reckless youth. Pocking fun of the 30's when there was movieTV propaganda about foolishness of teens and how your youth can destroy you by taking reckless temptations.The feature did kinda remind me of Monty Python gags and definitely in the way the format was presented. These Python's films are 'And Now For Something Completely Different' and 'The Meaning of Life'. Although a friend of mine told me that this idea for this film is similar to 'The Kentucky Fried Movie' 1977 the same people who went on to create the spoof 'Airplane'. It supposedly was a catalyst for this type of picture.Basically it's a fairly entertaining watch and true to its sources but still rather forgettable when it came to shove.".

The Titan's is also very funny.  wow thats a grammatical error.  The Amazon women on the moon is just awful.  I love the jumpy cuts.  And of couse Bullst or Not! where jack the ripper is really the loch ness monster....But the best the pinnacle of this movie comes after the credits.  I cannot stop laughing at the memory of this skit.The funniest part goes like thisCarrie Fisher is talking to her doctor and tells him about this party she goes to Carrie  it was a wild party... Scene shifts from Fisher to a small room with five people sitting in chairs bouncing balloons around.Then of course when her husband ken gets the social disease and suddenly loses his eyesight while driving....Oh god.Anyways some of the skits do drag a bit.  The critics corner is kind of dull.  The man in the tv while probably very very funny when it was made remotes being pretty new stuff at that point falls kinda flat now.  The hospital scene is funny in theory but the actors kind of drag it out.However the movie in whole is hilarious great for people with very low attention spans and perfect for parties especially parties so wild you toss balloons around.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a supposed sequel to a John Landis movie I've never seen called Kentucky Fried Movie. I will say that this movie is a heck of a lot better than the spoof of T.V. movies that I've seen such as Tunnelvision or The Groove Tube.The film has some weaknesses. Due to the presence of 5 directors who all came up with their own material the film lurches through different types of situations. From hilarious commercials to spoofing T.V. shows to SNL style sketch comedy to even making old black and white short films as well as the title film it changes without any rhyme or reason. There are some cruel sketches as well. Still the film is a classic because of the memorable characters created. In particular David Alan Grier's Don No Soul Simmons who appears in the Blacks With No Soul and a segment where you can buy his albums are hilarious. I'd love to get those albums especially Don No Soul Simmons Gets Down And Funky. I feel that Alfonso Ribeiro's character of Carleton Banks from The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air was derived from him they look dress talk sing dance and have the same interests in music. Joey Travolta's attempt to ape his brother John's Barbarino character in the Amazon Woman segment is pretty hilarious too. Of course Mondo Condo featuring Arsenio Hall in an apartment cursed with Murphy's Law is still hilarious as is the two segments featuring Archie Hahn Real Life Movie Review and Roasting A Loved One actually based on a show that existed where comedians got roasted on T.V.. Some great lines from those segmentsI'm sorry but I have to give Harvey Pitnik a big thumbs downWe're here to put two things to rest Harvey and the fact that Charlie Callas is funny!We've got two pieces of bad news Milton Berle couldn't be here and Rip Taylor is.Even the two blackandwhite featurettes are interesting. Ever wanted to see Ed Begley Jr. naked. Here you go. Ever wanted to see a glimpse of what a message film from the 30's about the evils of sexual diseases was like? It's here.The commercials are alright. Other than the No Soul commercials the Silly Pate I'm eating Popeye. comes close the rest are weak although the Irving Sidney novel commercial should have given Sidney Sheldon a good idea for a future novel.The SNL skits are a mixed bag. Mondo Condo is a classic. The one with the then married couple of Michelle Pfeiffer and Peter Horton trying to get their delivered baby from a doctor played by Griffin Dunne is great for one line uttered by HortonThat's not our son! That's a Mister Potato Head!The cruel skit involves Matt Adler Kelly Preston Steve Cropper Howard Hesseman and Ralph Bellamy and it's about a teenager buying condoms for the first time and finding out that he was the billionth man to buy them and is paraded around in embarrassing fashion. The Video Date one is pretty good until it gets a bit nasty in the end but since it features Russ Meyer and Andrew Dice Clay it wouldn't surprise me if Meyer came up with the plot for this one as a lot of his movies are like this. The Two I.D.'s skit with Steve Guttenberg and Rosanna Arquette is a frightening portent of today's fears of your private life being available for the public to know about. Video Pirates is weak why this one was made is beyond me as well as seeing Lou Jacobi in a running joke of being trapped on T.V.The movie says it has a lot of actors in it's opening credits. You'll see oldmovie stars established actors up and comers bluesman B.B. King comedians and cult movie directors such as Meyer and Paul Bartel. As well one of the most beautiful array of female talent ever assembled. A female cast with Michelle Pfeiffer Rosanna Arquette Kelly Preston Sybil Danning in the Amazon Women segments Lana Clarkson Amazon Women Angel Tompkins Irving Sidney Carrie Fisher you Star Wars fans loved her outfit in Return Of The Jedi former Playboy Playmate Monique Gabrielle an honourable mention in my tops list for beauty and former Penthouse Pet Corrinne Wahl nee Alphen. You can't beat that.Put it all together and you have a film that must be seen once a year at least. An ambitious project and even though it has a few flaws it's great. I wish they'd make something like this today.".

Interestingly there's no cannibalism at all.

Once Catherine is fully ensconced in the tribe she deals with character rivalries tribal customs and conflicting loyalties and emotions. There's some honour and romance at stake plus a minor mystery to be dealt with and revenge to be had. White Slave mobilises from being an extremely bythenumbers exploitation film to one with an involving story and human qualities you can get into. You still have to put up with one of the silliest court trials in the world it's used as a framing device but overall I found this film to be a pleasant surprise.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Italian film with once again more alternative titles than actual dialogue is a mid80's exploitation attempt by enthusiast director Mario Gariazzo who obviously was deeply impressed by the work of his fellow Italian filmmakers Rugero Deodato and Umberto Lenzi. It's a supposedly true story yeahsure about an 18yearold girl who visits her parents' plantation in the middle of the Amazon jungle. Shortly after her arrival her parents are brutally murdered and beheaded during a boat ride. The poor cutie is taken prisoner by a savage and primitive tribe. During two years she's has to take part in traditional and barbaric rites of this tribe. She's sold to the richest man in town price  one goat and a chicken has to work and eventually she escapes with the head warrior she has fallen in love with. Now 'Amazonia' isn't a bad little flick but it tries to be so much bigger than it actually is. The entire production seems to shout out 'Look we're as good as Cannibal Holocaust!!!' The opening sequences in which the beautiful jungle is shown guided by a great score is an exact copy of Deodato's film and throughout the whole film the same documentary style is used. The film could have done without these pretentious aspects. At his best Amazonia is like a fairly reasonable crossover between Cannibal Holocaust and Umberto Lenzi's 'Deep River Savages' in which an Englishman spends years among a primitive tribe in NewGuinea. It's not nearly as memorable as the majority of Italian sleaze classics and that's merely due to the atrocious acting of Elvire Audrey. There's some great gore and terrific authentic sleaze to enjoy though.".

And while I certainly found elements of the film enjoyable in the way that only a good exploitation film can be there are far too many problems I have with the film for me to consider it much more than average at best.What Works The Gore If you're a fan of the red stuff Amazonia delivers. While the total number of scenes of gratuitous gore may be fewer than in some other films of this type the gore is very well done and for the most part reasonably realistic. I was especially impressed with a scene depicting a human head being cut off. There are scenes in this movie that are definitely not for the squeamish.Plot Ideas It may not be completely original but I liked the idea of the kidnapped young girl living with and growing in the Headhunter society. It presents the opportunities for some interesting setpieces.What Doesn't Work It's Not Really a Cannibal Film Regardless of how it was marketed Amazonia isn't really a cannibal movie. The film's only real cannibals are dispatched within five minutes of making their appearance.The Acting Elvire Audray as Catherine Miles is positively wretched. Everything she does and says further reinforces the notion that she's a second rate actress. The rest of the acting is no better. One look at the courtroom scenes should be enough to demonstrate to anyone just how bad the acting is.A Sappy Love Story If I sit down to watch a trashy Eurocannibal film I want a trashy Eurocannibal film. Unfortunately Amazonia is full of too many melodramatic sappy moments. And that ending is straight out of a Lifetime movie. It's beyond ridiculous.The Headhunters I hate to compare any film of this genre with Cannibal Holocaust but it's hard not to. The cannibals in Cannibal Holocaust look like the real deal  wild savage dirty and all but alien. In contrast the natives in Amazonia are too clean. Most look like they've just had a shower a shave and a hair cut. And am I seriously supposed to believe that one of these Headhunters knows English or Italian or whatever language? That must have been some kind of correspondence class she was taking.Overall Amazonia is a weak film when compared with other movies of its ilk. It's neither as good and powerful as Cannibal Holocaust nor is it as silly and fun as something like Massacre in Dinosaur Valley. If you're a fan of this kind of movie you might find something worthwhile but overall it's liable to be a disappointing experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another example of cheap exploitation this should be of interest to cult movies fans due to the fact that a it's Italian and b it's a jungleset adventure featuring cannibals. However those expecting another CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST will be in for a bit of a disappointment with this sometimesamateurish effort which adopts the style of what I like to call a schlockumentary  ie. the events that occur in the film all claim to be true and the movie even goes so far as to incorporate supposedly real crime scene footage of a mortician holding up a severed head  it's so blatantly fake that I find it hard to believe that anyone could have been taken in by this. In any case although a tribe of cannibals are mentioned there's no gutchewing in this movie. Instead throughout the typical jungle antics we get repeated cuts to courtroom footage where the lead character Katherine Miles is on trial for the slaughter of her uncle and aunt. This adds an original if unconvincing framework to what is basically another exploitational bloodandskin jungle shocker.The lead is played by the otherwise unknown Elvire Audray a young and nubile blonde who spends the entirety of the film topless  an authentic facet of the movie of course and not an excuse to show some naked female flesh. The setting the native tribe the music and the style of filming all make for an authentic feel to the movie ironically only ruined by the intrusion of the badlyacted courtroom sequences which pop up periodically. At least the framework of the movie gives it a structured plot so that you actually feel that it's going somewhere instead of middling along aimlessly like some of these jungle shockers do. Although pretty Audray can't act very well and the cast are generally wooden or ham actors. The only exception is Alvaro Gonzales whose tribesman Umakai is a genuinely noble and heroic figure thanks to his strong almost mute performance.The movie is pretty gory as a whole so it comes as no surprise that it has been cut in its UK release. Nonetheless bits of gruesomeness remaining that the film has to offer include bloody deaths by blowpipe darts heads being chopped from corpses ironically this is cut when it happens but left in during a later flashback to the event reallife animal violence forced rape a man having his face eaten off by ants flies and worms a man being eaten by a crocodile and the culminating double axe murder with Katherine as the culprit. Rotting severed heads also play a bit part in the film's narrative. There's also one of those lovely grubeating interludes which Lenzi saw fit to include in his influential CANNIBAL FEROX film. Exploitation fans might get a kick out of this sometimes sleepy expose of jungle life thanks to the atmosphere and scenic setting it offers but there's no real horror here  only some shoddy gore effects.".

This adds an original if unconvincing framework to what is basically another exploitational bloodandskin jungle shocker.The lead is played by the otherwise unknown Elvire Audray a young and nubile blonde who spends the entirety of the film topless  an authentic facet of the movie of course and not an excuse to show some naked female flesh. The setting the native tribe the music and the style of filming all make for an authentic feel to the movie ironically only ruined by the intrusion of the badlyacted courtroom sequences which pop up periodically. At least the framework of the movie gives it a structured plot so that you actually feel that it's going somewhere instead of middling along aimlessly like some of these jungle shockers do. Although pretty Audray can't act very well and the cast are generally wooden or ham actors. The only exception is Alvaro Gonzales whose tribesman Umakai is a genuinely noble and heroic figure thanks to his strong almost mute performance.The movie is pretty gory as a whole so it comes as no surprise that it has been cut in its UK release. Nonetheless bits of gruesomeness remaining that the film has to offer include bloody deaths by blowpipe darts heads being chopped from corpses ironically this is cut when it happens but left in during a later flashback to the event reallife animal violence forced rape a man having his face eaten off by ants flies and worms a man being eaten by a crocodile and the culminating double axe murder with Katherine as the culprit. Rotting severed heads also play a bit part in the film's narrative. There's also one of those lovely grubeating interludes which Lenzi saw fit to include in his influential CANNIBAL FEROX film. Exploitation fans might get a kick out of this sometimes sleepy expose of jungle life thanks to the atmosphere and scenic setting it offers but there's no real horror here  only some shoddy gore effects.";

The parents are murdered and their heads cut off but Catherine is saved by a member of the tribe who appears to have a thing for her. Catherine is then taken back to their village where she witnesses all sorts of horrors.There's no question that Italy was the home of the cannibal movie and many think that it reached its height with CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.

For some reason this movie doesn't get much attention from fans when they discuss the genre but I personally thought it was a fairly entertaining movie although it certainly doesn't rank among the best.What I enjoyed the most was Audray herself. The horrible English dubbing makes it hard to really judge her performance but I thought she was extremely cute in the part and I also thought she was rather believable in the role. This was especially true as the character becomes more like those holding her hostage. The supporting players are decent at best but there's certainly nothing horrible here.The film also benefits from a very good score by Franco Campanino which clearly wants to be like the one in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. There's also the violence and gore which is pretty fun although there's no question that the effects aren't as good as what we saw in films from earlier in the decade. There are a couple decapitations several other body parts cut off and plenty of blood throughout. Fans of gore will certainly get a kick out of some of the violence here and especially a couple head shots.AMAZONIA THE CATHERINE MILES STORY starts off with the lead character going to trial for murder and throughout the film we get some narration of her testifying in court.

The lead actress is pretty much nekkid for 34 of the film. This distracts from an otherwise horrid acting performance but hey we're not looking for Oscar nominees with titles like White Slave are we? Blood and violence? Oh yes we have that as well and some of it is actually pretty decent! Let's see Decapitations check. Blow darting check. Gratuitous acts of animal violence a tiger jumping up and nailing this little monkey is pretty sweet check. We also have random club beatings and people hung upside down to be eaten alive by insects. Yeah this was definitely a good way to knock off an hour and a half of my life. Anyway if you're looking for another Cannibal Holocaust forget it. This is just a guilty pleasure with no scars left behind unlike Cannibal Holocaust and one worth checking out. I give it 7 out of 10 for more boobies than you can shake a stick at.".

Gratuitous acts of animal violence a tiger jumping up and nailing this little monkey is pretty sweet check. We also have random club beatings and people hung upside down to be eaten alive by insects. Yeah this was definitely a good way to knock off an hour and a half of my life. Anyway if you're looking for another Cannibal Holocaust forget it. This is just a guilty pleasure with no scars left behind unlike Cannibal Holocaust and one worth checking out. I give it 7 out of 10 for more boobies than you can shake a stick at.";

What is left is mild compared to today's graphic depiction of sexbut since the story unfolds against an interesting historical background in London during the reign of Charles II it is worth viewing. Linda Darnell was not the first choice for AmberPeggy Cummins began the role but after filming several scenes was dismissed as being too immature. Linda makes a voluptuous willful Amber. Cornel Wilde is excellent as Bruce Carlton her true lovealthough an unrequited one by the film's end. George Sanders does a terrific job as Charles II spouting some of the film's wittiest dialogue and clever in his catandmouse game with Amber. Richard Haydn as the Earl of Radcliffe gives perhaps the most interesting performance in the entire film particularly during the fire sequences. The London fire is staged with authority as are the scenes involving the Black Plague. David Raksin's musical background is a sumptuous richly textured score now available on CD from Marco Polo records. A film full of rich details under Otto Preminger's directionbut not as strong because of censorship restrictions and the inability to tell the story the way Windsor wrote it. The ending is entirely too abrupt in the video print with the original lengthier ending missing for some reason. Fans of Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde will especially like this one.".

Without The Code and the Catholic Legion of Decency inspecting all the product that came from Hollywood Amber St. Clair's sexual escapades during Restoration Great Britain would have been a far better film. Still it's not bad as it is.Another reviewer compared it to Gone With the Wind. You can look at that in two ways the interaction between Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde and compare it to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Lots of similarities there. But also the book itself was a blockbuster best seller in the Forties as Gone With the Wind was in the previous decade and brought in a builtin audience.Kathleen Winsor when she wrote the novel was married to her first husband a football player who was a history student. For his honor's thesis he was writing about the Stuart Restoration. From his research material Winsor became fascinated with the period and created her novel.20th Century Fox and Otto Preminger got the rights and did a fine job in recreating the United Kingdom of the 1660s. Linda Darnell got one of her best roles in her career as Amber a high spirited and vivacious girl like Scarlett O'Hara who finds true love but sacrifices it for ambition.In class conscious times as those were there were few venues for people to rise even less if you were a woman. Darnell rises from Newgate Prison to the court of Charles II where she becomes one of Charles's numerous mistresses. Along the way she uses many men like highwayman John Russell army captain Glenn Langan nobleman Richard Haydn and even her own true love nobleman Cornel Wilde with whom she has a son out of wedlock.Presiding over it all is a world weary and cynical George Sanders who plays Charles II. Sanders would play The Merry Monarch in another and vastly inferior film called The King's Thief. He does capture the jaded cynicism of Charles II so very well it's one of his top five career parts. If the title role in the film were about the male lead Bruce Carlton I'm sure Darryl Zanuck would have cast Tyrone Power in the part as he appeared in several films opposite Linda Darnell. Instead Cornel Wilde steps in and he's a most dashing Restoration nobleman and seeker of fortune in the New World.The most spellbinding performance and so against type is that of Richard Haydn as the elderly rake Lord Radcliff. He's a widower who's looking for a 17th century trophy wife and finds one in Linda who at the point in time he first meets her is an actress. He's a coldblooded person of mystery and menace and really registers it well on the screen. He marries Linda and she inherits his title when he dies.Haydn is killed in a thrilling scene involving the great fire of London which occurred in 1666. It's the highlight of the film and I can't say any more about how and why he's killed but trust me it was one deserved end.Though Forever Amber is a good film it could have been far better but for censorship problems. Still it provides Darnell Sanders and Haydn with some of their best career parts and is worth seeing.".

He's not in it much however.The production itself is pretty good some great costumes and sets. The swordfighting scene with thankfully little dialogue was excellent and far too short. The story itself is a little choppy. The first scene was a nonsequitur promising a potentially interesting plot device that never came.

Cornell Wilde is NOT Clark Gablebut who was? Still both manager to give satisfactory performances.Wilde's best scenes are with the child who looks very much like him. There is a warmth and humor about Wilde when he is interacting with the child that is charming.  His Baron Carlton is aloof and something of a snob with everyone else.  He is aware of his station in life and unable to break his code of behavior even for Amber.  I have no doubt he likes her but I don't think he ever loved her in the same way she loved him.  He never really seems to empathize with her struggles but is genuinely grateful to her for saving his life and delighted with his young son.  He is an puzzle wrapped in a conundrum.Amber is all surface.  She has the depth of a parkinglot puddle and I find myself wishing Maureen O'Hara had been cast.  Then REAL sparks would fly. In Darnell's Amber we get a smudgepot.  Oh well.The glimpses of the court and old London the plague and the fire are interesting and in general the film is FUN.My one REAL regret is that we never see enough of Wilde fencing.  He was a National fencing champion and on the 1936 Olympic Fencing team but his fencing scene in Amber is shot through fog so dense you can hardly see him. That's a shame!!Enjoy that barnburner for what it is not what it could have been!".

It was for its time a racy book that makes it clear that Amber sleeps her way to the top. Also the book was historically accurate and even at 800 pages a fascinating read. 20th Century Fox took the book jettisoned all the racy stuff more or less and spent great care and no expense in bringing this to the screen. It's in beautiful color with gorgeous costumes and sets. Sure there are plot holes and bad acting but this is never dull and speeds along. Even at 140 minutes it didn't seem too long.Darnell is beautiful and pretty good in the lead. George Sanders matches her playing Charles II. He's clearly enjoying himself. Richard Greene is good also popping up as a friend of Ambers. However Wilde is pretty bad as Carltonyou keep wondering what Amber sees in him. The silly wig he wears doesn't do him any favors. It's kind of funny to realize this was considered pretty dirty back in 1947. It wouldn't raise an eyebrow today and as it is the movie never makes it clear that Amber is sleeping around.So it's colorful elaborate and well worth catching.

The result is nowhere near as bad as one would guess.Based on a novel by Kathleen Winsor who had definitely been thinking about the story since she saw Gone with the Wind 8 years earlier the story concerns Amber a great beauty at the time the Stuarts were restored to the English throne. Amber is ambitious for the finer things in life a la Madame Bovary. She leaves her life of poverty and the man she is told to marry and gets a ride to the big city with Bruce Carlton Cornel Wilde and Lord Almsbury Richard Greene two adventurers who want to get the money promised them by King Charles II George Sanders for their last voyage and then go off to sea again. Amber falls in love with Carlton immediately. The two have a romance but for Carlton it's more a dalliance. However he leaves Amber pregnant. She's cheated out of the money he gave her by two con artists and she's arrested.Amber escapes prison with the help of a highwayman John Russell who uses her in his robbery gang she seduces the victim to go with her and he's robbed. One night as the police chase her she runs into the home of Captain Rex Morgan Glenn Langan. Morgan tells Amber that if she takes a job on the stage she will have the king's protection. So the next thing we know Amber is a performer. Eventually she winds up as a favorite of King Charles and lives in the palace with her son.The film started out starring Peggy Cummins who apparently wasn't doing a very good job. She was replaced with Linda Darnell who is as gorgeous as a blond as she was as a brunette. Though she's very sensual as Amber she's not particularly vixenish or fiery. Her costumes are absolutely stunning. The whole color production is stunning sumptuously produced.As one might guess the story was mighty scandalous in the '40s with Amber sleeping her way to the top as it were. The film received horrific publicity because the Catholic church demanded changes and if they didn't get them the film would get the feared C rating condemned which meant Catholics couldn't go and see it. The changes were made the film was rated B objectionable in part for all but because of all the bad publicity it didn't make much money.Forever Amber moves a little slowly and Darnell has no chemistry with Cornell Wilde. Not only that but there isn't much film footage showing why she fell for him. The cast is pretty good with a charming performance by Richard Greene and a nice character turn by Anne Revere. Sanders is a real standout as is Richard Haydn as the Earl of Radcliffe. Wilde doesn't register much he could never warm up the camera but he looks good here.A derivative film but worth seeing for Darnell's great beauty.".

	schema:headline " Forgettable Historical Melodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "Kathleen Winsor's novel is frequently referred to as a bodice ripper a description often used for mildly salacious historical romances generally featuring passionate strongwilled heroines and dashing tempestuous heroes. Although the Catholic League of Decency saw to it that much of the salaciousness went missing between book and screen Puritanism in America is clearly not an exclusively Protestant phenomenon the film version still preserves a healthy ration of tempestuous passion. The heroine is Amber St Clair a beautiful farmer's daughter in the reign of Charles II who becomes an actress a fashionable London lady and eventually the mistress of the King himself. The decade immediately following the Restoration was one of the most dramatic in English history and the plot of Forever Amber milks that drama to the full featuring plague fire a highwayman a duel and the heroine's numerous love affairs.I would agree with the reviewer who pointed out the similarity of the plot to that of Gone with the Wind with Amber as a seventeenthcentury Scarlett O'Hara and her lover Lord Bruce Carlton as the Rhett Butler figure the one man whom the heroine truly loves but eventually loses. Amber's obsession with Bruce brings out the best in her character she courageously and selflessly nurses him through the plague but also the worst seen in her unsuccessful attempts to destroy his relationship with his new American wife Corinne. It also ruins her chances of happiness with any other man leading to the deaths of her elderly husband and a fianc killed in a duel and to the loss of the King's favour. He cannot bear the idea that his mistresses might have feelings for other men.The ending of the film in which Amber loses her young son to Bruce and Corinne seems to have been added by the filmmakers to placate the League of Decency showing her being punished for her sins. It also provides the pretext for a display of American patriotism with the implication that the boy will enjoy a morally purer life in the New World away from the aristocratic decadence of the Old. This contrast between the innocence and purity of Young America and the cynicism and corruption of Old Europe is of course a common theme in American popular culture but I was rather surprised to find it pushed as far back into history as the good old colonial days of the sixteensixties. As young Bruce junior was destined to become the master of a Virginia plantation built on slave labour I doubt if his new life in the colonies was any morally purer than the life he might have led as an English aristocrat and the son of the King's mistress.As a historical melodrama Forever Amber is not in the same class as Gone with the Wind. This is partly because of the look of the film the colour is rather dark and muddy but mostly because the leading actors could not bring to their roles the same depth that Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable brought to Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. I found it ironic that Peggy Cummins was sacked from the part of Amber because she was not worldly enough as I felt that Linda Darnell also came across as too young and innocent particularly in the later scenes where Amber has matured into a scheming courtesan. It perhaps might have been a better film if the slightly older and more experienced Susan Hayward who was also considered had got the part. As for Cornell Wilde he made a rather uncharismatic Bruce and I found it difficult to conceive of him as the great love of Amber's life. The other characters do not make much impression with the exception of George Sanders' King Charles. He was perhaps slightly too old for the part Charles was only thirty at the time of the Restoration but his cynical saturnine interpretation of the role was probably closer to the real Charles than the dashing merry monarch of the popular imagination. Him apart however this film is a largely forgettable historical melodrama. 510".

	schema:headline " Interminable Amber";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow this movie is long.  It also makes Mary Poppins look like a BBC production as the number of English actors in this War and Peace sized epic of ye Olde England during the Restoration can  be counted on one hand... and that's probably being generous.   I was just amazed how remarkably American everyone in this movie sounds with the sole exception of George Saunders and Jessica Tandy.   Even Black Jack Mallard sounds just like John Wayne. Yet it can't be any worse than its source Kathleen Winsor's lengthy yet mediocre wartime pulp novel which is essentially a thousand pages of lines like It was not until after he was dead that Amber realized how much Rex Morgan had meant to her.Despite the long running time and the comainducing script Linda Darnell tries her best to portray Amber I want much more than this provincial life St. Clare who goes from Puritan Miss to Material Girl within about 15 minutes and 15 costume changes.  I agree with the previous reviewer that this movie would have been much more enjoyable if there had been some glimmering of a spark between Linda Darnell and Cornell Wilde. But Wilde is a crashing bore and probably the least attractive of all of Amber's boyfriends.  God only knows why she finds him so fascinating... no doubt because it was in the script.   After the increasingly slutty Amber jumps in and out of various situations like a Jack in the box the movie grinds to a halt when Cornell Wilde comes back to London with his wholesome new American missus.  SPOILERS  In a situation more than reminiscent of Madama Butterfly Wilde then wants to take Amber's illegitimate kid back to the Colonies with him where he can raise him away from all that decadent old world nastiness.  Although unlike Butterfly Amber doesn't commit ritual suicide although I rather kept wishing she would she lets the kid go and... that's it. Linda Darnell turns towards the camera emoting and roll credits.That is all in all quite possibly the lamest ending I've seen in any movie ever.   Mainly one watches a movie like this for the eye candy but the sets are nothing to write home about and the costumes only bear a passing resemblance to actual Restoration fashion.  Fullbottomed wigs and petticoat breeches are nowhere to be seen all the doublets are padded thickly in the shoulders like gangster suits and Linda Darnell herself wears a succession of poofy dresses indistinguishable from a hundred other costume epics done in the '40s.  Frenchman's Creek filmed three years before actually does a far better job in the costuming department and with honesttoGod English actors in the lead roles! Also for old swashbuckling Hollywood glamor Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Don Juan is a thousand times more entertaining and for anyone with a passing interest in the period of time that Amber strives to portray should immediately hie themselves to a video store and get Restoration with Sam Neill and Robert Downey Jr. Forever Amber is right in that it seemingly takes forever and goes nowhere.

	onyx:emotionText "Wow this movie is long.  It also makes Mary Poppins look like a BBC production as the number of English actors in this War and Peace sized epic of ye Olde England during the Restoration can  be counted on one hand... and that's probably being generous.   I was just amazed how remarkably American everyone in this movie sounds with the sole exception of George Saunders and Jessica Tandy.   Even Black Jack Mallard sounds just like John Wayne. Yet it can't be any worse than its source Kathleen Winsor's lengthy yet mediocre wartime pulp novel which is essentially a thousand pages of lines like It was not until after he was dead that Amber realized how much Rex Morgan had meant to her.Despite the long running time and the comainducing script Linda Darnell tries her best to portray Amber I want much more than this provincial life St. Clare who goes from Puritan Miss to Material Girl within about 15 minutes and 15 costume changes.  I agree with the previous reviewer that this movie would have been much more enjoyable if there had been some glimmering of a spark between Linda Darnell and Cornell Wilde. But Wilde is a crashing bore and probably the least attractive of all of Amber's boyfriends.  God only knows why she finds him so fascinating... no doubt because it was in the script.   After the increasingly slutty Amber jumps in and out of various situations like a Jack in the box the movie grinds to a halt when Cornell Wilde comes back to London with his wholesome new American missus.  SPOILERS  In a situation more than reminiscent of Madama Butterfly Wilde then wants to take Amber's illegitimate kid back to the Colonies with him where he can raise him away from all that decadent old world nastiness.  Although unlike Butterfly Amber doesn't commit ritual suicide although I rather kept wishing she would she lets the kid go and... that's it. Linda Darnell turns towards the camera emoting and roll credits.That is all in all quite possibly the lamest ending I've seen in any movie ever.   Mainly one watches a movie like this for the eye candy but the sets are nothing to write home about and the costumes only bear a passing resemblance to actual Restoration fashion.  Fullbottomed wigs and petticoat breeches are nowhere to be seen all the doublets are padded thickly in the shoulders like gangster suits and Linda Darnell herself wears a succession of poofy dresses indistinguishable from a hundred other costume epics done in the '40s.

	schema:headline " A very near miss that is still worth watching and should be made available on DVD";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a period epic which is comparable in many ways to Gone With the Wind and might even in other circumstances have been the greater film. Unfortunately a number of factors contributed to the final film showing too many minor flaws for this and the principal reason for rewatching it today is probably the magnificent performance by George Sanders who perfectly depicts the amoral cynicism and jaded sensuality that is correctly or incorrectly always associated with the seventeenth century British monarch King Charles the Second. Although not nominated this was certainly an Oscar worthy role.The filmscript is based on the lengthy florid and sometimes almost turgid 1000 page novel by Kathleen Windsor  a book that had been roundly condemned by the Catholic Church. Twentieth Century Fox's decision to film it was highly controversial. This led to a long running battle with zealots from the Catholic League of Decency which ultimately emasculated the film to the point where it became no more than marginally commercially viable and where the final product was unable to stand the test of time in the way that many other great films from this era have done. Nevertheless it would be interesting to have the chance of seeing how a remastered DVD version would fare if released today and overall I am firmly of the opinion that this film would warrant such treatment. Unfortunately it appears that the first ending which was more in keeping with the original book but was changed under pressure from the Church may now be lost. Twentieth Century Fox accepted pressure to create the revised ending and to introduce a number of other changes designed to stress the immorality inherent in the story just two weeks after the film was first released. SPOILER AHEAD  This new ending shows Amber's out of wedlock son being surrendered to his father who is about to sail back to America to resume running the Plantation he owns there whilst a heartbroken Amber looks on. However Fox seem to have deliberately tweaked the tail of the Church even when making the change. The dialogue now ambiguously refers to how much better it will be for this young boy to be brought up in America learning to operate a slave plantation rather than to stay in England as part of the immoral seventeenth century London Society! The acting was very good but apart from George Sanders not superb. Maureen O'Hara who was considered for the part of Amber might have been more successful in adding some of the fire which was so badly needed in Amber's passionate but unrequited love affair as well perhaps as in her other more career orientated liaisons.The original lighting and cinematography are not easily assessed by watching surviving home video recordings of this film but those who saw it in the cinema largely agree that long sequences particularly in the early part were underlit. Presumably a remastered DVD release could correct this problem. The three strip Technicolor used to create this film was fully satisfactory The costumes have been criticised as being not totally authentic but except for those viewers who are students of costume they were probably perfectly adequate. And if you believe that period costumes should always be accurate remember the really authentic costumes used in the film The Wicked Lady 1945 were rejected by U.S. censors as showing excessive dcolletage so that many scenes had to be refilmed for the American release.The presentation of this story is hard to fault. The London scenario and the sequences involving both the Plague and the Great Fire of London were created excellently. The film also featured a great score which was nominated for an Oscar.Conclusion.For me the film rather dragged it was slow and a little ponderous. Originally this would have best been corrected by shortening a number of overlong scenes so enabling some of the many others from the book which were not filmed to have been incorporated but today a few judicious cuts to shorten the running time a little would serve much the same purpose. Unfortunately and less easily corrected watching this film today gives the impression that its Director Otto Preminger was continuously and nervously looking over his shoulder to assess what openings every sequence he filmed would provide for the Church to attack. Had he been able to concentrate more completely on how these scenes would be received by a modern audience unfamiliar with the atmosphere of the seventeenth century Royal Court he was depicting he might have been able to create a memorable and great film despite the fact that the original book could never have been described in these terms".

But it's also nice to extend yourself past the sort of movies you favor to see what else is out there. Such was the case when I received my copy of FOREVER AMBER. In reading the synopsis I could tell it wasn't my normal type of film to enjoy. But I watched it anyone determined to see if I would enjoy it or not. The end result was a mixed bag.The movie is based on the bestselling novel considered scandalous at the time it was released and banned in several cities. It tells the story of a young woman named Amber St. Clair Linda Darnell raised by puritans who leaves her home behind after meeting an adventurer named Bruce Carlton Cornel Wilde. Carlton romances Amber but then leaves her behind to go off to the new world. He leaves her with some money but she is soon taken advantage of and thrown into prison.Unfortunately for Amber she discovers she is pregnant with Bruce's child. She meets a highwayman when the prison guards pimp out the female prisoners who helps her escape and sets her up in his place. But as the movie moves forward you begin to see that a pattern develops with Amber. This new beau is killed during a scam the pair have concocted and she ends up with another man who wants to marry her never realizing she continues to pine for Bruce with the intent to marry him.Bruce continues to come and go into Amber's life. Her son grows from infant to child. And eventually she finds herself in the King's favor King Charles II George Sanders. But even when she finally achieves the status and social position she thinks will win her the favor of Carlton she brings ruin to her plans. It isn't until the end of the film that you discover if she succeeds or not. And even that is left up in the air when you learn that the company that released the film changed the ending.The movie runs longer than one would think at over 2 hours long for a movie that was released in 1947. And to be honest it felt like it ran long too. That isn't to say it isn't a good movie or that the story doesn't keep you watching but it feels repetitious at times. The acting is superb with both Darnell and Wilde giving it their all. Sanders dry way of playing the king also is worth noting.Fans of night time soaps or costume dramas will find this film to their liking. Others will be able to enjoy it but won't make an effort to seek it out. On the whole it was a nice movie with an interesting story but for me the melodrama became a bit much. Then again I'd just finished watching WUTHERING HEIGHTS before putting this one in so that may not have helped.Twilight Time has provided the cleanest version of the film to ever be offered but what would one expect from them by now? They always do a tremendous job an don't fail to do so here. Extras include an isolated music track a featurette entitled LINDA DARNELL HOLLYWOOD'S FALLEN ANGEL and writings by film historian Julie Kirgo. As with all Twilight Time titles this one is limited to just 3000 copies so if interested pick yours up before they're gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lengthy138 min. costume drama based upon the popular very lengthy novel of the same name. Most of the story is set during the early reign of Charles II of England. However the very brief beginning is set in 1644 during the English Civil War between the Royalists and Parliamentarians. During this earlier time a coach containing Loyalists is being chased by Parliamentarians. The coach stops long enough to deposit an infant girl on a cottage step. A little later the horsemen catch the coach and kill all those inside.Abruptly the screenplay moves forward to when this girl is 16 years old and itching to escape the confines of her life as a farmer's daughter. Perhaps it's that royal blood that she presumably was born with. In any case she thinks she's pretty enough to turn the heads of many a young as well as old gentleman. Against everyone's advice she sets off by herself for London where she meets two gentlemen she got acquainted with in the village tavern. She decides she very much likes one of them Bruce Carlton. The two are home from a voyage looking for a charter to serve as privateers. Clearly Bruce is not yet ready to tie himself down with a wife and children. He prefers an adventurous life to that of court intrigue. Nonetheless Amber persists at trying to throw herself at him. Bruce gets his permission from the King and goes off on another voyage leaving Amber with some money for living expenses. But she loses most of it from a pair of swindlers. She's thrown into prison as a debtor  and escapes thanks to the influence of a highwayman Black Jack who uses her to lure fops into an alley where they are robbed. Eventually Black Jack is killed in one of these heists. Amber has a child fathered by Bruce and then proceeds to form romantic relationships with several men. She nurses Bruce back to health when he comes down with plague and defends him against a thieving woman while sick. He then has to fight a rapier duel over her. Given Bruce's indifference she marries an elderly earl as a kept woman becoming a countess. He dies by fowl play in the great London fire which consumes his mansion. Amber next attracts the attention of King Charles becoming his mistress. Unfortunately Bruce again arrives this time from a plantation in Virginia. He has a wife this time and Amber tries to tarnish her reputation. But it backfires and the King dismisses her as his mistress concluding that she cared more for Bruce than for him. She is opposed to Bruce's pleading that he take Bruce Jr. back with him to Virginia. However Bruce Jr. says he wants to experience the adventure of the New World so she gives him up. She has lost those she loves most as well as her position with Charles. She's still a countess but has no clue what to do with the rest of her life.Linda Darnell is OK in the title role. The various featured men are good in their roles except that Cornel Wilde as Bruce should have been more animated and likable. Too bad Errol Flynn couldn't have his part. Vincent Price had played Charles II in Hudson's Bay and was the original choice for this role here. But George Sanders did a good job.Although Amber was infatuated with Bruce the opposite didn't seem to be true. Unfortunately their preferred lifestyles weren't very compatible. Bruce wanted an adventurous life and Amber wanted a courtly life. In his new life as a Virginia planter he definitely needed a wife and preferably a growing boy such as Bruce Jr Amber had already shown she wasn't interested in a rural life especially in farming. Much of the film appears to have been shot in semidarkness or occasionally fog. At this time shooting in color required strong lights for indoor shots. Or perhaps they wanted a more realistic lighting. Also the copy I saw wasn't a vibrant Technicolor.".

	schema:headline " Flower Power in the GDR";
	schema:reviewBody "The film Die Legende von Paul und Paula is the answer of DEFA to the western Flower Power movement in the sixties. And although normally the Bolshevist film makers have a habit of ridiculing western bourgeois cultural phenomena in this film they look kindly upon the sensual life of the hippies. The result is a bittersweet story. Bitter because Flower Power is a counter culture that revolts against the powers that be. The relation between the young lovers Paula and Paul is passionate and bold. For Paul is still married albeit with a pawky and deceitful woman a pauper and a pouter in an affair that from the start never had a chance. And Paula is a mother of two children just separated because her husband could not remain faithful. Evidently marriage can be a vexation. The relation between Paula and Paul develops on feelings of passion and attraction. For on the level of cognition they are very different. Paul is a wellpaid worker in the medical profession and looks forward to a brilliant career. Paula works as checkout lady in a supermarket does this mean something?. Some would call her a Paul Pry. But she possesses a fantasy a despairing joy and a cheerful nature that gradually undermine Pauls narrowminded objections against a new steady relationship. There is sorrow too for instance when Paulas little boy is killed in a road accident. Finally after much amorous powpow in the end the couple is united. But the union will not last. For Paula insists on having a child from Paul even though because of physical inaptness the birth will most likely kill her. She is passionate until the end. Her death is the rebirth of Paul who now under his own power adopts her sensual and joyous life style with three kids two from their former marriages plus the mutual one. The timeless freedom of their affair is supported by the music of the GDR rock band Die Puhdys and by psychedelic scenes of Paula and Paul in a bed of flowers floating on a river. The contrast with an earlier scene where they make love in a pound is immense. Of course this film is not unique. It follows the typical pattern of those days just like for instance the Dutch film Turks fruit also ending with the death of the female and the American Hair. But although I grew up in those years I am still unable to give a convincing interpretation. There is something about sexual liberation and illfated relations. Beyond that the behavior of the main characters is clearly unhealthy  just like Flower Power itself was unworldly and not viable. Perhaps the message is that there is always hope and you should smile even in times of humanitarian shortcomings. We are just pawns in life's game. Let us call it a kindhearted film with many qualities that deserves more than it gets  like often on IMDb.".

The relation between the young lovers Paula and Paul is passionate and bold. For Paul is still married albeit with a pawky and deceitful woman a pauper and a pouter in an affair that from the start never had a chance. And Paula is a mother of two children just separated because her husband could not remain faithful. Evidently marriage can be a vexation. The relation between Paula and Paul develops on feelings of passion and attraction. For on the level of cognition they are very different. Paul is a wellpaid worker in the medical profession and looks forward to a brilliant career. Paula works as checkout lady in a supermarket does this mean something?. Some would call her a Paul Pry. But she possesses a fantasy a despairing joy and a cheerful nature that gradually undermine Pauls narrowminded objections against a new steady relationship. There is sorrow too for instance when Paulas little boy is killed in a road accident. Finally after much amorous powpow in the end the couple is united. But the union will not last. For Paula insists on having a child from Paul even though because of physical inaptness the birth will most likely kill her. She is passionate until the end. Her death is the rebirth of Paul who now under his own power adopts her sensual and joyous life style with three kids two from their former marriages plus the mutual one. The timeless freedom of their affair is supported by the music of the GDR rock band Die Puhdys and by psychedelic scenes of Paula and Paul in a bed of flowers floating on a river. The contrast with an earlier scene where they make love in a pound is immense. Of course this film is not unique. It follows the typical pattern of those days just like for instance the Dutch film Turks fruit also ending with the death of the female and the American Hair. But although I grew up in those years I am still unable to give a convincing interpretation. There is something about sexual liberation and illfated relations. Beyond that the behavior of the main characters is clearly unhealthy  just like Flower Power itself was unworldly and not viable. Perhaps the message is that there is always hope and you should smile even in times of humanitarian shortcomings. We are just pawns in life's game. Let us call it a kindhearted film with many qualities that deserves more than it gets  like often on IMDb.";

	schema:reviewBody "Die Legende von Paul und Paula or The Legend of Paul and Paula is an East German Germanlanguage film from 1973 so this one is already over 40 years old. It runs for almost 100 minutes and is today considered one of the best GDR movies in retrospective. I agree partially with that. My personal opinion is sadly that the GDR was not a good country at all when it comes to their cinematic achievements so by general standards it is an okay movie but compared to other GDR films I believe that this one does indeed stand out from the very weak rest. It probably also helps that this is a color film. I cannot see this film by Heiner Carow and Ulrich Plenzdorf as relevant in depicting life in the GDR. It does not make an impact in terms of politics or society I think. It is however worth checking out because it is a solid romance movie that is pretty bleak and sometimes even devastating. The movie lives through the two title characters and the way they are portrayed and depicted especially Angelica Domrse's Paula. Yes there are moments of blatant overacting but this is basically the case in 90 of all 1970s films especially the German ones. There were some good parts some not so good but overall the positive outweighs the negative. I also liked the introduction of the two characters that we meet them long before they become a couple actually. As a whole I am not sure this film should be as popular as it is today but at least it's evidence that not every GDR movie is a failure. This is one of the rare successes. I recommend the watch thumbs up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's get one thing out of the way first. This IS largely a chickflick although many men who go to see it are likely to get caught up in at least one of the subplots. The litmus test is Love Actuallyif you enjoyed that movie and are a man I imagine you'll like this one as well. There are several attractive females some lesbian domestic affection scenes handled with remarkable matteroffactness and the film and novel handles the male characters gently and with love.But it is a movie that with primary appeal to two groupschicks and Jane Austen devotees including the male ones. Are there enough of these to make a movie a success? Yes there are.Jane Austen's work stays current because she wrote about timeless themeshow do you choose the best person to marry? Is love enough or even required for lifelong contentment? How do you deal with difficult or embarrassing family members? How best to handle a family crisis? How do you learn to tell true friends and quality persons from those who are perhaps flashy and amusing but will end up betraying your friendship and trust or heaven forfend tempting you to abandon your own principles? Whether you live in the age of Blackberries and Hybrid SUV's or the age of sealing wax and barouches every person comes smack up against many or most of these vexing problems throughout their lives.The conceit of this movie and the book it is based upon is that a shared love and appreciation of the works of Jane Austen can provide the currency through the exchange of which modern women and a few selected men can confront share and come to better understand their personal challenges and in the process form bonds of friendship or even romance. The strength of this movie is that even if you have a tough time with that conceit you will still enjoy the humor of it and the strong performances. It's pleasant to watch like curling up with a favorite book and a frothy cup of chocolate. It is true to Janeno explosions the villains aren't completely evil the primary problems of the characters stem from incomplete or willfullyfaulty understanding of themselves and those around them there is no melodrama or Gothic touches except of the parody sort and the lone death happens off screen.I have this weird little theory about why PP is the MOST beloved of all of Austen's books. Sure Darcy is a smoldering hunk of tightlycontrolled passion and Lizzie is as spirited and intelligent a heroine as ever nanced through a foot of mud to get to the bedside of an ailing sister but that's not it.In all the other Austen pairings you had a sense that they were pairings which would truly happen in real life because deep down we know nothing has really changed from Austen's daywomen's beauty and youth and social standing is factored into a certain equation which determines how handsome wealthy charming accomplished or respected a man she is able to aspire to. In no case other than PP does this basic equation get violated. Lady Catherine De Bourg had it right. A shocking match indeed! The LizzieDarcy romance therefore is the lone Cinderella story and don't give me Edmund and Fanny as Edmund was a younger son most in need of a virtuous wife who wouldn't ever embarrass him and was never laid out as a man of wildly attractive appearance while virtuous Fanny's looks were improved enough to attract the flirtatious Henry Crawford.So we women all of us are madly in love with PP precisely because it is the ultimate fantasy of this amazing guy who will love us JUST FOR OUR QUICK WIT GOOD HEART and FINE EYES. There are no Mr. Darcy's just like there are no characters of the sort commonly played by John Cusack so get over it already. There is possibly a Mr. Rochester but remember he had a crazy wife locked in the attic a creepy housekeeper an insipid ward a bit of a sarcastic streak and was once played on screen by a pudgy Orson Wells. In other words a lot of baggage. And he still wasn't able to be brought up to scratch by Plain Jane Eyre until his fine big house had been burned down his eyes put out and his arm messed up. Now THAT is reality.It is true in real life that single dog breeders can and do meet nice men and fall in love and maybe even get married. It is also true that nice handsome heterosexual men join book clubs.But this movie serves up impossibly cute Hugh Dancy in the role of an implausibly unattached adorably geeky Grigg Harris who loves reading older women and can dance gracefully despite being too clumsy to artfully sip a cocktail. The statistical probability of such an attractive and unspoiled man one who admits he is willing to be directed like this joining your book club and then actually wanting to develop a romantic relationship with an unattached woman older than himself is approximately the same as seeing one of the Dragonriders of Pern barnstorming over an Iowa cornfield.In the RL JABC Grigg would be gay and Allegra would be straight and Bernadette would be queuing up for the Early Bird Special at Cracker Barrel. And your cheating exspouse Jimmy Smits ain't never coming back and if he did it would be after a series of weepy drunken whiny pathetic phone calls at 3am. There will be no letter. This movie is a little bit cruel to imply otherwise.But that's OK. The world would be a very unkind place without at least the notion of dragons and rocketships Darcys and Griggs. And that is why we loved it.with wife.".

Their diversity brings perspective and depth to the story.I loved Bernadette's Kathy Baker ballsy and ebullient pseudomatriarchal figure and I silently cheered for Jocelyn Maria Bello to break out of her disciplined and 'incontrol' habits but it was Emily Blunt's portrayal of Prudie that shone a light giving the sharpest and most emotional contrast of all. She who steadfastly distanced herself from the social class she grew up in and worked tirelessly to elevate herself to the manor born convinced herself with her stylish bob Chanelesquire attire and fanciful forays into french phrasology that she was beyond the mundane and ordinary. She convinced me she was both strong and fragile and my heart broke along with hers. What a lovely performance.This isn't highbrow film by any means. The audience's biggest challenge is listening for and extracting the many Austen quotes that get zipped and zinged throughout the film. We are ultimately drawn to watching the everchanging relationships like petri dishes being poked and provoked.This movie will be enjoyable even for those unfamiliar with Jane Austen's novels. A visually appealing emotionally satisfying safe and somewhat predictable film. Most likely to be pegged as a chick flick because it's heavy on relationships. Guys' loss.".

But one day Daniel drops the big bombshells that he is seeing another woman and that he wants a divorce. Sylvia is heartbroken so much so that her young beautiful lesbian daughter Allegra moves back home to keep an eye on her. Close friend Jocelyn Maria Bello is also hovering over Sylvia and decides to create a book club so that the jilted lady will be surrounded by friends conversation and hope. Joining the club is a sixtime divorce Kathy Baker an uptight young French teacher Prudie Emily Blunt and Allegra herself. But because they decide the club will be devoted to Jane Austen and her six books they need one more member to put someone in charge of each distinct book discussion. Therefore Jocelyn invites Grigg Hugh Dancy an attractive young man she met at a hotel bar to join them. In truth he has eyes for Jocelyn and although a science fiction fan would read almost anything to get to know her better. Thus the discussions start but the repartee is at times only a brief breather from the continuing problems of the club members. These troubles include death nearinfidelity skydiving crashes crazy mothers and more. Will the club work to the benefit of its members? This is a lovely film about the friends and relationships that make human existence bearable. As the bosom buddies the movie's fine cast members are all quite wonderful with Blunt especially still managing to make her flawed confused character endearing. The California setting is beautiful naturally and so are the costumes. Then too the script is lively and refined echoing Austen's great books. Indeed there is enough of Jane's novels worked into the film's content to satisfy the fans of her highly esteemed works. In short book yourself a showing of this film and invited your friends to join you at the viewing. Forgive me but you will club yourself if you don't!".

	schema:reviewBody "What to think of a film that has the most literary references than any since 'Love and Death'. The danger here is that those with little knowledge of Jane Austen will have no understanding of what is going on since the dialogue twists and turns on discussions of characters and themes in 200 year old novels.But unlike a Woody Allen punch line comedy full of incontext jokes you do not need a complete understanding of Austen to appreciate this literate work. The reason Jane Austen interests people two centuries later are the universality of her themes. Seeing these themes played out can work at many levels. Addicts will revel in the dialogue's appreciative in jokes. Those with some experience like me will pick up things here and there while enjoying the whirling dervish playing out in the verbal repartee. Neophytes will simply enjoy the characters living out these timeless motifs likely leaving desirous to learn more.Some have complained about the lack of directorial artifices to woo us here and there. What better way to emphasize the literacy of it all by letting good actors use wordplays to move us instead. If this is too subtle for you 'American Gangster' awaits.Others have complained about obvious symbolism in the characters. A woman trapped in her time Austen wailed subtly against her capture by focusing thematically on one potential way out through love and relationships. The film and the book it is based on strive to provide a meaningful glimpse into the core themes of this wonderful writer and how for the most part these strivings remain among us as lively as ever. If the characters are archetypes they are necessarily so and once understood become more powerful in their abstraction.But it is their likability that rues the day and throughout you feel for them as they traipse through their foibles. The fixer who cares more for the happiness of others than her own a defense mechanism against longed for passion. The mother who wades through the ultimate disappointment with courage that makes her stronger when her dreams of marital bliss return. The aggressive young lesbian courageously bouncing between adventures until disappointed into seeking another. The young teacher walking to the edge of a potentially luxurious mistake and passionately imploring her man to save her from herself through Austen. The older woman wanting to keep tasting because the effort though difficult is worth it. And in the middle the almost goofy literature driven emodreamboat who attracts them all in various ways though suffering from an almost paralyzing inhibition ultimately resolved Unfortunately most men won't get it or even take the time to appreciate it all. In my screening women outnumbered men 172. In the end this intelligent optimistic feminism may have too small an audience to save itself from obscurity but if it ends up a voice in the wilderness it is far better left said than not.".

Neophytes will simply enjoy the characters living out these timeless motifs likely leaving desirous to learn more.Some have complained about the lack of directorial artifices to woo us here and there. What better way to emphasize the literacy of it all by letting good actors use wordplays to move us instead. If this is too subtle for you 'American Gangster' awaits.Others have complained about obvious symbolism in the characters. A woman trapped in her time Austen wailed subtly against her capture by focusing thematically on one potential way out through love and relationships. The film and the book it is based on strive to provide a meaningful glimpse into the core themes of this wonderful writer and how for the most part these strivings remain among us as lively as ever. If the characters are archetypes they are necessarily so and once understood become more powerful in their abstraction.But it is their likability that rues the day and throughout you feel for them as they traipse through their foibles. The fixer who cares more for the happiness of others than her own a defense mechanism against longed for passion. The mother who wades through the ultimate disappointment with courage that makes her stronger when her dreams of marital bliss return. The aggressive young lesbian courageously bouncing between adventures until disappointed into seeking another. The young teacher walking to the edge of a potentially luxurious mistake and passionately imploring her man to save her from herself through Austen. The older woman wanting to keep tasting because the effort though difficult is worth it. And in the middle the almost goofy literature driven emodreamboat who attracts them all in various ways though suffering from an almost paralyzing inhibition ultimately resolved Unfortunately most men won't get it or even take the time to appreciate it all. In my screening women outnumbered men 172. In the end this intelligent optimistic feminism may have too small an audience to save itself from obscurity but if it ends up a voice in the wilderness it is far better left said than not.";

But this isn't what I got.I have to admit that I've never cracked a Jane Austen novel but had seen many a British import on PBS rendering Austen's works for the small screen. And I half expected a costume drama to unfold on the screen but got something that was a little more clich in one way but very unique in another.The film uses Austen's plots as set piece examples from which the characters learn apply to their personal lives and grow. I have to say that I saw some aspects of my own personal life ingrained in this film. One might call it art imitating life imitating art only to imitate life once more. As an audience member whose been through some unique experiences as of recent I found it heart felt. But I digress.The film is respectably shot. Warm lighting compliments respectable though average cinematography. But then again the film isn't about wowing the audience with stunning visuals. It's about presenting characters and how they relate to one of the great writers of all time and her works.The humor revolves around the unexpected as do the more tragic and hurtful points. But even here there's a sort of unpredictablepredictability that because of its exuberance can be accepted for what it is. The characters behave as expected but are surprised with the audience when the unexpected pops up. We can sympathize with them and their situations. It's what might be called the ultimate in character empathyAusten style.And isn't that one of Austen's great hallmarks? Her ability to create characters one can believe and sympathize with on all levels? Austen's books are used to create a tapestry of themes to navigate the highs and woes of life. The film's irreverent narrative remains intelligent adult somewhat prosaic and marginally didactic but highly enjoyable for the most part.A respectable chickflick.  Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Those familiar with Jane Austen's six novels will get more but not necessarily much more out of this movie but it's people who have experienced book clubs that will really get a kick out of it. To audience that is neither this is still an enjoyable I hate to use the term but cannot think of a better one chick flick.As the title suggests the story evolves around the book club meetings but this is really one of those familiar ensemble pieces. But first the book club six members are needed to cover all six of Austen's novels each taking primary responsibility for one to be discussed in six consecutive monthly meetings at various venues one of which ended up being a hospital ward!. There are 4 initial members who know each other while the remaining two are drafted through chances encounters.BERNADETTE the founder is a sophisticated woman who has married six time and has purportedly seen it all. Her two Austen enthusiast friends are JOCELYN a woman of independent spirit and a dog breeder by profession and SYLVIA who on the surface has a happy family but is in fact on the verge of a separation with a husband who is looking for a new relationship after 30 years of happy married life. ALLEGRA is Sylvia's daughter a lesbian. As these four set out to look for two more members Bernadette has an encounter with PRUDIE another Austen enthusiast with a husband who has just disappointed her by canceling out a business trip to Paris on which she can accompany him because he has to travel with the boss to watch a basketball game. Finally GRIGG the only male member and an Austen virgin encounters Jocelyn in a bar in a certain amount of mutual attraction. With Grigg being a computer geek and SciFi fan he agrees to read Austen's girlie books in the hope that Jocelyn will give Ursula K. LeGuin's The left hand of darkness a try.There is no point for me to go into details. The audience will have a pretty good idea of what they expect to see. The six members have their own predicaments and situations and they are all projected through the Austen stories and characters during the discussions. Within the six of them we see relationships and interactions from simply conflicting opinions about the novels to much more personal involvements. Outside these six book club members there is more than another half dozen characters playing out various situation life dramas with them. The movie is light easy flowing and very funny at times. In the end everything is nicely resolved because there is no problem in life and relationships that cannot be set right by a well written letter as any deserving Jane Austen fan can tell you. By the end of the movie you would have enjoyed it so much that you wouldn't mind that it has not gone any deeper.The actings are all competent and effective. Playing Jocelyn is Mario Bello who is comfortable with both mainstream World Trade Centre and notsomainstream A history of violence material. Playing the woman outwardly fully in control but has a lot of feeling bottled up is not a big challenge for her. Kathy Baker whose sensuous persona in Edward scissorhands I still remember has an easy time with Bernadette a facilitator role in both the book club and the movie. Emily Blunt who served notice with The Devil wears Prada is good as Prudie a troubled wife who feels being neglected and is at a crossroad. Hugh Dancy whom I remember most as Galahad in King Arthur 2004 is the brightest spot in the movie as Grigg not necessarily because he is the sole male member of the club but more to do with his sunshine persona. Amy Brenneman shines as Sylvia giving a little more to the role of the betrayed wife. Maggie Grace makes an effective contribution to the ensemble cast with her role of pretty young thing Allegra.As I said there are more than another half a dozen characters but the one that must be mentioned is Prudie's mother whose mere presence spells trouble. This is just a cameo role but when this is played by Lynn Redgrave you get more than your money's worth.".

But first the book club six members are needed to cover all six of Austen's novels each taking primary responsibility for one to be discussed in six consecutive monthly meetings at various venues one of which ended up being a hospital ward!. There are 4 initial members who know each other while the remaining two are drafted through chances encounters.BERNADETTE the founder is a sophisticated woman who has married six time and has purportedly seen it all. Her two Austen enthusiast friends are JOCELYN a woman of independent spirit and a dog breeder by profession and SYLVIA who on the surface has a happy family but is in fact on the verge of a separation with a husband who is looking for a new relationship after 30 years of happy married life. ALLEGRA is Sylvia's daughter a lesbian. As these four set out to look for two more members Bernadette has an encounter with PRUDIE another Austen enthusiast with a husband who has just disappointed her by canceling out a business trip to Paris on which she can accompany him because he has to travel with the boss to watch a basketball game. Finally GRIGG the only male member and an Austen virgin encounters Jocelyn in a bar in a certain amount of mutual attraction. With Grigg being a computer geek and SciFi fan he agrees to read Austen's girlie books in the hope that Jocelyn will give Ursula K. LeGuin's The left hand of darkness a try.There is no point for me to go into details. The audience will have a pretty good idea of what they expect to see. The six members have their own predicaments and situations and they are all projected through the Austen stories and characters during the discussions. Within the six of them we see relationships and interactions from simply conflicting opinions about the novels to much more personal involvements. Outside these six book club members there is more than another half dozen characters playing out various situation life dramas with them. The movie is light easy flowing and very funny at times. In the end everything is nicely resolved because there is no problem in life and relationships that cannot be set right by a well written letter as any deserving Jane Austen fan can tell you. By the end of the movie you would have enjoyed it so much that you wouldn't mind that it has not gone any deeper.The actings are all competent and effective. Playing Jocelyn is Mario Bello who is comfortable with both mainstream World Trade Centre and notsomainstream A history of violence material. Playing the woman outwardly fully in control but has a lot of feeling bottled up is not a big challenge for her. Kathy Baker whose sensuous persona in Edward scissorhands I still remember has an easy time with Bernadette a facilitator role in both the book club and the movie. Emily Blunt who served notice with The Devil wears Prada is good as Prudie a troubled wife who feels being neglected and is at a crossroad. Hugh Dancy whom I remember most as Galahad in King Arthur 2004 is the brightest spot in the movie as Grigg not necessarily because he is the sole male member of the club but more to do with his sunshine persona. Amy Brenneman shines as Sylvia giving a little more to the role of the betrayed wife. Maggie Grace makes an effective contribution to the ensemble cast with her role of pretty young thing Allegra.As I said there are more than another half a dozen characters but the one that must be mentioned is Prudie's mother whose mere presence spells trouble. This is just a cameo role but when this is played by Lynn Redgrave you get more than your money's worth.";

I just did not believe at any point that these were real people. I especially did not believe the final scene. He ended up with her? I don't think so was what I kept thinking. I didn't believe the final couplings and I did not care.I had the same problem with this movie that I had with the book on which it was based. Both book and movie felt like writerly exercises to me. I felt as if the writer Karen Joy Fowler got this neato schematic idea in her writing class Aha! A book club of bourgeois people who read Jane Austen and fall in love! and went about filling in the pieces of that puzzle without ever investing any of the characters with real human warmth.One characterization stands out though. Emily Blunt as a depressive woman with a bad mother a mediocre marriage and a temptation to do very bad things creates a moody air all by herself. It's as if she came in from the set of a daring indy movie. I hope she's given chances in the future to live up to the promise she shows here.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this film came out weeks after Dan in Real Life there are many ways in which they resemble each other and I'm glad I did see Club second so I can understand how Dan didn't quite achieve its goals and Club soars above many of its contemporary counterparts. Both of them are ensemble pictures the same kind Hollywood used to release by the dozen week after week. Club uses as its inspiration the stories written by Jane Austen one of literature's most interesting societal observers her own personal life becoming secondary to her analysis of what was the main components of her contemporary society.In this film Maria Bello and Emily Blunt manage to shine a bit brighter than the rest of a very inspired cast. Emily Blunt validating the point that her turn in last year's Prada was no fluke shows she can handle an apparently infinite number of emotions. Her lovely French teacher faces a very tough choice as her own marriage undergoes critical times. There are other personal issues causing friction in her personal life and this one is one the film doesn't explore as much as it could have her relationship with her mother. Still since the film is probably supposed to come in under two hours in order to meet the industry's time restrictions we only get so much and what we get is lovely and satisfying.Maria Bello also has her own comedy of errors to deal with she is unable to recognize the restrictions and masks others learn to live with in order to cope and the message soon becomes clear it's time to live and take chances. She is a lovely woman with classical features and very expressive eyes eyes that are able to communicate love frustration jealousy passion and sadness within seconds of each other. Her scenes are probably the most intense in the movie yet not necessarily the best. The best involve the entire cast as they discuss Jane Austen's lessons and texts and soon we understand how our society is not very different from that of Austen's. The costumes and settings have changed but the emotions are still somehow the same.Giving another joyous and remarkable performance is Kathy Baker who embraces her role as the mother figure with gusto and much conviction. She is a lively creation and one that is not as overbearing as it the heavy hand of another director and performer would have created. Baker somehow is a metaphorical captain that leads her crew to safer water and watches teaches and learns without really interfering. It's a masterful job by this seasoned actress and it recalls the work of Rosalind Russell and other classic performers who knew what to do with a very good part and a great script.There is much more to discuss in this film and let it suffice that Smitts also does some of his best work ever as does the rest of this fantastic cast. The Jane Austen Book Club is a charming light film that manages to find its center and embraces literature life and the many emotions that are common to people throughout time. It is a film that makes us think feel and laugh at our trivial and deep conflicts that serves as a blueprint and a source of inspiration to filmmakers who might want to try giving the written word a bigger role in the production of films. An outline is not enough a well developed script will provide the performers with material that will satisfy both their professional drives and the needs of desperate audiences around the world.The Book Club is a remarkable achievement an oasis in a Hollywood landscape that has forgotten how important creativity and talent must work together to produce quality work. Thank the Gods for these moments when the silver screen still manages to shine golden.".

For him it probably was the height of hilarity. I was impressed and charmed even though the joke itself was pretty mild. Much like this movie.The modern day Jane Austen book club members act out love lives and turmoil and triumphs very much in parallel with a Jane Austin book as I understand their plots to be I have seen them all in movies but never in print. This reminded me of Shakespeare in Love where the modern writers performed a brilliant art that went beyond mere parroting or mimicry. I suspect a Jane Austen readerfan would recognize much and see injokes and intelligent references that I missed. But I think it is saying something good about the movie to note that I learned something about Austin's books but also followed the plot was thoroughly entertained and interested throughout and felt a involved with what happened. Again I'm not part of the Austin cognoscenti but I at least felt in on the jokes and in on the plot as well. I was included by the movie.Some of the plot points veered toward the girlie for a moment but never completely went off down that road. That is with the chatty older lady Kathy Baker's character initially showing contempt for men and hints of a lesbian theme at first I was ready for a rant. Or at least a putdown of males like the last 10 minutes of Steel Magnolias. But everybody lightened up and basically respect and affection was shown to all ultimately. Although returning for a moment to the lesbian thing I did not for one minute actually buy that the daughter Allegra was gay not that there would be anything wrong with that note the Seinfeld reference. But as a comment on the movie on the narrative and the portrayals it just didn't FEEL real or true. Not even movie true. But the actors were competent and otherwise convincing all around so I found myself able to dismiss that dissonant note with relative ease.If you are a guy don't be afraid of this movie. It's pleasant and about realenough things that concern us too. After all for most of us relationships involve men and women so here's something that is a bit about both but the perspective is nonetheless clearly from the distaff side which intrigued me. I enjoyed it! BTW I went to a special art series showing at the cinema where I am visiting. I went alone. Throughout the movie however I could hear many female voices laughing and seemingly chuckling with agreement when certain truths and characters' foibles were brought to light and never in a mean way. So maybe it rings true for the ladies as well.".

Allegra is a hedonistic selfcentered woman who has trouble maintaining long term relationships. Bernadette is a supercilious knowitall. And Prudie the most problematic member of the club is so neurotic and so clueless that you wince every time she opens her mouth. If you're going to put a neurotic main character in a movie he or she needs to at least be charming enough to offset the mental issues. In an ensemble cast it simply doesn't work to have so many unlikable characters. Another big problem I had with the movie is that the ending is right out of fantasy land. No way this is gonna happen in the real world. Still most Jane Austen fans will probably like the film and I would recommend it to them because of the many references to her novels.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you think Austen is all about mere story there's still something to talk about. In the end things work out despite the structural imperfections of the world which work against happy endings. If that's your take if it is all about story for you this is a perfect movie. Because it works. And it works in spite of some horrible missteps some absolutely bad decisions that should cripple it. There are a surplus here enough to have killed a similar movie. And yet it works. Yes everyone finds romance at the end but what I mean is also that we fall in love with the movie.Why? Three reasons.The actresses really are centered the key ones. The characters aren't Austenian in manner but they are as abstract and dramatic as hers are. Because these actresses don't have to play real nuanced people they get to pour all their skills into the three or so characteristics each is supposed to have. The funny thing is that the chords they strike as a group seem to be acceptable. Its not a play about life but a play about a fictional world of romance that itself relates to life or so we accept. So the actresses work. Emily Blunt is a power and I am committed to follow her. She makes good choices.There are some truly endearing sequences. Its fewer than half and they are interwoven with some real mistakes. But they are powerful enough to allow us to skim over the badness in the movie. I believe that in part this is because the nature of the story and the being of the characters is to do that. So the two tractors of continuance in the face of incompetence make the incompetence irrelevant. And then there's the big idea what I call the fold. We have the movie. We have the books. We have the people in the movie reading the books and comparing themselves to what they read. We have us reading the movie and doing likewise but slightly differently. We have us reading what the writer of the script did in terms of overlapping the four of these and us wondering whether we will follow 21st or 19th century conventions and being pleased to progressively find the latter. Its a simple fold but interesting because it is so overt. Its even underscored by the appearance of that usual folding device a school play about love where the actor gets to relate to his love offstage and tell her he loves her.You may be wondering about the sequences that are missteps. Austen depicts a world that is profoundly broken but instead of pounding us with it she presents the breaks through humor humorous characters mostly who present attitudes that collectively circumnavigate the world. Austen called this irony though the definition has changed twice since then. This writerdirector tries this in a way by introducing situations we might know from old TeeVee sitcoms. There's the computer geek's house that is set up with scary gismos. There's the same geek comparing Austen to Star Wars. And yet this same geek is the fulcrum of many of the most powerful presentations of tentative commitment.There's a moment when Blunt's character is making a tough choice and literally sees a blinking sign wondering what would Jane do? This is bad in so many ways. There are a dozen such spots where you wonder what they were thinking.This reminds me of some successful people I know. They are deeply inadequate in fundamental ways but they know how to use their strengths to comb over the thin spots.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

Now I have never read a Jane Austen book or seen an adaptation so I really had no idea what to expect. Let me say this if you have not read a Jane Austen novel I advise against seeing this movie. Not only could I not relate to anything they were saying when talking about her novels I could not relate to many of the characters. It's not like I was clueless as to what they saying during their meetings it was just hard for me to relate anything to the five women and one man in the club I suppose that's why it was necessary to spell all Austen's themes out during the conversation for the ones who haven't read any of her books.All that aside I found many of the situations predictable and 'been there done that' but I did find the plot more intelligent than your average chick flick. There was the occasional funny scene which I thought helped the movie and a couple of characters were interesting thanks to the actors and their wonderful and charming performances. Emily Blunt Kevin Zegers Maggie Grace and Hugh Dancy were the best of the lot but the rest of the cast Maria Bello Kathy Baker and Amy Brenneman were exceptional as well.I suppose the positives and negatives balance each other out to make this just an average film that tries to be more than a chick flick but doesn't quite do it. What we do have is a charming enough flick that is based around Austen's books which will surely attract many fans.510".

And to me they might as well have called this movie the Soap Opera Fan Club or the Jackie Collins Fan Club. The books were written in the early 1800's people not 2008. In none of Jane's books were there even hints of men cheating and leaving their wives lesbians or women who lust after men like dogs in heat. I'm sorry but I must say that I feel it's misleading to portray to those who are clueless of Jane Austen that she was just like today's Desperate Housewives type of modern woman. She was witty and funny often ahead of her time true but this movie makes her books sound like they are what they really aren't. If the movie had been titled by another book club name I could've swallowed it. However my tolerance for such Hollywood exploitation most who have probably never even read classic literature the actors who were forced to read the book ahead of time by the director DOESN'T count is absolutely zero.".

For the life of me I don't understand how a filmmaker can create a movie around the marvelous writings of Jane Austen and literally suck all of the soul and spirit from every single character! It's as if director Robin Swicord assumes that just by mentioning the classic novels everyone will swoon at her movie and her characters. Wrong!! First of all how about tossing in a likable character? The closest we have here is pretty boy Hugh Dancy no not Darcy who is not only a very nice and sensitive guy guess what he has older sisters! but in a tip of the cap to the ultimate dream guy ... he also has lots of money! OK he has a few flaws ... he doesn't vacuum his car.Somehow every female character in this film is miserable in their life and more importantly miserable to watch on screen. Could someone PLEASE tell Kathy Baker to shut up? And Amy Brenneman ... supposedly devastated when her hubby dumps her ... her reaction is to stop wearing makeup. Now THAT is heartfelt pain. I am not going to say much about Maggie Grace in her role as a selfish little lesbian princess who has no clue what caring or giving is but is quick to rip everyone else's thoughts. Maria Bello's character gets a really raw deal. The film starts out with all her friends making fun of her miserably lonely life because she has a funeral for her prize dog. A lousy start to a lousy film. Worst of all is how the great Emily Blunt is treated. Why would this beautiful and intelligent woman who is going through a rough time in her marriage even consider messing around with a student? Plain ridiculous.As if all that weren't enough I really felt embarrassed for Vanessa Redgrave who is forced to act like a clown and then written out in a cheap TV movie plot twist. Then just when you think it can't get any worse the last 10 minutes are hokey gutless and just pathetic. If you want a quality chick flick see In Her Shoes or The Devil Wears Prada ... or better yet pick up and read any of Jane Austen's marvelous novels.".

In either case the movie follows the evolution of a young man named Daniel who arrives in Berlin in a rather unspoiled state and gradually trades in both his shyness and his sincerity to better feed his escalating appetite for excitement in the bigcity gay scene. As we follow Daniel's escapades he is transformed into a jaded hedonist caught in his addiction to ever more exotic read campy clothing and ever more depersonalized sexual experiences.Scenes from Daniel's life and the various milieus he frequents are accompanied by voiceovers that are sometimes narrations and that sometimes represent dialogue. There is no synch sound and the movie never even tries to pretend that the sound was recorded together with the picture. Thus this film is determinedly lowfi and has a crude and vibrant aesthetic that is well attuned to the subject matter it covers.For most of the movie the voiceovers are highly astringent  steeped in cynicism bitterness and melancholy. Seen from today's perspective after the tremendous cultural evolution that has occurred since 1971 with respect to gays and their acceptance in society this film often looks and sounds very dated indeed but not so dated as many viewers might prefer to think. Many of the topics covered here with scathing honesty  the idolization of youth and marginalization of older gays the materialism of gays the competitiveness of gays and the hypersexualization of gay culture with its tendency to cause isolation and loneliness  these basic themes are still quite operative in today's supposedly modern gay world where the mainstream acceptance so ardently craved by some gays seems all but assured.See this movie and get a wholly authentic taste of the witty insightful and unhappy man who made it. This is a brilliant document often highly entertaining when viewed in the proper spirit and a valuable window not just on the dawn of the gay rights era but on the underside of today's supposedly brave new gay world.".

It is an early career effort by Rosa von Praunheim who was not even 30 at that point and he is still known today for being one of the most influential homosexual filmmakers even if pretty much all of his works went under the radar during his long career. And the title here already tells you the subject of this mix of fiction and documentary movie. There are so so many gaythemed short films coming out these days 8and in the last 1520 years that still act as if homosexuality was a huge problem but this is incorrect as the majority of people have grown really tolerant by now. But back in the early 1970s it was completely different. Homosexuality was a complete taboo so RvP actually a Latvianborn filmmaker had an outstanding opportunity to really make a difference on an important subject and show audiences the path of understanding and tolerance for the future. He did no such thing. The only intention I see here is probably to shock as many people as possible. There is not a single stereotype about gays that is not included here. This refers to leather police outfits to crossdressing to causal sex at public toilets ewwwwwww.. and more. The narration is not good but the acting especially the voice acting are way worse admittedly and make this almost an unbearable watch because the actors are almost all so so bad. Yeah well I see von Praunheim here trying to be as controversial as possible and this is probably a reason besides the title why this film here is still relatively wellknown today especially in the LBGT community. The best thing about it for me is certainly how short it was only slightly longer than an hour. I don't recommend the watch. Not at all.".

I don't think they considered that the concept and acting alone would not make a entertaining 90 minutes. This movie is about a inmate on death row Roy Dupuis who also starred in The Rocket Maurice Richardwho is awaiting his execution by needle ejection and throughout the movie we see some of the different versions of what could have happened starting with his last meal. With every meal we see a whole different Kevin Barlow and a whole different set of events. There are no twists in this movie and no action whatsoever. It is pure drama with mostly unknown actors that tries to grab your attention with the concept of you are what you eat. There is enough drama in life without watching this movie but if you want to see it for the concept alone and great acting performances by the leads Roy Dupuis and Serge Houde then this is the movie for you!".

	schema:headline " Pollack Does Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "Three Days of the Condor is a classic spy thriller with a bit of a twist it takes place inside the U.S.A. There are no flashy locales no superhero types and no ultramenacing bad guys who spew cheesy dialogue instead we have a common man Robert Redford battling for his life in an uncommon situation.  This is similar to Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest in its theme and intensity and Sydney Pollack pulls it off to perfection.Robert Redford stars as Joseph Turner a reader for the CIA who finds himself on the run after everyone in his office is assassinated.  Pollack wisely allows us to share in Turner's horror and confusion upon finding his dead coworkers.  We witness his scramble for protection and his shaky call to the CIA Headquarters as he demands to be brought in. The wheels start turning and it seems that all will be resolved safely and quickly but things don't go as planned.  After a shoot out in an alley Turner is seen as a possible rogue agent sending him into greater peril.  Now everyone is out to get him.  Only through quick imaginative thinking and survival instincts can Turner stay ahead of those who are out to kill him. In a moment of desperate improvisation Turner kidnaps Faye Dunaway to elude his pursuers.  This turn allows us to have someone else view Redford's character for us and provide a different intensity a sexual intensity to the film. Again this is somewhat reminiscent of Cary Grant meeting Eva Marie Saint on the train in North by Northwest.  But this story has more of an edge to it and Dunaway's character has greater depth and purpose than we imagine possible.  She acquiesces to her captor's demands as she tries to understand him and learns quickly to appreciate him and the situation he's in.  Through Dunaway's help Redford is allowed to meet up with the man Cliff Robertson who he believes is pulling the strings inside the CIA.  The story turns more cerebral as we learn why Turner's office was hit and who was behind it.  Furthermore we understand how truly alone Redford's character really is.  The audience is kept guessing through to the very end as to whether or not Redford's character will survive.This is one movie that provides action and excitement coupled with a strong plot and solid characters.  Max Von Sydow is excellent as a Joubert a sophisticated calculating evenkeeled assassin who is only doing what he is paid to do.  Redford shines as a man whose entire world is thrown into violent disarray forcing him to fight for his survival.  His ability to project his thoughts and concerns through his actions and facial expressions holds the audience to him.  While this movie does not have the overwhelming paranoid feel to it that a movie like The Parallax View had it is stylish convincing and an intriguing movie.  Sydney Pollack doesn't fill the scenes with deep shadows and hard camera angles as some would do.  Instead most of this story takes place in broad daylight which actually increases the tension.  There's no easy place to hide no dark doorways to duck into no characters stepping out of the fog when we least expect it.  Like Hitchcock Pollack knows that exposing his hero to the light of day is to abandon him to his pursuers. The audience is pulled in right along with the Redford's character and we can't let go until we know we're safe.".

	schema:headline " One of Redford's Best a 70s Suspense Classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "A cold rainy day in New York City...a small cramped office building where a friendly diverse group of CIA administrative types do research...one employee a young 'reader' Robert Redford is assigned to pick up sandwiches and takes a short cut through back alleys to a local deli...a van pulls up in front of the building a group of disguised armed assassins disembark enter...and brutally kill every person in the building leaving just before the 'reader' returns to face the carnage...With this visually gripping sequence the stage is set for one of the best suspense films of the 1970s Sydney Pollack's classic THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR. In a novel twist of the Hitchcock 'Man Who Knew Too Much' theme Redford's 'Joseph Turner' code name 'Condor' whose employment consists of reading novels and publications for any reference to the CIA develops an 'imaginary' scenario of an agency 'inside' the agency working independently which his boss forwards to Washington for review. Unfortunately the scenario is true and Turner and his coworkers must be eliminated to keep the secret intact. By sheer luck Turner survives the 'hit' and the bookish 'admin type' must now run for his life utilizing survival skills he didn't know he possessed while trying to discover the reason for his 'death sentence'...The tension never lets up in this grim exciting tale as Turner discovers he can trust no one and barely survives assassination attempts again and again. Forced to kidnap a young woman Faye Dunaway more vulnerable than usual to aid him it takes a death attempt to convince her to believe him but Turner refuses to allow her to continue to risk her life protecting him so ultimately it becomes a 'David and Goliath' struggle between Turner and the 'outlaw' CIA and it's hired assassins. Featuring Max von Sydow as a sophisticated 'hit man' John Houseman as a mysterious CIA senior official and Cliff Robertson as an agent with an agenda THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR influenced a generation of similarthemed thrillers including Mel Gibson's CONSPIRACY THEORY and Will Smith's ENEMY OF THE STATE.The Robert Redford film is the best of the crop by far!".

	onyx:emotionText "A cold rainy day in New York City...a small cramped office building where a friendly diverse group of CIA administrative types do research...one employee a young 'reader' Robert Redford is assigned to pick up sandwiches and takes a short cut through back alleys to a local deli...a van pulls up in front of the building a group of disguised armed assassins disembark enter...and brutally kill every person in the building leaving just before the 'reader' returns to face the carnage...With this visually gripping sequence the stage is set for one of the best suspense films of the 1970s Sydney Pollack's classic THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR. In a novel twist of the Hitchcock 'Man Who Knew Too Much' theme Redford's 'Joseph Turner' code name 'Condor' whose employment consists of reading novels and publications for any reference to the CIA develops an 'imaginary' scenario of an agency 'inside' the agency working independently which his boss forwards to Washington for review. Unfortunately the scenario is true and Turner and his coworkers must be eliminated to keep the secret intact. By sheer luck Turner survives the 'hit' and the bookish 'admin type' must now run for his life utilizing survival skills he didn't know he possessed while trying to discover the reason for his 'death sentence'...The tension never lets up in this grim exciting tale as Turner discovers he can trust no one and barely survives assassination attempts again and again. Forced to kidnap a young woman Faye Dunaway more vulnerable than usual to aid him it takes a death attempt to convince her to believe him but Turner refuses to allow her to continue to risk her life protecting him so ultimately it becomes a 'David and Goliath' struggle between Turner and the 'outlaw' CIA and it's hired assassins. Featuring Max von Sydow as a sophisticated 'hit man' John Houseman as a mysterious CIA senior official and Cliff Robertson as an agent with an agenda THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR influenced a generation of similarthemed thrillers including Mel Gibson's CONSPIRACY THEORY and Will Smith's ENEMY OF THE STATE.The Robert Redford film is the best of the crop by far!";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film back in 1976. The next time was in 2002. Both viewings had me captivated from start to finish even though second time around there were parts which I remembered from the first time. Robert Redford Condor works for the CIA as a readerresearcher. His job along with others is look for new ideas or plots published in books or journals around the world in all languages. He turns up a well authored scheme in a journal printed in a variety of strange languages and reports to his superiors. Unfortunately someone doesn't agree with his report and his colleagues turn up dead when he returns from lunch one day. Whoever is behind these killings hasn't finished yet as Condor was on the hitlist. The hide and seek game begins with Condor trying to stay one step ahead of his assassins. He resorts to kidnapping a beautiful woman Faye Dunaway who possibly through the Stockholm Syndrome eventually becomes his ally. The film has an unpredictable ending for all involved. There are many stories about the cloak and dagger world of the intelligence communities but few have a storyline which is believable. This is one of those few and it is as relevant today as it was back in '75. If you like films which depict the sinister and dark side of the CIA and provide plenty of suspense with the obligatory victimized female this is the film for you. I guess the modern day version of this film is Borne Identity. What Robert Redford pulled off over 30 years ago Matt Damon is doing today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Pollack is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock which he also proved with The Interpreter. Apparently he loves suspenseful thrillers and I sure hope for him that his movies will age as well as those that Hitchcock made. And I guess they do. Even though it was made thirty years ago Three Days of the Condor still hasn't lost any of its power. Sure you could call it a typical product of the seventies but even today this movie feels uptodate and believable.Turner works for the American Literary Historical Society or at least so it seems. In reality he is a CIA researcher with the code name Condor who gets paid to read books in which he has to find possible scenarios that could be used in intelligence work. When he returns to his office after he went out to get lunch he finds all his colleagues dead and he doesn't know who shot them. He immediately calls a superior who sends his section chief to get him out of there. But when the man arrives he immediately opens fire on Turner. In an act of pure desperation  he no longer knows who he can trust  Turner kidnaps a woman he has never seen before and forces her to hide him. He will stay in her house until he can find out what exactly is going on. But even there he isn't save. He is discovered and attacked in the woman's house but is able to kill the man. Now he knows one thing for sure the man too had a connection to the CIA which means that someone in the CIA must be behind all this...I guess the best thing about this movie is the fact that it doesn't give away all its information at once. At first Turner appears to be an ordinary guy who arrives late for work. Nothing special there. But because he gradually builds up tension by slightly releasing more information the writer knows how to keep you focused and interested. I guess the best way to describe this movie is calling it a classic spy thriller without James Bondlike locations or bad guys and and no super hero who can beat all the bad guys with a blink of an eye. No this is a normal man who was at the wrong place at the wrong time and who now has to face an unusual and life threatening situation. I guess that's where this movie gets its strength you can easily identify with him even though he is a spy.And yes the whole concept of the movie is very seventies the paranoia towards the government the insecurity of not knowing who your enemies or your friends are... all give it that typical feeling. but even today this movie hasn't lost any of its power or relevance. All in all this is a very good and stylish thriller that offers plenty of tension and some very nice acting. Especially Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway were very nice to watch but the other actors did a fine job too. Thanks to the combination of the acting a good story and some nice camerawork Pollack has created a movie Hitchcock might have been proud of if he had done it. That's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

Three Days of the Condor wasn't a major blockbuster in 1975 and didn't win any Academy Awards the next spring But if it were remade today it would hold up as good as any film about government secret covert policies and behind the scenes action as any movie about the same subject would now. The movie Three Days of the Condor eerily as well as accurately predicts the very situation that the US has got itself into nowin 2003in the oilrich Middle and Near East some twenty eight years ago back in in 1975! Robert Redford Joe Turner works for the CIA and is doing his job like he's done it for years. He reads and interprets books without the slightest suspicion of how he as well as his coworkers is looked upon when it comes to the real scheme of things to what his bosses think about what's going on in the world.Turner takes his employment in the CIA which is one that he obviously needed to get a very high government clearance like most working people woulda 9 to 5 job with a months vacation and a good government pension waiting for him when he retires. One day when it unknowing at the time to Turner luckily comes his turn get lunch for his coworkers that he finds out that working for an outfit like the CIA is a lot more dangerous then him getting mugged or having his motor bike stolen on his way to work. From then on until the end of the movie and even beyond Turner is a marked man not marked by the enemies of the US but by his CIA bosses themselves.Three Days of the Condor is a true Man without a Country movie when Turner as well as those that he worked with who were loyal to their country and the agency that employed them were deemed expendable because of a slight case of paranoia from a top administrator in the agency. The CIA outfit that Turner was in were checking out a book that seemed to be some kind of secret blueprint written in a number of unlikely and foreign languages about a Westerntype country plotting to and taking over an or a number of oilrich MiddleEast nations! This is exactly what's happening in Iraq today! I doubt that A movie like Three Days of the Condor would be made today given the climate of the September 11 2001 attacks and the War on Terrorism in both Afghanistan  Iraq that quickly followed. But back in 1975 when we here in the USA were living in a more peaceful and secure time and with the Frank Church Commission investigating in public the accesses of the US intelligence agencies it could.I especially liked the cast of Cliff Robertson Higgens Max Von Saydo Jobert and Faye Dunaway Kathy besides of course Robert Redford's Joe Turner. I liked the contrast between Higgens and Jobert in the fact that Higgens was a career man working for the government and Jobert was a contract killer only working for whoever paid him. Even though Jobert should have been the heavy in the film he was by far more sympathetic because what he did was only a job and that all it was to him and his encounter with Turner towards the end of the movie who's job it was for him to kill wasn't that threatening and not at all as personal as Turners scenes with Higgens were. Higgens always came across as a conman who would shoot you or have someone shoot you in the back as soon as you turned around. This contrast goes to show you that a person who hires a killer to kill someone is far more guilty then the one that does the killing himself. Charles Manson didn't kill anyone he had others do the killing for him but he's more responsible for those murders back in 1969 then the ones that did the killings themselves.Faye Dunaway as Kathy was great as the innocent bystander who's life was turned upside down by all these events that she had no knowledge or control of. She showed fear and outrage at first and then later realizing that Turner was telling the truth and that she like him had no choice in the matter because she knew too much but to risk her life what else could she do. Kathy ended up helping him because helping Turner or not she was also targeted like he was so she might as well do what was right.I'm surprised that I didn't read or hear anyone talk about not all these years after Three Days of the Condor was released the fact that a good part of the movie as shot in and around the illfaded World Trade Center in NYC. In fact I think that Three Days of the Condor was the first major motion picture that was filmed there. The WTC was opened to the public in 1974 and the movie was made in late 1974 and early 1975. Even more ironic about the film is that Higgens who was undoubtedly the villain in it had his CIA offices located in of all places you guessed it the World Trade Center.".

Over ten years ago.I came across it on one of the movie channels. It opens so quietly. Just everyday life going on. A guy late for work. Coming in by bike and in the rain no less. His workplace is comprised of superiors he wont conform to please and those he works alongside that apprciate that quality in him. He has the air of a man that knows who he is. Gently he sets the tone for his corner of the world and those around him are much the better for it.He goes out for lunch and returns to find everyone in his office cut down like they were nothing. Even though we saw it happening. We still feel his horror at returning to find his sanctuary torn asunder.When he finds his feet again he calls in and in a panic tells his superiors. Everyone's dead! When they try to run him through the usual protocols he reponds. I'm not a field agent I just read books! He doesn't go charging off for revenge like so many action heroes. This guy just wants out. He's seen his world demolished and he just wants to survive the day. He's panicked and alone. But when his saviours turn out to be if not in league with the devil at least working the same side of the street. He has to fend for himself. Having run out of options and with nowhere to turn this CIA reader realizes if there's any saving to be done he'll have to do it himself. And as John Houseman's Big Guy at the CIA asks Cliff Robertson's Director Higgins how is he doing this Higgins replies He reads. He reads... everything Houseman nods knowingly. The message here? Knowledge is power. And while these men have their offices and expense accounts Joseph Turner is a man who knows things. He borrows some equipment from the back of a Telephone repairman's truck and taps a telephone line in a NY city Hotel. Another character we might think this an unlikely skill to just happen to come in handy but it's been established. The guy is brilliant and has a job reading and analyzing books all day every day five days a week. He isn't everyman. He's just the hero any one of us COULD be. He is believable which makes all that he achieves all the more impressive.The moments of tension between Turner and Joubert the Assassin are beautifully done. From the initial scene where the hit on his office goes down we know that this hitman knows he is standing next to the only one of his targets that is still running free. Joseph it seemshas a sense of it. As you watch the scene play out as they move between floors. You feel trapped there with them. Joubert is like a force of nature. He harbours no personal motives and so it's difficult to harbour any against him.As to whether Joseph knows it was he that personally killed the people at his office. Its unsure. But I feel like at the final interaction between them one thing is clear. Turner is at least at that moment unable to switch gears from the natural gratitude he must feel at being saved by this man and however coincidentally aided by his actions. He feels safe enough to talk comfortable with him.I could write pages more but time escapes me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three Days of the Condor 1975This is looking more and more like a period piece dated and curious like one of those great Cold War films looks today Failsafe or Seven Days in May. And yet it also feels like the beginnings of spycounterspy films that are going on today way beyond the pizazz of the early Bond films of the 1960s and presaging the dozens since including recent ones like the Bourne films or Syriana. It plays straight up as a suspense film one where an almost innocent man is caught up in something huge and perplexing and awful and we all identify with the individual against the powers of evil. Robert Redford plays the role of Joe Turner well with the usual Redford stiffness but believablyhe reads books after alland sympathetically. Putting yourself back to 1975 you have to remember that everyone was talking about and reacting to Watergate and a U.S. president who had to resign from office because of it. Watergate more than anything started the current public roar blossoming on the internet about government conspiracy. Three Days of the Condor makes the government and the CIA in particular an almost unassailable and invisible force of spying and mistrust. Turner by circumstance at first and then by admirable determination fights back. He's clever as much as he is worried. He falls in love. He feels isolated but never gives up. He has close calls and lucky escapes and unlikely friends. He thinks of other people first. In other words he's a hero against the machine and if the movie is sometimes slow it creates a nice pace for the end which is beautifully thought out. Director Sydney Pollack is hampered by a screenplay that alternates between awkward Faye Dunaway's scenes and brilliant Redford's antispy character has a conversation with a hit man played by Max Von Sydow that shines but he patches it together with an editing job that was nominated for an Oscar. And the cinematography by Owen Roizman is really nice he shot a dozen great films from the French Connection to the Exorcist to Network.

Where's the excitement in seeing an ordinary guy fighting against the odds facing powerful and dangerous people behind him without being a James Bond or a Jason Bourne type? Where did the intelligent and high standard plots go? And who said that a suspense film must have a haunting score or fast action scenes? Sydney Pollack made a wonderful thriller with delightful dramatic scenes and an interesting plot that new directors of our recent times would be ashamed of what they're doing with plenty of money but no good script in hands.And you gotta love when Robert Redford plays someone related to spies and intelligence services after all he gave us notable and memorable performances not only in this but also in Sneakers and Spy Game outstanding spy thrillers. Here he plays a bookish CIA researcher named Joseph Turner codename 'The Condor' involved in a mysterious and dangerous incident after the murder of all his colleagues. The strange fact is that they only deliver messages to the headquarters under secret memos nothing harmful but for some reason the only member of this team who survived is followed by a sinister man the great Max von Sydow and also by some of his bosses at CIA one of them played by Cliff Robertson. Trying to figure out what happened and who is trying to kill him Turner takes a hostage Faye Dunaway that might help him out and also might be a next victim of these people.Intelligent without being complicated or fuzzy breathtaking without making the audience feel dizzy with some innovating shaky camera Three Days of Condor might look dated or not much demanding in terms of surprise but it certainly it's a serious and thrilling experience with lots of action and effective and well balanced dramatic moments between Dunaway and Redford and it has many things that lack in today's movies it makes us feel good and it makes us really scared for the sake of these characters we can relate to them and to their dangerous moments fighting the bad guys. The performances are brilliant most notably the villain played by Max von Sydow working with an efficiency in such a sinister and dark character that gets our attention from the first moment he's on the screen to the very last and surprising! scene. My favorite part with him was when he explained why he does what he does explaining in very reasonable terms for his line of work as sort of a high class mercenary. Sydney Pollack makes of Three Days of Condor a rare great thriller that still can make our hearts beat fast with enormous qualities in terms of acting screenplay direction cinematography editing and music and he only would made a similar interesting work in the also thrilling The Firm. No wonder that David Rayfiel wrote both films and they were both amazing. We need more of those now! 1010".

I have seen it multiple times and will continue to watch it.Having said that I have to admit I laugh when I see people writing about how intelligent this movie is. Intelligent? Yeah right.Let's see. A man goes out to lunch and comes back to discover after walking into an open front door that previously shuts and locks automatically that all his coworkers have been murdered. Shortly afterward he is shot at by a professional killer who conveniently misses! OK. Now on the run our hero Robert Redford kidnaps a woman at random in broad daylight and forces her at gunpoint back to her apartment. Nobody sees any of this. About two hours later the woman is making love to the man and is instantly in love with him!!It gets better. The man  a professional reader a bookworm instantly turns into James Bond and the woman is instantly transformed from a lonely shrinking violet into an international spy boldly breaking into the CIA and talking tough to an agent. Wow yes that sure sounds plausible to me! Together they fight a renegade CIA wing until he convinces her to leave town and then he finishes up surviving the whole affair. All that from a mousy guy who just reads books for a living. Wow.Well I''ll repeat one thing for the readers here who forgot my opening paragraph and think I am panning the film. I am not. I like the movie. it's entertaining. It's fun to watch and that's the name of the game........but if you think this is intelligent storytelling well I have this swampland in New Jersey I'd like to sell you that......".

I have seen it multiple times and will continue to watch it.Having said that I have to admit I laugh when I see people writing about how intelligent this movie is. Intelligent? Yeah right.Let's see. A man goes out to lunch and comes back to discover after walking into an open front door that previously shuts and locks automatically that all his coworkers have been murdered. Shortly afterward he is shot at by a professional killer who conveniently misses! OK. Now on the run our hero Robert Redford kidnaps a woman at random in broad daylight and forces her at gunpoint back to her apartment. Nobody sees any of this. About two hours later the woman is making love to the man and is instantly in love with him!!It gets better. The man  a professional reader a bookworm instantly turns into James Bond and the woman is instantly transformed from a lonely shrinking violet into an international spy boldly breaking into the CIA and talking tough to an agent. Wow yes that sure sounds plausible to me! Together they fight a renegade CIA wing until he convinces her to leave town and then he finishes up surviving the whole affair. All that from a mousy guy who just reads books for a living. Wow.Well I''ll repeat one thing for the readers here who forgot my opening paragraph and think I am panning the film. I am not. I like the movie. it's entertaining. It's fun to watch and that's the name of the game........but if you think this is intelligent storytelling well I have this swampland in New Jersey I'd like to sell you that......";

No vulgarity in the love scene just a great sensuality. Both stars have shown an outstanding performance ! Topnotch screenplay  70's films are definitely the best ones in terms of storytelling and screenplays. Sidney Pollack does also a great job as a director and delivers an efficient thriller that you can watch over and over again.I agree with some reviewers who think that it is one of the Redford's best. The supporting cast is also excellent. Maybe the directors nowadays should watch more often 70's films to be more inspired.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is possibly the only first rate spy thriller whose most classic set of dialog lines spoken by Max Von Sydow became the basis of a very funny moment in a Seinfeld Episode.Originally published as SIX DAYS OF THE CONDOR the film title took a reduction of days to three. Robert Redford is working in what we would call a CIA think tank in Manhattan in an old brownstone. He reads there and makes reports of what he reads. It is a pleasant enough job. One day he goes to work not realizing that he and his fellow workers are all being watched and counted as they enter the building. They start working but Redford goes out a back door to get some coffee. Soon the men outside come in and shoot down all the people in the building. They note that Redford is not there and that the back door is not locked so they realize he stepped out. But time is of the essence as the NYC police may be on the scene soon. So they leave before Redford returns. The film then follows what happens to Redford. He is horrified at the murder of all his colleagues and tries to get some guidance from his contact Cliff Robertson but soon he is beginning to wonder if Robertson is really being so very helpful. He seems hesitant to assist Redford in figuring who committed this set of killings. And one attempt at a safe surrender ends in the murder of a close friend.The film is dated in one ironic manner  the meetings of Robertson and his C.I.A. boss John Houseman at his most cynical weary are in the agency offices in the World Trade Center. But we see slowly what is at the base of this. There appears to be a rogue C.I.A. group acting here and for patriotic motives in their own eyes. Von Sydow is a freelance assassin used by the C.I.A. who has been involved in the massacre.Redford realizing he can't trust Robertson or the latter's bosses becomes his own protector hiding out in Brooklyn Heights at the apartment of Faye Dunaway and using a stolen port  o  phone used by telephone workers to telephone Robertson without being traceable. We follow the rest of this splendid thriller as Redford slowly finds out who did the dirty work why and gets his own back at the Agency.Oh yeah SEINFELD. Remember the episode where Cosmo Kramer tried to start a movement to get people to drop all use of the U.S. Post Office. His pal Newman realizing what Kramer is bucking tries to warn him while driving a postal truck Kramer is standing in the street that one day a friendly face will offer him a ride in a postal truck. Do not take that offer! warns Newman. But a moment later Newman sees that two of the Postal police have seen him and Kramer together and Newman tries to get Kramer into the truck. Unfortunately for both Kramer has learned not to trust such offers. So both are caught. Kramer is then intimidated by a smooth as silk Postmaster General a splendid Wilford Brimley  whose golf game was just spoiled by all this. As a crestfallen Kramer leaves he sees Newman brought in for his punishment tied up with a bucket over his head. Tell my story to the world! the postman squeals. A perfect comic salute to a first rate thriller.".

It is not and never has been about freedom it is now and always has been a war of economic necessity. Although this film is not as renowned as many of the other paranoid spy thrillers of the 70's such as the Conversation or the Parallax View it is still a very watchable and intriguing film.Redford is well cast as a fish out of water having to adapt his talents from the page to real life. The central relationship between Dunaway and Redford doesn't work as well as it should. She is too keen to fall for his charms and were it not Redford but a more charmless man like Hackman for example I doubt it would have worked at all.The film is not as complex as has suggested. It is neat and easy enough to follow. It has a beguiling character that is better for my money than harder hitting films like Parallax. Redfords fight in the middle of the film is copied in a many ways by the new Bourne movie fight scenes. Indeed the double talk spy will appeal to fans of this genre. Bourne today is the nearest thing to Condor in the movies.And Von Sydow is as always untouchable.

Unfortunately neither character was particularly believable. Turner  selfdescribed as no spy but rather simply as a guy who reads books nevertheless seemed to come across as a pretty accomplished cloak and dagger type. The relatively quick development of the relationship between Turner and Kathy detracted from the latter character's credibility as did her apparently quick and easy entrance into Turner's activity.This isn't especially an action movie  although it has action moments. It's more of a behind the scenes look at the intelligence community and its ways. It has some mildly effective twists and a resolution to the mystery of why Turner's colleagues were killed although the movie ended on a bit of an open ended note with a great deal of uncertainty about what Turner's ultimate fate would be.".

Ask 'em when they're running out. Ask 'em when there's no heat in their homes and they're cold. Ask 'em when their engines stop. Ask 'em when people who have never known hunger start going hungry. You wanna know something? They won't want us to ask 'em. They'll just want us to get it for 'em! This is at the end of the film and the last exchange between von Sydow and Redford. This film came out just after the first oil crisis of the '70s! 30 years on and people are even more brainwashed then ever before...I think that this film should be remade and probably the only man that could do this justice would be Denzel Washington. The only man at the moment that has the quality called Screen Presence. Hat can make stay interested in a film with him saying anything for 5 minutes or more.I feel that Hollywood should really go for this film and remake it. But touching this up to make it more relevant for todays generation. If Possible.Please think about it Hollywood.If you haven't seen the original please do so.

Turner Boy what is it with you people? You think not getting caught in a lie is the same thing as telling the truth? Higgins No. It's simple economics. Today it's oil right? In ten or fifteen years food. Plutonium. And maybe even sooner. Now what do you think the people are gonna want us to do then? Turner Ask them. Higgins Not now  then! Ask 'em when they're running out. Ask 'em when there's no heat in their homes and they're cold. Ask 'em when their engines stop. Ask 'em when people who have never known hunger start going hungry. You wanna know something? They won't want us to ask 'em. They'll just want us to get it for 'em! This is at the end of the film and the last exchange between von Sydow and Redford. This film came out just after the first oil crisis of the '70s! 30 years on and people are even more brainwashed then ever before...I think that this film should be remade and probably the only man that could do this justice would be Denzel Washington. The only man at the moment that has the quality called Screen Presence. Hat can make stay interested in a film with him saying anything for 5 minutes or more.I feel that Hollywood should really go for this film and remake it. But touching this up to make it more relevant for todays generation. If Possible.Please think about it Hollywood.If you haven't seen the original please do so. Its something that you shouldn't miss!";

	schema:headline " Some perspectives on Alien Resurrection";
	schema:reviewBody "The Auteurist Perspective  The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. JeanPierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera setups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or more obliquely Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big scifi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its buildup by contrast Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.The Whedonite Perspective  The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original which is available online. Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script  Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film  reducing characters like Hillard in particular to cyphers changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth the only place as Whedon instinctively understood that the climax could possibly take place and removing a lot of the texture of the setting like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal' but the dialogue Whedon's great strength is mangled by a director working in his second language and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.The Cynical Perspective  The 'Alien' series is by this point a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions  and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England this production was mounted in LA for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is after all the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend hence Winona shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.The Aesthetic Perspective  John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series both lushly romantic and queasily menacing it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive with perhaps a hint of playful parody the sickly green light the mad scientist outfits the giant glass jars in the lab the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective  the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly overripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material particularly in the way the cast is shot Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme. It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front however is the Newborn. The thinking behind it  to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's and our emotional response to it  is sound enough but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipecleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white redveined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.".

	schema:headline " The Fatal Mistake.";
	schema:reviewBody "Review 4 of 4With Alien 3 closing the story arc of the Alien trilogy this film begins with a fresh slate. The Alien films have always been a director's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it. Resurrection tries to be too many things at once. It has a very artistic and dynamic visual style but cardboard characters. It has a very overt sense of humor but it is all done in a very juvenile manner. Much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence. Sigourney Weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could. Thinking back the first three films all had very solid overall stories and well developed characters while Resurrection has a very solid concept but can't seem to build a coherent movie around it. If you follow the overall themes of the series with the first second and third being birth life and death respectively that leaves Resurrection on shaky thematic ground. Since this is Alien RESURRECTION obviously the filmmakers wished for rebirth to be the theme but somehow it never quite works. The characters are basically action movie clichs and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived. Why does the Alien always stop to snarl before it attacks giving people just enough time to shoot it? Alien 3 did not have this problem and it reinforced how dangerous the creature really was. Resurrection turns the Aliens into monsters from a Bmovie. Very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable. Sure the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derringdo but there's no real sense of danger...except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits. Two fantastic scenes that I wish there were more of in the film are the doctor's examination of the Aliens where he plays with them. Now that was a scene of inspired genius. The other scene was when Ripley wakes up in her circular chamber. It is interesting to note that neither of these scenes have any dialogue because the dialogue is pretty atrocious. Ron Pearlman is always fun to watch and makes a good comic duo with Dominique Pinon but Winona Ryder absolutely kills this movie with her nonperformance. The effects look less realistic this time out and the score at times seems to try too hard to emulate the second and third films with Goldsmith's original Alien theme being used on several occasions. The film is a brilliant exercise in dynamic visuals but the story really does not go anywhere. Unlike the first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent. I believe JeanPierre Jeunet was an excellent choice for a director but the script served him very badly. This is an interesting film to watch for an interesting scene here and there but not in the same league as the previous films.".

	onyx:emotionText "Review 4 of 4With Alien 3 closing the story arc of the Alien trilogy this film begins with a fresh slate. The Alien films have always been a director's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it. Resurrection tries to be too many things at once. It has a very artistic and dynamic visual style but cardboard characters. It has a very overt sense of humor but it is all done in a very juvenile manner. Much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style. The cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence. Sigourney Weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could. Thinking back the first three films all had very solid overall stories and well developed characters while Resurrection has a very solid concept but can't seem to build a coherent movie around it. If you follow the overall themes of the series with the first second and third being birth life and death respectively that leaves Resurrection on shaky thematic ground. Since this is Alien RESURRECTION obviously the filmmakers wished for rebirth to be the theme but somehow it never quite works. The characters are basically action movie clichs and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived. Why does the Alien always stop to snarl before it attacks giving people just enough time to shoot it? Alien 3 did not have this problem and it reinforced how dangerous the creature really was. Resurrection turns the Aliens into monsters from a Bmovie. Very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable. Sure the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derringdo but there's no real sense of danger...except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits. Two fantastic scenes that I wish there were more of in the film are the doctor's examination of the Aliens where he plays with them. Now that was a scene of inspired genius.

	schema:reviewBody "Alien Resurrection was released about six months after I graduated from high school and at the time I wasn't very familiar with the series. I took my first film class about six months later at which point I learned to really appreciate the great films and filmmakers and one of the first things I learned was that the first three Alien films are spectacular achievements of science fiction cinema and the third sequel is a sad ridiculous mess. This happens all too often with sequels and yes part four is not yet another amazingly impressive Alien film but come on it's not THAT bad. I watched it last night for the first time in almost ten years and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's strange that I liked it so much because it shows all the signs of a botched modernized sequel of a series that should have been left alone long ago. The characters most of all are almost all goofy caricatures with preposterous dialogue and routine motivations and some just don't belong at all. Personally I am a pretty big fan of Winona Ryder but only in roles that suit her and she has had a lengthy list of roles that suit her but Annallee Call in Alien Resurrection is just not one of them. Too often she comes off as a tough talking teenager in this movie and it just gets hard to take her character seriously. She's like Ja Rule in Half Past Dead but less ridiculous.Then again this could just have been a result of her starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and that woman is just awesome. Dan Hedaya is suitably overthetop in his role as the gleefully neurotic General Perez and I have to admit that I was curious to see the performance of Gary Dourdan as Christie. Lately I've been watching countless hours of CSI on DVD and it's amazing to see how different his role is in this movie from the most serious role he would play later in that show. I prefer the later performance myself.The resurrection implied in the title refers to Ripley being borough back to life 200 years after her death for the purpose of creating one of the alien queens and then breeding the animals for twisted scientific purposes. They decide to keep Ripley alive for observation after surgically removing the alien from her chest only to discover that she and the aliens are clearly more than they are prepared to handle. There is a negligible subplot involving a group of shady characters headed by the wonderfully sinister Michael Wincott as a Frank Elgyn who promises his men won't start trouble or get into any fights if they are allowed to stay on board for a few days and nights. I also have to mention Ron Perlman who just has a face for this kind of movie. Probably most recognizable lately as Hellboy this has to be one of the least appreciated actors of the last few decades. In just over 20 years he has acted in more than 150 films and TV shows and at the time of this writing he has 18 projects in the works. Unbelievable! He also has one of the best lines in the movie Why the waste of ammo?! Must be a chick thing.The aliens are probably the thing that will make or break this movie and in my opinion they were impressive enough. The occasional CGI effects are never convincing but then again they never are so luckily they didn't overdo them. Even the aliens swimming underwater was not too much for me to accept perhaps given the automatic tension that is immediately generated in almost any movie where someone has to hold their breath for a long time. This went on far too long to be anything remotely realistic in this movie but it was a good scene nonetheless. I would also argue that this is the goriest of all of the four alien movies particularly at the end but also contains some of the best comic relief. This combination makes the movie highly entertaining even following in the long shadows of its spectacular predecessors. There is a high energy scene in the third act of the film where Perlman's character performs a daredevil stunt to shoot one of the pursuing aliens dead which is followed by what has to be the funniest spider killing in film history. I haven't laughed out loud like that at a movie in a long long time. In browsing through the posts on the message board for Resurrection I have been inspired to raise my rating for the movie from a 7 to an 8 if only because it is so obvious that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon about bashing this movie. I see nothing but whiny pouting little brats whimpering and griping about little nitpicky details in the movie condemning the third sequel in the Alien quadrilogy as a travesty and an embarrassment and a pathetic way to end the series. Stupid people in large numbers man. It's sad to see such a clear mob mentality slamming a movie that is about 100 times better than most people say. No it's not up to the same level as the first two films and it definitely has its drawbacks but it is definitely a good installment in the series and you could certainly do a lot worse for some fun popcorn scifi on a Friday night. I'll admit that my judgment might be a little skewed because I watched the staggeringly awful Eaten Alive just before seeing this but it is clear to me that Alien Resurrection has yet to receive the respect it deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "Where does one even begin? I guess the first thing I want to say is that this film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. There is not a single line of dialogue a single shot a single performance or detail that is actually good.So let's get to the bad things then.The director. That deranged surrealist Frenchman should never have had anything to do with the project. The script. It is as though it was intended as a kind of parody of the Alien films which was a horrible idea. But in the hands of the aforementioned director this wouldbe parody becomes a surreal mess that is simply unwatchable.The castcharacters. Winona Ryder's character is irritating and irrelevant for the plot. Come to think of it all of these characters are irrelevant. They just run around while we wait to see how many will make it until the end of the film. Sigourney Weaver is now a psychotic bitch which means she talks nonsense and none of her actions seem to have a discernible motivation. Dan Hedaya plays a general whose character is straight out of a cartoon. Seeing him do these comedic bits is probably the first shocking thing. A film that starts like a straight horror in space takes a strange turn as soon as he enters the stage and the confusion thus created never ceases. Of course the confusion and incredulity are exacerbated by further......Nonsensical moments. A guy fires a gun at an angled surface on the ceiling thus shooting an adversary. This is straight out of Looney Toons. To make it more baffling that same character cannot hit an alien from three feet away even after unloading an entire clip at it. Then he falls into a pool of water and everyone assumes he is dead. Why is he dead? Can he not swim back to the surface? Who knows. And who cares? The director certainly doesn't care so why should we? But let's look at the very basics They are running this super secret expensive project... which relies on services provided by space pirates. They breed aliens that bleed acid... in containers that are not resilient to acid. They are a military facility crawling with troops yet they never even attempt to contain the escaped aliens. For some reason they just run for their lives without even taking the time to assess the situation. Was that their emergency plan from the start? Run for your life? And just to make things even more interesting the ship is programmed to return to Earth... in case deadly aliens break loose making the entire garrison flee in disarray. Great idea. By the way although the ship is supposed to be far away far from sight of the various government agencies it makes the trip to Earth in a matter of hours. I guess it makes sense the crazy Frenchman took the job as the director  no one else would touch it while he clearly couldn't care less about plausibility and saw the whole thing as a way of shoving in some of his favourite implausible plot elements. I'd like to point out another inconsistency here the plot only seems to remember aliens bleed acid when it needs the acid to be used to make the aliens escape or to help Ripley cut something open with her own acidic blood the result of cloning. In other situations aliens that have been shot dead do not bleed acid. The script simply doesn't care. The alien hybrid. Apparently alien has been fused with human DNA and is now being born like a human baby and looks like Pumpkinhead. You don't know whether to laugh or just feel uncomfortable watching that thing.The lesbian overtones. Ripley is not only psychotic apparently she is now a lesbian as well. I guess they thought that they could score some points for that. But Ripley looks godawful and frankly watching her make sexual advances towards that little twerp Wiynona Ryder is just creepy.Boring. Yes it's boring. We couldn't care less about the characters  in fact they are quite unlikable so we might find ourselves cheering for the aliens to get them. And when they do get them it doesn't involve suspenseful scenes. The only action scene people will remember from this film is the one where they are being chased by aliens under water. It's interesting to see aliens swim but then again they do not look convincing at all. They are being chased by CGI. Ending. I have no idea how it ends. I have seen this film several times and by the time Pumpkinhead makes its appearance I am sick of it. By the time we get to about ten minutes before the end I can't take it any more. I know how it ends though but only because I have seen some reviews of the film on Youtube. I literally cannot endure to watch this nonsense until the end.So there you have it. You still want to watch this thing? It just occurred to me that I somehow still haven't been able to explain just how awful the viewing experience of Alien Resurrection is. I guess that final touch of awfulness comes from the French auteur himself. Think of Alien Resurrection as a cinematic turd with an attitude.".

The plot appears to have been drawn from a Dark Horse comic story about breeding Aliens for profit. 20th Century Fox could have developed a great screenplay. Instead Joss Whedon is brought in to create one of the lamest scripts in movie history. Definitely on par with ROBOT MONSTER. The dialogue is appalling. Cringe inducing oneliners and throwaway wisecracks abound. Worse they are delivered by the actors in pantomime style. Must be a chick thing Who do I have to f to get off this ship? and so on. Terrible visual larks are thrown in for good measure. There doesn't seem to be anyone who isn't overacting. Except maybe Ryder who turns in a planklike performance. However Ron Perlman and Dominique Pinon take the armflapping and mugging to extraordinary levels. Perlman as Joner the tough guy Space Pirate shouts grimaces and demonstrates that he is the badass of the story. The Xtreme Badass. Pinon as the physically challenged character annoys from start to finish. He whines pouts and plays the underdog part with the subtlety of a pipebomb. A pity some fine actors were involved Brad Dourif Michael Wincott Leland Orser. All wasted here. There are goofs throughout blasting an alien head through it's mouth then extracting a pristine tonguejaw. Christie has his hands by his side. Then not. Then back again etc. This movie can be viewed just to spot the many goofs. There are too many hijinks and extroverted attempts at comedy. Jeunet and Weaver had too much creative control and appear to have made the film by constructing it around set piece shots and scenes Let's have Ripley dreaming that she is covered in cheesecloth. Wouldnt it look brilliant to have a pit of squirming tentacles?. What about an Alien pushing the punishment button with it's inner jaw? Not it's hands it's dripping jaw!. A robot in a Chapel! How very subversive and avant garde!. The end result is forced and seems to serve only these ostentatious artistic scenes. Logic is nowhere to be found in this tale. Christie cuts himself loose and thereby sacrifices himself for his little buddy for no apparent reason. He isn't incapacitated the acid on his face looks little worse than a bad case of acne. Is he so vain he would prefer death to a future without a modeling career? Joner displays his edgy inyourface disposition by blasting a spider whose web he is inconvenienced by. Spiders on space ships? What do they catch to eat? Never mind it is symbolic of their struggle against the aliens. Spider bugs aliens... get it? Tres anarchistic! The production itself blows chunks. The movie starts off well enough but soon descends into a gaudy psychedelic style. There appear to be lights that serve no function other than to provide a multicoloured wash. The sets look far too big and are more Poseidon Adventure than Alien. The bombastic score reminds the viewer this is a suspenseful movie with a melodramatic Dun dun dun ...DUNNNN! In over the top leathers Weaver seems to meander through the part falling back on a role she used from her last production. The characterization of Ripleyclone and The Queen from Snow White are awfully similar. There is actually a scene where Weaver repeats the same signature hand gestures with Ryder that she used in SNOW WHITE A Tale of Terror which was shot just prior to this. Perhaps she was channeling the Evil Queen through Ripley? Or telling us that Call is really a banished Princess? There is at least one dwarf. What were you expecting? Santa Claus?. No but I wasn't expecting this piece of  either. It makes Armageddon look cerebral. Buffy the Alien Slayer. Fox really should have hired a director who spoke English. Jeneut is not entirely to blame. Weaver and Whedon did little to help. Was going to give it 2x stars. But just thinking about this mess makes me angry. It takes a dump on the Alien Trilogy. Ripley We did it. We saved the Earth. Call What do we do now?... Make another multimillion dollar crappy rip off from a now violated cinematic legend of course!".

No but I wasn't expecting this piece of  either. It makes Armageddon look cerebral. Buffy the Alien Slayer. Fox really should have hired a director who spoke English. Jeneut is not entirely to blame. Weaver and Whedon did little to help. Was going to give it 2x stars. But just thinking about this mess makes me angry. It takes a dump on the Alien Trilogy. Ripley We did it. We saved the Earth. Call What do we do now?... Make another multimillion dollar crappy rip off from a now violated cinematic legend of course!";

What may be truly unique about Alien Resurrection is the scene wherein Ripley discovers the 7 mistakes that preceded her. It is one of the most powerful terrifying and ultimately beautiful scenes I have ever experienced in a film.  The please kill me segment pops up in other scenes perhaps other films in the series and certainly other films in general but where has one witnessed the great suffering of a version of oneself and the chance to end that person's suffering? Weaver plays the scene with just the right amount of emotional chaos.  Jeunet typically softens the end of the scene with Ron Perlman's must be a chick thing comment but thankfully that humorous interjection is no more jarring that a slight Shakespearean comic relief.  Another terrifyingpoignantgrand guignol and perhaps a unique situation in film mother killing son and being a hero for it with the Newborn getting sucked out of the cargo window one glob of flesh at a time is also a visually stunning and beautiful realization of the ultimate primal connection between Ripley and the beast and the uncomprehending shock and horror the beast experiences when he realizes his own mother won't save him. I think Jeunet perfectly handled the movie the humor goofier than any in the previous episodes in the series shows a very European director confident enough in his own style to inject a sacred cow with some sweet cream.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was better than Alien 3 that I hate it so much improvement over the third installment and yes it was better but hits the mark. This is another raging rant on Alien Resurrection! Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley and she is a clone now. This must be a joke why is she a clone now? After 200 years with DNK they cloned Ripley and they took xenomorph queen out of her chests. They grew up in to 2 Aliens and since when an Alien kills his own species? It is beyond me and that was never in Aliens before. The Alien creature can not kill one of his own that is breaking the rules. Aliens creatures have to stick together.This movie lacks the story or something new or different it is almost the same as Alien and Aliens. Third movie was boring trash this movie was a little better at least it did had an action and they did not offended me by kill in a dog like Alien 3 did. I like some of the cast Ron Perlman Michael Wincott and Kim Flowers I like those three but that was all. Nothing likable is in this movie there was nothing I liked about.What makes me angry on this film is Sigourney Weaver she is now the mother of these Alien creatures she gave them a birth. She doesn't act like Ripley did in the first two movies. She is not a leader or a badass she is now a selfish clone chick who want's to go out of this ship. She cusses a lot and beats people up. She betrays her own child on the end the film I hate it. I hate this character she is unlikable character. She is no longer a heroine from the first 2 movies sadly she failed. How much was Sigourney Weaver paid for this 2 movies? Sigourney Weaver is selfish she doesn't care anymore about us fans.The newborn designed was so disgusting horrible I hate too see that person playing newborn hybrid. It was ugly and I did not like it. The movie was boring the pacing was slow and it felt been rushed. Alien Resurrection is a peace trash it can't hold a candle to Alien and Aliens. If people like those 2 movies it is fine I hate them so much!This is forgotten lackluster I really don't have nothing good to say about this movie except it did had happy ending. But I just did not care about other characters in this movie or been killed. Since when Aliens can swim? Or they are intelligent I don't know if they can swim.I hate Alien 3 and I hate so much Alien Resurrection I don't have those 2 movies on Bluray only on DVD for the collection. I do have Alien and Aliens separately on Bluray disc. That is why in 5 years I haven't seen Alien 3 or this movie because they are offensive trash movies to me. I didn't want to rent them but since I decide to watch all Alien mythology movies and review them I have to do it. P".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that I LOVE the Alien series so please acknowledge that.  Here's what I think  The first two Alien films were outstanding. The first is the scariest movie of all time and the second is the best action film of all time.  I think the third was okay because it did achieve the dark and creepy feel it was going for but was also a bit of a disappointment.  What I think everyone didn't acknowledge about the film was the fact that it did a damn good job of resurrecting the aliens.  Think about it.  How else can you make a story that takes place after the third one and still star Sigourney Weaver?  Don't say to say the third one was a dream because then that would be corny and immature.  I thought that the story was very good.  The characters although slightly wooden were very well drawn.  Several people say that the old Ripley was gone but by the end of the film she was acting just like the good ol' gal we all know and love. And something that only one critic acknowledged was this  the newborn alien.  WOW!  That thing was ugly and scary as hell!  That's the type of alien you need for the ending.  You've been seeing the same old alien for 3.75 films now and you've pretty much gotten scared by the creatures as much as you could why not bring some fresh meat on the scene?  And plus you have to include the alien tradition of battling a new alien at the end of each film.  In the first one Ripley battled a normal alien.  In the second one Ripley battled a queen.  And in the third one Ripley battled a dog alien.  To continue the tradition Ripley battled a human alien.  And if I may say that thing is the scariest of them all.  What I don't understand is that everyone says that this series ran out of steam by the beginning of the third one.  I disagree.  The Alien films still have a flare going but a fifth one would be all that you could have before the flame burns out.  I expect the fifth to be REALLY good but also tie up the entire story and give an accurate epilogue to the series.  And think about this  You're not going to resurrect a series like this just so that you can end the series again just before the credits of the said film.  Alien Resurrection was a good movie and I think that it was as innovative as a third Alien sequel could be.".

The director goes straight into the action very quickly in this film so the only well developed character is Ripley.

This nailbiting picture contains tension from start to finish  gory scenes aplenty  thrills  some strong scares  slime  emotion  entertainment and good acting . It is a superb cinematic combination of SciFi  monster movie and terror . This is a brutal  considerable violent and exciting scifi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s  80s and 90s. The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters .

	schema:reviewBody "Let's recap.The first alien film which was directed by Ridley Scott is the film that started it all.  Scott's direction was sharp and Alien had the most tensionfilled setting of the series and it brought to life a truly horrifying creature.  But that was twentythree years ago.  Alien since it was released in 1979 has become seriously dated and seems to have lost some of its potency.Aliens which was directed by James Cameron is the most wellknown film in the series and the most successful.  This time instead of Ripley going up against one alien she must now go up against an entire nest of the deadly creatures but with the help of a few good marines added to the bunch.  The ultimate question was of course would excellent firepower be enough to combat the aliens?  Cameron focused a lot on action and tension which transformed Aliens into a war movie of sorts.  I liked Aliens the most and hasn't lost any of its ability to still shock its audience.Alien 3 directed by David Fincher is the most underrated of the series. Fincher changed the series by doing something new with it by adding his trademark dark settings to the film.  Instead of continuing the trend that was pioneered by James Cameron he went back to step one while still taking the series in a new direction.  He created one of the most dark and depressing horror films ever brought to life.  Though for some odd reason audiences missed that entirely.  Fincher had originally intended the film to be much longer and with more character development but executives at Fox had cheated him out of his own vision by removing most of said footage.Now we have Alien Resurrection released in 1997 and directed by acclaimed French film maker JeanPierre Jeunet.  Set twohundred years after the events of Alien 3 Ripley Sigourney Weaver has been cloned from a sample of her DNA and must continue her ongoing fight with the deadly alien this time with the help of a group of futuristic space pirates and a mysterious woman named Call Winona Ryder.  It goes without saying that Jeunet is a visual genius.  He has a real sense of bringing life into his scenes and giving the movie a fantastic look.  The gore here is pretty extreme and some scenes will certainly make your skin crawl turning the movie into a freak show of sorts.  But that could ultimately be what Jeunet was trying to do I'm not quite sure.  That is no reason to hate this film however.  An excellent addition to the series that is not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why? I'll ask that question again. WHY? Why was this film ever made? The original Alien is a masterpiece. No doubt. Aliens is the perfect sequel. Alien 3 is flawed but visually inventive and it makes some interesting developments from the first two films in terms of drama and character. Alien Resurrection is a cashin. Of course most sequels are but this one doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that it is one. It feels lazy hackneyed tired and lethargic. There is no tension not even in the underwater sequence that everyone raved about simply because it was too difficult for the fans to believe that an Alien film could be utterly devoid of merit suspense or interest. The Ripley character looks bored and is now so outrageously arrogant as to become a cheap parody of her strong female status. Now she is so overwhelmingly macho it just looks stupid. The other characters are pitifully written. The first two Alien films had characters you cared about and even the third film managed to make some of the victims tough job considering they were all murderers sympathetic. But here all they do is make bad jokes and totally dispel any possible tension by spouting ridiculous dialogue. And for a film in which all the characters do is run away there is no atmosphere of tension or sense of danger. This isdue to a lame script and uninvolved direction. The special effects are mostly poor especially in the end and is a further testament to the overall badness of CGI.There is only one mildly diverting sequence when Ripley sees all of her clones in the laboratory and burns them down in a moment of grief. Some attempts of character development but in retrospect the sequence just feels throwaway just a bit of filler in between the next inevitable death. It is also doesn't help that the emotion of the scene is ruined by the line Women... by the stereotypically mysognist bonehead played by that moron out of Beauty and the Beast.Finally. Winona Ryder. She is terrible in this! Of course SPOILER she's a robot but that's just something defenders of her unexplainable star status say to avoid admitting the fact that she is bad in this. Very bad.If Alien 3 was a pale imitation of Alien albeit not a bad one then this is a TV movie copy of Aliens. It looks rubbish has no reason to exist and completely destroys the credibility of one of the most interesting SF film series ever. For what once was a classic trilogy has now become a franchise.As stupid as Alien Versus Predator seems it can't be as bad as this.".

What I will write is about the experience this fan of the franchise had watching this movie for the second time in many years shortly after the first three.For me this is just the perfect little ending to the Alien quadrilogy. Aside from being a perfectly badass scifi action movie on its own with a ridiculous amount of referenced subplots like the relationships between the pirate crew members and their individual stories the crazed scientist who is ultimately killed by the absolute peak of his life's work and the timid general forced by his corrupt superiors to deal with criminals it takes every classic theme from the series and does something cool with it.First obviously the aliens. Ripley who died trying to exterminate them is mercilessly resurrected once again pregnant with a queen. The cloning process that in a way revived her however has fundamentally fused her physiology with that of the aliens. She has become that which has dominated her life for as long as she can remember. Ultimately we learn that this has happened to her child as well enabling it to give birth to a perfect cross between Ripley and the queen. In a truly moving homage to the end of the first Alien movie Ripley ends the quadrilogy by once again blasting the final surviving alien into space except this time the action is infinitely more profound the alien being a confused child and Ripley being one of the mothers. Out of the blue I literally wailed during that final moment. Never before have I seen the main antagonist in a series become so intertwined with the object of her struggle literally becoming it actually having given birth to it and personally destroying it. Weaver plays the role no less than perfectly.The synthetic. We went from the malevolent corporate heel android working against Ripley in the first film to the empathic good guy android saving Ripley twice in the next two films to the oddly completely and utterly logical successor to these a second generation ie produced by androids synthetic human initially intending to kill Ripley in a really neat reversal of the Ripleyandroid story from Alien but ultimately working with her and saving her life by noticing her on Betty's monitor. Call is a tormented synthetic much more so than Bishop and Jeunet pays a great deal of attention to this all through the film from Joner's incessant stigmatizing comments to Call's reluctance to go to the dark place that is the cyberspace part of her belongs to.Finally of course the company. While WeylandYutani apparently doesn't exist anymore by the time this story takes place everything the army and their scientists do is perfectly in line with the spirit of this evil corporation. More than in any previous film human dignity is spat on completely from the dozens of failed Ripley clones including the one featured in one of the most haunting visuals of the film the killing of which incidentally is also a neat precursor to Ripley's ultimate act of destruction to the kidnapped hosts consciously being impregnated. In the most perfect ending I can imagine for the company at least for the purposes of this quadrilogycloser I am excluding the AvP films from the story arc the last host first beats Wren the only surviving company man half to death in a fit of blind superhuman rage then holds him in front of his chest just in time for the baby alien to burst through his brain before the baby and its host are blasted to pieces.How people defecate on this so vehemently I fail to see. Continuity errors? Every movie has some. Unexplainable plot elements? It is scifi. You've already accepted that a spider crab can make love to someone's face have a small creature grow in their chest burst out of it and within hours transform into a huge slimy predator. I would think a clone with memories isn't such a gigantic leap.".

In Aliens we have space marines who are built up as ultimate hard men equipped with stateoftheart fire power. In the unloved but worthy Alien 3 we have the opposite of the space marines unarmed convicts. Most of them turn out to be British character actors. It is fun to slowly sort them out identify them and see them throw harsh language at the beastie. In Resurrection the main opposition for the Aliens is not the soldiers but a motley group of pirates. The soldiers run away but the pirates die hard.The review that angered me said that this pirate crew did nothing. I think the contrary. If you know your film and your TV series you will recognise all these guys you will positively enjoy seeing them get as far as they get. I am not a complete enthusiast for the film as whole though it deserves plenty of credit. But I think this is one of the best crews in film. Most films haven't a clue how to present any kind of team so that each makes his mark.

I love horror movies made by people with sense of humor. Ron Perlman's Johner is a masterpiece but unfortunately if three previous movies were about Ripley in Alien 4 due to Johner she is not leading. It doesn't spoil the movie but changes it a bit. I can't wait to see Alien 5 one day!!!".

Ron Perlman's Johner is a masterpiece but unfortunately if three previous movies were about Ripley in Alien 4 due to Johner she is not leading. It doesn't spoil the movie but changes it a bit. I can't wait to see Alien 5 one day!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "While this is commonly thought of as the weaker installment of this line personally I believe it to be superior to Alien 3 in many important ways.200 years after Ripley's death she is cloned and brought back to life. The cloning process however also involved the DNA of the Alien Queen giving her superhuman powers and abilities. After several failed attempts they finally make good with a humanoid RipleyQueen with superior intelligence and talents.According to the Making of documentary this installment was very unlike the disorganized mess which was Alien 3 in that this attempt was together and ready to go a year before they actually started shooting. The story was polished and perfected and was a unique and creative story in comparison. It was a big script in Hollywood. The buzz about it was that it had elements which made it a worthwhile successor to the first two completely ignoring the third installment all together.Alien Resurrection takes the Alien franchise to places fans would never have dreamed without compromising the key elements of the Alien world and does it successfully.The studios did not want a typical Hollywood popcorn movie to be part of this franchise and therefore hired JeanPierre Jeunet City of Lost Children if you can dig it to bring in a unique interpretive eye to the direction of this project. His visual style is quite distinct and permeates this work in a proactive way. It was perhaps the most shrewd move Fox could have made in that his unique perspective was the singlemost saving factor of this attempt.The action sequences are quite rousing the story here is once again solid and convincing and the performances are still the top row quality you expected from this line. The fight sequences are well choreographed and executed beautifully done as is the rest of this movie. While I cannot rate it as high as I did the first two it is obviously superior to Alien 3 in all ways that matter.It rates a 7.910 from...the Fiend .".

Alien is a creepy monster thriller. Aliens is an action movie. Alien3 is a goth nightmare gone wrong. Alien Resurrection is a Whedon film. Me being a big fan of FireflySerenity and his Astonishing XMen comic book series loved this film dearly. Yes it may require some thinking to understand due to the cloning and crossbreeding stuff. But it isn't bad to have Hollywood make you think with an actionhorror movie. If you think of this a different kind of movie I think you'll enjoy it like I did. But if you are looking for the same kind of movie a before you might a well pass this one.".

The movie has a different approach than its prequels but in 20 years movie industry changed so much and it would be sad if it was the same. Honestly although I think it is slightly worse than two previous sequels I still prefer it to the original Alien.7510".

	schema:headline " Not as good as the first two but better than Alien 3";
	schema:reviewBody "To sum this up Alien Resurrection is great example of combining action and some suspense and make it entertaining as best as possible. While it doesn't have the scariness of the first two or the best acting It's not as melodramatic as Alien 3. The story revolves around 200 years later after Ellen Ripley's death on Fury 161 where scientists have genetically cloned her since she had an Alien queen founded by the Company. While after the Queen Alien has been removed from the cloned Ripley Sigourney Weaver she is been kept alive for stasis etc. Then a cargo shop which has a load of humans that are to be used for hosts. A curious female later to be known as the android Call Winona Ryder finds the cloned Ripley and sooner or later all of the people are in trouble because now the Alien Experiments have minds of there own and now are attempting to create a colony of there own. This movie was a pretty good one to watch I enjoyed the movie even if there were flaws. The one major one was Call Winona Ryder is a good actress but I felt her lines were dry and she could have done better and some characters that I felt that should have stayed in the movie more like the character Elgyn and Brad Dourif. Another flaw was the Alien human hybrid creature it was just too sick and depressing for that kind of thing. Now off to the good stuff Sigourney Weaver potrays the Ripley clone in a different way but It's not bad I especially liked the scene where she founds out about the other Clone experiments failed. Ron Perlman gives a great performance as the muscle bound Johner who likes to make a joke at just about anything. Dominque Pinon was an Interesting character as Vriess Kim Flowers was ok but had no character development but I did like Brad Dourif's humor relief Especially making those faces at the Aliens and J.E. Freeman was ok. The writing by Joss Whedon Buffy the Vampire Slayer series is a decent job but could have used some elements that could have given a more familiar Alien look to it but wasn't bad for his first try. The directing was stylish by French director JeanPierre Jeunet who's proberly directed a few classy french films before this one. The Visual Effects were good if not bad few were sorta fake but not bad. Overall I think this was a close to excellent movie that was underated and should have gotten more profit at the Box Office and to me Alien Resurrection was a near return to the Alien saga.Regular Scale45 110 Scale810".
