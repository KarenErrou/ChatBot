	schema:headline " Sheer magic";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Elliott is a moving uplifting and often exuberant drama about motherless young Billie Jamie Bell fulfilling his dream of becoming a ballet dancer in the process overcoming the objections and prejudices of his father and brother Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven.It is also a piece of magic realism with political overtones. By setting their near fairy tale in the context of a closeknit mining community and more specifically against the backdrop of the 19845 miners' strike  a defining moment of modern British economic and social history  writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry are able to refer to gender and class issues without turning their work into a political tract and without losing focus on the central human drama.The film is realised near flawlessly. Bell achieves a convincing blend of adolescent bewilderment and defiance if his dancing is not quite as good as we might expect the storyline explains this away by saying that at this early stage his attitude and drive are more important than his technique. The dancing set pieces clearly inspired more by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly than by Nijinksky are performed with gusto mainly to pop songs by TRex.Lewis and Draven put gritty realism and passion into their roles of a father and son committed to their community and to the miners' cause. They make us feel their despair as they realise that this cause is lost but also their endurance as they come to terms both with Billie's aspirations and their own uncertain futures  within a few years most UK coalmines would be closed. The colliery in Easington the reallife location of the film closed in 1994.. The scenes of violence between strikers and police are presented uncompromisingly and authentically but with the occasional touch of humour.Julie Walters provides an outstanding performance as Mrs Wilkinson the dancing teacher who recognises and fosters Billie's talent and helps him resist his own and his family's inhibitions. She is perfect as the chainsmoking straighttalking mentor who has her own personal disappointments and hurts which she hopes Billie's success will help heal. To we outsiders watching the movie Mrs Wilkinson appears as an integral part of the local community but it is made clear that in the mid80s as far as Billie's family and friends are concerned she is a middle class outsider almost as alien as another species.One issue which the film tackles headon is traditional heterosexual male abhorrence of homosexuality. This attitude clearly underlies the shock of Billie's father and brother when they discover his interest in ballet. They would be even more horrified if they realised that his best friend was discovering gay tendencies in himself. It is typical of the sensitive direction that without labouring the point the film indicates by its close that attitudes towards gays changed radically during the 1980s and 90s along with the industrial landscape.".

	schema:headline " Simply excellent";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before About a Boy Notting Hill Love Actually Four Weddings and a Funeral and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month finally I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade.Director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional truly inspiring and moving emotional and poignant movie. The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in NorthEastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us. Sometimes the movie is sad sometimes it's funny but Stephen Daldry's work never leave you indifferent. The story occurs in a small coalmining town in 1984 and there are signs of a severe depression all over the town. You can see all around a shadow of distress and even poverty. Some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring to us sad feeling of hopelessness and even despair. There is a big coalminers strike in the town but it's easy to see that it's also the hopeless strike. But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character a twelve years old boy. He recently lost his mother and both his father and elder brother are striking coalminers. Billy is forced by his father to attend boxing classes and one day accidentally he see the girl ballet classes that occur in same room and he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing. So he attends those ballet classes instead the boxing and there is nothing surprising that after a few weeks his father suddenly finds out that Billy didn't attend boxing and worst of all he is attending the ballet classes. The main conflict occurs.Billy must fight for his choice fight against his own family. There are two stereotypes against him. First one is that ballet for girls not for boys lads do football... or boxing... or wrestling. And second sounds even worse all male ballet dancers are gays. Billy is not but no one from his family except aged grandma want even heard about ballet. There are only two people in the whole town who support him  middleaged ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson and his friend Michael who is the same age as Billy and who found that he is possibly a gay. This gay subplot easily became for conservative audience a very controversial question. But the fact is that such stereotypes are not invented by the director of the movie and if you would try to learn more about this terrific picture you will found that Jamie Bell who took dance lessons from age six suffered from similar sneers and taunts. Billy's problem is that he must fight not only against bad obstacles and misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes. Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero.Jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors. His performance and particularly dance sequences is so genuine bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy not a director choreographer or writer. BAFTA award for best actor of the year is welldeserved and it is pity that conservatism of the Academy too often becomes an insuperable obstacle for many great movies. Julie Walters an Academy nomination for best supporting actress as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary. The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot. Two other important supporting characters  Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction. The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic including a nice reference to great Swan Lake and modern music.The original R rating shouldn't mislead you. Except for strong language it should be easily a PG13. But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding. The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them.10 out of 10 looks well deserved. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English".

Jaime Bell is brilliant for a firsttimer and his dance is wonderful. There are also so many layers to the film. From brilliant cinematography to wonderful symbolism both in the script and in the music listen for the tune Billy is playing on piano in the main score during the big moments.

	schema:reviewBody "To say that Billy Elliot is the best movie of 2000 is to damn it with faint praise since this year's crop is pretty uninspiring. Better to compare it to movies of the past few years and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way since it goes against the trend of quirky violent sexobsessed moviemaking that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good almost mythic story complicated yet believable characters a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint and a series of dance scenes that are authentic inspiring and completely integral to the plot.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres onequarter to one sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart head funny bone eyes and ears and last but not least your feet for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure the people in his life rendered more black and white characters would have either remained caricatures or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot where the characters develop in a totally believable way where Billy invites admiration instead of pity and where the silences looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum Less is more is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a knock 'em dead Hollywood rollercoaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breathtaking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age career box office draw or Hollywood clout Jamie and his movie would win hands down.".

We've finally been given a film with a good almost mythic story complicated yet believable characters a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint and a series of dance scenes that are authentic inspiring and completely integral to the plot.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres onequarter to one sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart head funny bone eyes and ears and last but not least your feet for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure the people in his life rendered more black and white characters would have either remained caricatures or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot where the characters develop in a totally believable way where Billy invites admiration instead of pity and where the silences looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum Less is more is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a knock 'em dead Hollywood rollercoaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breathtaking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age career box office draw or Hollywood clout Jamie and his movie would win hands down.";

So many great scenes here that are both happy and sad Billy's father feels he has to break the strike to give Billy a chance in life this leads to a truly heartbreaking scene between him and his eldest son I weep unashamedly at the realism of it all the dancing is just wonderful with too many great scenes to only pick just one out the film is a seamless classic that ticks every box that I personally require from a film like this.The cast are magnificent Jamie Bell perfectly layers the lead role of Billy by fusing confusion joy fear hope and sorrow into one almighty performance. Julie Walters is up to her usual standard of greatness whilst Gary Lewis as the father is nothing short of tremendous they all can take a bow for making such a wonderful movie. The soundtrack is music gold you can never have enough TRex in your life ever and I ask if there has ever been a more appropriate use of music than the use of The Jam'sTown Called Malice? Paul Weller's up tempo beat belies it's sombre lyrics the song is about a town besieged by unemployment a great scene accompanies the song as Billy dances out his frustrations down the street you either cut down on the beer or the kids new gear it's a big decision in a town called Malice.Brilliant! Maybe I'm biased because I remember the miners strikes a sad and desperate time for the industry that was about to go under perhaps I love it for the sheer sympathy the characters garner or could it just be that it's an incredibly human story that is laid out fantastically well with an ending that demands a positive response from the viewer? Either way it rates 1010 for me and it always will.".

The boy who played Billy should get an award hands down for this movie. I watched the emotion on his face and it was amazing. This is the best breakout performance by a young boy since haley Joel Osmant in Sixth Sense. I have to say I just loved Julie Walters too. Where has she been since Educating Rita. Inspite of the swear words this is a movie that families should see. Its hard to believe this gets an R rating and movies like Scary Movie get...only R ratings.  I dont get it.

	schema:headline " A Triumph of Highly Charged Storytelling";
	schema:reviewBody "Billy Elliot is by far the most honestly told depiction of middle boyhood I've seen in years if ever. I was in joyful tatters at the end of this story of a boy struggling to stay true to his calling in an anguished northern English mining town circa 1980. Every working class character in this film is written and uncompromisingly played with great love and understanding of both family and class hardship. Personally I view this film as the finest piece of British intimiste cinema I've seen since Mike Leigh's Secrets and Lies. Yet it has epic elements as well.  Billy's personal story unfolds while his home town is occupied by uniformed British strike control forces.This is a tale of intermasculine struggle in a family and mining town almost devoid of and yearning for a balancing feminine presence. Billy's gift is slowly awakened in this stressed and violent male crucible. His relationships with his brother his father his genderally confused classmate and his teacher all grow increasingly charged as the movie develops. For honesty and presence Jamie Bell as Billy far surpasses Haley Joel Osment's debut in The Sixth Sense. And if that's not enough Julie Walters Gary Lewis and Jamie Draven as Billy's teacher dad and brother are all heartbreakingly portrayed. All are perfectly cast and at the very top of their form.After all these characters have passed through the warzone of the first and second acts director Steven Daldry delivers perhaps the most perfectly executed third act I have seen in a family centered drama from England or elsewhere. There are countless insightful decisions  Daldry makes in the course of this film that other directors will study for years to come. But they're all brought to touching and masterful closure in the third act segments.Kudos to scenarist Lee Hall for an excellent script. It should also be noted that many of DP Brian Tufano's beautifully composed shots match those of the great Chinese and Italian cinematographers. The film is brash in its musical style and forthright in its language. It is a film of specifics and the locale is not dressed up. And unlike many other local color films from England since 1985 this film has a strong eminently compassionate narrative spine. Many audience members in the show I attended were immobilized and overcome in their seats during credits.Despite frequent profanity boys 11 and up should be allowed to see Billy Elliot if only to keep them from abandoning hope. If it helps even one oppressed and confused boy keep an ear to the faint voice within that might just be his true calling this film will have been worth every dollar spent in its making. A truly uplifting film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those really great dramas that only come around maybe once a year. This is my pick for the best drama of 2000. Filled with amazing characters a great plot and circumstances that seem too real the wonderfully underplayed value of it takes precedence over anything set against it.There are some great performances here so let's get to em.Jamie Bell plays the lead role in an astonishing performance. Amazing dance routines done in perfect sync I can just imagine the time he had memorizing all the steps. A knockout performance with some of the most dramatic scenes played out with perfect honesty and realism.Another notable performance comes from Julie Walters who plays Mrs. Wilkinson the dance instructor in the mining town where Billy lives. Once a great dancer but now forced to work in the bottom floor of a boxing hall she plays her part wonderfully showing the lack of compassion and jadedness without words but only through expressions deep hurt lying beneath all that scorn but love shining through as she sees Billy's true talent.Finally performance wise we have Gary Lewis who plays Billy's father. With wonderful scenes that play themselves out with harsh reality I never tire of seeing the hurt in his eyes when he sees that his little boy isn't going to be a boxer or a football player but a dancer then seeing him again with the love and appreciation for his dancing son. Some things must be experienced and the deep hurt he carries about the death of his wife is one of those. Greatness all around.The one problem I did have with this movie is that it is first of all rated R. Why?!  If it weren't for the few and very effective uses of the 'F' word it would've gotten a PG13 rating. It so strongly needs the 'F' word yet it needs to be seen by a PG13 audience! This is a move that truly should be shown to middle schoolers all over the country showing that you should believe in yourself and no one else. Follow your dreams. Not only is this message not shoved down your throat as some other movies shamelessly do but it is done in such a way that you truly believe it. You want good things to happen and you get that but not spotless and clean. Nothing is done easily and there will always be someone who will try and stop your dreams from coming true.Another and the only other problem are the accents. The British definitely have a style of speaking all their own and it sometimes took a moment for all the dialogue to register. Sometimes I'd miss half a scene trying to decipher out exactly what was said. However the tones and emotions of most scenes were enough to let you know what was said. Everything didn't have to be spelt out but I can imagine that after I get this DVD I will sit down with the captions on just to know I didn't miss anything. This is one of the only complaints I have for another favorite of mine Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.Billy Elliot is a true ragtoriches story that unfolds amazingly well without pulling your heartstrings shamelessly as other movies love to do. I recommend this to all expect to be entertained with great plot twists as well as interesting characters wonderful dialogue and a story that can never grow old Follow your dreams.".

Since I am only young I haven't experienced much in my life while I am growing and I discovering new feelings and this movie has triggered oneit's become apart of me.Showing that he came from a poor and broken family and relished in his dream to become a ballet dancer and escape his born destiny to become a minerit's just unbelievable.Since I come from a wealthy family with so many opportunities around me it made me think about what I am taking for granted this movie has changed me since Friday night I have watched it about 6 times over and over again. I am now taking in my lifethis movie has showed me that whatever I am in or whoever I am I can do anything that want to be a true genius movie";

	schema:headline " Beautiful honest touching poignant a truly remarkable film";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is such a good film for a number of reasons. As a study of daring to be different in the fact of intractable tradition Billy Elliot is beautiful touching poignant and very honest. It does start off slowly but the film does have a lot of heart. Firstly I liked the story a young boy who wishes to ballet dance against the the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike it was a nice one and is likely to evoke some emotion. Stage director Stephen Daldry makes his feature debut here and succeeds pretty much brilliantly. Another strong asset was the writing while funny in places it is also quite touching. Then the music I loved hearing the music Tchaikovsky's timeless ballet Swan Lake such a melancholy yet enchanting and haunting score. But really the best asset of the film is the acting. Jamie Bell gives a really believable performance in the lead role while Gary Lewis is marvellous as his dad. The acting honours though go to the brilliant Julie Walters as Billy's chain smoking dance instructor that role especially proves what a fine actress Walters is. In conclusion I loved this film. 9.510 Bethany Cox".

I liked the feeling that I was able to recognise the world of Billy  it seemed familiar although I was brought up very conventionally.

	schema:headline " Good film";
	schema:reviewBody "To say that Billy Elliot is the best movie of 2000 is to damn it with faint praise since this year's crop is pretty uninspiring. Better to compare it to movies of the past few years and even then it would stand out. It is a phenomenally good film and perhaps even groundbreaking in its own way since it goes against the trend of quirky violent sexobsessed moviemaking that's become so popular recently. We've finally been given a film with a good almost mythic story complicated yet believable characters a masterful blend of emotional intensity and critical restraint and a series of dance scenes that are authentic inspiring and completely integral to the plot.No wonder critics have been falling over themselves in heaping praise on Billy Elliot. No wonder it's been holding its own in the box office despite being shown in a mere handful of theatres onequarter to one sixth as many as the big Hollywood blockbusters and despite its receiving hardly any promotion at the moment. Its success is being driven by word of mouth. And what is the word? Here is a movie that appeals to your heart head funny bone eyes and ears and last but not least your feet for the music and the movement will have you wanting to get up and dance. And it achieves all of this without insulting the intelligence. I sometimes wonder how the movie would have been done by Hollywood Billy would have been made a more pathetic figure the people in his life rendered more black and white characters would have either remained caricatures or made to develop in the blink of an eye. All such excesses are avoided in Billy Elliot where the characters develop in a totally believable way where Billy invites admiration instead of pity and where the silences looks and gestures all leave so much to the imagination. The dictum Less is more is clearly the guiding principle behind the film.The buzz for Billy has been so positive that people sometimes come away disappointed that their lives haven't been changed. So don't go expecting a knock 'em dead Hollywood rollercoaster. Billy Elliot is far more subtle though the emotional moments are all the more powerful because of that. You can however believe everything that has been said of Jamie Bell. He has an outstanding screen presence and carries the movie on his little shoulders with breathtaking naturalism. His dancing is honest and powerful and very masculine. He makes you forget that all the other actors give the performances of their careers in support. If the Oscar were awarded without consideration for age career box office draw or Hollywood clout Jamie and his movie would win hands down.".

The key is never to let go of your visions and dream big. And hey who in a million years would choose boxing or wrestling over dance? That's my question of the day.Dance to express. And that's all Billy does. Unleashing all the pain and negative energy by dancing Billy manages to impress everyone and finally fulfil his dream of becoming a real ballet dancer. Because dancers are athletes just like all the boxers and football players who dwell in that little mining town.The actors do very well especially Billy and his family. I'm not even going to tell about Julie Walters brilliant as ever. Jackie Elliot is so dominant and powerful i would certainly not dare to cross him as a father in this film. Boys don't do ballet! Arghhhh! All in all Billy Elliot is an excellent watch refreshing touching emotional sensible funny and has heart. I could go on for another hundred words. I feel like flying like a bird like electricity. That's all dancing is about. I really liked this movie. Big time.".

	schema:headline " Billy Elliot grounds the magic and passion of dancing into reality";
	schema:reviewBody "Dancing passion and familial struggle are all tied together in the highspirited Billy Elliot the little independent film that could in 2000 when such films were drastically under appreciated. Billy Elliot caught some attention however because it combines the dreamlike fancyfree spirit of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films along with the socialhistorical context of the '80s coal miner strike in England. Youthful optimism and social reality are at odds as seen through the young Billy a very talented Jamie Bell and the film doesn't let either one completely win out an admirable and unexpected quality for a story about a child.Preteen Billy lives in a small England town where his father Gary Lewis and brother Jamie Draven are picketing as part of the coal miner's strike so money is scarce. His father then becomes especially angry to find out Billy's been taking the money he was supposed to be using to pay for boxing lessons for ballet instruction instead. Despite his father's disapproval at his son taking up a girl's activity Billy meets regularly with Mrs. Wilkinson Julie Walters to prepare for the Royal Ballet School audition.The feature film debut for both writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry Billy Elliot is a real triumph of art imitating life. In a stroke of inspired creativity Billy dances when he feels it when he needs to express emotions of anger or excitement or when he was something to prove. Scenes are intercut often to show how Billy's drive to master ballet is indicative of a need for selfdiscovery family approval and learning how to handle life's challenges.With a soundtrack mixing '70s English rock band TRex with classical music and orchestration by 1999 Oscarwinning composer Stephen Warbeck Billy Elliot takes on this true independent spirit. It's far from the cheesy uplifting string music of an inspirational drama and more true to its historical context. Its much easier to sympathize with Billy's yearning for movement and his description of electricity in terms of how dance makes him feel with modern music.Billy's dancing outburst scenes give the film the feel of a dance musical movie ala the Fred Astaire era of Hollywood while his angry and emotionally withdrawn father as well as Billy's own fits of irrational anger ground the movie in the struggles that surround the Elliot family on a daily basis. The film is also not a social commentary on gender roles despite the conflict of Billy wanting to dance and his father wanting him to box. Billy takes an unexplained interest in dancing and doesn't exhibit any homosexual tendencies. This is about doing something you're passionate about not a child's struggle with his gender identity. Billy's crossdressing friend is there to remind us that one thing is not connected to the other but the film doesn't waste time overdramatizing this small conflict in a greater story.Billy Elliot is a special film one that perfectly fits the magic of finding one's passion within the troubles of real life and a cast that accurately reflects that vision from Daldry and Hall. It acknowledges that with good comes bad and with reward and hard work comes nervousness and discomfort. It's a unique outlook for a movie based about a young boy and his dreams.

It's a moving love story between a boy and his father a story field with emotions like despair anger sorrow and love. All inspired by an excellent choice of music. This is the first movie that made me login and rate it with a perfect 10!Tarig".

Breath taking photography scenery. Excellent cast specially by young Jamie Bell Billy and Gary Lewis Billy's father. Above all I enjoyed the story which becomes so alive due to a director's talent. It's a moving love story between a boy and his father a story field with emotions like despair anger sorrow and love. All inspired by an excellent choice of music. This is the first movie that made me login and rate it with a perfect 10!Tarig";

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Elliot is a heartwarming tale that brings out sadness anger and laughter captivating the viewer throughout the whole film. There is an obvious musical comedy and drama theme as seen in The Full Monty and East is East this makes it fun to watch and appealing to all ages. The poster used to promote the film is successful in setting the story targeting all audiences while making it seem interesting. Jamie Bell plays Billy a fiery emotional and possibly confused character who is still grieving over the tragic death of his mother. The director Stephen Daldry was definitely looking for a 'raw talent' to play this diverse and intriguing young boy seeing as Jamie had little acting experience and no dancing knowledge he must have seemed perfect to play the role. All of the actors live up to expectations especially Julie Walters who comes from the other end of the spectrum being very popular and with years of experience. She fits into her character's personality instantly because she plays many 'motherly' roles such as Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince and Aunt Betsy Trotwood in David Copperfield. Daldry seems to enjoy producing or directing films in the drama genre he directed The Reader and another short film Eight which features the same kind of journey Billy Elliot undertakes having to cope with the loss of a parent and discovering a new interest that changes their life. As well as this Billy is constantly in disagreement with his father who deals with his grief in an extremely aggressive way. He is also involved in the miner's strike that severely affected the family's income and interferes with Billy's aspirations. The saddening situations make the viewer sympathise with Billy and to a certain extent his family.Brian Tufano and his crew are very talented in deciding what camera angles and type of shots to use in certain scenes. For example being able to portray emotions through angles of the camera and make a scene look better on camera than it does when filming. This is also enhanced by editing techniques used by John Wilson and the editorial team. They provide a gentle transition from one scene to another without losing the storyline and in some parts the mood of particular scenes change so rapidly the viewer is taken aback. Without editing this film would not have been achieved to such a high standard and would not have been as successful in emphasising emotions and events. The colour also compliments the film and the period with nothing too bright and the interiors of the houses typical to the 1980's with patterned wallpaper and frosted glass. Stephen Warbeck uses T.Rex's catchy 'I Love to Boogie' to begin the film. Other artists such as Stephen Gately EagleEye Cherry The Clash The Jam and The Style Council also feature in the film. Most of the sounds are diegetic which enables the film to be more realistic to the audience however the few nondiegetic parts do not detract from the scenes. Set in the mid 1980's in a small estate with all families on a similar income it reminds the people aged between the ages of 30 and 40 who may have experienced the affects of the minor strike had on the community. While appealing to the older audience the story still interests teenagers especially the youths who enjoy dance. There is a comical aspect to this film for example when Billy is attempting a 'pirouette' in the bathroom to make sure his father doesn't find out about the ballet lessons but fails miserably falling in the bath and soaking himself. In addition Billy's friend Michael Caffrey played by Stuart Wells is discovered by Billy to be dressed up in his sister's clothes and putting makeup on obviously hinting at his homosexuality. Billy is encouraged to attend boxing sessions by his father who had been taught that he needed to be masculine to get somewhere in the world but this is something that Billy doesn't want to pursue. Julie Walters plays Mrs Wilkinson an average but troubled ballet teacher who persuades Billy to join a class something that Billy knew his father would be fuming about. Walter's character seems to be disappointed in herself for not being good enough to make a successful career in ballet so she tries to channel that frustration through to her female students that simply don't have that spark of talent. However Billy Elliot does show an indescribable something that she knows could take him to a future that she hoped for but only with the right training. Because of this she provides the role of a mother as well as a coach for Billy this automatically makes the viewer have a respected opinion of her. All the characters especially Julie Walters perfected the language and accent that is needed to professionalise the film. This would have proved difficult to some who have had no experience of speaking in a Northeastern accent because it is such a vital aspect. Jamie Bell was at an advantage because he came from a similar area and already had the blunt and sometimes comic accent. However it may be difficult for people who do not recognise this style of speech and they may not be able to relate to the film as well as people who are familiar with it. Despite some minor errors the film was loved by the public and praised by the critics. It shows that being a dancer is more difficult than first expected and is in some ways deemed to be similar to the physically exhausting mining job his father does. In my opinion Billy Elliot is an extremely successful film and many feel that it is 'the best British movie for years'.".

Although the bank manager and female tellers agree not to interfere with the robbery Sonny finds that there's actually nothing much to steal as most of the cash has been picked up for the day.

Sometimes the absurdities of life are so great they dwarf those included in any form of fiction. Without even trying to make that point this film captures that concept beautifully. 3 Its tone in relation to the homosexual theme is ahead of its time. In fact it's ahead of OUR time even in hardly making an issue out of it at all  it just IS. 4 It captures the climate of the 70s in a manner so sober you'll remember its unshowy yet authentic feel forever.5 Lumet's film brings to life the concept of the distorting lens of the media and how different groups with different agendas will turn an outlaw into a hero with far more efficiency than Oliver Stone's brash bloated childish and repetitive Natural Born Killers.6 Watching this film will illustrate to the younger generations exactly why Al Pacino has earned himself the legendary status he probably no longer would deserve with his performances of the last 10 years alone. SPOILERS Just watch those last ten minutes of him handcuffed against the bonnet of a car where he doesn't say a word but speaks volumes with his eyes and his soul just oozing out of every frame at the end of the movie you'll remember those eyes for as long as you live! 7 Watching this film you'll realise that firing a gunshot is a BIG DEAL in real life and that other films make too much use of gun fire in a highly contrived way. 8 All that tension deriving from pointed guns unable to fire a shot OR move away you realise Tarantino must've taken notes sometime along the way. 9 No genre is old or done too many times before if it's handled with this amount of freshness inspiration and talent. 10 Watching Dog Day Afternoon for the third time has filled me with the same amount of wonder at the power of truly inspired but unobtrusive filmmaking as it did first time round.".

	schema:headline " great character study and a masterful actors' showcase";
	schema:reviewBody "Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is one of the most highly enjoyable and wildly funny movies I've ever seen  smart sharp complex witty and often quotable dialogue and superbly acted. Al Pacino stars as Sonny an optimistic loser who decides to hold up a bank with his friend Sal played by the late great John Cazale to get money for his lover Leon's sexchange operation. The film is only worked around a few sequences and may seem overlong to some but it works excellently because it is held together by the fantastic acting. Al Pacino is astounding as Sonny and his work here even eclipses the excellent work he did as Michael Corleone in The Godfather and that's saying something because I adore that movie and his portrayal. Pacino has the facial tics and the energy and the wideeyed optimism down pat and his performance is extremely engaging and entertaining. Take for example his scene where he rouses up the crowd against the police by chanting Attica! Attica! Put your fing guns down! A lesser actor would have made it insipid but Pacino makes it oddly poignant and hilarious at the same time. And he was robbed of his Oscar for his role. The late John Cazale is also superb as Sal the dopeyeyed follower the quiet laidback calm to Pacino's maniacal energy. It's a less flashier role but Cazale still brings on all the laughs especially in his deadpan delivery of the line Sonny they're saying there are two homosexuals in here...I'm not a homosexual. Frank Pierson won an Oscar for his script for a reason  the dialogue is hilarious sharp and witty. Many of the lines in this movie are extremely quotable and you can check some of them out under memorable quotes. This is intelligent writing in the sense that you will laugh and be moved at the same time. Great movie! It belongs in your VHS or DVD collection. 1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon is one of the most highly enjoyable and wildly funny movies I've ever seen  smart sharp complex witty and often quotable dialogue and superbly acted. Al Pacino stars as Sonny an optimistic loser who decides to hold up a bank with his friend Sal played by the late great John Cazale to get money for his lover Leon's sexchange operation. The film is only worked around a few sequences and may seem overlong to some but it works excellently because it is held together by the fantastic acting. Al Pacino is astounding as Sonny and his work here even eclipses the excellent work he did as Michael Corleone in The Godfather and that's saying something because I adore that movie and his portrayal. Pacino has the facial tics and the energy and the wideeyed optimism down pat and his performance is extremely engaging and entertaining. Take for example his scene where he rouses up the crowd against the police by chanting Attica! Attica! Put your fing guns down! A lesser actor would have made it insipid but Pacino makes it oddly poignant and hilarious at the same time. And he was robbed of his Oscar for his role. The late John Cazale is also superb as Sal the dopeyeyed follower the quiet laidback calm to Pacino's maniacal energy. It's a less flashier role but Cazale still brings on all the laughs especially in his deadpan delivery of the line Sonny they're saying there are two homosexuals in here...I'm not a homosexual.

You can't help but sympathise with Sonny due to Pacino's terrific performance as the firsttime bank robber who's unprepared out of his depth and just trying to think up a way out. Even the audience begin to feel the effects of Stockholm Syndrome as Pacino's character gains our affections. The 'villain who's a nice guy at heart' could have been disastrously clich but Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of brilliance. Even Sal with his morbid disposition is magnetising as his childlike innocence shines through. Calzale was wonderfully cast as this awkward accomplice wordlessly following Sonny. A huge success combining the skills of Lumet with the talent of Pacino for the second time in Pacino's best role yet. A true story that's compelling and tragic but most of all tangible  and that's what makes it so powerful.".

There's this indescribable nervous energy to his performance that there's no way he'll leave u NOT feeling sorry for Sonny.Sadly for some reason this movie is kinda forgotten when discussing Al's greatest moviesperformances.

They could have been out in five minuted but things went terribly wrong. Instead of a robbery it became a hostage situation. And a media circus as well.From the first second you will be totally in the movie. Afterwards I wanted to write my review and I was not able to remember how the music was if there was any. It says something about how much the movie grabs you. The first part is very funny I laughed a lot of times. The second part is more a drama and a thriller. Great director Sidney Lumet creates a certain atmosphere for the movie that is just right. Pacino in one of his best performances is surrounded by a great supporting cast. He was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win it. He lost it to a guy named Jack Nicholson in a movie called 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. The chances were probably fiftyfifty and the Oscar went to the better movie I have to admit that. Still one of the best performances I have ever seen. With any other actor this movie was a nice one with him it is a great one.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose. Forget the holdbacks of Serpico here we get a glimpse into the real Al the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters.There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character and here he's the character and it works splendidly. Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director which has been happening a lot lately although fortunately his comparison De Niro has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of olderage filmmaking.This is based on a true story like Serpico only it's better and more involving. It connects with the audience more than Serpico because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy. The clichs are gone and the originality creeps in early on. Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in. It's more touching than it seems at first.Pacino is Sonny Wortzik a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his wife's operation. The wife is actually Leon Shermer Chris Sarandon who was Oscarnominated for this his first role in a mainstream film Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the money for a sex operation.The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest bad guys once described as a quick in and out but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn. It's like Denzel's movie only better and more original. Oh and true. This one actually happened and we can tell.Sonny's partner in crime Sal John Cazale is worried that he'll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside. His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience. Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation. His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's.Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent manic and energetic. He'd display this same talent in Scarface again eight years later only he would be bashed by the critics for going overthetop. Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence just like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ will soon become a wellknown classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made.There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana's Last Stand in Scarface or the Baptism Scene in The Godfather which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his wife carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby. Watch Pacino delve into character here and you're immediately hooked. We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real and that's why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time.Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men? No. This is Hollywood showing us a true story regardless of the homosexuality. Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us not the background of its characters.Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come. Prince Humperdink from The Princess Bride is equally memorable but less realistic. Here he seems more real which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for Bride. We don't like real characters in fantasy tales do we?Lumet who ruined Serpico with his bad editing outofplace music clichd dialogueevents and unnecessary scenes directs Dog Day Afternoon with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care. This isn't exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close.".

	schema:reviewBody "Al Pacino has portrayed some memorable characters in some classic movies like 'Serpico' 'Scent of a Woman' 'Donnie Brasco' and the three 'Godfather' Films. 'Dog Day Afternoon' and Sonny Wortzik belong high on that list.As the movie opens Sonny and his twoman gang are nervously waiting outside a Brooklyn bank which they intend to rob. Sonny has a plan all worked out but after the robbery begins it quickly unravels. Not the least dismaying development is that the bank is almost out of cash. Shortly after this revelation police begin to arrive in numbers that would be able to lay siege to a small country Wyoming maybe? This sets up a hostage situation that lasts the afternoon and late into the night.One might think this setting might make things a little claustrophobic but director Sidney Lumet has handled this problem before witness his film 'Twelve Angry Men.' The goingson in the bank itself are fascinating as the moods and relationships of the hostages and their captors develop and change over the course of the long day. Out on the street the crime scene immediately turns into a circus with thousands of onlookers straining at police lines news media doing everything they can to get close to the story and a new busload of police arriving every few minutes.Great performances are all over the place here. This is a tourdeforce for Pacino even by his standards as the bungling crook who has instantly become the biggest media star in the city. Sonny may have blown the first role but he shines in the second. One of Pacino's Godfather brothers John Cazale is excellent is the lessflashy role as Sonny's partner Sal definitely not the brains of this operation. Events are soon beyond Sal's comprehension and his subtle performance is wonderful. Charles Durning is super as police lieutenant Moretti who works as hard as he can to keep the situation from spinning totally out of control. He's juggling desperate fugitives in the bank a crowd growing crazier and crazier aggressive newspeople and some of his own cops who are ready to end this thing with a bang. When the FBI shows up the agent in charge James Broderick doesn't even say hello to Moretti. He cooly assesses the situation and decides their plan of action and from that moment on there is a grim air of fatalism hanging over Sonny and Sal.There are more twists and turns we won't go into here. This is a great work by Pacino Lumet and most of the other actors in the film. I loved it.".

Troubled insecure confused Sonny makes for a lousy bank robber. And yet when he steps from the relative safety of the bank building and into the street before a hundred waiting armed police he changes completely. He becomes a strong proud prowling voice of the working class goading the police riling the gathered crowd. In referencing the prison massacre at Attica in 1971 he becomes a voice for the urban poor and it is a powerful and raging voice that contains the potential for victory and success even when you know it is doomed.An incredibly powerful work very much of its time and all the better for it. The 1970's was a decade when major studios hired actors for their talent not their looks or teen appeal. When major studios hired writers proud to take on sensitive political and social issues. When major studios financially backed and strongly promoted movies that mattered and said something. Dog Day Afternoon is the product of that system and as such could never be made today.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was so freshening and attractive to see His Majesty Mr. Al Pacino in this breathtaking movie of 1970s. The first thing that a discerning eye would notice throughout the film is the undying uniqueness of Pacino's originality. This was just another movie destined to reassuring viewers of Al's status of an icon. The movie itself is endearing and entertaining. Though the movie is supposed to appear like a bank robbing and in a sense it is but deep in the heart robbing is simply a way to achieve a totally different goal of course other than money! It is about affection and mutual caring. It's about what situations a person is ready to embark into in order to show how much he cares for another one. And I guess this is the point of the whole movie which is stylistically decorated with dozes of sarcasm and pleasantry with sporadic undertones of bravery. The characters are all innocent which innocence seems to relate them to each other. What I deem as very courageous here are the thematic elements homosexuality. I guess the time when the movie was made the society had still been ruled by prejudiced mentalities that could really ruin this innocuous piece of art. For this I praise the very daring Sidney Lumet one of my favorite directors. 1010".

Perhaps the most realistic character ever portrayed on film.Al Pacino as usual delivers a great performance as was nominated for an Academy Award playing the role of Sonny. This is a very entertaining film filled with humor social issues and moral issues definitely a mustwatch.".

Two dimwitted bank robbers Oscarnominated Al Pacino and the late John Cazale decide to rob a New York City bank on a summer day in the early1970s. The robbery is to be cutanddry but nothing goes as planned. Instead of getting away with a load of money there is only a miniscule amount as the money was transported away earlier in the day. As Pacino tries to burn bank records a small fire is noticed outside the bank and total chaos ensues. Now the bank is surrounded by the police and the FBI. Charles Durning and James Broderick are among the officials outside the bank as they attempt to negotiate with Pacino to get the bank's employees out safely. It is learned that Pacino is involved in a homosexual relationship with Chris Sarandon Oscarnominated and that his main goal was to steal his share of the money to get Sarandon a sexchange operation. The nervous Cazale is more worried that the media will think he is homosexual than anything else. The film is dark in many ways very lighthearted and funny in other ways but always dramatic and tense. As the clock ticks the realization occurs that this will not end well for the robbers. Sidney Lumet's Oscarnominated direction is sharp throughout. Based on actual events Dog Day Afternoon is another great winner from the 1970s Hollywood's second Golden Age. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "What transfixes me throughout every scene of this sinewy offbeat film is the extraordinarily pragmatic realism of the hurtles Sonny and Sal confront inside the bank. Not even twenty minutes into the film we find we're already seeing things absolutely no other crime film has ever included that are astonishing in their dramatic persuasiveness. The head teller and the bank manager picking apart Sonny's plan with him. One clerk's husband calls and asks what time the robbers will be through so he knows if he has to cook for himself or not. While ordering the bank manager to help him block the back entrance by moving a big desk Sonny asks offhand why he'd hire a diabetic as a guard and is told in ordinary persontoperson terms what a guard's salary is and why poor old Howard has that job.And when does Mulvaney the bank manager played by captivating unknown character actor Sully Boyar tell hostagetaker he'd like to see his family again but if someone must be taken take him? When he's helping his captor move a big desk to block the back. They sound like regular working urbanites so caught up in the daily grind of city life that they might as well be making small talk in an elevator. Later the phone rings Sonny picks up it's a sicko telling him to kill 'em all. Sonny hangs up after four seconds moving on. The female tellers sit and sweat while giggling about the same silly thingsHe said the fword. Well I'm a Christian and my ears are not garbage cans.in the thick of a hostage situation and a media circus. Poignant real.Every nuance of Pacino's performance is incredibly realistic. He practically possesses the audience as we can begin to expect certain things from him and care about him because he's played by an actor who completely subsists as him. At points when characters speak of him offscreen speaking of things that we are surprised to hear about him that take us aback and color his image Pacino has prepared the size for those turning points to fit in. His improvised scenes are exceptional as well and are in fact some of the most riveting nailbitingly intense scenes in the entire film. In such scenes he is matched by the great actor Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon's becoming fulfillment of his role.Indeed this is by far Durning's most riveting performance. He works so well here because in shouting matches with Sonny he looks and sounds entirely his age not a movie character. He's fat middleaged tired just as surprised as everybody else. He runs short of breath trying desperately to keep up with the pressure cooking higher all around him. As Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti Durning epitomizes the thankless job of a police officer more candidly and perfectly than any other movie cop I've ever seen. One of this stunning succession of brilliant scenes is the first time Sonny emerges to talk facetoface with Moretti in the street which begins with a protracted pindrop silence and slowly steadily invisibly culminates in deafening earsplitting chaos.Lumet opens the film with a montage of city scenes in NYC with a good gettingupinthe morning song like Elton John's Amoreena and with the same indifference ends up on Sonny Sal and their friend waiting outside a bank in a car an image that just happens to continue. This is a great way to demonstrate the itcouldhappenanywhereness. Lumet's overall direction of the film is beautiful indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s. The climactic final ten minutes are ruthless in their steadily unraveling almost unbearably intense tragedy. It's not only one of the most effective uses of sound to create drama I've ever seen but everything concludes exactly as it would in reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "We've seen this story before but then again maybe not. This is the attitude that director Sidney Lumet takes as he did with films like 12 Angry Men and Serpico the later also starring Al Pacino with Dog Day Afternoon. Bank robbery films are a staple in cinema since The Great Train Robbery filmed in 1903. However this story not even saying based on a true story just saying 'this is a true story' is enough is set in 1972 and filmed a couple of years later at a time when attitudes in society were changing as was storytelling. Lumet here could get away with things he couldn't get away with if he tried this in the 50's with unapologetically homosexual but truthful is the key characters one of them the lead character surprises that add to the unconventionality of the style of the film and an ending that will keep you guessing. Lumet did a lot of good with this movie and in a small way some not so good people would look at many bankrobbery pictures that would come after this and size them up to this as it was almost transparently influential the 'Attica Attica' tirade is something a child knows years before he actually sees the film.But its the honesty in the truth of the story and problems of the main characters and in fact the lead up to the robbery and the unsuccessful robbery has truth out of it. It is manipulative in a sense as it is so truthful artifice is almost excluded entirely from the picture. Take when Sonny Pacino and Sal John Cazale first whip out their guns in the bank. Their friend can't take it and wants out. This is a great moment and the film has them scattered about. In some ways these great parts and scenes make up for the fact that beneath it all is a story that we have seen too many times the robbers faced with intense media attention wanting a plane to take the hostages etc or maybe not maybe one has to put the film into context of the period. But a scene for another example when Sonny talks to his 'friend' on the phone. This is one of those moments where Pacino is of course as always 'Pacino' but also totally immersed in the character and the situation. Lumet lets this play for painfully real results.Dog Day Afternoon is one of Lumet's grittiest successes as he takes the city he's made most of his films in New York and gives it the right tone inside the bank and out for this story of eventuality to unfold. The opening montage with an Elton John song in the background really has little relevance to the rest of the film except to set up mood and style and it is a wonderful style interestingly the rest of the film aside from this opening is without music another touch of the gripping realism. In a way as I mentioned its almost TOO intense and too spectacular in the power that it has. This is Al Pacino in his prime after all off the heels of Serpico and The Godfather films with his Sonny loaded with vigor and ambition and delusions of grandeur. John Cazale's Sal by the way is equally convincing in his own right bringing a level of sanity to some of Sonny's overthetop ideas. This film and its actors and characters and Dede Allen editing is almost a blueprint for how many other films that would come after this would take. One almost wonders what's the point of all of it but when it makes its moments to shine its dynamite.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming from a school of thought who believe that Al Pacino is the god of acting I began watching Dog Day Afternoon with a lot of expectations. Having now seen it 25 times And counting I must say that this movie has surpassed my expectation every time I've seen it. It has been my all time favorite movie for some time now.Dog Day Afternoon is a plot driven movie with superb characterization  is based on a real life story. It is essentially about two Vietnam War veterans Sonny Wortzik Al Pacino  Sal John Cazale who have a lot of antiestablishment feeling within them. They disagree with the idea of working hard for a meager amount of money. Sonny is a bisexual who has a relationship outside his marriage  wants money for the sex change operation of his boyfriend. Both of them decide to rob New York bank in broad day light along with another colleague who backs out at the last moment. The bank robbery goes haywire as their haphazard ways to deal with the situation does not hold them in good stead. To start with the bank is short of cash. The bank employees are also difficult to deal with. When the city police come to know about the robbery they station themselves outside the bank leading to a hostage situation. The movie unfolds into a negotiation between Sonny and the cops  then between Sonny  FBI which is followed by a rescue operation. Sonny meanwhile takes time out to slam the media which was following this operation the cops  the whole establishment in general. He distributes some of the stolen money to the public around him creates a scene around the bank and becomes a superstar of sorts for one day.Sonny is sharp  takes charge of the negotiations. He surprisingly gets along well with most of the hostages who also show some sympathy for him A bit of Stockholm syndrome. Sal on the other hand is impassive confused  does not take charge of the situation. The chemistry between Sonny  Sal is one of the highlights of the movie. However the biggest USP of the movie is Al Pacino's performance. It was clearly his best acting performance according to me. The 'Attica!!' scene as well as the scene where Sonny has a conversation with his wife on the phone were phenomenal displays of his acting prowess. The whole Attica sequence makes me sit on the edge of my seat every time I watch this movie. John Cazale has also given a great performance. The movie is fast paced  eventful. Some of the scenes with the hostage The bathroom scene for example however are slightly overdramatic. Finally Sidney Lumet has done a wonderful job as a director in terms of characterization  to make the whole situation come alive. He evolved as a director from his last movie which was Serpico.In a nutshell I would say that it is one of the great movies of all time. Anyone who calls himself a movie buff this movie is a must watch for him.".

There was not much action and Pacino and the other robber were both good actors but it was a bit over the top and there wasn't much interesting action in this. I kind of knew everything that was going to happen so it just seemed predictable that way. I guess maybe it is possible that people long ago told me the best parts of the movie and I forgot about it but knew it was going to happen once I started watching the movie. The scene where they leave the bank is pretty cool with some good tension but other than that I was just really bored most of the time very disappointing to me because I was expecting such a great movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brooklyn New York. Sonny Sal and another man walk into the bank and hold it up.  Seconds into the job the third man changes his mind and leaves. The job starts to go wrong when Sonny discovers that the truck he was told was dropping off money was actually picking it up meaning the vault is nearly empty.  Things get worse when the police arrive outside and trap the two inside with a handful of hostages.  As Sonny and Sal try to keep control a circus breaks out on the street with the police the public and the media all involved.I have seen this film several times but it has been a few years since I last had the chance to see it.  I watched it again today with the memory of it being good but not really as truly great as many seem to think it is.  The plot is all the more fascinated for it being true but it is not an easy subject to bring to the screen.  While morally most people can accept robbers in films as characters to support it is a bigger step to accept the sexualities and complexities of these characters and to get behind them. However the film actually manages to make this quite moving and difficult  not only do we feel for Sonny but the film is fair to him and more impressively Leon. It would have been easy to turn this relationship into a joke but the script allows it to be done with sensitivity.  The rest of the film captures the sense of circus and media feeding frenzy well as well as being quite tense and enjoyable to watch.The film's strength is it's performances and in particular Pacino in a performance that is both showy and understated at different times.  He is a real person and it is to his credit that no matter the revelations about Sonny he never loses the audience.  Cazale is good here too but in a different way  a simple sympathetic character.  His hit rate is amazing when you think that he was only ever in a handful of films and they were all pretty amazing but it's hard to tell how good an actor he was really. Durning is good in support and the rest of the cast are pretty good but it is Pacino's film and he manages well with the shouting the silence and the complexities of his characters.Overall this is not one of the best films ever made but it is certainly a very good telling of this true story.  The film deals very well with both the tension of the situation but also the underlying stories and characters  even more surprising for the period it was made in it makes a very balanced presentation of the homosexual characters.  The direction is very good and the performances are all good but it is Pacino's film and he does very well with it.".

I also liked Charles Durning who did a fine job as the hostage negotiator.  Sidney Lumet is a talented director who specializes in intense dramas and is good at stirring up the atmosphere for moments of intrigue.The film starts out very engaging with a premise that locks you in.  The opening scenes are handled really well.  I like how we get to know the characters in the bank on an almostintimate level.  But the film stretches. It stretches itself a little too long with scenes that could've been considered for the cutting room floor.  The intensity just seems to dampen as the film passes the halfway mark.  The intrigue is lost and we're watching soapy interactions between Sonny and his gay lover as well as his angry wife.  The climactic scene is a little disappointing and could've been more exciting.  I wouldn't rate Dog Day Afternoon as one of Lumet's bestthough it does contain one of Pacino's best performances.  There are some memorable moments but the filmas a wholeis lessthanmemorable.My score  6 out of 10".

It's actually a very gripping tale and filmed just beautifully and casted even better. Al Pacino of course is great and even though he does walk a little close to the overacting line a line he crosses throughout his entire career to some degree he just stays safe here.Charles Durning was excellent as the head cop trying to keep things cool and the scene with him and Pacino simply bickering back and forth is priceless. When the FBI take over at one point he pretty much disappears for the rest of the movie and it's very noticeable.This was actually filmed just blocks from where I grew up in Brooklyn so that's another reason I always wanted to see it. I'm shocked this hasn't been on the list for potential remakes another decent movie ready to be ruined by today's Hollywood.".

The only warning I would give parents is the profanity gets a little rough at times especially with Charles Durning the negotiating cop who uses the Lord's name in vain about every other sentence. All the other characters were definitely interesting especially Pacino's partner Sal John Cazale. Sal doesn't have to say much just the looks on his face say a lot. The story certainly is a memorable one and a big hit when it came out.Notes The character  Sheldon is played by James Broderick the father of Matthew Broderick.

The writing is brilliant and the characters are complex and so real. Mind you this was based on a true story. And of course you won't find a comment where it DOESN'T talk about how brilliant Al Pacion was in this.  True this is probably his best role out there and one of the best in history.

I came to the film anticipating it was going to be good but expecting it to be good as a hostage siege thriller or a heist caper or maybe a typically gritty 70s crime drama. It isn't any of those things. In fact it's hard to categorise Dog Day Afternoon at all because it so skilfully fuses a vast array of conventions and themes resulting in a film that is endlessly watchable and hugely rewarding. If it sounds like I'm using a lot of superlatives here that's because I am Dog Day Afternoon is one of the great films of American cinema. As great as Lumet's masterpiece Twelve Angry Men I hear you ask? I'd have to say yes both films pretty much equal each other in their brilliance.On a hot August afternoon a trio of men enter the First Savings Bank in Brooklyn and proceed to rob the place at gunpoint. During the early moments of the heist young Stevie Gary Springer loses his nerve and bails out leaving Sonny Al Pacino and Sal John Cazale to continue with their audacious raid. However what should have been a lightningfast robbery rapidly descends into a catalogue of errors. Firstly the hapless robbers learn that there is almost no money in the bank as everything in the vault has already been collected. Then Sonny attempts to burn some of the bank's paperwork only for the smoke to raise suspicions in the neighbouring businesses and it isn't long before the police arrive. Before they know it Sonny and Sal are surrounded by hundreds of heavily armed police officers and their plight looks utterly hopeless. With a handful of oddball bank staff as hostages the robbers attempt to negotiate with Det. Sgt Moretti Charles Durning. As the evening wears on more and more curious onlookers come along to watch the event as it unfolds many of them chanting their support for Sonny and Sal especially when it becomes clear that Sonny only ever wanted the money to pay for his gay lover's sex change operation. What was meant to be a straightforward crime suddenly becomes a media circus and the two men at the centre of it are swept helplessly towards their fate.Dog Day Afternoon is impressive on so many levels but probably best of all is the acting. Pacino is mesmerising as Sonny. His semiimprovisational dialogue his jittery body language and those incredibly expressive eyes combine to create a remarkable screen character. In fact throughout the entire film the characterisation is richly detailed and wholly believable and all the actors come off exceptionally well. Lumet gets across the immediacy of the situation brilliantly with moments of tension despair folly bravado and even some absurdist humour. It has a relatively thin plot when you stop to think about it but very early on in Dog Day Afternoon the importance of the story is sacrificed in favour of detail and character and beautifully understated social commentary. The whole film is a joy to watch  edgy and exciting filmmaking at its finest. In a decade that saw some truly amazing films here's one that can hold its place with the best of them.".

	schema:headline " The greatest action sequel masterpiece of all time!";
	schema:reviewBody "Magnum Force 1973 is the greatest action sequel of all time! Dirty Harry and Magnum Force are my two best favorite sequels of all time. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I always always enjoy those two movies so much from Clint Eastwood I grew up watching those two movie and they are the best action movies of all time! I just kept watching them. My second best favorite action flick of all time! The movie had a good edition  good actors in this and Clint was his usual bad ass self. Hal Holbrook is a great villain in this. The flick is proof sequels can be damn fine films and not redundant. It is my favorite entry's of the series and no doubt one of the greats action flicks of the 70's! Magnum Force has...everything. Immortal perfection personified. Hal Holbrook does a marvelous job as do the three rookies who later became famous on their own. Robert Urich and David Soul wellperformed the berserk cops. I do believe that Harry crosses the line and obviously so do those berserk cops but unlike them he never kills innocent bystanders and women.Magnum Force is old school 70's action flick with 'acting' and 'actors...none CGI or special effects in it. It is not that I hate CGI or special effects ...it's just so nice to watch the way it was done. Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood goes up against rogue cops here and he never waivers on his 'justice'. Great pistol shooting scenes and very well done film. Eastwood rocks. I forgot to mention Dirty Harry series are more similar to Charles Bronson's Death wish series. In my opinion I enjoy Dirty Harry Series much better than any other action movies. So the film is set when a mysterious wave of killings sweeps the Mafia underworld it's Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan who answers with Magnum Force. Despite a demotion by Lt. Neil Briggs for his questionable methods Harry will stop at nothing to find the killers. A rouge traffic cops are killing criminals who have escaped from court they killing them brutally and they don't care if they kill an innocent person or not. Those cops are different from Scorpio from previous movie and they are more vicious than psycho sniper Scorpio. A tough hardcore and explosive actionthriller that gets the job done. It's sharply written and wellconstructed action film that has lots of flavor. Clint Eastwood is in top form as Dirty Harry showing that truly no cop series can stand next to his classic character or these films. Compared to the original this was a much better movie The main story and characters were more interesting the writing was less uneven and the overall pacing was better. It was still quite dated but a lot easier to take than the original. And once again I enjoyed the retroness of it. Mr. Eastwood's unshakable coolas he dismantles a bomb or refuses a local anesthetic for seven stitches. In the film Harry is certainly not a dictator. The law is. The law decides who lives and who dies. Nor does Harry glorify the state or in this case the system. He hates the systemthe liberal legal system that has made a mess of things and Harry's the janitor who must clean it up which makes sense considering his name derives from always getting the dirty jobs. Well somebody's got to do it. Ironically he sometimes makes a mess of his own but delivers efficient results in the end. In Magnum Force there's some new enforcers in town and they ride dark horses. If ever a fascistic label could be applied it's on them. Magnum Force is a 1973 American action film and the second to feature Clint Eastwood as maverick cop Harry Callahan after the 1971 film Dirty Harry. Ted Post who also directed Eastwood in the television series Rawhide and the feature film Hang 'Em High directed the film the second in the Dirty Harry series.I love this movie to death it is my favorite best sequel of all time Just like Terminator the first two movies I love those two sequels to death! This movie deserves 10 it is almost so good as Dirty Harry the only problem I have with the film is it 2 hrs. long it could have been shorter. All the actors did a great job acting and the story was amazing. I have enjoy this movie to death and I always will! Throughout there's a stress on dear old hubris Harry earnestly repeats that a man's got to know his limitations. Thus it's reasoned that the killings he commits are justified  There's nothing wrong with shooting as long as the right people get shot  but murderers do have to be discriminating. The action scenes are fabulous and the fantastic the gun play is terrific you will sea a lot of hand gun use and they are used well.".

Changing the plot but not the style is good formula in movies rather than playing out what was already done in the original which is why so many sequels fail. Magnum Force is my second favorite film by Eastwood after High Plains Drifter. Harry still likes to do things his way although rather than focusing his energy on the bad guys he's focused on some crooked cops in his own department! Follows in the original's footsteps with lots of great views of San Francisco My Birthplace! I always feel at home when watching this movie. This is another film that is played a lot on TV because its so good on it's own. Felton Perry does a good job as Harry's partner comparable to Reni Santoni in the original. Didn't like any of the sequels that followed this movie with the exception of Sudden Impact. Magnum Force is a film that rates highly as watchable again  again.".

This is another film that is played a lot on TV because its so good on it's own. Felton Perry does a good job as Harry's partner comparable to Reni Santoni in the original. Didn't like any of the sequels that followed this movie with the exception of Sudden Impact. Magnum Force is a film that rates highly as watchable again  again.";

Magnum Force 1973 is not as near as effective or powerful as the first and original film but this sequel is watchable and has its merits too. Harry is now investigating strange killings of criminals pimps dirty politicians and others so the killer is killing bad guys this time. Harry starts to investigate the cases and he has his doubts about all this. Then the truth is revealed and also unfortunately spoilt in most of the reviews and comments I've read.Harry has again his usual opponents mostly his colleagues and superiors who don't accept his tough style. Harry wants to do justice but by using his own ways and moral. If talking doesn't help then the magnum .44 will. I don't think this or the first film are fascist but realistic and honest and extremely bleak depictions of world and society which is more or less collapsing because of its inhabitants. This film manages still to tell something about that but the next sequel The Enforcer is pretty lame in comparison.Magnum Force has pretty fat plot and many different characters and sub plots without being too confusing. Towards the end the film becomes perhaps too predictable and unbelievable and I think the ending should have needed little tightening. Now it is little unnecessary shoot outs and nothing else. The film runs two hours which is the longest running time in the series but still this manages to interest and even surprise but if they had finished the film some 20 minutest earlier this would be even more noteworthy film. Now it has nothing too important to offer during its finale and so the finale becomes little unnecessary in my opinion.As an action film this is pretty exciting and shot with talent. The action scenes are often fast and full of gunpowder and fire so director Post can surely direct with skill. The film is pretty brutal and violent at times and this again shows the fact that films this gritty and violent are not made in Hollywood nowadays at least not too often. Magnum Force is much more easier and positive film than its predecessor and that's why it hasn't got so many things to offer and give. This is pure action film where the first film was also many other things too like social commentary and talking about things many would not want to talk about. Magnum Force gets 710 but fortunately still has its positive things and even little bit of the power that made Dirty Harry so immortal.".

Steve McQueen also managed the same with his classic Bullitt and Dirty Harry uses essentially the same formula but it does it well with its own unique spin and style.

	schema:headline " Magnum force will make your day!";
	schema:reviewBody "If you were to ask film goer's which character or movie they would associate with Clint Eastwood it would probably be his portrayal of the nononsense crime buster inspector Harry Callahan. Of course Eastwood had done some very popular movies prior to this including his spaghetti westerns in the 1960's and even after the Harry Callahan run he has gone on to do some well acclaimed films in front of as well as behind the camera. It's worth mentioning this because despite being well into his seventies he's still in demand as actor and director which is a testament to his movie making abilities and longevity that spans fifty years! All in all an impressive achievement. Be that as it may when you play the character of Harry Callahan five times over an 18 year period it's hard for fans not to associate him with the part.MAGNUM FORCE might actually be a tad better than DIRTY HARRY as well as being the best of the sequels. Not only do we learn a bit more about Inspector Callahan but also it's a more interesting and compelling story as well as having a better all round cast. Well at least it seems that way as time has gone by because the supporting cast of David Soul Tim Matheson and Robert Urich who play the easygoing traffic cops would go on to be well known stars in their own right through the 70's 80's 90's and 2000's. In addition they are backed up by the brilliant Hal Holbrook playing the impatient and easily irritated lieutenant Briggs.Tough street wise cops were not a new thing to Hollywood but because of the civil rights movements in the 1960's and 70's there were a lot of new rules that the police had to adhere to and their methods came under greater judicial scrutiny. If there was a whiff of wrong doing the judge would instruct that critical testimony should be dismissed and vital evidence rendered inadmissible thus making the DA's prosecution impossible and an acquittal or a dismissal of a case a certainty. They had rights! As a consequence it seemed that the courts became a sanctuary or a get out of jail card for the criminals! Also rather than having some dopey public defender the criminals gained access to the new breed of wiseguy smarmy lawyers who would use all forms of court room trickery to gain acquittals for their clients. Whether it was organized crime pimps murderers rapists and muggers the system seemed to work in their favor.Also politicians became sensitive to the minority communities complaints of police strong armed tactics leaned on local police forces to ease off. All this coincided with an explosion of violent crime in the early 1970's where the public particularly in the big cities became anxious and frustrated at this. Therefore movies such as DIRTY HARRY where Harry used his own methods to get his man and DEATH WISH which encouraged the public to fight back using the same methods as the hoods all captured the public imagination. In the follow up MAGNUM FORCE explored the possibility of vigilante cops acting as judge jury and executioner because the system seemed not to be working.Inspector Callahan is not impressed by these new methods and shrugs off pressure from above. The beginning of the movie sets the tone from his indifference towards the gunned down thugs as well as the way he tackled the hijacked plane only demonstrated the way he wanted to do his job. When it appears that some one is trying to put the courts out of business as the body bags that are piling up in the cities morgue are San Francisco's dregs of the earth Callahan has the unenviable task of finding out who is responsible for this? Harry at first thinks that it is some rouge cop acting out of impulse who might be the one responsible for these revenge killings but as things progress it appears that this is not just a random or a spur of the moment act.Callahan becomes suspicious towards a well disciplined team of rookie cops who he knows are expert marksman. It appears that they are a highly motivated and are a product of a well organized shadow police force who have support much higher up the chain of command. Although Callahan has no empathy towards the people who are being killed and to a large extent understands why somebody might carry out such a deed he is much happier catching them in the act and blowing them away in a shoot out. He is uneasy at the blatant execution style of these killings and is way beyond what he thinks is right! As his investigation unfolds he too becomes a target and when his partner gets rubbed out it seems that he may have crossed more than just the mayor and the chief of police! Now with nobody watching his back can he get to the bottom of this before he becomes a victim and more importantly who can he trust?There are obvious plot holes but it is more than compensated by great cinema photography with great shots of San Francisco shoot outs an easy going back ground score and and of course a very smooth Clint Eastwood to boot. The sparing between Briggs and Callahan is entertaining and produces some great dialog it's well worth a watch and I'd highly recommend this to 70's movie buffs and Clint Eastwood fans!.".

By far the best of the Dirty Harry movies with Clint Eastwood never better in his role as Dirty Harry Callahan in the most actionpacked and exciting Dirty Harry film ever made. Eastwood is much freer and less constraint then he was in the first Dirty Harry film.

Post keep things moving when it comes to keeping the tempo of the action in the movie up and the talking and explaining down by Harry and his fellow police officers and friends as to why Harry is called Dirty Harry every ten minutes in the film like in the first Dirty Harry movie. Great ending sequence at the San Francisco Navy Yard with Harry taking care of business by doing in the bad guys and making the city safe again until the next Dirty Harry film comes blazing along.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's all about the man his politics and his methods. Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood is a tough nononsense cop. In this second Dirty Harry movie Callahan is on the trail of a ruthless vigilante gang. The story starts off well enough with a fair amount of suspense. As the plot moves along however it becomes less tight and more drawn out. Suspense fizzles. And the puzzle solution is revealed too soon.The film conveys an angry tone especially directed at the American court system. The idea is that the law doesn't really protect innocent people. So we need loners like Dirty Harry to hunt down the bad guys. The film glorifies guns a symbol of rough justice. As such Harry is very much a modern representative of the Old West cowboy gunslinger. Right is right wrong is wrong there's no inbetween. I hate that overly simplistic mentality.Color cinematography is fine there's some good overhead camera shots. Many scenes take place on city streets. Way too much time is spent on car chases. Acting is acceptable. I especially liked the performance of the always reliable Hal Holbrook.The original Dirty Harry was quite suspenseful. By contrast Magnum Force is much less so. Still it's not a bad movie if you don't mind lots of car chases and the sounds of screeching tires and if you adhere to a philosophy that a lone toughguy cop can protect us with the help of his trusty 44Magnum the most powerful handgun in the world.".

In this second Dirty Harry movie Callahan is on the trail of a ruthless vigilante gang. The story starts off well enough with a fair amount of suspense.

	schema:headline " Eastwood Holbrook save day in trashy followup";
	schema:reviewBody "'Dirty Harry' was a twopronged success for Clint Eastwood as the 1971 thriller broke new ground in police films and earned over 28 million at the box office. With this good fortune however came backlash from writers such as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert who judged the movie as 'fascist' and an endorsement of police brutality. The first Dirty Harry sequel 1973's 'Magnum Force' was a direct response to these claims and hoped to build on Harry's alreadysolid marketing power.'Magnum Force' opens at City Hall in San Francisco where mobster Carmine Ricca Richard Devon has been acquitted of killing a union leader and his entire family. Ricca is free on a technicality and drawing protests from those already sick of loopholes in the American justice system. When returning home from the trial Ricca and his legal team are pulled over by a sunglasswearing motorcycle cop who shoots dead all four men.San Francisco's felons are dying in mysterious hits and the police have almost no clues. Inspector Harry Callahan Eastwood who has been transferred from the homicide division and worked recent months on stakeout is ordered to investigate. The assignment comes unwillingly from Lieutenant Briggs Hal Holbrook a bythebook administrator who is disgusted with Callahan's tactics. Callahan soon realizes that four motorcycle cops David Soul Tim Matheson Kip Niven and Robert Urich are members of a suborganization called Magnum Force that aims to wipe out crime in San Francisco regardless of the cost to human life. Harry who is seen as a prototype by Magnum Force refuses to support it he believes that any such group would endanger honest citizens rather than protect them.One can't expect 'Magnum Force' to rival its predecessor but this followup is still a major disappointment. The writing direction and technical work of 'Magnum Force' simply don't compare to Don Siegel's original film. Magnum Force's screenplay by John Milius and Michael Cimino does not have the tight plotting or razorsharp dialogue that makes 'Dirty Harry' special. The plot is littered with conveniences such as Callahan eating at an airport snack bar when a hijacking occurs and Harry not being able to start a motorbike which allows David Soul to catch up with him and engage in a chase. Also featured are an unnecessary love interest played by Adele Yoshioka and onedimensional characters who only exist to be tortured and knocked off including Margaret Avery as a prostitute who swallows drain cleaner. 'Magnum Force' doesn't build on its premise yet drifts on crude tangents and is much longer 124 minutes than it needs to be.Don Siegel was replaced by Ted Post as director whose experience is mainly in television. Post's direction is bland and without a clearly defined style he frequently uses master shots rather than closeups of actors and vehicles which ruins the sinister closedin atmosphere that Magnum Force's death squad is supposed to generate. The action scenes are very basic in approach when their energy could have been heightened by some imaginative camera work. These sequences have a degree of excitement but they rarely walk the levels of 'Dirty Harry' whose action is quite limited. The cinematography by Frank Stanley is also a major jump down from that of Bruce Surtees in 'Dirty Harry.' 'Magnum Force' has a dreary appearance on lowerquality film stock combined with the violence and trashy situations 'Magnum Force' has an atmosphere similar to 'B' films by American International Pictures and Crown International. It's almost hard to believe that 'Magnum Force' was released by Warner Brothers and that Eastwood fills the starring role.Strong performances by Eastwood and Holbrook keep 'Magnum Force' from being a complete disaster. The two veterans play their roles intensely and make the film considerably more entertaining than its script allows for. Supporting roles with Soul Matheson Niven and Urich are effectively played although their lack of identity in the biker squad makes this whole greater than the sum of its parts. Actors from 'Dirty Harry' such as Albert Popwell and John Mitchum reappear Felton Perry has a dull turn as Harry's illfated partner. Lalo Schifrin is back as composer which gives the series a further degree of continuity. The brilliant theme song combines his sleek orchestration and wordless vocals. Interestingly Schifrin's music during the film is mostly background color rather than holding a dominant place.Warner Brothers has released a snapper case version of its 'Magnum Force' DVD improving the flimsy cardboard version previously sold. The DVD treats 'Magnum Force' with respect but is weak on extras. 'Force' is presented in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 stereo enhancement dubbing and subtitles are offered in five languages. Magnum Force's print is in fairly good condition although grain is visible and colors look faded. Audio presentation is decent while Schifrin's score comes across nicely dialogue is sometimes muffled.DVD extras include a commentary track with screenwriter John Milius 'A Moral Right' WB's 24minute program on the social implications of Dirty Harry 'The Hero Cop' a short program released during Magnum Force's production and a gallery with all five trailers from the Dirty Harry series. As a person who doesn't especially like John Milius's work I found his selfrighteous commentary grating. To worsen matters the new program is only a rehash of ideas from Warner's 'Dirty Harry' DVD I would've rather seen a 'making of' program that examines 'Magnum Force' in depth. On the plus side its trailer gallery is an excellent look at Dirty Harry's evolution from 1971 into the 1980s. Harry fans will certainly be entertained as I was but the film and DVD never live up to their potential.  out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr".

Once again Dirty Harry must play dirty to track down the bad guys and the movie has cool dialogue and actionscenes.   But the movie couldve been better if itd had more and better action.  Still this is cultaction from the early 1970s and worth a look for those whove seen the first movie.  If you havent seen Dirty Harry you should see it first and then return to Magnum Force later. 7510".

	schema:reviewBody "Second outing for Clint Eastwood's antihero is an absorbing thriller let down by some sloppy characterisation and the lack of a killer no pun intended scene or even iconic dialogue. It starts off poorly with the title credits lamely played over an almost static shot of the title weapon very Sledge Hammer but once we get past the token scene reminding us of Harry's shoot first ask questions later policing policy the main plot strand about an internal police deathsquad violently taking out known felons dominates the film.There are some humanising touches around Harry's character although these stereotypically show him as irresistible to women rebellious to authority and almost friendly and caring for his young black sidekick so that nothing new is revealed about what makes him tick. There is something condescending about the treatment of these supporting characters especially the portrayal of Callahan's young Oriental neighbour who despite hardly seeing him around seems desperate to jump into bed with him.Better to stick with the action of which there is plenty. There's intrigue as Callahan's instincts lead him to find the true identities of the assassination bureau and a good twist as their ringleader emerges from the shadows.The acting is mostly fine Eastwood naturally dominating in his typical laconic manner. Hal Holbrook is also excellent as his testy superior and David Soul shines in a preHutch role. Ted Post directs with some flair with some blunt lapses while Lalo Schifrin contributes a typically gritty soundtrack. The film makes its main point about the dangers of vigilantism and cleverly uses Harry Callahan of all people as a counterpoint to its proponents.Some might argue as to whether all the violence was necessary and I felt the grisly death of a black prostitute bordered on the gratuitous but on the whole this was superior copfare and a good sequel to the trailblazing Dirty Harry.".

Fortunately however Magnum Force is far better than that. Whilst it retains its predecessor's focus on vigilantism police officers who act unlawfully and the failures of the justice system it also recognises that the solutions needed to deal with these problems aren't always quite as simple as those suggested in the earlier movie.The public are outraged after murder charges made against notorious gangster Carmine Ricca Richard Devon are dropped because of legal technicalities and shortly after as Ricca and his associates are driving home their car is stopped by a police patrolman. After making some brief checks the patrolman produces a gun shoots dead all four occupants and promptly leaves. Shortly after a large group of people at a mob boss' pool party are killed by a motorcycle cop and in a later incident a pimp is also shot dead by a police officer.SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood and his new partner Inspector Early Smith Felton Perry are tasked with investigating the killings and after finding evidence that the pimp had offered his killer a bribe Callahan concludes that the killer must be a cop. His further investigations reveal that the killings were actually carried out by a group of rookies who're all accomplished marksmen and regard Callahan as a role model. His reaction to their activities isn't what they expect and sets up a series of further developments which lead to the movie's exciting conclusion.The Harry Callahan of Magnum Force has finetuned his attitudes to authority and vigilantism in ways that are best exemplified when he says I hate the goddamn system but until someone comes along with changes that make sense I'll stick with it and also I didn't shoot at anyone who didn't start shooting at me first. Interestingly though his longstanding contempt for his boss Lieutenant Briggs Hal Holbrook is actually given some justification in this story.Magnum Force has an excellent script with numerous quotable lines that make a strong impression and there's also enough car chases shootouts and stunts to satisfy even the most demanding action fans. The entire cast turn in creditable performances and predictably Clint Eastwood brings his tough softlyspoken character to life with consummate ease and style.".

The original was a fairly groundbreaking cop thriller in terms of violence but it had great characterisation clever dialogue and genuine tension too. Magnum Force is really just about the violence. The characterisation is cartoonish the dialogue contrived.... and the moments of tension are sporadic to say the least. There's something uncomfortable and tasteless about watching Harry coolly dispose of a couple of plane hijackers or an undercover black cop being told to suck the barrel of a shotgun by a liquor store gunman or a bunch of naked sunbathers being gunned down by a renegade machine guntoting motorcycle cop. Perhaps Magnum Force is trying just a bit too hard to be controversial when it ought to be concentrating on the action.Highprofile criminals who have been released by the courts due to legal loopholes are being bumped off in San Francisco. Harry Callahan Clint Eastwood tries to figure out who is responsible for the executions. He knows that one or more motorcycle cops are responsible and initially he suspects that it could be the work of Charlie McCoy Mitchell Ryan an old buddy who is growing suicidally disillusioned by the way that the crooks he keeps busting are being pardoned by the courts. Or perhaps the killers are a bunch of sharpshooting rookie motorcycle cops David Soul Tim Matheson and Robert Urich? Even though Harry can see that the legal system is flawed and frustratingly ineffective he is still sworn to protect those considered innocent by the courts.... so he finds himself hunting the renegade cops despite the fact that they have a valid point.Eastwood seems to be on autopilot in this one trading off his tough persona rather than giving a performance of any real depth and feeling. The only performances that seem to carry any acting weight are given by Hal Holbrook and Felton Perry. Lalo Schifrin provides a sensational '70s score perhaps the best thing about the film but in most aspects the film is relatively lacklustre. Ted Post directs in a very workmanlike manner never really sensing the opportunities to make this anything more than a standard police actioner. The plot which has a potentially explosive moral question about whether it is right or wrong to release known criminals simply because of insubstantial evidence and whether the vigilante cops are right to assassinate such lowlifes without the support of the law remains sadly underdeveloped.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why would someone want to be comment number 458? Because it might mean something to somebody. This movie meant a lot to me.I spent about four hours soletosole in the back of a pickup truck hitch hiking with her and a friend of mine in Florida. This was before she had killed anybody I believe.Years later I saw the wanted drawing. It sort of rang a bell but a lot of usual suspects look like that don't they? What are the chances? Then they caught her and showed the first photo then gave both the nickname like a cousin and the real name like another cousin only spelled in Irish. At the time she mentioned the spelling with an A. I asked her if she was Irish and told her about my two cousins. What a small world right? She either told me her last name and I assumed it or told me she was Greek. The point being the whole name aspect was the first part of a four hour life story discussion we had. And you don't forget four hours of a face like that either. The life stories matched. It was her.The mood swings Charlize Theron portrays are perfect as are the mannerisms body language clothes teeth complexion hair the body fat manner of speaking that strutting walk and just everything. It was absolutely uncanny. You never forget someone like that and then when they pop up alive like that again. It was just unreal.She was mood swinging or perhaps cycling the whole time I was with her. I imagine if that was portrayed realistically the movie would be unwatchable. I remember thinking at the time her behavior seemed like the popular portrayal of those possessed. After I saw Monster more than twenty years later I called the other guy that was with me. We have remained friends over the years. I told him Oscar this Oscar that blah blah blah just out of the shock of reliving the experience of Aileen again. The fact that she was played by the glamorous beautiful Charlize Theron on top of it was beyond all comprehension. What a transformation! Of course my beloved goofball buddy was sitting beside her sleeping most of the time in the truck. His head kept on falling on her shoulder and she would push it off. It was like Three Stooges. They shared the Doritos like it was the school cafeteria or something. Can you imagine in hindsight? Yes it is good for a few jokes I admit it. She hadn't killed anyone yet so far as I can tell from reading about her and piecing the timeline back together. This was the first and only time I had been in Florida in those collegeage days so putting that together was fairly easy.I don't know if I ever met anyone before or since that I have felt more sympathy for at the time. She was very talkative about herself and the hard times she'd had. She was believable. She wasn't scamming us or anything as I first suspected just shooting the breeze. I wanted to cry for her. I think I even did so later in hindsight. She was unreal. She had what I thought were multiple personalities. Really just two she would laugh one second cry the next. She was like a big tough hardass girl of eight years. She told me all about her childhood abuse the horror of being a prostitute and taking beatings and abuse from the men. She mentioned living in hotels. She didn't seem like too much of a drinker or a druggie. I just thought she was deeply emotionally disturbed. In those days we should have said mental. My friend and I were a couple of happy middleclass college snowbird guys on Christmas break. She had about the worst kind of life of anyone I had ever met. She was only about four or five years older than us but looked twice her age. When I thought later about the hand she was dealt compared to mine you better believe the religious feelings and tears well up. They still do. I can't bear to watch the movie sometimes or at least parts of it.Yes what she did was wrong if not evil. I don't think she was evil though at all.

I don't usually contemplate these things its just that you could see there was a good person there just profoundly ed up. For some reason I was proud of her when she wanted the execution.

	onyx:emotionText "Why would someone want to be comment number 458? Because it might mean something to somebody. This movie meant a lot to me.I spent about four hours soletosole in the back of a pickup truck hitch hiking with her and a friend of mine in Florida. This was before she had killed anybody I believe.Years later I saw the wanted drawing. It sort of rang a bell but a lot of usual suspects look like that don't they? What are the chances? Then they caught her and showed the first photo then gave both the nickname like a cousin and the real name like another cousin only spelled in Irish. At the time she mentioned the spelling with an A. I asked her if she was Irish and told her about my two cousins. What a small world right? She either told me her last name and I assumed it or told me she was Greek. The point being the whole name aspect was the first part of a four hour life story discussion we had. And you don't forget four hours of a face like that either. The life stories matched. It was her.The mood swings Charlize Theron portrays are perfect as are the mannerisms body language clothes teeth complexion hair the body fat manner of speaking that strutting walk and just everything. It was absolutely uncanny. You never forget someone like that and then when they pop up alive like that again. It was just unreal.She was mood swinging or perhaps cycling the whole time I was with her. I imagine if that was portrayed realistically the movie would be unwatchable. I remember thinking at the time her behavior seemed like the popular portrayal of those possessed. After I saw Monster more than twenty years later I called the other guy that was with me. We have remained friends over the years. I told him Oscar this Oscar that blah blah blah just out of the shock of reliving the experience of Aileen again. The fact that she was played by the glamorous beautiful Charlize Theron on top of it was beyond all comprehension. What a transformation! Of course my beloved goofball buddy was sitting beside her sleeping most of the time in the truck. His head kept on falling on her shoulder and she would push it off. It was like Three Stooges. They shared the Doritos like it was the school cafeteria or something. Can you imagine in hindsight? Yes it is good for a few jokes I admit it. She hadn't killed anyone yet so far as I can tell from reading about her and piecing the timeline back together. This was the first and only time I had been in Florida in those collegeage days so putting that together was fairly easy.I don't know if I ever met anyone before or since that I have felt more sympathy for at the time. She was very talkative about herself and the hard times she'd had. She was believable. She wasn't scamming us or anything as I first suspected just shooting the breeze. I wanted to cry for her. I think I even did so later in hindsight. She was unreal. She had what I thought were multiple personalities. Really just two she would laugh one second cry the next. She was like a big tough hardass girl of eight years. She told me all about her childhood abuse the horror of being a prostitute and taking beatings and abuse from the men. She mentioned living in hotels. She didn't seem like too much of a drinker or a druggie. I just thought she was deeply emotionally disturbed. In those days we should have said mental. My friend and I were a couple of happy middleclass college snowbird guys on Christmas break. She had about the worst kind of life of anyone I had ever met. She was only about four or five years older than us but looked twice her age. When I thought later about the hand she was dealt compared to mine you better believe the religious feelings and tears well up. They still do. I can't bear to watch the movie sometimes or at least parts of it.Yes what she did was wrong if not evil. I don't think she was evil though at all. She had the innocence lost naive but semifunny sweetness portrayed in the movie. I don't usually contemplate these things its just that you could see there was a good person there just profoundly ed up. For some reason I was proud of her when she wanted the execution. She was nothing if not honest. As an outside observer I don't know how you feel sorry for someone like that but if you knew what happened you just might. I have no agenda in that regard.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on a true story this movie is about Ailen Wuornos a prostitute who killed quite a few men who she serviced.  She was convicted in 1990 and executed in 2002.She's played by Charlize Theron who's just incredible.  It starts off just before she began murdering men and has met Selby Christina Ricci an adorable lesbian who loves her.  It basically chronicles their relationship and what led Wuornos to kill these men.  Also she reaccounts her childhood and how she became a prostitute.  It's more than a little depressingit's a tragic story of a beaten woman who saw murder as the only way out.  Only three murders are shown and that's more than enough.  The violence is not glorifiedit's bloody and sick and one is the most harrowing thing I've seen in years.  What's so fascinating and scary about this film is that I actually began to sympathize with Wuornos!  While I could never condone her actions you can see clearly what led her to it.  This is a rare filmit makes a serial killer look sympathetic.Theron is a wonder in thisshe became Wuornos who was very unattractive. She gained weight shaved off her eyebrows colored her hair used contacts and dentures to change her appearance completely.  Never once did I think I was seeing Theron actingshe BECAME Wuornos.  A great performanceshe'll easily get the Oscar for this one.  Ricci is also good here.  She's been ignored in the press but she nicely underplays the role of Selby and is a perfect contrast to Theron's acting.  Also nice to see Bruce Dern in a small role.Music is used very effectively here.  They play songs of the time it took place 1980s so you know when this is happening and also nicely complements the actions on screen especially with Journey's Don't Stop Believing.A very good movie but a very depressing one.  Proceed at your own risk.".

	schema:reviewBody "An intense depressing movie. It sticks pretty close to the facts but focuses chiefly on the relationship between Charlize Theron as Lee and Christina Ricci as Selby. The police are hardly there at all. In fact neither is anyone else except for Bruce Dern who makes one or two short but welcome appearances.It could easily have been a bythenumbers TV movie. Come to think of it it has hasn't it? With Jean Smart? But the production values are good and the time and money has been spent on this film that we usually associate with feature films.The cinematography is outstanding. The shots of Lee near the end of her rope hitching on a foggy blue nightime Florida highway look like a desktop theme from some arty horroroccult site. The script doesn't have many tag lines. No Rosebuds or I coulda been a contendah. Nor is it folksy or catching in some other way. The dialogue follows the story in being pretty straightforward and without much in the way of noticeable touches. The director should be commended on her handling of two things. One is the explanation for Lee's crimes. None is given. There is a short scene in which Lee tells one of her johns about her miserable childhood but the abuse excuse is vitiated by Selby's mother an orthodox and unimaginative woman who says simply that lots of people have hard childhoods without growing up like Lee. And the men are not all turned into sadistic hogs which must have been a temptation for the writers. The second virtue in the direction is its management of the murders. Instead of exploding heads there are a few squibs and usually not even that before the victim yields to the fathomless cool enwinding arms of death. The themes explored here are not so much violence as love and desperation.Ricci looks the part with her broad forehead and tiny lips but comes across more as a Valley Girl than the kind of outcast who would pick up and move off with someone like Lee.Which brings us to Theron's performance as Lee. It's startling of course to see a glamorpuss like Theron so thoroughly deglamorized. It's the kind of performance that wins Academy Awards  lesbians the heightchallenged autistics all have won awards in recent years. Theron deserves recognition for her effort too but not just because of the makeup and wardrobe. They're all splendid. Makeup has shaved her brows to a Mona Lisa extent and turned her face just blotchy enough and given her a raggedy set of teeth.But that's not all that has made her performance as the central character so memorable. She's in almost every frame. And it isn't the thirty or so pounds that she put on for the role either. What's so homeric about that? I can put on thirty pounds without blinking an eye and enjoy doing it. Heck I can put on forty or fifty if she wants to get into a peeing contest. No  it's Theron herself who MAKES the character. She's great particularly in her physical manifestation of Lee  her body language for instance. Instead of coasting through the role she animates it. The way she struts around with her shoulders thrown back and her face down emphasizing her several chins and the girth of her neck. Maybe it takes a profession ballerina to figure out these little techniques. Her voice isn't as coarse as that of a hooker who constantly puffs on cigarettes but Theron does what she can with her own. She overcomes her native South African speech with no trouble and introduces us to a breathless bravado that she's never used on screen before  not that I know of.Her movements her speech her dreams are filled with a desperate illusion that doesn't exactly make us feel sorry for her but does make us worry for her  that she might for instance start screaming at any minute and never stop. A nerveracking picture of a ruined soul.Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. You won't learn too much about how Aileen Wournos turned into the person she did. Even the narrative itself is a little confusing at time so that you can't be sure where Lee and Selby are at given moments. But it's Hollywood professionalism at one of its rare high points. It's made by a mature team for an audience of adults. Refreshing.".

I was so blown away by her that her performance actually reignited my own passion for acting and made me realize why I'm trying so hard to break into this business and to do it well. I never thought that Charlize Theron of whom I was never a big fan of all people could make me remember what moviemaking is all about. With one role she's converted me into a lifelong fan. If Oscar means anything anymore she deserves that award handsdown. The movie itself is one of the most gripping and emotional stories I've ever seen in a film and true or not its right up there with the other great indies depicting the sorry lives of MiddleAmericans such as Boys Don't Cry and ironically Monster's Ball. I wept straight through the last twenty minutes of this movie continued weeping intermittently throughout the day and wept some more about it during my preparation for acting class the following day. Before I saw the film I saw Charlize on The Daily Show talking to John Stewart about how Aileen Wuornos' story and I'm paraphrasing forces one to reexamine how we might label someone evil for doing horrible things. I thought that's just a bunch of liberal bullst. Then I saw the movie. Like I said we can't know how much of the movie is onehundred percent factual but it's almost scary how little that mattered to me after I left the theater. This film moved me so much that I actually decided then and there that I would that I would have to think a little harder the next time I thought of someone as evil. If the goal of the filmmakers was to just try to get people to think about the fairness of the death penalty I believe they succeeded.".

The characters aren't judged but they're shown with their humanity. With empathy. The result is not your usual indie movie that tries to be hip or a sugarcoated version of this tragic story with an answer for everything and a nice confortable message in the end but a truly moving and absorbing film that focuses on the people whose story is telling. At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. Her work is powerful subtle moving and layered. It's incredible to watch Broomfield's documentary after seeing the film. Sometimes it really seems like watching the same person. It's not only that she recreated her mannerism which she did perfectly she's also somehow got her energy as a person. She got to the emotional reasons as to why Aileen's mannerism was like that. In short an extraordinary performance and a powerful film.".

It's not only that she recreated her mannerism which she did perfectly she's also somehow got her energy as a person. She got to the emotional reasons as to why Aileen's mannerism was like that. In short an extraordinary performance and a powerful film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Okay seriously i needed a bit of comedy before reviewing this dark serious movie about murder and human nature.Monster as most of you know is the story of serial killer Aileen Wuornos physically ugly abused as a child living as a prostitute falling in love with another woman and killing men.  An upbeat film this is not.As much has been said about Theron's performance as Aileen I won't comment too much.  I will however make the joke that she got an oscar just for looking ugly!  Seriously though she doesn't just look like Lee but she lives and breathes as Lee.  Just watching the littlest facial quirk the way she holds and moves her body all I could think of wasn't who was playing her or how amazing the make up was but just about the character.  That's why she's so good in this. The rest of the cast is okay with Christina Ricci playing against type as a needy lesbian who stands by and allows Lee to kill becoming something of a monster herself.Another thing to comment on is that this isn't called Monster because Godzilla's in it.  My friends and I commented that there were maybe 2 nice people in the entire film.  This movie is dark and depressing.  Now we've got a macabre sense of humor but after seeing this it took a while for some jokes to seem funny again.Of course this leads into just how realistic is the movie to life and the events surrounding it?  Some people have claimed that the film misinterprets some of the victims and that it oversympathizes with Lee.  And then there's what I said about there being maybe 2 redeemable human beings in the whole thing with selfrighteous religious stereotypes in it as well.I believe the movie is that way for a purpose.  I can't defend the misinterpreting of some of the victims but other things I can.  Notice how the film is narrated from Lee's point of view.  And since it's from her messed up murderous point of view wouldn't most of humanity seem irredeemable?  And wouldn't she play us the audience her jury for sympathy?This movie is so successful because when I left the theater I was made because I figured I had just seen another psycholiberal movie bashing religious people and the death sentence among other things.  But as I left and talked with others I realized that that's how I'm SUPPOSED to feel the movie is told from Lee's point of view of her trying to justify her horrible actions by making people see her view of how bad the world is and how much a victim she is.  The filmmakers want me to get mad at her to not agree with her.  If they didn't if the filmmakers really wanted people to feel sorry for Lee they wouldn't have called it Monster.  Looking back on it i see how the directing the writing and the few really innocent people in the film were put there to make me feel a certain way.  Excellently done! They were so successful I didn't notice until long after the movie was over.That said aside from being depressing enough to bring down a guy high on ecstasy the movie's main flaw is the music.  The orchestral music is okay but some of the songs like the one they play when Lee and Selby are cuddling made me want to kill someone!  And the guitar sound that starts to play before their tastefully shot sex scene sounded like 70's porn music i kid you not.  But man if that was meant to be funny i sure needed it because nothing else in this movie is a laughing matter.Alltogether sorry Lee but I only empathize with you.  I would probably found you guilty as well.  If the way you were treated by the first guy was accurate in the film and you had turned yourself in I'd have found you notguilty it being self defense.  But you couldn't stop or wouldn't and tried to hide it.  Besides lots of people who do get raped and abused as kids don't go out and kill.Monster is an incredibly subtly effective film but definitely not for the faint of heart.  It's more Henry than Hannibal.  But for those who can take it or enjoy studying the darker aspects of humanity in a serious light gather your courage and see Monster.".

Despite adverse comments from other reviewers I consider Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby equally remarkable conveying childlike naivety seductiveness stubbornness and growing manipulativeness very well. They dominate the film between them but the supporting performances are fine also. I gave this 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "After just seeing this film I'm pretty much speechless. This is a tough film to comment on. This is mainly due to the fact that it's a serial killer film where you actually end up feeling sympathy for the killer. Near the end of the film when it goes completely out of control for Aileen Wuornos there's no feeling of justice is done once again... quite the contrary actually. It's so moving and disturbing following this person's life through the last part of it. In the beginning we get a fairy talelike presentation of Aileen's hopes and dreams in her young years. Without warning we're thrust into the hard reality of her current years immediately afterward. From there on out we're in her world feeling her pain experiencing her failures. We get to know her as the film goes on but we feel for her from the very beginning without even knowing why she is like she is. That says something about the masterful direction and writing of Patty Jenkins that is featured in this film. The plot is great and it's surprisingly easy to follow the thought process of Aileen... we understand why she kills. The pacing is very good there are only few scenes that seem to move slow and I don't think there was really any point where I was bored. The locations is incredibly authentic. Jenkins actually went out of her way to get shooting done at several places where the real Aileen had been and even cast people who had met her in smaller roles. Cinematography is great. Acting is pretty much flawless both Theron and Ricci shine in their roles. The movie also has a unpleasant view of prejudice from the 'other side'the people who become victims to prejudice and hopefully this will act as a much needed wakeup call for the people who believe in and go by prejudice. What really makes this film have an impact is how dark and real it is. No happy ending no silver lining... just tough uncut reality. When you see it you can't help getting engulfed in this person's world. The raw horror of her life moves you. I can't see anyone no matter ignorance beliefs or moral and ethic standpoint coming out after seeing this film and believing that Eileen was the 'bad guy' in this story. It's just not possible. I haven't seen any of the interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos and I didn't follow her case but I would like to know more about her find out what she was like to a greater extent than a movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes can tell me. That's what this movie did to me. It made me care for this person and that says more than anything I can put in this review. You need to see this film unless you refuse to watch anything that has harsh reality instead of a happy ending. I recommend this to anyone who can take it. This movie will depress most people but after this one viewing I consider it required viewing for just about anyone. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is absolutley amazing it picks on nearly every single human emotion and brings them all to the surface.  As an audience you're left confused about how you should feel towards this serial killer.   Charlize Theron certainly deserved her best actress Oscar her performance in this movie was moving thoughtprovoking and truly believable something I find lacking in many currently released movies.  Behind each emotion expressed on Therons face you see a whole lifetime of pain and anguish in Lee's character you find yourself knowing her past without it being explained to you.  When watching it's easy to find yourself thinking that you're actually seeing Aileen Wuornos.  Being familiar with the story of Wuornos I feel that Patty Jenkins touched on a hugely sensitive subject and delivered a story with immense passion.  Whether or not you are familiar with the actual events of Wuornos' destructive 1 year period is irrelevant as Jenkins and Theron bring a character to life that we all can relate to in someway. The notoriety of the actual story brings the problem of making a charicature of Lee a problem that Theron has easily sidestepped showing what an amazing actress she is.  I think that this may be my all time favourite film or it is certainly heading that way.  This film has everything that a REAL film should have it doesn't need big stunts CGIs 20millionamovie actors...It's just a brave idea fuelled by a passion that comes through to the audience.  A truly excellent piece of filmmaking and even better acting talents.".

In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.MONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron The Devil's Advocate as Aileen Wurnos one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.The woman is named Selby Christina Ricci The Opposite of Sex and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.But one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.MONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not but hey you never know.If there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is in real life a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.I also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.The screenplay by Patty Jenkins Who also directed does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black and not all people who murder are 100 culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.MONSTER is a wellmade brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging engrossing and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out.".

Selby comes off as a weak if loving parter totally in the dark as to her lovers vicious killings. The innocence of the lovers and Lee's intense need to be loved form a centerpiece around which the killings seem almost incidental. Theron plays Wuornos as a freaked out victim raped since a young age and abused all her life. You see her as someone who never really had a chance. The performance is excellent and the intensity of this movie just riveting. I'd see it again and probably will. Highly recommend.".

That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn't matter for me then.But everyone involved in this film deserve the credit. Monster is gripping. It's a film that makes you feel almost every emotion you can think of sadness anger compassion wrath. It confuses you. Do you identify with Aileen or do you disapprove of her actions? I guess both. You despise her for killing the men. But the film challenges that. You can almost explain and thus condone her actions. I guess the one thing that stayed with me was that it occurred to me what it must feel like to be really and utterly alone in this world.".

I didn't see the film until after Charlize Theron won the Oscar and so much had been made of her gaining weight and becoming unattractive for the role I was downright cynical about why she won the award. That is until I saw the movie!Charlize Theron's on screen portrayal of Aileen is so eerily realistic that you forget it's an actress behind some prosthetics she WAS Aileen for the entire duration of the film. I kept sayingOh my gosh oh my gosh the whole time as she had every single mannerism of Aileen's down to a T. It was the most impressive portrayal of a real person that I have ever seen hands down. This woman deserved that Oscar!Although several people thought the film was sympathetic to Wuornos I didn't see this as being the case. We saw that Aileen was manipulative violent abusiveand didn't take responsibility for her actions. We also saw her as a human being vulnerable traumatized and lost. Despite the insight into Wuornos' humanity we still knew she was beyond help.Christina Ricci also delivered a terrific performance as Shelby and was a perfect complement to CharlizeasAileen's abrasiveness.This was the best film of 2003 IMO.".

	schema:headline " Grim Portrait Of A Sad Wasted Life";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me begin by saying that Charlize Theron gives the best female performance that I have ever seen on film. Theron deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. I can not recall a performance male or female with such raw intensity. For those who may not know MONSTER is the true story of Aileen Wuornos a Florida prostitute who was executed a couple of years ago for killing men that picked her up on the highway. However this is much much more than a deranged serial killer flick. This film shows us very convincingly how a person can be led to a life of violence. Aileen had an awful childhood and an awful life. She was molested as a child by her father as well as other male relatives. As a child she was surrounded by abuse drug addiction and domestic violence. Men horribly abused her as a child and she began prostituting at age thirteen. In her later years Aileen became a prostitute because it had been grilled into her head all her life that she was just a whore. As MONSTER opens Aileen's car breaks down and she wanders into what she doesn't know is a gay bar. Sitting alone at a table is lonely confused lesbian Selby Christina Ricci who strikes up a conversation with the dirty unkempt Aileen who washes her hair in gas station sinks and uses the hand dryer to fix her hair. After many drinks Aileen and Selby become close and soon enter into an unhealthy torrid tragic love affair. Selby is naive and has always been sheltered and she just wants genuine love. However Aileen has issues that Selby doesn't see at first. There is certainly nothing positive or redeeming about serial killers but you often feel yourself having a small bit of sympathy for Aileen because you realize why she kills the men who pick her up...SHE HATES MEN. Aileen has always hated men and the only love scenes in which any tenderness and emotion is shown are the lesbian love scenes between Aileen and Selby. You also feel some sorrow for Aileen because she DOES want to improve herself but has no way of knowing how to do so. There are scenes where Aileen applies for jobs because she really wants to do right but she is always rejected. She applies for secretarial jobs at law offices and is laughed right out of the building while she curses and screams at everyone. She doesn't know any better because she has no social skills. In one of the most powerful scenes Aileen is hitch hiking and is picked up by a genuinely nice man who offers to help her. He is sincere and doesn't want sex. He is a decent man who offers a helping hand but Aileen just can not trust any man. She tells him she doesn't want to kill him but because her previous killings are all over the news she has to kill him so she won't be identified. Selby meanwhile learns of Aileen's murderous rampage and tearfully decides to go to the authorities. What makes this film so powerful is that this is A TRUE STORY. Aileen Wuornos had a miserable life. Life dealt her a sy hand. She never had a chance. Growing up nobody....teachers parents relatives....reached out to her. You can't excuse a serial killer rampage but this is the only serial killer film that I have seen that at least offers some reasoning behind the insanity. Again this is intense and Charlize Theron is AMAZING.".

	schema:reviewBody "Monster is the true story of Aileen Carol Wuornos a prostitute in Florida who murdered seven men in the late eighties and early nineties.Based on the title of the movie and knowing somewhat of what the movie was about I watched this film expecting a rather brutal depiction of the actions committed by a serial killer. While it does go into detail of some of the killings and what led to them it's more than just a recount of a killing spree. It's mainly a love story with a very depressing theme to it.Aileen played by Charlize Theron who did an AMAZING job meets a younger girl Selby played by Christina Ricci also a fantastic performance and the two eventually fall in love. While they appear to be complete opposites they share two characteristics a sense of rejection from the world and a desire to be accepted by others. Selby a lesbian coming from a very strict religious family and Aileen who suffered from an abusive childhood were both looked down upon by those around them.The movie makes little attempt to portray Aileen as a monster as the title might suggest. Instead it displays a different perspective of Wuornos' life. We get to see the human side of Aileen. However the film in no way tries to condone the murders but instead goes to show that they weren't simply the result of an evil mind. When not killing people Aileen appears to be a decent though short tempered human being.This film effectively tries to show you that sometimes you can be placed in a horrible situation against your will and that you might have no say in these lifealtering events. Aileen though a murderer was not someone who decided one day to get up and start killing people. She was severely abused as a child destroying her selfconfidence at a very early age and effectively crushing any chance she might have had at a decent normal life.Monster is a beautiful and depressing drama with superb acting. A movie that can make you feel sympathetic for a serial killer without glorifying the murders is a truly effective one I believe. I think this fact intimidates some people who might not actually WANT to feel pity or sympathy for a person who committed these crimes. I gave this movie a ten though I'm not sure if it deserves one I wanted to try and help raise the average as it certainly deserves more than a 7.4.".

With the direction taken by Patty Jenkins it is not so much a film about a woman committing heinous acts but unlike so many serial killer movies which very much rely on violence and in depicting that violence on screen to explain their evil intentions Monster attempts to show to us that the violent nature of Wournos' erratic behaviour is partly as a result of society's failure to acknowledge and assist those who have fell through the net and were let down by the system thus they turn to crime such as murder. I am not saying that I condoned the actions of Aileen Wournos apart from one who according to her tried to rape her but rather with the abuse that she had experienced as a childthey played a considerable part in her growing up as an angry bitter woman. Her psychological and emotional damage was inflicted by those who were in her care and of whom were in the hands of those people of whom were supposed to protect Aileen.Monster is alas not a serial killer movie but neither is it a lesbian one the violence for example is not as excessive and gory in stark contrast to other socalled films of a similar nature. Having said that the rape scene in the car where Aileen is attacked and taken advantaged of was somewhat distressing to watch. It is most certainly not implying that violence is in the context of this film utilised as a way of empowering women over men. It is in fact a film which attempts to underline how behind the troubles and abhorrent actions lie a emotionally scarred and frustrated person who was clearly troubled and not happy nor satisfied with oneself. Irrespective of her gender. But also that she was often misunderstood by certain parts of society like for instance when she goes and applies for jobs she gets turned down. Also in one scene which also took place in a car she had killed her first john as an act of selfdefence after he tried to rape her. Because of that incident she is spurred on by the assumption that all men are women rapists paedophiles etc and continues her killing spree by targeting her male victims and thus shooting them one by one.The role that Selby of which her real name is Lydia and whom was Aileen's lover plays is important because it was during the time in which those murders were carried out that she had been in a lesbian relationship with her. Christina Ricci gave as good a performance as she did and it was interesting that it was Monster where she made her film comeback after spending a couple of years out of the limelight.The acting was first class the direction was masterful and the locations looked spectacular. Theron delivers a killer and mesmerising performance as Aileen never had I seen her in a performance of a lifetime until I saw this film. Even without the prosthetics I do think that she could've just about pulled it off still. Given her not too impressive previous on screen roles as stereotypical male eye candy and blonde bombshell figures there was always this danger that she would be ridiculed as well as type casted as an actress. Thankfully for her her solid efforts in Monster as well as North Country put an end to all that and the persistent criticism being levelled against her.Overall Monster is a superb film full of raw passionate emotion. I very much doubt that any other movie that Theron had starred in or will star in will ever supersede and surpass her excellent rendition of Wournos. Kudos to Theron Ricci and Jenkins though. It is one of the best films to come out of the 21st century.".

	schema:reviewBody "MONSTER Watching this film proves that despite the boredom and predictability of the Best Actress race in '04 Charlize Theron is one of the most deserving Oscar winners in recent years. It's amazing how such an average film holds up so beautifully in repeat viewings solely on the shoulders of Theron's unbelievable performance as Aileen Wournos in MONSTER.MONSTER tells the story of Wournos a homeless streetwalking loner with a grim outlook on life. Although her rage doesn't manifest itself to murder till later in the film it is clear that Wournos' ability to live in a world with men is shaky. She holds loathing and hatred towards the men that belittled her as a child and instead of removing herself from those situations... she has chosen to live a life where her survival depends on men's carnal desires. However after finding happiness in a relationship with a young girl named Selby played by Chrisina Ricci that rage that has been simmering deep down unleashes itself in a murdering frenzy as Aileen becomes one America's first female serial killers.Virtually all of MONSTER's acclaim was focused on Charlize Theron and her startlingly good performance. And though it was certainly warranted... it should also be noted that MONSTER is a solid effort on it's own as well. It's a simple film told from a rather simple point of view. However by remaining simple first time featuredirector Patty Jenkins manages to keep the film well balanced. MONSTER never takes sides on the issue of violence it is clear that Wournos is not justified to do what she does... but it is also clear that is not entirely her fault the her emotional state ever got to the place it was. If the film had taken sides it would have been far less gripping. Thankfully Jenkins with the help of Theron manages to make this film an accurate portrait of this woman's life.Aside from Theron the only other performance that registers in the film is that of Christina Ricci. Her's is a polarizing performance because it's hard to tell whether the incredibly annoying aspects of her character come from Ricci's acting or Selby's personality. Personally I think it's a little bit of both. Nonetheless Ricci's performance works in the context of the film... and Theron obviously has no difficulty playing opposite her.Though MONSTER is an solid film it's clear it would have been nothing without the conviction of Charlize Theron in the leading role. Much flack has been given to the Best Actress category in recent years for being too quick to award any Hollywood actress who deglams. However I think such a generalized criticism is unfair because it slightly taints Charlize Theron's win. Yes she deglammed and got fat... but even without that her performance is one of the most emotionally hypnotizing female performances I've seen in years. This film IS her performance and she's brilliant here.... B ...".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is what film is all about. This had to be one of the most human stories I have ever seen. Most movies about serial killers either paint them out to be pure evil or misunderstood. Monster showed Aileen to be just another person who screwed up. Some feel that this was sympathetic to Aileen. It may have been but I saw it less as a justification of her actions and more as an attempt to see Aileen as more than simply a female murderer. Any justification for Aileen's actions came more from her own head then from the film. The first man she killed seemed justified as self defense. However the rest of the men she killed for their money and her justification that she knew they were rapists and bad men was obviously her attempt to ease her guilt. Charlize Theron gave an amazing performance that truly made Aileen believable. Christina Ricci is really the underrated gem of this piece though. As Selby she perfectly portrayed a young woman trying to be an adult yet unable to make her own decisions. She was horrified that Aileen was killing these men but at the same time she would complain to her that she needed money. The cinematography was incredible. I was amazed that they were able to hold a scene on pretty much one shot and not become dull. The seeming simplicity is in reality a huge accomplishment. The only real complaint I could have is with the soundtrack which at times betrayed the emotional impact of the scene and made what could have been a powerful moment feel a bit cheesy and the last shot which just felt contrived. Other than that this film is for me a tribute to the craft. 910".

	schema:headline " party. Why? no seriously....why was this movie made?";
	schema:reviewBody "Eleven years ago Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. PARTY. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie Son of the Mask. Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds Cuz I gotta! Unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking Good Lord Why? Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim played by Jamie Kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to oneday draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin.First off ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question WHY? The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask.".

After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin.First off ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question WHY? The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask.";

Apart from him there's no Jim Carrey no Cameron Diaz no Richard Jeni .....oh wait so most of the appeal of the first film was immediately thrown out the window.Instead we're introduced to Jamie Kennedy who is a whiny manchild who works in an animation studio who comes across the mask picked up by his dog presumably a different Jack Russell Terrier RIP Milo He wears the mask and impregnates his girlfriendwife apparently giving his child mask powers? It's ridiculous.So Odin and Loki get involved nope not from the MCU because that would be awesome and try to eliminate the child.The child is eventually born the dog gets jealous and tries to kill it and Loki goes around creepily as well. OK apart from some of these scenes having the most horrific and poorly handled CGI I've ever seen this film really has a problem with which audience it's catering to. The characters are too exaggerated the visuals are legitimately traumatizing so the kids won't enjoy it. And the same thing will apply for adults because the acting is horrendous Jamie Kennedy is a horrible replacement for Jim Carrey and the script may as well have been written by a sixyearold. Plot holes and red herrings dominate the story with there literally being no rhyme or reason for this film for existing.This film is desperate to extract any reaction from its audience and this includes reactions of trauma horror anger boredom and frustration.

	schema:reviewBody "It's so ridiculous and bland that I would not know where to start. This boring film is more directed to kids than the original from 1994 and the proof is that the magic of Jim Carrey movie here has completely disappeared. The director of the 1994 film Chuck Russell is conspicuously absent and his position is usurped here by Lawrence Guterman the same man over the helm in the intolerable Cats  Dogs. The script was original could be polished a lot the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL it apparently beat Star Wars I or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy.

	onyx:emotionText "It's so ridiculous and bland that I would not know where to start. This boring film is more directed to kids than the original from 1994 and the proof is that the magic of Jim Carrey movie here has completely disappeared. The director of the 1994 film Chuck Russell is conspicuously absent and his position is usurped here by Lawrence Guterman the same man over the helm in the intolerable Cats  Dogs. The script was original could be polished a lot the concept of keeping in mind the very Loki was striking. But the role of the Mask is greatly ridiculed. The abuse of digital effects is CRIMINAL it apparently beat Star Wars I or go there I think. The main character is so stupid that I do not fall that ends well one ends up preferring Loki and that he is the bad guy.

Surprisingly it totally tanked at the box office in Hollywood terms  it lost big money though it grossed 17 million. This must have been because it was not marketed for kids. In fact I don't remember much marketing at all on this movie which is strange for a flick that cost almost a hundred million dollars to make. But it's too good a movie not to have legs with the nippers in the years to come if someone will just tell them about it.

	schema:headline " Am I from a different planet? Maybe I should conjure Odin";
	schema:reviewBody "Series note As this is not a direct chapterlike continuation of The Mask 1994 one can easily watch either film first.If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as say Schindler's List 1993 or The Shawshank Redemption 1994. Two factors mitigate that lack. One Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.Of course related to point one above it's not that every film needs to have a paradigmshattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey ReggioPhilip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi 1983 Powaqqatsi 1988 and Naqoyqatsi 2002 all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me and debatably they have no plots even if they make many cogent often philosophical arguments about culture.But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same locationthe fictional Edge Cityas the first Mask as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books upon which both films are based. The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery Jamie Kennedy lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke. The mask of Loki the God of mischief in Norse mythology comes floating down a stream to be found by Tim's dog Otis in an alliterative reference to Odin Loki's father and a pun on Milo and Otis. Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss played by comedian Steven Wright and his wife Tonya Traylor Howard. Prior to this Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.Meanwhile we get to meet Loki himself played by Alan Cumming in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask of course and Odin an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.Although it sounds complex perhaps that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fatherstobe experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmasand director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughouthinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts including the importance of personal assertiveness carried over from the themes of the first film the quandaries of dual career families sibling rivalry child development issues and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.Not that this is primarily a serious film but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laughoutloud comedy either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film at least to an extent.The production designincluding things like the sets matte paintings costumes and the ubiquitous cgiis simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film Son of the Mask realizes a live action cartoon.Tex Avery is again a strong reference made obvious by Kennedy's character being named Tim Avery and working as an animator as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening 1955 and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate almost Rube Goldbergian elimination contraption.The funniest aspect of the movie for me perhaps was a kind of suspended absurdity made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s still in shambles from the cartoonish events that precededthe piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs the giant boxing glove is still engaged and so on.But the performers have many funny moments too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carreylike mannerisms when Tim is The Mask and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can of course these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask and entertaining otherwisehe's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny especially when more surreal.Giving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically at least this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered.".

	onyx:emotionText "Series note As this is not a direct chapterlike continuation of The Mask 1994 one can easily watch either film first.If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as say Schindler's List 1993 or The Shawshank Redemption 1994. Two factors mitigate that lack. One Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.Of course related to point one above it's not that every film needs to have a paradigmshattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey ReggioPhilip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi 1983 Powaqqatsi 1988 and Naqoyqatsi 2002 all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me and debatably they have no plots even if they make many cogent often philosophical arguments about culture.But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same locationthe fictional Edge Cityas the first Mask as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books upon which both films are based. The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery Jamie Kennedy lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke. The mask of Loki the God of mischief in Norse mythology comes floating down a stream to be found by Tim's dog Otis in an alliterative reference to Odin Loki's father and a pun on Milo and Otis. Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss played by comedian Steven Wright and his wife Tonya Traylor Howard. Prior to this Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.Meanwhile we get to meet Loki himself played by Alan Cumming in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask of course and Odin an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.Although it sounds complex perhaps that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fatherstobe experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmasand director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughouthinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts including the importance of personal assertiveness carried over from the themes of the first film the quandaries of dual career families sibling rivalry child development issues and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.Not that this is primarily a serious film but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laughoutloud comedy either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film at least to an extent.The production designincluding things like the sets matte paintings costumes and the ubiquitous cgiis simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film Son of the Mask realizes a live action cartoon.Tex Avery is again a strong reference made obvious by Kennedy's character being named Tim Avery and working as an animator as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general.

Caesar honours his adopted son Augustus with a triumphal entry into Rome and then sends him to Greece together with his friends Agrippa and Maecenas. There Augustus hears the news of Caesar's assassination and he returns to Rome with his friends. Back in Rome he is able to gain both the support of the people and political power. In his struggle with the conspirators against Caesar he finds an ally in MARC ANTONY. Marc Antony not only pursues BRUTUS and CASSIUS he also initiates a wave of executions which practically eliminates the old Roman ruling class. Among those who are killed is the husband of LIVIA DRUSILLA a woman with whom Augustus had been in love as a young man. Through a combination of good luck and chance Augustus and...";

Yes some of the historical details were a bit off. But it's tempting to compare it with other productions such as I Claudius and Cleopatra the latter played even more loosely with historical fact. This production explored why Augustus Julia Livia and others did what they did.Others complained it was too long on the contrary I would like to have it longer and fill more detail in some of the years in Augustus's life that were not covered or glossed over.The recreations of the Forum the Curia and other locations were the best I've seen.

All of the battle scenes suffer as a result and this is worsened by some shots of legionaries being hit by arrows and pila that are utterly laughable  one soldier can be seen to pull the spear into his body others are already grabbing the part the arrow hits before it hits. Moreover the battles they represent are meaningless as they neglect to show either Phillipi or Actium in any detail that could do them justice.The script is a bizarre mishmash of historical accuracy and modern elements the most obvious being the character of Maecenas brought in for some reason to be both comic relief and the only gay in the village. The continual harping on about Rome also grates somewhat though this tends to die out towards the end for that matter the original insistence that Octavian and Agrippa were country boys is incorrect  Octavian's father had been praetor.The filming location  in Bizerte  is also very obviously not Italy and since a recurring element of the film is the activity in and around the forum this is noticeable more than it would have been if the activity was focused in the senate.Despite all that there is still an OK film lurking beneath the surface. Peter O'Toole does a good  if bored  turn as the elderly Augustus Livia who the historical sources believe was as manipulative as she is portrayed here Marcus  Caligula was to call her Ulysses in petticoats is played well by both actresses with exactly the right amount of malice Michele Bevilacqua's Tiberius is suitably reluctant to assume the burden of the Empire and Julia as well as nagged by Livia though he shunned Julia and appealed against her banishment  so the rape scene was unjustified.Despite what Marcus wrote above the treatment of Julia in this film  aside from the rape  is justified by the extant evidence she was banished for adultery after a complaint by her father using a law he had brought about with Iullus.Its also much more historically accurate than most films  it sticks closely to Suetonius's Life of the Deified Augustus aside from the gripes mentioned above and far better than more expensive films King Arthur bow your head in shame and is well worth watching for anyone who is prepared to accept some bizarre script moments in order to learn something of history.".

This movie was made with an obvious plentiful budget sponsored by the Italian government and US filmmakers and the result is a complex and nicely detailed biographical study of the first Emperor of Rome Augustus Caesar the man whose reign spanned the BCAD time frame with all the attendant changes in world geography and history and religious orders. It was a time of Rome's greatness and a time of Rome's disintegration.Writer Eric Lerner and Director Roger Young wisely elected to tell this tale as a series of flashbacks as recalled by the aged dying Augustus brilliantly portrayed by Peter O'Toole. His very presence gives the project credibility and dignity and helps the viewer forgive any of the many shortcomings that dot this epic. Augustus is attended by his wife Livia again a wise choice in casting the always superb Charlotte Rampling to bring this odd woman to life. With some adroit camera superimpositions of the old Augustus' face the story goes back in time to the death of Julius Caesar the one who appointed the young Augustus Benjamin Sadler to be his successor. It is 42 BC and the young Augustus together with his sidekicks Agrippa Ken Duken and Maecenas Russell Barr in a foppish turn struggle through the Senate the noblemen and the poor people of Rome who all have been ignored during Julius Caesar's infamous wars to expand the Empire. The complicated lineage to the 'throne' of Rome is manipulated by Julia Vittoria Belvedere Marc Antony Massimo Ghini Tiberius Michele Bevilacqua and Iullus Juan Diego Botto the son of Marc Antony among many others.Along the way we meet Cleopatra Anne Valle and Cicero Gottfried John and many of the other casually dropped names of Roman history. Though the names and the changes of who is ruling who at any one time can be confusing to even the most astute Roman historian the writer and director do their best to make this story flow so that it all is of a piece. The acting is superb for the leads adequate for the secondary roles and the camera work manages to make the numerous battlefield sequences seem cogent.In the end is the beginning the death of Augustus. A casual mention is made that during his reign there was born in the land of Judea a child whose name was Jesus...and suddenly the whole lengthy film gathers more meaning. This is a fine overview of Roman history and civilization and thanks to the fine work by Peter O'Toole and Charlotte Rampling the result is very satisfying. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "AUGUSTUS isn't the best it could be lacking the historical accuracy that previous reviewers have been kicking a screaming about it is because of the pointless stereotypical Julia who is always made out to be a villain and Augustus a wounded. However the tales of Augustus daughter Julia are mainly made of rumours the likelihood she was a prostitute is slim and chances are Iullus was one of her only if not only lover. Read your historical notes and what historians say today chances are you'll find her in a new light. AUGUSTUS shows Julia as the wounded daughter she was mistreated and thrown around just for her father's own delights. When you consider that he treated her like that and that she had a father who led a far kinkier and scandalous sex life is it any wonder his daughter who apart from her adulteries had no bad vein in her body ended up the way she did? Augustus Peter O'Toole is on his deathbed overlooking how he played his part in this comedy called life and he takes us back several years to the high point of his rein. His daughter Julia Vittoria Belvedere is married to his beloved friend and ally Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and together the two have had a pair of lovely sons Gaius and Lucius who are just like their grandfather and running around in army gear rather like how Julia's daughter Agrippina oddly missing from the movie would do for her youngest son Gaius or Caligula thirty or so years later. Of course the bubble bursts when Augustus is nearly murdered by an assassin only saved by his leather breast plate and Julia receives dreadful news her husband Agrippa has died. He tells her of his earlier days when he was a sickly eighteenyearold who one day gets a letter from Julius Caesar despite the pleas of his mother Your father would forbid it! Octavius Benjamin Sander reminds her that only your uncle treats me like a son leaps on a horse with Marcus Agrippa Ken Duken another eighteenyearold who dreams of becoming a soldier to join the army. The story seems to take us through a romanticised view of Octavius growth into manhood along side his two friends Marcus Agrippa and Gaius Maecenas Russell Barr a man who is clearly thrown in for a giggle. Agrippa represents the world that we all want to be apart of yet he doesn't live in a fool's paradise like Octavius does and towards the end of the flashbacks he finally pulls his friend out of belief that sticking to the nobles will save him he has to suppress them. Interestingly they show us how Agrippa built the great aqueducts proving himself not only to be a great soldier but also one of history's great architect. Ironically Maecenas mocks him by saying At least we'll be able to get some lovely fountains out of it! Cleopatra is just as she should be not a Liz Taylor but a real malicious mastermind. Julia does as she's told but is so trapped that she can't help but loom for ways out. Tiberius is a pig and his mother Livia too ambitious and it's refreshing that Augustus actually gets that Livia wants Tiberius to be emperor. Iullus Antonius who wants revenge for his father's murder at first uses the vulnerable widow of Agrippa to in his plan. The irony being of course that lovely Agrippa warned Octavius when he saved Iullus' life that this would one day come to pass. In a way Iullus cheats both his saviours not only seducing Augustus' daughter but also taking Agrippa's wife and using her against the man he spent his whole life protecting. Of course the plot falls through when Iullus ends up falling in love with her proving himself a true Antonius boya woman changed Antony you could change Iullus Augustus says and by god Julia does. The acting is still great though many see O'Toole as the best the desperation of Belvedere's Julia the cunning of Rampling's Livia the nobleness of Duken's Agrippa and the deep love that Barr's Maecenas has for Augustus really does touch you and makes their characters come alive.The only thing that is disappointing is that it didn't cover the whole of the history the Battle of Actium was rushed we never see two of Augustus wives and we don't know what happened after the civil war was over which is probably some of the most interesting part. Various other characters were clearly cut to save time for the film Octavia's first husband her children Fulvia Sextus Drusus who was Livia's other son and various others. If anything this show would have been better off as a mini series and covering other important parts of history like the selfexile of Agrippa because of Marcellus and how his death resulted in Agrippa's marriage to Juliathat would have been a story worth hearing.If you're not interested in history then you could just watch it for its soap opera feel with the drama attempted assassination and Julia's affair with Iullus Antonius driving her husband into raping her we might as well have been watching an ancient rendition of DAYS OF OUR LIVES only it's much better! Boys will also be happy to see that they get a hot babe to stare at in the form of Augustus' daughter Julia for half of the film. Don't worry fear not girls because in the other half ladies such as us also get a hot and handsome treat in the form Agrippa. My point being is that there is something for everyone. Filled with comic relief a few wars a few scandals a troublesome wife a few hot wild affairs a hot chick for the boys and a cute guy for the girls it pretty much does have everything you need to make history come alive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let us paint the scene The year is 12BC. The republic has been replaced with the imperial family the rebels are gathering and the fight for the succession is on. Frankly it is like THE WAR OF THE ROSES Ancient Roman style! The side most are routing for is the current emperor Augustus and Julia his beautiful clever and liberal daughter. They stand for rights for the plebs and responsibility of the nobles rather then for them to lay around on their backsides in litters. The father and daughter are at war against the cunning merciless and sly Livia Drusilla who has a strong desire to see her own son Tiberius on the throne. A believe so strong that he should be the next man worthy of the name Caesar she even tries to sway her husband Augustus into it. He of course always says no.This is the first point of greatness in this moderately made TV drama Augustus is not a dolt like he is in I CLAUDIUS he is as he should have been knowing ruthless and in league with everyone. Augustus did know everything and wasn't at all as stupid as Robert Graves wanted us to believe he was. He knew how Livia's mind worked and knew how to take care of her. Despite all arguments from both parties they don't really love one another they are like friendly rivals who both want their children to become leader of some big corporation.Of course the victims in the war against each other are Julia and Tiberius who both hold the love or their fathermother but have different ideas on how they'd rather spend their day. Augustus wants a babymaking obedient daughter and motherofRomanfuture in Julia. What Julia wants is to live up for a lot of lost living marry Iullus Antonius and settle down nicely. Also despite what Livia wants Tiberius would be more content matching in the army sleeping out in the open and throwing stones into the sea.There are historical tidbits about his show you might want to know. For example Marcus Agrippa and Julia are lacking three children in this show! They were babymaking machines in reality having one child back to back with each other. Also Julia was banished in 2 BC not 12 BC and her sons died in different years not the same year.Nonetheless I'd give it a watch if you want a bit of fun. It's long but certainly worth a rentit or even buyit cry. The DVD doesn't cost much so give it a go.".

There are certain sections in the movie which are very true to history. Some of them which are not true to history are not very important as well. Movie begins with old Augustus mourning the death of his friend son in law and General Agrippina with his daughter. Movies keeps going back in to long flashbacks. The transition is brilliant. This movie works for me at all levels acting camera characterization range and above all facts. I prefer an 'Augustus' over 'Lawrence of Arabia' for the simple reason it shows what happened and not an interpretation of the director. Some of the important details are missing from the movie which in my opinion is OK even if they are missing like Augustus butchered the son of Cleopatra and Julius Caesar Augustus's daughter was first married to Mark Anthony and Augustus's sister's son. I think movie wasted the character of Cicero but its OK as the movie was only about Augustus. The characterization was convincing. The whole section where Augustus assimilates power is very well done. Peter O'Tool as Augustus is quite good. Benjamin Sadler as Octavius is OK. Massimo Ghinni as Mark Anthony is very good. All the senate scenes are done in a very good taste. Good movie.".

So many other movies like the latest version of The Alamo had a lot of correct history but also showed things that no one could really verify like Davey Crockett yelling at Santa Anna commenting how short he was and before they murdered him he warned them he was a screamer.Fact or Hollywood? Just take Augustus for what it is and enjoy this epic with great battle scenes and done in the same manner as past greats like Ben Hur and Cleopatra. I think you'll enjoy it much better this way.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen lots of epics on ancient Egypt Greece or Rome the viewer is bound to be attached to some favorable depictiondepictions of a story and consequently make comparison. Moreover what we can observe in the genre is a selection of historical material. It's clear that some stories are put to screen many times while other ancient or medieval events which could be equally entertaining are entirely ignored. And that is what we find here  another film adaptation about the rise of the Roman Empire. Consequently a question could arise is there any point in making yet another movie about Augustus' reign? It seems that the persona of Augustus Caesar has been widely developed in lots of film versions from spectacular CLEOPATRAs to brilliant novelbased drama I CLAUDIUS 1976. In other words does AUGUSTUS 2003 by Roger Young offer us anything new? At first sight it occurred to me that the movie is practically yet another revision of what has already been said. What is more being watched by some historian it can appear to be discouraging for a person who notices quite a few serious inaccuracies. Just to note the fact that Octavian is depicted as a villager who finds himself once in the great world that Rome was and sacrifices everything to join his noble companions. Other errors include the depiction of deaths of Augustus' grandchildren Cassius and Lucius and the attempt on Augustus' life. The Battle of Aktium is skipped though it was so decisive for the events to come for Octavian and Agrippa. So we soon realize that the aim of the director was no history lesson since he takes much liberties in this case. However while looking deeper at some aspects of this film you realize that the point lies somewhere else.Roger Young's movie's strength lies in the the psychology the insight into the personal struggles of Augustus. Since it has a powerful tale to tell the director uses the tool to tell the story according to his own vision a story of a man who ruled the world but could not rule himself his own life a man with all his strengths and weaknesses a father who was forced to send his beloved daughter to exile a brother who had to sacrifice the happiness of his sister for Rome a husband who could not foretell the wickedness of his wife finally a 'god' worshipped by some people within the empire who could not avoid the necessary fate of death. What comes in the end is one man one life one death... All this is presented memorably thanks to flashbacks and Augustus reflecting on his own decisions deeds and consequences. And you as a viewer will feel empathy with him due to precious modesty portrayed in the end. But as far as the psychological reflections are concerned I would like to highlight briefly one more aspect...You can have some doubts as for the authenticity of some thoughts due to their Christian or as some people prefer 'modern' nature. There is a mention of love over power of forgiveness over revenge. There is Julia at dying Augustus to represent forgiveness. Even Augustus himself mentions the birth of a Savior while denying his own divinity... Strange... The story is set in pagan Rome where there was no room for Christian ethics. What does the director want to convey? What does he want to tell us by that? Could people who did not know Christian values consider them so seriously? Perhaps the universal presence of God's Spirit within humanity?... This is a dilemma that I tried to figure out and could not find most adequate answers to these questions.Other stories other plots are there as rather historical than historic. Yet there is a need to mention some of them. We have the aforementioned Julia portrayed by Vittoria Belvedere a tragic woman striving for happiness of love by means of decadence of lust. There is Livia Augustus' wife portrayed by sweet young Martina Stella and later by Charlotte Rampling indeed not that memorable as Sian Phillips in the famous TV series but giving quite a decent performance. There is beautiful Anna Valle as seductive Cleopatra and pathetic Massimo Ghini as Mark Antony. There are supporting cast worth attention like as Cicero. But no performance can equal to Peter O'Toole's in the lead. He crafts the difficult role perfectly making it possible for the viewer to understand Augustus to get his point to see the events in his way from his point of view.All in all does the movie play its role well? Not so much as an epic but it was not meant to be a spectacle whatsoever. It's worth seeing as a biopic of a powerful ruler and a simple man convincingly portrayed by a talented artist and a terrific actor. Applause Augustus Caesar! Applause Peter O'Toole! 710 for the whole movie".

Perhaps the universal presence of God's Spirit within humanity?... This is a dilemma that I tried to figure out and could not find most adequate answers to these questions.Other stories other plots are there as rather historical than historic. Yet there is a need to mention some of them. We have the aforementioned Julia portrayed by Vittoria Belvedere a tragic woman striving for happiness of love by means of decadence of lust. There is Livia Augustus' wife portrayed by sweet young Martina Stella and later by Charlotte Rampling indeed not that memorable as Sian Phillips in the famous TV series but giving quite a decent performance. There is beautiful Anna Valle as seductive Cleopatra and pathetic Massimo Ghini as Mark Antony. There are supporting cast worth attention like as Cicero. But no performance can equal to Peter O'Toole's in the lead. He crafts the difficult role perfectly making it possible for the viewer to understand Augustus to get his point to see the events in his way from his point of view.All in all does the movie play its role well? Not so much as an epic but it was not meant to be a spectacle whatsoever. It's worth seeing as a biopic of a powerful ruler and a simple man convincingly portrayed by a talented artist and a terrific actor. Applause Augustus Caesar! Applause Peter O'Toole! 710 for the whole movie";

If you find Rome an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy Imperium Augustus. But if you feel Rome is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome. I especially disliked Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drugsoaked sex addict. There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good and so are some others. But then... If you have come to know  and love  Atia as the super cool bitch you'll find the depiction of her in Imperium  as a tearjerking mother goose in an apron  absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. You'll find no interesting female characters in this epic. There's also the painfully comic Maecenas whom we see as a screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such he's once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annals.The interiors are rather meager and rely on clichs upon clichs. Cleopatra's big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an Egyptian theme park. There's a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics not up to 2003 standards.The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving. So we get a quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not. An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the eternal flame of Augustus. This affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tearinducing musical score. Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non English speakers.Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True there are more historical accuracies than in Rome but dramatically speaking it's plain boring. The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. Camerawork is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.There's really noone to love and noone to hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome there are much better films and miniseries around. Ancient Rome The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend.".

The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the threehour film but just to give you an idea...Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles. This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war. There had been reformers notably the Gracchi brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens.There are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period. Cleopatra with Richard Burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it is.Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production. I burst out laughing several times especially when Julia the daughter of Augustus meets a lover. They clutch passionately as she breathes My father... Ah your father your father.... your father would disapprove. Peter O'Toole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a nebbish  and the character is written as such  it's impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time.Charlotte Rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as Livia Augustus's wife with dignity. Had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity.There is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue CGI. Oddly this was made for British TV and appears to be a BritishItalian coproduction but is labeled with an R rating.The DVD picture is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk.Almost any Roman movie even Cleopatra or The Fall of the Roman Empire has more historicity  to say nothing of compelling drama  than this bizarre Classics Illustrated Jr. adaptation. This one gives new meaning to the muchabused phrase Based on a true story. In this case they could have said Suggested by real events.".

For those of you who have read seen and enjoyed I Claudius Julius Caesar and Antony And Cleopatra this film will be all the more enjoyable.In the other works I've mentioned Augustus aka Octavian is a peripheral character in the drama. Here the story is seen from his perspective in the present with Peter O'Toole where he is dealing with the problem of his daughter Julia played by Vittoria Belvedere in 12 BC. If you've seen I Claudius you know the story and the intrigues surrounding that. The slant is different in this her husband and Augustus's trusted friend Marcus Aggripa has died leaving her with three children. She now wants to marry for love but Augustus influenced by his wife Livia his second wife I might add played by Charlotte Rampling has her marry Tiberius Livia's son by her first marriage. However Livia as determined as she is to see her son succeed her husband she is not the manipulative monster as she was in I Claudius. That was author Robert Graves own interpretation.In flashback we see Benjamin Sadler as young Octavian who with his trusted companions Agrippa played by Ken Duken and Maecenas played by Ronald Barr as they first join Octavian's grand uncle Julius Caesar at his final campaign against the heirs of Pompey in Munda Spain. After that we see for the only time I know the events of Julius Caesar and Antony And Cleopatra from the point of view of Octavian. Those events bear very heavily on the reasons Augustus makes the decisions he does. We also see Sadler courting the young Livia played by Martina Stella who was of high noble birth and let everyone know it. This is the genesis of the character played by Rampling here and by Sian Phillips in I Claudius who was at one time married to Peter O'Toole.I made it a point to do some research Ronald Barr's character Maecenas and what you see is what apparently was. He's described as effeminate and that's putting it mildly. Apparently Augustus and Aggripa didn't have a problem with him hanging around and as a minister of the empire later Maecenas was quite efficient and effective. Imperium Augustus is one fine and almost flawless made for TV film it should have gotten theatrical release. If you liked those Shakespeare classics and Robert Graves' I Claudius this is an absolute must view for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what movie the first reviewer saw but it sure isn't the one I saw or actually he is ignorant of Roman history because it was seriously inaccurate. For one Soldiers in Rome were not allowed to carry weapons within the city walls nor did they work as police detachments to protect the citizens there were no police they had gangs and wards and mob bosses who were manipulated by the politicians. The battle scenes against Sextus did not portray standard Roman army tactics. There's no way an entire Roman battalion would be taken down by arrows as the movie shows. They used their shields like tortoise shells and had far less deaths by arrows that way. Also they wouldn't have thrown their spears at the approaching enemy rather they would have marched in strict formation with the spears sticking forward and move like a tank. Then they make Caesar and Octavian out to be peaceniks who only really wanted everybody to be happy and get along far from it. Pretty much at that point I gave up on the movie. What a waste of Peter O'toole's talent. I can stand a little historical rewriting in any movie but the producers obviously said to heck with historical accuracy just make a movie that will sell lots of tickets. But I'd be surprised if this made a lot of money because as a stereotypical ancient war movie it didn't even do that.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know what movie the first reviewer saw but it sure isn't the one I saw or actually he is ignorant of Roman history because it was seriously inaccurate. For one Soldiers in Rome were not allowed to carry weapons within the city walls nor did they work as police detachments to protect the citizens there were no police they had gangs and wards and mob bosses who were manipulated by the politicians. The battle scenes against Sextus did not portray standard Roman army tactics. There's no way an entire Roman battalion would be taken down by arrows as the movie shows. They used their shields like tortoise shells and had far less deaths by arrows that way. Also they wouldn't have thrown their spears at the approaching enemy rather they would have marched in strict formation with the spears sticking forward and move like a tank. Then they make Caesar and Octavian out to be peaceniks who only really wanted everybody to be happy and get along far from it. Pretty much at that point I gave up on the movie. What a waste of Peter O'toole's talent. I can stand a little historical rewriting in any movie but the producers obviously said to heck with historical accuracy just make a movie that will sell lots of tickets. But I'd be surprised if this made a lot of money because as a stereotypical ancient war movie it didn't even do that.";

My lord the dialog is horrifically bad. I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this. The constant exposition and pontificating grates upon the ears like fingernails on chalkboard. Ugh. Okay I exaggerate a bit but the dialog truly is bad. The HBO series Rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable regardless of their historicity.Rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes. The creators of this film did not. When Caesar attacks Munda the battle scene is practically farcical.I will grant that the costumes are perfectly good. The sets are fine though their CGI backdrops can be a bit jarring at times. The sound is bad thoughboth in terms of the music the foley work and the dubbing of so many of the side characters.Anyway it's completely not worth renting. As a history major I was hoping for an alternative approach to Augustus than HBO's Rome which I feel failed to capture his overall feel quite as well as they did Caesar or Antony.

I could criticize a lot of things about the film but I won't. The bottom line is that I actually enjoyed most of it. What does it harm is actually the animation.You may have seen other comments of mine where I dismiss the importance of animation style if the artistic vision is good enough. But with such a clich plot and with a designer such a Moebius anyone would expect a lot more from this film. As such it becomes a barely average family movie an attempt to copy the success of American animation films. You may think why not? Americans remake everything they see making money in other countries. but it works for them. Europeans want substance are used to interesting stories and have no idea what PG13 means. And you know the story of the copy of the copy of the copy after all.Conclusion for a story about a teen from the future going through a portal to an alien planet to look for his father and falling into a feudal intrigue between two factions of giants the film was ridiculously mild. I half expected them to burst into song at the end of the film. The 3D animation is caught between interesting world design and really shoddy technical implementation but it's mostly bad and uninspiring. The result is average at most and truly not a 7 but just a bit more than 6 which for me is a failure.".

What does it harm is actually the animation.You may have seen other comments of mine where I dismiss the importance of animation style if the artistic vision is good enough. But with such a clich plot and with a designer such a Moebius anyone would expect a lot more from this film. As such it becomes a barely average family movie an attempt to copy the success of American animation films. You may think why not? Americans remake everything they see making money in other countries. but it works for them. Europeans want substance are used to interesting stories and have no idea what PG13 means. And you know the story of the copy of the copy of the copy after all.Conclusion for a story about a teen from the future going through a portal to an alien planet to look for his father and falling into a feudal intrigue between two factions of giants the film was ridiculously mild. I half expected them to burst into song at the end of the film. The 3D animation is caught between interesting world design and really shoddy technical implementation but it's mostly bad and uninspiring. The result is average at most and truly not a 7 but just a bit more than 6 which for me is a failure.";

More specifically it's about a guy called Refugee who lives in a village on the IndoPakistan border and helps Muslim refugees from Bangladesh to cross over to Pakistan where they hope they will have a better chance of a life free from oppression. The first such group that we see him transport across the desert consists of two families one of whom is eventually revealed to be Kareena Kapoor under her veil. He takes a bit of a shine to her and she to him. Love blossoms and it is will do in these circumstances. The family settle in a village on the Pakistan side of the border and they meet up with Refugee whenever he makes the trip across.But crossing the border is not a terribly safe activity especially with Jackie Shroff guarding the Indian side and Sunil Shetty guarding the Pakistan side. One might expect that Refugee would encounter trouble with the law making these trips on a regular basis and indeed the guards are soon on his case. But the law turns out to be amongst the least of his worries in the harsh and extreme desert living conditions where war and hardship are a way of life.REFUGEE is a movie of two halves or possibly three thirds. We open up with an hour or so of character development as the romance between Refugee and Naaz grows and we learn more of the families and others in the village. In the second hour or so the complications that have been hinted at before start to develop and grow personal conflicts with others rise to the surface and life for our heroes starts to get tough. In the next hour the tension that has built erupts and the situation becomes desperate as politics and social turmoil overwhelm the lovers personal lives entirely all of which builds to an insanely incendiary conclusion.At 3 minutes short of the 3.5 hour mark REFUGEE requires a little bit of stamina but it uses its time well to flesh out the situation and the characters. The overall theme of personal happiness being stomped on by political issues is one that comes across a lot in Indian films.  REFUGEE tries hard to be fair and to present the message that people are people and killing each other over the concept of 'nation' is a terrible waste of the potential of life. In the end there does seem to be something of an India good Pakistan bad sentiment in the film regardless of its efforts otherwise. The film closes with a speech dreaming about a world with no borders No passport no visa... but one can't help suspect that J.P.Dutta imagines such a world would be established on India's terms rather than Pakistan's.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the success of Border 1997 J.P. Dutta came before the Indian audience with Refugee 2000 whose lead pair at that time was known as AB's baby the offspring of Amitabh Bachchan and Lolo's sis the sister of Karisma Kapoor. J.P. Dutta had planned to launch Amitabh Bachchan's son Abhishek through a movie  Aakhiri Mughal but due to certain reasons he had to shelve that project for good and instead he introduced him alongwith Kareena Kapoor the highprofile daughter of Randhir Kapoor and Babita and the younger sister of the top heroine those days Karisma Kapoor.All things said and done Refugee starts quite promisingly with the first encounter of the debutant hero and the debutant heroine with the illegal crossing of the IndoPak border at Bhuj Rann of Kutch. The heroine belongs to a Muslim family coming from Bangladesh and can be categorized as the Bihari Muslims who had to migrate to the East Pakistan later turned into Bangladesh at the time of partition of India. The problems and woes of the Bihari Muslims are very pertinent because partition did not help them and to be frank affected them quite adversely. Still the attitude of the Pakistanis towards them is negative and they look upon them in a derogatory way. Had the wellrecognized director concentrated on this relevant issue he would have made a much better and admirable movie. However he got confused between making a serious movie and a romantic movie. And it's this confused storyline of the movie which has made Mr. J.P. Dutta to fall flat on his face.The hero who calls himself a refugee because he does not have any name except this identity and carry the job of helping the willing people cross the border illegally to earn money falls in love with the teenager girl of the family whose marriage is the burning issue before the elders. The romantic track is definitely fascinating and the soulsoothing songs have made it all the more attractive and memorable. The dialogues of the movie penned by J.P. Dutta's father O.P. Dutta are also praiseworthy in this regard. However the rest of the movie is studded with utterly illogical sequences and incidents. The action sequence seems to have been inserted in the movie quite superfluously.The narrative and the treatment of the plot has a clear imprint of the moviemaking style of J.P. Dutta. However it renders a lesson also to the prospective filmmakers that the narrator should be clear in his mind as to what he has to narrate and what should be the logical conclusion of his story. If he himself  is not clear about what he wants to convey how can his product become a good one ? The actors have done their parts quite well. Jackie Shroff and Sunil Shetty being the BSF officials of India and Pakistan have done justice to their defectively crafted roles alongwith Sudesh Berry Anupam Kher and Reena Roy. An actor of the calibre of Punit Issar has been wasted in an insignificant role. However the best performance is definitely of Kulbhushan Kharbanda the head of the illegally migrated Bihari Muslim family. His dialogue  'Bangladeshi Hona Koi Gunaah Hai Kya ?' Is it a sin to be a Bangladeshi ? underscores the path which the movie should have followed to be a meaningful and purposeful one.Now for the young and fresh lead pair who was better known for its family background at that time  Abhishek Bachchan has done well in some scenes and is quite pathetic in some others i.e. he has delivered a mixed bag of good and bad performances. On the other hand Kareena Kapoor is so natural as if she were born before a moviecamera. I rate her performance in this very first movie of her as her best till date even better than that of her in Jab We Met.Cinematography and technical aspects are uptothe mark. However the unnecessarily intruded action scenes are not that impressive as in the other movies of J.P. Dutta. The length of the movie is also on the higher side. The climax is quite indigestible Kareena giving birth to a child on the border and looks ridiculous.Music is the biggest asset of this movie. The team of Anu Malik and Javed Akhtar has done a memorable job and Anu Malik quite deservingly won the national award for the best music director for his work done for this movie. The song Panchhi Nadiya Pawan Ke Jhonke is in my opinion one of the best twenty Hindi movie songs of all times. The other songs  Aisa Lagta Hai Taal Pe Jab Ye Zindgaani Chali Raat Ki Hatheli Par Chaand Jagmagaata Hai Mere Humsafar Mere Humsafar and Jise Tu Na Mila are also worth listening to again and again.I recommend this movie to all the fans of Kareena Kapoor and others too who are interested in watching a lovely love story blossomed on two different sides of the IndoPak border alongwith memorable songs.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding middle part surrounded by Hollywood clichs";
	schema:reviewBody "'Tears of the Sun' is a movie with a message and an interesting first hour but contains too many Hollywood clichs to really be something. We start with Lieutenant Waters Bruce Willis and his team of SEALS who have to rescue Dr. Lena Kendricks Monica Bellucci a priest and two nuns from a missionary post in Nigeria where murdering rebels are about to arrive. The priest and the nuns want to stay Kendricks only wants to come if the Nigerian refugees can come too. Waters agrees only to leave them behind as soon as Kendricks is on the helicopter. Then from the helicopter he witnesses the result of rebels passing by and in an instant he disobeys his orders and turns the helicopter around.This is the point where the best part of the movie begins. Waters and his team are on their own now leading the refugees to the border of Cameroon. The way his team not always agrees with his decisions but how they are loyal anyway is one of the interesting things here. Another is the way the movie dares to show the rebels and their actions things we see parts of on the news in places like Liberia and Sudan. It gives us an impression how hopeless the situation is in some parts of Africa. The distraction here comes from Kendricks who is an obvious Hollywood plot device. She is the possible love interest or at least the needed female character and she must annoy Waters by constantly suggesting things that even to her must sound stupid when followed by a lot of rebels. Never mind.Then the third act starts and the movie fails to deliver what it kind of promised before. Instead of following the dramatic path it changes into the kind of action film Hollywood likes to produce. A lot of gunfire explosions and bodies flying through the air. That's too bad since an earlier action sequence was able to show both the horrific actions of the rebels and the trained and nuanced way of SEALS dealing with a situation. During that sequence I felt a director Antoine Fuqua doing his job the right way making the movie very intense. He did the same thing for the excellent 'Training Day' from the year before. His third act of 'Tears of the Sun' was sort of like an introduction to his real Hollywood adventure 'King Arthur'.".

Sorry...couldn't resist.And since when was a movie so horribly horribly bad because it couldn't be filmed in the actual location?  So what if this was filmed somewhere other than Nigeria?  And so what if the music was not authentic Nigerian music? I don't remember a title card at the beginning of the movies saying it's a National Geographic documentary.This is a good movie.  Less action than many war movies and less thought than some political dramas.  There are good and bad people of all races. There's tension and there are explosions and gunfire.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was simply incredible. I didn't see it at the cinema which upon seeing it later on DVD release regretting missing first time round.It made some incredibly powerful statements and was very difficult to watch. I rarely admit to this but I actually found parts of it so moving that I cried! And I never cry.The choice of Bruce Willis was a good one and he plays a deeply conflicted character he plays him with depth. I have seen Monica Belucci in films before. She is an incredibly gifted actress and she really believed in this project. Her character comes across as having strong religious and moral convictions prepared to die to help and protect others. This comes across in the decisions she takes and the willingness to stand strong under pressure.Having seen the Documentary on the special features section of the DVD afterwards I could see the incredible lengths that everyone attached to the filming went to. Each of the actors playing Seal Team members went through some very authentic training in preparation and stayed in character outside of filming during the day. Given the commitment of all those attached to the film I can see why the film is what it is.The director Antoine Fuqua from the films I have seen in which he directed brings a strong moral theme to his characters and the story. The whole visual manner of filming camera angles close ups etc adds to the intensity here.The choice of filter during filming that gives a subdued and darker feeling visually was perfect. The use of Africans as extras was an interesting and a suitable choice given their backgrounds. Many of these extras were showing genuine emotions which was captured on camera as they relived traumatic moments in their lives when certain scenes were filmed.On that note one scene in particular made for very difficult viewing but totally in context and I would expect it would provoke a strong reaction from viewers for good reason. The actual combat scenes are kept selectively short and in context to the overall film. They are also very realistic. The soundtrack was well suited and complimented the whole overall feel to the film. I would not say that this film was entertaining it is very hard to watch but it is an example of good film that will challenge everyone who watches it and who has a conscience.After seeing this film as with Hotel Rwanda and Tears of the Sun I am constantly reminded of our individual and collective moral responsibilities in the 'civilised Western World' when atrocities are committed. And it sits badly with my conscience that 'we' in the West do so little and so late in trying to stop such genocide from happening. I for one think that every adult should see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "7.5 out of 10Tears of the Sun is hardly perfect.  Director Antoine Fuqua's direction can get a bit heavyhanded and most of the characters are one to twodimensional in development understandable given the large cast.  But it's a solidly made often thrilling and sometimes thoughtprovoking film that aims for serious issues particularly as a sober outlook of modern warfare and morals.  It's not entirely successful at the latter but to even attempt to stray from typical Hollywood is admirable and Tears of the Sun is often more hit than miss.Bruce Willis stars as A.K. Waters the head of a mission to retrieve a Dr. Lena Hendricks Monica Bellucci from the Nigerian jungle after Muslim rebels have just assassinated the presidential family and are on a rampage throughout the country.  Hendricks is located easily but she will only leave so long as all ablebodied individuals on her mission can come along. Waters reluctantly agrees but soon finds that he and his group must trek the jungles with no assistance and with 300 Nigerian soldiers hot on their trail.Tears of the Sun works as a thoughtful film but is more successful as a tensionbuilder.  Director Fuqua shows an able hand at building suspense to a feverish pitch all the way to the concluding battle sequence a fifteen minute setpiece that rivals any recent war film in both intensity and technical superiority.  The other major action setpiece is a tense shootout in a village the aftermath of which is disturbing in its revelation of the rebels' treatment of civilians.  Tears of the Sun is a violent film but never exploitative in its approach.  The film's two best developed characters belong to Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci.  Willis has always been a fine actor this understated approach has worked for him before and fits like a glove here.  I'm not quite as familiar with Bellucci who I've only seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf and as one of the brides in Bram Stoker's Dracula but she's quite good here easily the film's anchor when it comes to heart and warmth. I'm certainly not exaggerating when I say she's one of the most beautiful and bodacious women to ever grace the screen and I look forward to her in the upcoming Matrix sequels.  There are flaws such as the rather obtrusive musical score and some pretentious use of slow motion on Fuqua's behalf.  The film's biggest narrative stumble comes with a plot twist 34's through the movie when an extraneous plot twist is revealed.  Admittedly without the twist the film wouldn't have been able to build up as much suspense much less deliver that final battle.  But when all is said and done Tears of the Sun is highly recommended a Hollywood film that has more on its mind than explosion and gunfights which the movie still has an ample amount of.".

This films representation brought forth a perspective that showed a few sides to a mission. Yes there is the desire to finish and get out. But the film also showed that the situation can change on the ground as it always does and sometimes you have to modify. An seasoned veteran like Lt. Waters who is somewhat seasoned being a Lt. probably would have the foresight to say it is safe to go ahead and try and get these people to a border being that was the only way to drag the doc outta there without hog tying her even though the orders above were different. A team leader is expected to use some discretion and Lt. did that. Although it was borderline crazy operationally it still worked. Working in that environment is not just like a round of socom. Things happen and you have to do the best you can for the situation if it is feasible and you have the balls to do it. Also the depiction of the action scenes were practically dead on and impressive. Mr. Fuqua didn't cheese it up it was kept fairly raw and confusing as is a real engagement. The ethnic cleansing scenes well it doesn't get any more realistic than that. I can understand why everyone else hates America for doing these films about ourselves but honestly can you see a french film showing specwar going into save a village nope. They would hand out white flags to everyone. Maybe the Aussies Israelis or Brits but pretty much beyond those three countries thats all ya got. If at the least this is a reminder that even when you think you know about what our guys are doing in the world you don't know the halfwe lose guys everyday and people should realize that a silent war exists.".

It's not at the level of a Verhoeven action film or even a Cameron action film. It is on the other hand a good piece of entertainment with a decent and human edge with sequences that have been competently shot. Which puts it ahead of a lot of films on today's market already.".

I suspect one big reason is that they are used to seeing films in which Christians are shown as sympathetic victims of persecution.

The story gets a little too melodramatic at the end but it's tolerable. This is not a family film by any means because of the violence perhaps 20 f words and a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain.

	schema:reviewBody "Tears of the Sun is a lush violent and eventually frenetic film by director Antoine Fuqua set during a fictitious and particularly bloody Nigerian civil war. Using elements of the many real civil wars and coups d'tat that have plagued Africa the film develops from a plausible premise. Although it is an action movie overall with all the blood and gunfire one would expect Tears of the Sun does illustrate graphically the brutalities that are uncomfortable realities.After the democratically elected government of Nigeria is deposed by armed rebels and the country descends into anarchy an lite U.S. military unit is dispatched to evacuate four foreign nationals. With Lieutenant Waters Bruce Willis at their head the unit departs for the mission with orders not to engage the militia unless fired upon. The supreme confidence of the men assures the viewer that success is ensured.Reaching the remote encampment Waters and his men encounter a recalcitrant Dr. Kendricks Monica Bellucci who refuses to leave without 'her people'. Informed by his superiors that her patients could not be assisted Waters instead deceives Dr. Kendricks telling her that those who could walk could come. The three Catholic missionaries decline evacuation even though certain death awaits them. And so through the jungle they journey to safety with rebels in pursuit.The plot is quite simplistic but also inconsistent and often annoying. Dr. Kendricks seemingly cannot comprehend that they are in the most immediate danger consistently protesting that her people need to rest. Even after the group narrowly survives a rebel patrol she complains. Her belligerence is contrary to the overwhelming sense of urgent danger conveyed by the film. Presumably it serves to generate a tension between her and Waters that ultimately leads nowhere and certainly not to any romance.The first half of the film is set almost entirely in the depths of the jungle as the group moves towards the Cameroon border. It is quite slowmoving and repetitive as the group advances and rests and then proceeds again. The jungle surrounds are lush thick wet and dark and closeups are prolific as Fuqua attempts to convey a sense of claustrophobia. However little is done to endear the characters to the viewers. Willis as Waters speaks so scarcely and his portrayal so passive that instead of appearing curiously enigmatic he is distant and disinteresting. The neglect of character development during the early part of the film disconnects it somewhat from the latter half. The powerful and percussive African music largely fails to move the viewer and potentially poignant scenes do not recognise their potential.The film takes a sudden turn when the group bear witness to an unfolding pogrom. The soldiers having at this point already committed themselves to aiding Dr. Kendrick's patients are moved to intervene. Here Tears of the Sun rises above the prevailing mediocrity if only because of the scenes' sheer grisliness. The audience is successfully shown what is euphemistically termed 'ethnic cleansing'. Fuqua does not shy away from depicting the senseless slaughter and sexual violence that has been inflicted upon innocent peoples. With this scene the soldiers emerge as 'heroes' not because they were obedient but because they intervened to do the 'right thing'.The film from this point continues in violence and descends into an allout action film. The ending is reasonably cathartic the 'bad guys' are crushingly defeated in a display of pyrotechnics worthy of the Die Hard franchise and Waters and the group make it to safety  although not without losses. Water's disobedience is vindicated and the film alludes to its ultimate viewpoint  that American and indeed international intervention in crises is both desirable and 'right'. That the film begins with a title card of the oftcited Edmund Burke quotation  the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing  confirms the film's advocacy of this position. Incidentally Tears of the Sun was released in the leadup to the Invasion of Iraq. Tears of the Sun is a film best appreciated in retrospect.S. R. Watson Flinders University Adelaide".

	schema:headline " A propaganda flim for the war";
	schema:reviewBody "Tears of the Sun is a very sad movie that does justice to the title.  The story of Nigeria and bloody political coo that's major reform in the government was to implement genocide.  The basis for this genocide was ethic cleansing which meant if you did not believe in the same god as the rebel forces that were taking over Nigeria you were shot in the head.  Actually you would have been lucky to get shot in the head. Many were tortured and some even burned alive.  The women were raped and had their breasts cut off if they were nursing at the time.  The United States had a citizen that was a doctor working in a mission in Nigeria trying to help all the wounded from the bloody coo going on.  If the U.S. dose not goes in a save her she will be killed like everyone else.  I find the time of the release of this movie along with the attack on Iraq to be more than a coincidence.  The movie is all about the United States coming to the rescue and saving the American doctor.  The movie goes one step further with the special opts team trying to save the whole village from being wiped out.  The team puts their lives on the line to save the people by marching them to a county while they are being chased down by the murdering rebels.  The movie is one big piece of propaganda for the United States involvement not only in Nigeria but in any country in the world.  The movie depicts the rebels as heartless murderers who kill rape and burn every thing they meet.  The movie shows this again and again.  This is best depicted when the priest is praying and the general takes a machete and cuts off the priests head.  The camera work in this sense is amazing with a close up to the hand raising and grip tightening on the handle then has it as it falls to his head. The scene is cut to a tree filled with white birds all of the sudden flying away.  This might symbolize the priest's death and his soul being released to heaven.  The rebels were depicted as total animals but in most war movies the enemy is.  The other aspect that made this movie a propaganda film was the way the U.S. troops acted.  They were depicted as the people's saviors and they could do no wrong.  The U.S. soldiers did what was right no matter if it meant that their lives would be in huge danger.  This is repeatedly shown in the movie first by turning the helicopters around to pick up the kids.  Next by the soldiers going into a town killing the rebels when they could of went around the town.  It is also shown by a solider running back to grab a Nigerian women trapped by gun fire.  Using himself as a human shield to save her even though he gets killed.

	onyx:emotionText "Tears of the Sun is a very sad movie that does justice to the title.  The story of Nigeria and bloody political coo that's major reform in the government was to implement genocide.  The basis for this genocide was ethic cleansing which meant if you did not believe in the same god as the rebel forces that were taking over Nigeria you were shot in the head.  Actually you would have been lucky to get shot in the head. Many were tortured and some even burned alive.  The women were raped and had their breasts cut off if they were nursing at the time.  The United States had a citizen that was a doctor working in a mission in Nigeria trying to help all the wounded from the bloody coo going on.  If the U.S. dose not goes in a save her she will be killed like everyone else.  I find the time of the release of this movie along with the attack on Iraq to be more than a coincidence.  The movie is all about the United States coming to the rescue and saving the American doctor.  The movie goes one step further with the special opts team trying to save the whole village from being wiped out.  The team puts their lives on the line to save the people by marching them to a county while they are being chased down by the murdering rebels.  The movie is one big piece of propaganda for the United States involvement not only in Nigeria but in any country in the world.  The movie depicts the rebels as heartless murderers who kill rape and burn every thing they meet.  The movie shows this again and again.  This is best depicted when the priest is praying and the general takes a machete and cuts off the priests head.  The camera work in this sense is amazing with a close up to the hand raising and grip tightening on the handle then has it as it falls to his head. The scene is cut to a tree filled with white birds all of the sudden flying away.  This might symbolize the priest's death and his soul being released to heaven.  The rebels were depicted as total animals but in most war movies the enemy is.  The other aspect that made this movie a propaganda film was the way the U.S. troops acted.  They were depicted as the people's saviors and they could do no wrong.  The U.S. soldiers did what was right no matter if it meant that their lives would be in huge danger.  This is repeatedly shown in the movie first by turning the helicopters around to pick up the kids.  Next by the soldiers going into a town killing the rebels when they could of went around the town.  It is also shown by a solider running back to grab a Nigerian women trapped by gun fire.  Using himself as a human shield to save her even though he gets killed.  If the constant parade of the U.S. great actions is not enough at the end there is a touching scene in which there is a close up of one of the Nigerian woman the solders saved thanking the remaining soldiers and crying thanking them and telling them all are blessed by god. This movie is just the repeating of the same theme of the U.S. doing the right thing no matter what.

Anyway the movie as it is ends up being not bad.

The biggest weakness is that the characters are not very strong  Willis' character hardly says that much and you don't get a feel for his character Bellucci's statements and actions eventually resemble that of a broken record and the rebel commander pursuing the protagonists is given no personality at all.

	schema:headline " So why Nigeria?";
	schema:reviewBody "The makers of Tears of the Sun' blindfolded maybe just pointed at a list of African nations in which ethnic cleansing has taken place and landed on Nigeria? Actually Nigeria is as good a country to pick on as any. Rwanda Ethiopia Sudan and Zimbabwe are some other nations they had to choose from. Clearly the makers of Tears' wanted it to take place in Africa for noble reasons I'm sure. Hollywood has long ignored the tribal warfare and military horrors of many of its nations.But I wondered how close what happened in the film is to modern conditions in Nigeria. I thought there had to be a reason they picked it. For one I think they wanted a jungle nation. That eliminates Ethiopia and Sudan which are eastern high and dry nations. As for Rwanda also not a jungle nation the U.S. presence there in 1994 is still a source of controversy with questions about the degree of our involvement or lack of it. Also much of that catastrophe was aired on newscasts throughout the world. It's safe to say that the film's makers understandably simply wanted nothing to do with that nation. Then there's Nigeria. What takes place in Tears the source of the religionfueled ethnic cleansing depicted is a military coup d'etat. The truth? A civilian government exists there today although parts of Nigeria regularly experience localized civil unrest and violence including in the country's largest city Lagos. Clearly what takes place in Tears' though at least the events of the coup itself are modeled after Rwanda.The choice to use a real nation is curious indeed. To not do so would seem to indict all of Africa in the minds of those with a narrow world view surely a good portion of the film's potential audience. I guarantee the film will be the ONLY education many people who see the film will get on that country. It's as if the film's makers are saying 'Nigeria Uganda Rwandaone's as bad as another so it doesn't matter which we use.' As I said at the beginning if any nation deserves to be picked on in this way Nigeria fits the bill. The problem is that the reasons behind genocide in any nation in which it takes place are much more complex than Muslims easy targets these days killing Christians. In the film the only body commiting murder in the film are the soldiers. In Nigeria's history the violence has been largely tribes warring with each other with the military getting involved and sometimes according to whom you ask taking sides. What's happening in the film is basically a very onesided civil war which is accuratebut more times than not it's tribe versus tribe that produces the mass killings. By necessity the filmmakers must take an overly simplistic view of Nigeria's history of unrest. The film tells of a royal family democratically elected to office being assassinated. This as far as I can see from some researching the subject never happened in Nigeria. Military dictators were overthrown by other military men and sometimes the outgoing leader was assassinated. Nothing in the scope of the events told in Tears though ever took place. In fact Nigeria's current president is a civilian Olusegun Obasanjo who was the country's dictator from 1976 to 1979 was replaced by a civilian then jailed during the administration of Sani Abacha who ruled from 1993 until dying of a heart attack in 1998. Obasanjo was freed by Abacha's successor Abdulsalam Abubakar in 1998. Abubakar like Obasanjo in his time transitioned the country to democracy. Obasanjo ran in the elections of 1999 and won.What eats me about Tears of the Sun' and other war films like it Behind Enemy Lines' comes to mind is that just once I'd like to feel like I'm not watching an Army propaganda film.  Even Black Hawk Down' had a certain war hawklean to it. This is certainly due to the fact that cooperation with US Armed Forces is vital to the production of these films. Agreements are madecertain lines are not to be crossed certain information not divulged. But a piece like Tears' not only doesn't cross the line it comes off like a navy SEAL training video. A scenario like that told of in Tears' deserves better than the macho fronting the just doing my job ma'am' excuses for inexcusable behavior. Surely audiences deserve a better explanation for ethnic cleansing than it is what they do' as if the Nigerian woman has no idea why the Nigerian soldiers would commit such atrocities. If you're not willing to answer the question yourself then don't ask it.I'm sure Tears of the Sun' is supposed to be about how humanity is impossible to suppress even for the most hardened soldier. It's hard to believe they would stand and watch the ethnic cleansing take place for even the short time they do before acting. From where I sat there seemed to be no choice at all. The only thing to decide is how to stop it.  See No Man's Land' for a better picture of how it's impossible to get in the middle of a conflict and stay neutral.".

I do not want to give up hope and I have spent some memorably good moments there but I cannot but help thinking more often than not that Africa has become a basket case.

I can believe the movie is honest in trying to kick us a conscience with these images. They certainly are very powerful. But this honorable intention is marred by 2 things. One it is packaged into a very mediocre action movie woodenly acted with a script full of holes and an unbelievable but it is Hollywood after all ending. Two it is too topical. We are not looking at a universal conflict the two tribes are not archetypal for THE tribes no they are specifically named Fulani and Ibo in Nigeria and suggesting the Fulani are monsters and the Ibo innocent slaughtering sheep. Not so. It could easily be the other way around. By giving these very specific topical references the film compromises severely whatever universal message it might want to make.

I did not believe for one moment that we were in Nigeria. I liked the music but if it was supposed to bring a sense of Nigeriality across it failed to do so. On the other hand it gave a sense of Africa and as such the music came much closer to illustrate the universality of the movie than did the story.Still related to topicality but in a different sense the character of the doctor played by Monica Belluci was very unbelievable especially if you consider that her husband was killed not that long ago in a similar situation in Sierra Leone. I could easily recognize the priest and the nuns and their desire to stay. I talked to many missionaries who survived the massacres in the Congo in the sixties.

Lucky me.The plot develops slowly very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end. It is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like Lt. Waters would disobey direct orders. And even if he would if the rest of his platoon would. They know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our Lt. so let's do what he says despite the direct orders remember.Still there are some nice scenes in this movie. They somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels. Well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed. The strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind. They rather go on foot. Maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no explanation for it. Anyway. I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it.What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves. Only near the end they loose a few comrades. And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe that?They fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves. And they have rounds and round of ammo. Never run out of it. Grenades and claymore mines an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around or what? They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days. Really? Who think up this crap.I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating. If not skip this one. It saves you time.".

This film is as close as you will ever get to seeing a real SEAL team in action. You will get special warfare eye candy when the team does a stealthy assault on a village where some killing is underway. The way they move how they attach suppressors without being told to the tactics they use the way they deploy to cover a large area with only eight men the actual procedure of peeling off retreating later in the movie and many other small details are the closest I've ever seen that shows the general public what a deadly machine a real life SEAL team is. I give it the highest score. If you want to enjoy a good action movie with depth that is actually believable check this one out. You'll be wondering if is based on actual events. HooYah!".

The characters are stereotypical wooden onedimensional caricatures. The cinematography and editing are adequate to the job at hand  rescue a white female natch! French natch! doctor natch! with the walking sick and wounded from her hospital in the Nigerian jungle  and the special effects produce the required shock and awe from viewers no doubt.

Now it is a race across the Nigerian jungle with ruthless rebels chasing them. I'm still not sure if this is based on actual events I know that many countries in Africa have gone through civil war but I'm not sure about this.Bruce Willis' character develops through the duration of the movie from a hardened soldier to a complex caring character focused on saving the refugees. Monica Bellucci is making a name for herself with this The Passion of the Christ 2004 and both matrix sequels 20032004. The movie did not receive what it deserved. this could probably be considered the predecessor of Hotel Rwanda 2004 focusing on the same subject of genocide. The film is slow at some parts but the amazing battle scenes held in the forest and the representation of cruelty of the rebels keep the movie going. Some scenes are hard to endure the slaughter of an entire village including the children and babies. Bombs incinerating refugees as the run from the rebels.The movie doesn't stray from its point and the ignoring of the world toward the civil wars raging in Africa currently Sudan.Tears of the Sun.

And the story about the two brothers actually touched me.I will recommend you to see the film if you meet it at a festival. At least you'll get to see something you haven't seen before. ANd the Danish actor Thomas Bo Larsen who was also in the film Festen is brilliant as the big brother. I didn't know the other two actors but they were also giving good performances.".

These two elements themselves give the film a very special atmosphere. Maybe the experiment doesn't work all the way trough the film but at least it's very original. And the story about the two brothers actually touched me.I will recommend you to see the film if you meet it at a festival. At least you'll get to see something you haven't seen before. ANd the Danish actor Thomas Bo Larsen who was also in the film Festen is brilliant as the big brother. I didn't know the other two actors but they were also giving good performances.";

In retrospect I think this is due to poor marketing  leading the audience to believe one thing but delivering another! It really IS a good film  it has many layers and was even touching  but when you are mislead in the marketing department you are bound to have some unsatisfied customers!

	schema:reviewBody "Actually there have been quite a few features madefors and miniseries shot in and around Wilmington North Carolina as this one was. Wilmington has the second largest assemblage of studios in the country outside of Burbank. The problem is most of the things shot there are turkeys. Not including Crimes of the Heart and Blue Velvet and one or two others which my own performances rendered memorable. Considering the schlock as a class in itself this probably rates a B. It isn't as bad as it could be. Of course it's filled with clichs. Shoot outs take place in which thousands of rounds are exchanged with no one having to pause and reload their weapons.

Wilmington has the second largest assemblage of studios in the country outside of Burbank. The problem is most of the things shot there are turkeys. Not including Crimes of the Heart and Blue Velvet and one or two others which my own performances rendered memorable. Considering the schlock as a class in itself this probably rates a B. It isn't as bad as it could be. Of course it's filled with clichs. Shoot outs take place in which thousands of rounds are exchanged with no one having to pause and reload their weapons.

	schema:reviewBody "This fine movie directed by Howard Hawks is more potent for its absolutely dazzling aerial photography and filming one of the best I've ever seen  much better than the eighties Top Gun. First let me say the late twenties to late thirties was the height of what is known as the Aviator movie. Many hits were scored using this genre including this one which was a blockbuster in 1930. The thirties aviator movies in their flight sequences have a certain feeling to them. They are so realistic in look and this is achieved without music being used but just the whirring of the engines gaggling give it a prescient omniprescence that advances in movie technology Digital imagery and CGI can't duplicate. I mean any of the thirties aviator pictures sparkle in their flight segments. It must be the way they were shot. I wonder what technique was used. The story for this movie which won an Oscar was written by John Monk Saunders who obviously knew the genre well. He also wrote Wings the first Academy award winner Legion of the Condemned an even bigger hit than Wings with Gary Cooper Devil Dogs of the Air and West Point of the Air. The leads are Richard Barthelmess and Doug Fairbanks jr. Barthelmess gives the real performance here while Fairbanks gives the movie star performance. They are involved in WWI and are ace pilots and best of friends. The film has a pandemic tone and regurgitating pace that feeds the ennui of war. Like the pilots of Top Gun they tend to go against orders given by their boss silent screen leading man Neil Hamilton who has the tough job of sending men on their missions missions in which lives will surely be lost. He doesn't like it but he has to follow orders. That is the theme of the movie obeying and serving your job because it is necessary. Life is hard and fulfilling your functionrole against all odds is rote. Tough choices have to be made for the greater good. Cliche but true. That is the irony of war and when one falls another must takes his place. Barthelmess eventually takes Hamilton's job and in his shoes feels the pressures the man felt and the toughness of following necessary orders. It is not an antiwar movie more than it is a WAR IS HELL! but heaven is only one more day of hell away. Slow because of early talkie cameras which needed absolute silence to be recorded and were static without any movement but sets are highly believable and bombing raids uncharacteristically realistic. Dialogue though is a bit pedestrian with certain heavyhanded moments in today's glare and performances not up to par in certain areas but overall a fine movie.".

I'm taking one point off for that occasional overacting and for the really dumb use of Southern California semidesert topography in which the planes take off and land.

	schema:reviewBody "This is an early talkie starring Richard Barthelmess as Dick Courtney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Doug Scott a couple of World War I aces and the best of friends at least at the beginning of the film. Neil Hamilton police commissioner Gordon in the 60's Batman TV series is Major Brand in charge of handing out commands and assignments among his group of fliers. One day Courtney and Scott pull off a daring air raid that they have been ordered not to do by Brand. When they return their success causes Brand to be promoted just as he is about to punish Courtney and now Barthelmess' Dick Courtney is named as replacement and the new commander of the unit.Now instead of risking death himself Courtney is the one ordering others into harm's way and it is cracking him up as he turns more and more to drink. However he still has Scott's friendship until a new recruit arrives and is ordered into a fatal battle. Now it is Scott who not only has no use for Courtney but no use for life itself and it is up to Courtney to make sure that Scott doesn't throw his life away.This film like many early talkies is long on talk but short on the kind of aerial action you'd probably expect in a film about World War I fliers. Only towards the last third of the film do you see much in the way of dogfights. The focus is mainly on the fliers themselves and the futility of war. Barthelmess gives a great and poignant performance as Dick Courtney and he lasted longer in talking pictures than most silent film actors due to his great skill. Also remember that most of the films made about World War I during this time were essentially antiwar films. By the beginning of the depression WWI seemed a wasted effort in both money and manpower and these early talking picture war films reflected that attitude.The version of this film starring Errol Flynn is what most people remember. It's too bad this version didn't at least rate as an extra feature on that DVD. It makes for an interesting comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although William Wellman is the Hollywood director most associated with air films not counting of course the self indulgent Howard Hughes Howard Hawks with The Dawn Patrol and with Air Circus and Only Angels Have Wings can certainly hold is own against the formidable Mr. Wellman on his own turf.This may have been Howard Hawks's first sound feature and he debuted magnificently with a story about a group of fliers from the United Kingdom's Royal Flying Corps of World War I. John Monk Saunders wrote the original story for the screen that netted The Dawn Patrol an Academy Award for that category.The story centers on three men. Group commander Neil Hamilton who has to send his men up against some of Germany's best fliers and two of his senior pilots Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Hamilton is a troubled man indeed having to send barely trained kid pilots and he hears about it from Barthelmess and Fairbanks.One fine day oddly enough to do a daring assault that Barthelmess and Fairbanks pull off Hamilton gets a promotion up to the staff headquarters. In a curious bit of poetic vengeance he names Barthelmess his replacement.Of course when Barthelmess now is seeing the war from Hamilton's point of view he starts to behave differently. What he does and the choices he makes are the basis for the rest of this story about some of the United Kingdom's most gallant generation lost in the first terrible total war of the last century.As Fairbanks and Barthelmess criticize Hamilton in what he does I do wonder about when they were the fresh recruits.

	onyx:emotionText "Although William Wellman is the Hollywood director most associated with air films not counting of course the self indulgent Howard Hughes Howard Hawks with The Dawn Patrol and with Air Circus and Only Angels Have Wings can certainly hold is own against the formidable Mr. Wellman on his own turf.This may have been Howard Hawks's first sound feature and he debuted magnificently with a story about a group of fliers from the United Kingdom's Royal Flying Corps of World War I. John Monk Saunders wrote the original story for the screen that netted The Dawn Patrol an Academy Award for that category.The story centers on three men. Group commander Neil Hamilton who has to send his men up against some of Germany's best fliers and two of his senior pilots Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Hamilton is a troubled man indeed having to send barely trained kid pilots and he hears about it from Barthelmess and Fairbanks.One fine day oddly enough to do a daring assault that Barthelmess and Fairbanks pull off Hamilton gets a promotion up to the staff headquarters. In a curious bit of poetic vengeance he names Barthelmess his replacement.Of course when Barthelmess now is seeing the war from Hamilton's point of view he starts to behave differently. What he does and the choices he makes are the basis for the rest of this story about some of the United Kingdom's most gallant generation lost in the first terrible total war of the last century.As Fairbanks and Barthelmess criticize Hamilton in what he does I do wonder about when they were the fresh recruits. They became the veterans more than likely by sheer chance that they did survive. Yet that never plays a part in their thinking.The aerial combat sequences are excellently staged Howard Hughes and William Wellman could hardly have done better.

It's bloody suicide. Yet there is gallantry in the air and on the ground. Pilots who are going down in flames salute the enemy pilot who has brought them to this sorry state. There was little of that gallantry left in World War II except in one instance in which an American P47 pilot damaged an enemy fighter. The pilot bailed out and sailed past the American's canopy upright and in full salute.The British pilots we see  almost all of them American  are jovial enough in their day room or whatever it is. If someone is shot down the loss is overcome by an excess of booze and song. The gramophone plays a scratchy Poor Butterfly how apt and the men drink and sing The world is made up of lies So hurrah for the next man who dies. The pilots are in good shape pretty chipper compared to their commander who is filled with guilt and rapidly becoming a neural shambles. He snaps at the men barks out orders and has no sense of humor. The men can't understand this until one of them Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is promoted to Flight Commander and takes his place.The film is an early talky. There is no underscore we hear only the men singing and the gramophone playing. And it's stagy. There aren't many outdoor scenes the men swill booze and argue and play cards in the day room. The message itself is overstated.But ah the scenes of flight. Great whirling masses of biplanes some spinning down and trailing smoke. Lots of stunts with airplanes too. It's more like a comic book than like reality but well consider the period. The special effects aren't bad. More realism and a more complex message can be found in a relatively recent movie like The Blue Max. Howard Hawks is uncredited but listed as a German pilot. Well there is only one German pilot we get to see anything of. He's a victim of one of the fliers on our side and has been brought to the day room for a bash before being taken off to the Gefngnis where he must have woken up with a terrible hangover. He looks nothing like a young Howard Hawks. True Hawks was trained as a flier in the Army but somebody is pulling the wool over somebody's eyes around here.".

However this wasn't really a bad thing as the story itself did have more depth than the other two filmsfocusing on the pressure on WWI pilots and the fragility of their lives. In many ways it reminded me of WWII films COMMAND DECISION and 12 O'CLOCK HIGH because they too talk about the burden of leadership and responsibility of sending men to their deaths. So it's obvious that this is NOT your typical war is fun type film you so often see! As far as the film goes it was quite dandy but unfortunately the 1938 version really wasn't all that different. About the only noticeable difference was that more actors actually spoke with British accents in the remake. Because they are so very similar I recommend you only see one unless you are a real purist. And if I needed to say which one I'd say the later version is slightly bettermostly because it is a bit more polished. The 1930 version lacks background music something shared by most films in 1930 though otherwise they are neck and neck as far as which one is best. Interestingly the 1930 version also features James Finlayson of Laurel and Hardy movie fame in a supporting role.".

	schema:reviewBody "The troubles facing a World War I British flying squadron with a high casualty rate. It's a somewhat conventional war movie that's a little rough around the edges as an early talkie but wins you over with strong character work especially from the leads Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Richard Barthelmess and Neil Hamilton. Although the film could use some scoring to enhance the experience there's only a bit of diegetic music from the phonograph there are two fantastic action sequences with stunning aerial photography and stunts particularly the raid on the German camp. The handing over of power and guilt to a new commanding officer is an interesting device that I don't think I've seen explored in another film at least not quite the same way. There are some flaws a few poor performances and an overreliance on clunky exposition it makes me groan whenever I see someone on the phone repeating everything in question form What's that you say? We've got to take the bridge!?.

	onyx:emotionText "The troubles facing a World War I British flying squadron with a high casualty rate. It's a somewhat conventional war movie that's a little rough around the edges as an early talkie but wins you over with strong character work especially from the leads Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Richard Barthelmess and Neil Hamilton. Although the film could use some scoring to enhance the experience there's only a bit of diegetic music from the phonograph there are two fantastic action sequences with stunning aerial photography and stunts particularly the raid on the German camp. The handing over of power and guilt to a new commanding officer is an interesting device that I don't think I've seen explored in another film at least not quite the same way. There are some flaws a few poor performances and an overreliance on clunky exposition it makes me groan whenever I see someone on the phone repeating everything in question form What's that you say? We've got to take the bridge!?. Although ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is not a wartime film I think it's a slightly better look at the camaraderie and the stakes among flyboys largely thanks to the highpowered cast.

	schema:reviewBody "The 1938 version of The Dawn Patrol is one of those remakes which is a perfectly fine film in its own right but you do have to question is it necessary especially when it is largely a shot for shot remake with various changes made to the dialogue. The original Dawn Patrol from 1930 is a superb film to begin with and one of the better films of the early sound period. But do the technological advancements between 1930 and 1938 make the remake the better film or does the original still come on top? While I like both these films I have to side with the original over its more famous counterpart. However when your remake has Errol Flynn David Niven and Basil Rathbone I can't be too critical on its existence.The Dawn Patrol from 1930 was Howard Hawks' first featurelength talkie. Although his trademark overlapping dialogue is absent The Criminal Code made the following year would be his first film to feature this trademark it still has the Hawksian themes male bonding and the tensions created from a small group of people being forced together under an impossible strain. In both movies the squadron use humour to combat tragedy and drink to deal with reality which does raise the question of how they are able to fly if they drink so much? But I digress. There are also no women in sight both films are a man's movie through and through. There was no shortage of aviation films in the 1930's a world in which death was always around the corner. Simply put a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Both versions of The Dawn Patrol are close to the history they are recreating. Cast and crew from both productions had been involved in the war including Howard Hawks and Basil Rathbone. Watching a film about an armed conflict made by people who saw it firsthand really adds that extra element.Hawk's Dawn Patrol is an early talkie which I believe benefits from being just that. I know many dismiss early talking pictures as being static but some films from this period would not have been as effective in my eyes if they had been made a few years later films which benefit from the rough and gritty nature of early talkies such as war movies like All Quiet on the Western Front Hell's Angels and War Nurse or others like the prison drama The Big House. Due to this the original Dawn Patrol feels more intimate to me than its counterpart not to mention the sets here really do feels like they're being lit by the candles which appear on screen. The remake on the other hand is shinier and less gritty not there's anything wrong with that as it is a beauty of a film in its own right but original gets my vote when it comes to aesthetics. Surprisingly however The Dawn Patrol is one precode film which appears to be absent of any precode material making the process of remaking it in 1938 easier.Who succeeds more in the role of the Squadron's leader Courtney Errol Flynn or Richard Barthelmess? Barthelmess has a more gentle and more sensitive persona yet still commanding expressing so much through his eyes as he was a distinguished actor of the silent era after all. As strong as Flynn's performance is the contradictory traits in Barthelmess' Courtney makes for a more interesting performance in my eyes.The Dawn Patrol would be one of Basil Rathbone's few outings as one of the good guys well kind off he still has to perform the dirty work. It's interesting to see him playing a character who shows sympathy towards others and even gets revenge on Errol oneupping him when he gets promoted to wing and names Courtney in the new in command of the patrol. Rathbone also has my favourite moment of the remake a moment which isn't in the original in which his assistant Phipps Donald Crisp speaks of how wonderful it would be if they had a dog at the squadron headquarters only for Brand to be completely zoned out that he doesn't hear him only to then look over at him and ask him why he's pretending to play with a dog  a great piece of dark comic relief.But who comes on top as the better Major Brand Basil Rathbone or Neil Hamilton? Rathbone's Brand is more commanding and more in control even though we still see signs that he is at breaking point. Hamilton is less commanding and in control but this itself I feel makes for an interesting character dynamic as someone who in this position of reasonability but clearly can't handle it. If I was to choose however I would go with Basil Rathbone. While Hamilton's performance does have more to it Rathbone is simply a far more charismatic and cool screen presence.Who makes for the better role of Courtney's closet friend Scott David Niven or Douglas Fairbanks Jr? Fairbanks is an actor I've long had trouble even remembering in any role. I don't find him an engaging screen presence and will forget about his performance in a film as soon as it's over. David Niven on the other hand is an actor I have great esteem for while his reallife friendship with Errol Flynn translates into the film making the friendship aspect is stronger and more endearing in the remake than in the original. Fairbanks is my only big complaint with the original Dawn Patrol so it's David Niven all the way.The aerial footage from the original is reused in the remake and there is a noticeable difference in image quality between reused footage from original and the newly filmed material. Still is it an interesting side by side comparison of how movies evolved within less than a decade. The aerial action sequences are exciting to watch helped by the impressive quality of the footage while the lack of a music score and reliance on sound effects heightens the tension. I do have to ask though but can a single plane cause so much damage to an entire factory? It's still exciting stuff none the less.There are no good guys or bad guys in The Dawn Patrol. The movies don't take a side such as when the downed German soldier is brought back to the squadron headquarters. He speaks in German but from what I've gathered in the original version of the film he calls them friends and how the fighting has absolutely nothing to do with personal hate and that it is a sportgame and our duty as soldiers is clear.Would The Dawn Patrol be classified as an antiwar film? I'm very dubious of the term antiwar film and I feel throwing the term around willynilly as is often the case comes off to me as a form of virtue signalling. As Francois Truffaut stated war movies inherently glorify combat when they portray the adventure and thrill in combat. In other words there is no such thing as an antiwar film. Watching the action scenes in The Dawn Patrol I do feel the same kind of feeling I get when I watch an actionadventure film but then I have to remind myself of the horrors of war. Is The Dawn Patrol condemning war altogether or just the tactics used during this war such as the use of young inexperienced pilots? Or is it merely showing at the end of the day war is just a necessary evil?".

Major Brand Neil Hamilton is his commander who suffers under the circumstances that he has to send inexperienced pilots on those missions with the knowledge that every time his squadron is at least halved.The first half of the film we see the struggle between Courtney and Brand. The Major is criticized and blamed by Courtney for sending all those young pilots into their untimely death. Brand defends himself because he only follows the orders of his superiors. Then Major Brand is promoted and Courtney becomes commander of the squadron. Instead of flying with his pals he faces a career behind a desk and after a while he realizes that he is in the same position as Major Brand before him. He looses himself in depression and alcohol before operating in a final heroic flight.At first we don't see to many action in this movie. Most scenes are in Major Brand's office or at the bar of the airport. We see the companionship between the pilots but also the despair the fear and a lot of drinking. In the second part we follow the pilots as they do their missions. Taking into account that this movie was made in the early thirties the war in the air is very well pictured. Those scenes were used again for the remake of 1938. Still I don't think that The Dawn Patrol gives a realistic view of the lives of RAF pilots during the Great War. It wouldn't be possible to consume so many alcohol and still control those early airplanes to survive the missions into enemy territory.The film shows a lot of respect for the pilots but also for the enemy. When a German is captured he joins the drinking bout before he is taken to prison. The most striking moment in the film is the salute that Courtney gives the German pilot who has just shot him down. The pilots are portrayed as modern knights whose war in the air knows other rules and the dirty war on the ground.So in a year wherein legendary anti war films like All Quiet on the Western Front and West front 1918 were made The Dawn Patrol was already a bit old fashioned. Although the harsh reality of war is shown by the losses of young men's lives and the hard choices that the command of squadron had to made the film also glorifies the pilots their loyalty and their respect for their enemy.

Neither should be mistaken for the muchinferior 1940 Flight Command about Navy pilots which starred Robert Taylor. In either version Dawn Patrol is a stirring and exciting story of the courage shown by pilots who know they or their friends will likely be killed on one of their missions and the anguish their commanders feel when sending them to their deaths. Set on the battlefields of WWI it is filled with exciting and realistic because it IS real flying from the age of knights of the air. In fact whole sequences especially flying scenes and the climactic attack were lifted directly from this film for use in the remake. Although it's a close call I'd have to say this is one of the rare instances when a remake improves upon its predecessor and recommend the 1938 film over the 1930 one for the superior performances of the lead actors. 1938's Errol Flynn as Dick Courtney was more involving than 1930's Richard Barthelmess a veteran actor whose performance retains the somewhat stilted quality of silent film era. And although Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was excellent in the 1930 version as pilot Doug Scott David Niven in the same role positively sparkles in several more lighthearted even comedic scenes. And of course 1938's sneery Basil Rathbone makes for a much more despicable Major Brand as the story calls for than the original film's Neil Hamilton.Furthermore current as of 2012 releases of 1930's Flight Command  Dawn Patrol are not as visually clear in all scenes as the later version and also have a lot of scratchy sounds and low rumble in the soundtrack which are especially distracting in quieter scenes particularly since the 1930 film did not have a musical soundtrack. Hopefully remastered versions of both films will someday be available.Still this is only nitpicking as both the 1930 and 1938 versions of Dawn Patrol are excellent. But given the choice go with Flynn and Niven of 1938.".

The conflict is wellwritten and the casting is decent. There are also many great action shots such as aerial views of bombs being dropped and the resulting explosions.Unfortunately the movie is faced with many moments of bad acting. Examples of overacting overthetop performances bad deliveries and overly phony death scenes abound in this film. The attempts at comedy are corny and should have been left out. Melodrama constantly bursts into the picture with otherwise serious characters flying into say it ain't so! moments and don't tell me he's ggggone! scenes. At one point a soldier nonchalantly dives into an opera in an otherwise songless picture.Overall you could skip this film.

	schema:reviewBody "I had no high hopes when I walked into this film.  I like Will Smith I like Martin Lawrence so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny and then some.  It was action packed thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.Michael Bay former music video and commercial director has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn't actionpacked it is funny.  It is sexy fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. Bad Boys doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.Watch Bad Boys again and every time there is an action sequence ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level it introduced an new conflict it increased the present conflict it eliminated a key character it introduced a new character and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.Bad Boys of course isn't the greatest story on film or even in the action genre but what is so appealing and memorable about Bad Boys is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story entertaining and complete and leaves you very satisfied. Watch for Michael Bay because he is here to stay.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly wellknown there have been plenty of them all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are well buddies they act like friends to each other they get in fights they help each other out they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well Smith's the sleek cool one who is popular with the ladies while Lawrence is often nervous and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good onscreen chemistry too you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes and worse the ageold complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal but hey that's the only complaint about it and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy action or both. It takes off immediately and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are wellwritten well for stereotypes at leastbecause lets face it they are. The comedy is welldone and often made me laugh out loud and believe me I am not in any way shape or form a Will Smith fan. The action was welldone too intense and exciting. The film all in all was pretty good very entertaining. For a buddy comedy it's good. For an action comedy it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies and buddy comedies. 710".

	schema:headline " Finally a successful marriage of comedy and actionthriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This highaction crime drama stands out for me because it succeeds at doing what other movies have tried and in my opinion failed to do  integrate genuinely funny comedy into the mix. The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence  who have the ability to deliver crude rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless  and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry Smith and Marcus Burnett Lawrence who are a kind of toughcop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave slick selfcontrolled welltodo heroic and a real ladies man.  Burnett on the other hand is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively if somewhat ineptly through his work and his married life.So imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness Julie Ta Leoni that he's Mike Lowry  not just for a few hours but for a few days.  Furthermore this is no preplanned wellorchestrated masquerade.  A large stash of confiscated heroin has been unconfiscated right from police headquarters and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days or Internal Affairs is going to take some bigtime disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place and because of the one trait they share  a renegade approach to police work which may not have their boss's approval but which does get the job done and at one point causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him.  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option  Subsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. For all you action movie fans plenty of cars plenty of buildings and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  Looking over this review I see that I've belied the high level of violence which I definitely should warn you against.BAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm afraid I did have two small complaints however.  First I wish the resolution of the BurnettpretendingtobeLowry  story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. As it is the comic subplot ends leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion.  Second I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.Aside from that however this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.One final note concerning the DVD Special Edition release.  BAD BOYS was a movie in which the music was particularly effective and the DVD actually lets you listen to the music track by itself.  I wish DVDs of other movies with great music had this option. Three examples that come to mind are 48 HOURS KINDERGARTEN COP and another Michael Bay film ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.  KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate.".

The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option  Subsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. For all you action movie fans plenty of cars plenty of buildings and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  Looking over this review I see that I've belied the high level of violence which I definitely should warn you against.BAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm afraid I did have two small complaints however.  First I wish the resolution of the BurnettpretendingtobeLowry  story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. As it is the comic subplot ends leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion.  Second I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.Aside from that however this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.One final note concerning the DVD Special Edition release.  BAD BOYS was a movie in which the music was particularly effective and the DVD actually lets you listen to the music track by itself.  I wish DVDs of other movies with great music had this option. Three examples that come to mind are 48 HOURS KINDERGARTEN COP and another Michael Bay film ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.  KINDERGARTEN COP made me laugh but the crime drama felt like an unwelcome intrusion. In ARMAGEDDON I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate.";

	schema:headline " A funny thoroughly entertaining action comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys is a great action comedy from producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. It features Will Smith in his breakout performance and Martin Lawrence an unlikely pair who quite simply are the best movie duo I've seen since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The film features incredible action sequences i.e. the Ether truck chase scene featuring massive explosions and pervasive gun fights which all lead up to the film's actionpacked climax which could only be done in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. The film also stars Tea Leoni who is pretty good in playing the damsel in distress Joe Pantoliano whom we all know as Ralphie on The Sopranos as a police captain and Tcheky Karyo as the villain. He was also the French officer opposite Mel Gibson in 2000's The Patriot The movie features comedic oneliners from Smith and Lawrence as well as a few by Leoni. It also features a few sex jokes and just plain disses. However the characters are so underdeveloped that all we are left with is action and comedy. This formula is also seen in the recent summer blockbuster Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines in which we could care less about the characters and just look for the action. However Simpson and Bruckheimer's Bad Boys succeeds where T3 does not. By the end of the movie we care about the heroes because they are fun to watch. In T3 the great Ahnuld is just a figurehead for a movie romped with actionpacked sequences and jawdropping stunts. This is one of only three good Michael Bay films right next to Pearl Harbor and The Rock and should seen by any action movie fan.Lenny's Grade B".

I just can't say enough good things about Bad Boys.This is a film that works on many levels.  Before Bruckheimer and Michael Bay became famous and lazy and made disappointing flicks think Pearl Harbor and Armageddon they made excellent movies like The Rock and Bad Boys. First off directing is top notch.  From the getgo this movie moves along at a furious pace and Bay's trademark slowmotion closeup sequences are amazing.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence give firstrate performances as the supercool Miami Narc good guys.  The villain Fouchet is also wellplayed by Karyo. Of course there is the beautiful Tea Leoni.  The assortment of smaller characters like Sanchez and Ruiz Jojo the Captain and the goons add flavor to many scenes.  Everyone is just so cool and stylish.  I love Jojo the tireman!Action sequences are some of the BEST ever filmed.  The lobby shootout Club Hell and all the others.  Even the soundtrack in this movie is awesome. Mancina's score fits this movie like a glove.  And in between the action there is hilarious humor and some quite moving emotional scenes. As for style...just watch.  Miami Miami Beach Lowrey's black Porsche the clothes the bad guys the women...its all there.I could go on and on about every single thing that is so great about Bad Boys but I will stop here and invite all the action junkies out there to definitely see this!I give this movie 1010.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm pretty sure that BAD BOYS is the only film of Michael Bay's that I like. Well technically while it is the only Bay flick that I like I can also say that I LOVE it too! I know that it's supposedly a mindless action buddy cop flick but it is hugely entertaining and extremely well done. THIS is the type of movie where all of the Bay trademarks work the driving musical score the quick jump cuts between and within scenes funny dialogue which actually is funny in this film! strong leads some seriously sexy females and characters that sweat all the time and there's a reason for it here there in Miami!.Actually the jump cuts are a big part of why BAD BOYS works. They move the story along nicely and are perfectly placed during the film. Also Bay does a great job with the camera angles accentuating the scenes. You don't have time to think or analyze the action just enjoy. The movie moves at a speedy pace but not too speedy. And the scenes where the film slows down are all very well done. A really solid action film.The main reason to love BAD BOYS is the ideal pairing of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry two of Miami's finest undercover narcotics cops. Lawrence is especially impressive as Marcus Burnett with his hilarious standup routine being a part of his character but that's a good thing. He's a laugh riot throughout. But his standup act is actually toned down believe it or not perfectly to satisfy the constraints of a film they could easily have screwed up his character but Lawrence is extremely likable and funny without being too overthetop. Smith is very good also as Mike Lowry. He is so comfortable in this role that you could foresee a star in the making based on his performance here. Both actors give really solid performances and do a great job of carrying this film. I find Smith just slightly more believable as a cop than Lawrence but still I go with it bc the 2 have such great chemistry.The story is moot some bad guys confiscated drugs from the police station. The cops have to catch the bad guys and get the drugs back. That's the plot! Main reason to enjoy is the humor fast pace and chemistry of the leads. Typical cop buddy stuff. Been done before and to death but it still works in this film. We've seen it in LETHAL WEAPON 48 HRS STAKEOUT etc. In fact this may be the LAST really good film of its kind.Also of note are sexy Tea Leoni as an important witness the guys need to help catch the bad guys she and Smith should have gotten together in the end! Joe Pantoliano as the basicalwaysinafoulmoodyellingcopsboss Tcheky Karyo as the big bad guy himself and a host of great supporting characters most notably Sanchez and Ruiz the funny sidekicks to the 2 main cops Mike's doorman Chet who almost steals the film! and JoJo Michael Imperioli of SOPRANOs fame. The film also has working in its favor great cinematography showcasing the sights of Miami catchy 90s music and a memorable score all driving the story along. Bay can hang his hat on this one! It's a keeper!".

Why people like Joey Pants Will Smith and Tea Leoni ever signed up for this piece of trash is beyond me. I hardly know where to begin.First we all know that movies are shot scene by scene but rarely is it so apparent as it is with this movie. Note the instantaneous switch from broad daylight to night as Tea climbs the stairs to escape the bad guys before jumping off the roof into the pool. Huh? I don't think even creative editing could have melded these disjointed segments together.The dialogue is so bad that the writer should have been ashamed to put his name in the credits. With the caliber of people in this movie I KNOW they could have addlibbed the entire thing and done a better job.  And when Will and Martin go into their spontaneous arguments every time they are in trouble it just gets old very fast.The only reason I kept watching beyond the half hour mark is that Tea Leoni looked SO HOT in this movie.  But even that couldn't keep me from pulling the plug after around the 1 hr 15 min mark. I could go on and on but then I'd just be wasting more of my time on this trainwreck of a movie.If you like actioncomedy movies and or buddy movies you'd be better served by walking through that aisle in Blockbuster with your eyes closed and picking one at random.  Few movies with the possible exception of 8 Million Ways to Die could be any worse.".

Given how great of an actor Will Smith is it hurts me to be so negative but his acting is almost as bad as Lawrence's even for a Bruckheimer production.If you like completely ridiculous movies with plots that are extremely farfetched but have lots of crap blowing up and the sound on your TV is broken you may enjoy this film.";

Okay acting humourous and not too bad action. But as soon as Mike and Marcus started swapping their roles it got so bad  really bad. The story went nuts and made absolutely no sense at all  there are so many storyholes and ridiculous scenes the acting got absolutely worse throughout the rest of the movie and in general nothing made sense anymore. Why the heck can't they simply tell the truth? For example when Marcus got the witness in Mike's appartment  what the heck did he still play Mike there? And why can't this looser Marcus tell his wife what's really going on? Who the heck wrote this crp? I'm sorry. This is too sad. And what about that fact that two regular cops are driving a Porsche there? A bad joke? Was Porsche sponsoring this movie? Tea Leoni was horribly miscast. In the end where everything's over already you have the whole cavalry coming there. I've counted 8 police cars and one or was it two? helicopters. My god this whole movie is oh so wannabe Lethal Weapon it made me 1. feel disappointed since the movie started out very well and 2. puke when the movie was over.My ratings cast 310 bad bad... including Lawrence action 410 wannabe 'we is teh cool' type of brainless action story 110 oh my... directing 610 camera 810. That's all I can rate because the rest was simply ridiculous. Oh well there might also be that one thing to mention I liked the overall colour tones  nice and intense warm colours in some scenes eg. club at Max in the beginning and cold sterile ones in other scenes eg. drug labour. One thing for sure I am definately not looking forward to see Bad Boys II.Overall 4.510  NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!".

	schema:reviewBody "I like a good action comedy. I loved Martin in Blue Streak Big Momma's House loved Rush Hour Men in Black etc. These kinds of comedy's usually are very entertaining and do very well at the box office. I was very disappointed with Bad Boys. The script was horrible. The dialogue was either cliched strained or cheesy  mostly a bunch of mindless bantering and arguing between Smith and Lawrence that makes you want to fast forward to a good part but except for some action sequences  their aren't any. The characters were cliched as well but what was really bad was the plot itself horribly deficient and full of holes.Near the beginning of the movie Martin Lawrence's character Marcus Burnett has to assume the identity of his partner Mike Lowry Will Smith's character in order to protect a witness who saw her best friend murdered by some drug kingpins. Mike Lowry is the only cop she trusts and only knows him by name. Marcus arranges to bring her into protective custody and claims to be Mike who is indisposed at the time. In the process Marcus saves her life numerous times but yet for some reason doesn't tell her he is really not Mike. Later she meets Mike and the both of them save her lousy hide several more times. She obviously trusts both officers but they still can't reveal their true identities for whatever reason. She is beautiful but other than that her character is annoying and if they had just shot her it would have really helped the film.The two officers get into all sorts of problems attempting to pass of as the other and the longer the charade goes on the more you realize how little thought went into developing believable characters who react logically with their environment and situations. The film is an insult to anyone's intellect who has more than two brain cells firing.Don't waste your time watching this movie! It's not worth the 2 at Blockbuster.".

Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor were funny in their day.  Whoopie Goldberg has me in stitches when she is on stage or in a movie.  Chris Rock is an up and coming comic genius.  And the two guys in this film have me in laughing almost every time I see them on screen.  Martin Lawrence was the best part of Boomerang and in Bad Boys he is hilarious as the married side kick to Will Smith's bachelor playboy.  And of course Will Smith launched his career with this movie.  He is very funny in The Fresh Prince television show and he shows here that his propensity for comedy is excellent.  Together these two are brilliant one of the best cop buddies since Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh.Bad Boys is a story of two cops that have to protect a witness that saw her best friend murdered.  Her best friend may have had information on some guys that committed huge crimes that involved drugs.  Now it is up to the two heroes to try and crack the case and not get into too much trouble in the process.  There are so many cliched things about this movie but sometimes cliches are good if you have likable actors to carry out the script.  As in every buddy cop movie you have the two partners that are very different but have a mutual respect for each other.  You have the police chief that does nothing but tell them how much they have cost the department how they could be suspended if they are not careful and how they are the best at what they do but a little too care free.  You have the bad guy with the foreign accent who is charming and debonair but as deadly as a rattlesnake.  Take any good copcaper movie from Lethal Weapon Stakeout Beverly Hills Cop to films like Last Action Hero.  They all have the same themes but what makes them all good and that includes this one is how well they are executed.  A lot of the credit has to go to Smith and Lawrence but I also think special attention has to be given to Michael Bay.  He was a new comer here and he proved that he has a great eye for action.  The chase scene that starts in Smith's apartment and ends on the street where Lawrence almost dies is one of the most emotionally charged scenes I've seen in a cop comedy.  It kind of reminded me of Lethal Weapon 2 when at the end I thought Riggs was dead after his battle with the South African bad guy.  That had power this one is even better than that.Bad Boys is great entertainment and Smith and Michael Bay have become major players in Hollywood now.  This is the start of it all and if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it.  It is funny action packed and likable. You can't go wrong.  If you like some of the films that were mentioned in the review then you'll have a hard time not liking this one.  An excellent film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching Hollywood movies 6 years back watched some of the greatest classics and blockbusters of all times. Was amazed and awestruck that how was Hollywood capable of churning out such amazing stuff with such amazing consistency...but after seeing Bad boys and a few other disappointing movies I realized that Hollywood too wasn't perfect. Coming to the movie the plot was an oft repeated one of two cops pairing up both different in personas infact diametrically opposite and still great pals one has a wife and kids and other is single and hot the usual clichs. But that's not all that is bad about the movie... there is morethe silly dialogues lousy work by the lead pair the female lead has no clue what to say or do she often keeps mumbling and muttering in the background. Above all the scenes are illogical and can't be attributed to be the actions of sane people. Martin Lawrence does ok in his role but maybe he could have done better if he hadn't tried to fake that dialogue delivery style which looked very irritating and totally lacking in humor. Comic timing and wisecracks have to be differentiated from silly mannerisms and this movie is a big example of that. Will Smith is a little more subdued...but isn't able to emote much or come up with funny stuff. Ta Leoni has no role in the movie she acts in the craziest most insensible ways invites trouble each timeif it was real life she would have been killed the first time she tried to pull off those stupid stunts of hers not to mention the male leads who too are guilty of this!!! The wife too is shown as an irrational human being who would make unjustified demands on his apparently busy husband. The movie is about the most irrational and stupid people we are ever going to come across. They do all sorts of crazy and suicidal things at the silliest pretext and dumbest logic!!! I hope there are no people of such kind anywhere in the universe. About the director he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it everything doesn't have to be so dumb. Besides showing African Americans in such clichd roles just tarnishes their image. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE is the action scenes and occasional good comedy. So my advice is if u have better things to do in life don't watch it. If u really have to watch a movie then rent some old favorite rather than go for it. GOD SAVE YOU.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys unlike Bad Boys II that spawned from the loins of this film runs less then two hours coming in at 118 minutes.  The reason I mention this is because I wanted to start my comments by saying something positive about this film.Bad Boys is without a doubt one of the more insipid tasteless humorless comedyaction films ever to be put on celluloid.  Bad Boys is so bad it makes a film like Smokey And The Bandit look like Academy Award stuff in comparison.  At the beginning of this film we get a group of criminals led by the evil head criminal FouchetTcheky Karyo who are intelligent enough to steal 100 million dollars in heroin from a police vault.  Unfortunately for them they get away with the heroin but leave their brains back in the vault as they then become the stupidest criminals to pull off a heist since Peter Falk concocted The Brink's Job.  They kill stupidly and randomly starting with a girl friend of Mike LoweryWill Smith then one of their own guys all in front of a witness Julie Mott Tea Leoni.  So of course instead of going into hiding getting their job done and selling the heroin they decide it's a better idea to chase down Mott and shoot at some cops shoot up the city and make themselves as conspicuous as possible.  Compared to the actions of Marcus BurnettMartin Lawrence and Mike Lowery though these drug dealers are Einstein.Burnett and Lowery are partners who must find the heroin and the crooks protect Mott their only witness and do it within three days time so their department doesn't get closed down and they are out of a job.  We know this because their boss Capt. HowardJoe Pantolianokeeps calling them in to yell scream and holler this point several times during the film so that they couldn't possibly forget let alone the audience.  As if all this wasn't enough we get this totally ridiculous side plot having to do with mistaken identity that is straight out of an old Doris DayRock Hudson movie.  Why they put it in this film is beyond me and totally unnecessary.  It does give Martin Lawrence a chance to do mug for the camera act stupid and annoying sort of like Jerry Lewis in some of his worst movies.The only interesting worthwhile actor in this film is Tea Leoni but they give her a case of the stupids along with everyone else so her performance is wasted.  Martin I never met a four letter word that wasn't funny Lawrence seems to have most of the screen time and it is excruciating to watch.  Will Smith isn't quite as bad but he just phones this one in and appears disinterested throughout.  The so called banter between Lowery and Burnett is never funny just forced.  There is no rapport at all between them.Michael Bay might know how to stage an action sequence he just doesn't know how to film one.  He seems to think that action sequences are the same as a music video filming them with quick cuts shaky camera incomprehensible closeups at crucial moments slow motion of Burnett and Lowery firing their Weapons so that when there is something going on it's unwatchable to the audience.  It is incomprehensible that this film did as well as it did.  It's amazing what star power will do I guess.  Worst then that and even more astonishing is that this mess bred a more inept sequel.  At least we had eight peaceful years before Bruckheimer and Bay dropped the second bomb.  Be thankful for small favors.".

So of course instead of going into hiding getting their job done and selling the heroin they decide it's a better idea to chase down Mott and shoot at some cops shoot up the city and make themselves as conspicuous as possible.  Compared to the actions of Marcus BurnettMartin Lawrence and Mike Lowery though these drug dealers are Einstein.Burnett and Lowery are partners who must find the heroin and the crooks protect Mott their only witness and do it within three days time so their department doesn't get closed down and they are out of a job.  We know this because their boss Capt. HowardJoe Pantolianokeeps calling them in to yell scream and holler this point several times during the film so that they couldn't possibly forget let alone the audience.  As if all this wasn't enough we get this totally ridiculous side plot having to do with mistaken identity that is straight out of an old Doris DayRock Hudson movie.  Why they put it in this film is beyond me and totally unnecessary.  It does give Martin Lawrence a chance to do mug for the camera act stupid and annoying sort of like Jerry Lewis in some of his worst movies.The only interesting worthwhile actor in this film is Tea Leoni but they give her a case of the stupids along with everyone else so her performance is wasted.  Martin I never met a four letter word that wasn't funny Lawrence seems to have most of the screen time and it is excruciating to watch.  Will Smith isn't quite as bad but he just phones this one in and appears disinterested throughout.  The so called banter between Lowery and Burnett is never funny just forced.  There is no rapport at all between them.Michael Bay might know how to stage an action sequence he just doesn't know how to film one.  He seems to think that action sequences are the same as a music video filming them with quick cuts shaky camera incomprehensible closeups at crucial moments slow motion of Burnett and Lowery firing their Weapons so that when there is something going on it's unwatchable to the audience.  It is incomprehensible that this film did as well as it did.  It's amazing what star power will do I guess.  Worst then that and even more astonishing is that this mess bred a more inept sequel.  At least we had eight peaceful years before Bruckheimer and Bay dropped the second bomb.  Be thankful for small favors.";

After this one I think Michael Bay has been cemented in my mind as one of the worst directors of all time. As you can tell I'm not one of his fans. This time he has taken a couple of pretty appealing movie stars and turned them into worthless action heros with the occasional oneliner thrown in Aka Travolta  Cage w FaceOff. This time he's done it with Will Smith  Martin Lawrence. He has the unique ability of spending lots of money blowing things up and devoiding the audience of all caring for it's characters. This movie is about a bickering cop due who become involved in a major drug deal and protecting a witness played by Tea Leoni. She provides some of the only nice moments in the movie with some witty lines despite her weak character. Smith  Martin bicker throughout the whole movie their cop boss yell at them a few times things blow up there are a few car chases people get killed and the good guys end up winners in the end. That's about it for this mindless actioncomedy movie from one of the biggest money wasting directors of our time who has very little good stuff to show for it. America please give up on this genre and this director before we all go bankrupt!!".

	schema:headline " An Underrated Little Gem";
	schema:reviewBody "It is little surprising that a movie with such a controversial title has attracted so much criticism over the years. Peter Richardson and Pete Richens' 1991 film is a comedy drama which stars Robbie Coltrane as Dave Albinizi a well meaning but unorthodox Catholic priest who seems to spend more time doing mechanical work than doing his sermons. It was originally intended to start life in the late '80's as an edition of 'The Comic Strip Presents' entitled 'Five Go To Hell' but the project was shelved following the poor box office performance of Richardson's 1987 film 'Eat The Rich'. Instead Richardson and Richens conjured a film out of the project.Though building up a following at the time 'The Pope Must Die' seems to have vanished into obscurity. With the P.C brigade cracking down on everything it seems highly unlikely that we will ever see a DVD release or even a satellite repeat of this film in the near future. A pity as 'The Pope Must Die' is a superb little work of art with wonderful one liners sprinkled more than generously throughout as well as a generous helping of dramatic moments.Following the death of Pope Pius The Vatican are on the lookout for a new pontiff. Cardinal Rocco who is in cahoots with Mafia boss Vitorio Corelli suggests that silverhaired Father Albini  who Corelli wants to use to embezzle money from the Vatican bank  should be the new pope. However the deaf secretary of the College of Cardinals Fr. Rookie mishears the name and writes down in the official election results book that Albinizi  who has been fired from his position at an Italian orphanage  is to be the new holy father.One day out of the blue an attractive young woman appears in the papal apartment disguised as a nun. This is Veronica Don Dante Dave's exlover whose rock star son Joe Don Dante  who turns out to be Dave's illegitimate son  is in a relationship with Corelli's daughter Luccia. Angered at the thought of his daughter in the hands of a rock star Corelli hires a pair of bumbling thugs to kill Joe which they do. Unfortunately they end up killing Luccia as well.Robbie Coltrane's performance as Albinizi is wonderful to say the least. Coltrane was no stranger to poking fun at religion  he played Orangeman Mason Boyne in the BBC Scotland sketch show 'Laugh??? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee' and the year before this film played bank robber Charlie McManus who along with his partnerincrime Brian Hope  played by Eric Idle  disguised himself as a nun to avoid imprisonment in 'Nuns On The Run'. Also of good value is beautiful Berverly D'Angelo. This fine actress is a natural when it comes to comedy  watch her in 'High Spirits' and 'Every Which Way But Loose' for proof of that . John Sessions  who also starred in 'Laugh??? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee' with Coltrane  and Steven O'Donnell were hilarious as Corelli's thugs who in terms of incompetence could give Harry and Marv from 'Home Alone' a run for their money. As Corelli the late Herbert Lom sent shivers down the spine with his cold eyes and gruff voice. Impressive in their supporting roles also were Alex Rocco Paul Bartel Ade Edmondson Salvatore Cascio Janez Vajevec Balthazar Getty and also the film's cocreator Peter Richardson. Appearing in lesser roles were Annette Crosbie Ernest Clark Niall Buggy and William Hootkins.The film was a hit all over the world especially in America  where it was titled 'The Pope Must Diet'  and Yugoslavia  where it was titled 'Sleeping With The Fishes' . The film is also notable for Coltrane's hilarious rendition of Pat Boone's 'Speedy Gonzales' which was later released on LP along with the movie's theme music. If by some miracle you can get your hands on this film I would highly recommend it. Never mind what those P.C bores say just get stuck in and watch it!".

The movie has not garner greater appreciation due to its touchy subject matter. Or it may be the story hits a little to close to home. The story is loosely based on the disputed account of the death of Pope John Paul I. The way this account goes Pope John Paul I was horrified at the multiple scandals occurring at the Vatican Bank and wanted them stopped until he died under suspicious circumstances after only being Pope for fortyfive days.While this may be considered a spoiler it actually is not. The real value in the movie are in the comic performances. Herbert Lom is at his slimiest best as the gangster kingpin in charge of the corruption in the Vatican Bank. Alex Rocco who played Moe Green in the Godfather is absolutely over the top as a corrupt Cardinal. The other supporting roles are simply hilarious. Robbie Cochrane is good as the bumbling priest who is accidentally elected Pope. To be honest the performances of Lom and Rocco overshadow Cochrane's lead role. My best advice is that if you did not like Monty Python's Life of Brian you will definitely not like this film. On the other hand if you can get past the subject matter the movie will give you many good laughs.".

	schema:headline " Has the potential for great religious satire but eventually falls flat";
	schema:reviewBody "Religion has always been a contentious subject and yet one ripe for satirical comedy which has been the subject in more recent years with Kevin Smith's Dogma and Four Lions springing readily to mind. It was one however that writers Peter Richardson and Pete Richens had failed to tackle on the small screen with their anarchic and predominantly satirical The Comic Strip Presents...series of short films. Choosing to satirize Catholicism with their third full length feature film after The Supergrass and Eat the Rich and having frequently collaborated on together with the results being decidedly hit and miss but when they really hit at times they really could hit. It's with some semblance of good will that I approached The Pope Must Die with some semblance of good will hoping that it might be rewarded. With Robbie Coltrane in the title role as the eponymous now pope C. David Dave Albinizi a dedicated priest who before his appointment to pontiff works in a Italian orphanage run by Nuns and who's unconventional methods raise the ire of the Mother Superior veteran actress Annette Crosbie of One Foot in the Grave and Dr. Finlay fame. A clerical error upon the death of the last Pope finds the small time priest in the hallowed position which proves timely as he was given his marching orders by his boss. Meanwhile head Italian mafioso Vitorrio Corelli Herbet Lom who has insinuated his influence in to the Catholic Church which has become rife with corruption and wants to see the new Pope taken care of is enraged that the wrong man has been given the role having his eyes set on another to fill the vacancy. There is at the heart of the film the potential for some great satire and with Coltrane who as he invariably does making for a likeable leading man who brings considerable warmth and conviction to Albinizi. It does indeed get off to a promising start with the early scenes being fairly engaging and the absurdest nature of it's humour which was a often a mainstay of Richardson and Richens work with The Comic Strip team which Richardson was the founding member working well and it does raise a few chuckles. As a biting satire on the inner workings of the Vatican and allegations of corruption which have dogged the institution for decades and which ranks as only just one of it's misdemeanors over the years it feels like something of a wasted opportunity. While there are early hints at the biting edge that we've come to expect it proves to later be decidedly unfocused and rather shallow as if they're holding back which gets in the way of the political and social commentary. Comically over the top characters that permeate the films narrative although initially raising a smile do begin to wear pretty thin as does the plot which just goes from absurd to plain ridiculous with it's plot developing in to a bit of a contrived shambles in it's final act by which point it feels like it has descended in to a one joke concept that has ran out steam. Not even the scene's involving John Sessions and Steven O' Donnell as two bungling hitmen sent to carry out Corelli's dirty work despite the efforts of both actors do much if anything to raise laughs with any attempts at doing so feeling forced. All the while Adrian Edmondson who a Comic Strip regular and writer along with Richardson and Richens feels underused and wasted as a hardd of hearing Vatican Priest who delivers some of the movies few laughs. With Paul Bartel and yes Peter Richardson who makes more of an effort on screen than he clearly has on the paper doing the best they can to strain laughs from the flimsy script but it's ultimately a losing battle. The Pope Must Die although not the worst of the movies that both Richardson and Richens cinematic collaborations with their later attempts at satire proving even less successful with Churchhill The Hollywood Years which bombed at the box office thirteen years later proving to be arguably the nadir of their respective careers. It does after all benefit from the reliable presence of Coltrane as it does the rest of it's strong cast but even they cannot prevent it from being something that could have been so much more than it is and lacks the innovative searing wit that was better served on the small screen than it was on the big.".

As a biting satire on the inner workings of the Vatican and allegations of corruption which have dogged the institution for decades and which ranks as only just one of it's misdemeanors over the years it feels like something of a wasted opportunity. While there are early hints at the biting edge that we've come to expect it proves to later be decidedly unfocused and rather shallow as if they're holding back which gets in the way of the political and social commentary. Comically over the top characters that permeate the films narrative although initially raising a smile do begin to wear pretty thin as does the plot which just goes from absurd to plain ridiculous with it's plot developing in to a bit of a contrived shambles in it's final act by which point it feels like it has descended in to a one joke concept that has ran out steam. Not even the scene's involving John Sessions and Steven O' Donnell as two bungling hitmen sent to carry out Corelli's dirty work despite the efforts of both actors do much if anything to raise laughs with any attempts at doing so feeling forced. All the while Adrian Edmondson who a Comic Strip regular and writer along with Richardson and Richens feels underused and wasted as a hardd of hearing Vatican Priest who delivers some of the movies few laughs. With Paul Bartel and yes Peter Richardson who makes more of an effort on screen than he clearly has on the paper doing the best they can to strain laughs from the flimsy script but it's ultimately a losing battle. The Pope Must Die although not the worst of the movies that both Richardson and Richens cinematic collaborations with their later attempts at satire proving even less successful with Churchhill The Hollywood Years which bombed at the box office thirteen years later proving to be arguably the nadir of their respective careers. It does after all benefit from the reliable presence of Coltrane as it does the rest of it's strong cast but even they cannot prevent it from being something that could have been so much more than it is and lacks the innovative searing wit that was better served on the small screen than it was on the big.";

	schema:reviewBody "The film's underlying connection is obviously the lot of zombie films which have filled the last decades since Romero's Night of the Living Dead 1968.

So you get the feeling of what's like to be one of the evil kind. And in this it's pretty funny because there are many scenes in which the teenage actors are reacting unexpected but never miss the point to be what they are a bunch of maturing youths whose only interests are in women booze and party! So you better won't expect to find any trace of subtile characterplay or the tragic evaluation of one's unforgiving fate  what doesn't mean that there are no interesting storybends in it. You bet they are! The cast is fine with me with the special appearance of Sissi Perlinger a more or less well known comedian as waytocool mother. Moments of blood  gore are limited for which it's not the film's intention to shock you out of your skin and also the brief nudity is way too normal nowadays. The German rating is 12 PG and nothing to discuss about. Interestingly there this a similar film out now with the title Shaun of the dead which takes on the funny sides of zombiefilms too although it has a better making and the puns are more precise than in this one. But hey it's a German film alright? What else should one expect from a small budget and trivial story?

It's almost impossible to accept such a thing exists and yet here's Mathias Dinter's Night of the Living Dorks! I swear unless you absolutely have no sense of humor in you you can't but enjoy this silly story about three typical German highschool nerds that suddenly move up the social ladder because they have the strength and advantages of the living dead. In a desperate attempt to conquer a girl's heart and body Philip and his friends Konrad and Wurst what's in a name undergo a voodoo ritual and become soiled by the ashes of a dead Haitian zombie. There's no result at first but after a car accident our jolly trio is immune to pain and has developed an insatiable desire for raw meat.

This lightheaded and spirited production contains all the necessary ingredients to guarantee brainless entertainment and yet a lot more too. Whereas other German movies are frequently uptight no offense to any German readers... Night of the Living Dorks specifically focuses on laughing with stereotypes and even the country's own national history. All the gags and references towards classic films in the script already featured in previous zombie comedies and yet this movie still feels fresh and innovating. Even the jokes that aren't zombierelated like softdrug usage or the crush on teachersyndrome are effective and will make you chuckle. The acting of the boys is pretty good while the girls all look ravishing and show quite a bit of naked flesh. The gory situations aren't as outrageous as I thought which is probably due to the German rating system but there certainly is some nice sloth to enjoy. Many will disagree maybe but I think this pleasant German surprise doesn't have to yield much to similar movies like Shaun of the Dead Return of the Living Dead or The Dead Hate The Living.

	schema:headline " Definitely funny if a little too much like an American teen flick";
	schema:reviewBody "As others have said this is kind Revenge of the Nerds meets Night of the Living Dead. It's also kind of sweet and romantic in a way. It kind of reminded me of Bob Balaban's underrated horrorcomedy My Boyfriend's Back released about ten years ago or Idle Hands a little more recently. After participating in a hilariously screwedup graveyard ritual with some halfassed satanists three nerdy losers are killed in car accident which results from a hilarious bongrelated mishap and come back to life as zombies. They decide to use their undead abilities to get revenge on their enemies and chase after the girls of their dreams.To this movie's credit it's very funny and all the characters especially the three protagonists are welldrawn and likable. There's also some subtle jokes like the characters attending Friedrich Nietzsche High School which actually might not be a joke in Germany and the homosexual gym teacher named Mr. Stalin. The downside though is it's a little too much like a modernday American teen movie which makes it pretty ironic that Hollywood is apparently going to remake this. The teens are ridiculously horny even by teenage standards and there is no end to the grossout sexually related humor yet there is also very little female nudity. The main protagonist is in love with an icy Aryan blonde but in typical Hollywood teen movie fashion doesn't seem to notice that the goth girlnextdoor who taught him how to kiss is absolutely gorgeous. I also wish it were even more politically incorrectthe funniest scenes are the ones Hollywood would have been too leery to put in a teen movie like the irresponsible dope smoking while driving or the scene where the dimwitted satanists accidentally draw a Star of David instead of a pentagram The only thing you're going to summon with that is the Jewish Council!.If you are going to watch a modernday teenage movie though you could certainly do worse than this a lot worse.".

	onyx:emotionText "As others have said this is kind Revenge of the Nerds meets Night of the Living Dead. It's also kind of sweet and romantic in a way. It kind of reminded me of Bob Balaban's underrated horrorcomedy My Boyfriend's Back released about ten years ago or Idle Hands a little more recently. After participating in a hilariously screwedup graveyard ritual with some halfassed satanists three nerdy losers are killed in car accident which results from a hilarious bongrelated mishap and come back to life as zombies. They decide to use their undead abilities to get revenge on their enemies and chase after the girls of their dreams.To this movie's credit it's very funny and all the characters especially the three protagonists are welldrawn and likable. There's also some subtle jokes like the characters attending Friedrich Nietzsche High School which actually might not be a joke in Germany and the homosexual gym teacher named Mr. Stalin.

It is obviously made like productions from America but with an unique German approach so it isn't a copy but a distinct work.It is simply an enjoying movie with funny dialogs silly situations and some slapstick in a positive manner. Of course you can call the humor not very subtly although it's sometimes almost black but remember the target audience. And who would call Monty Python subtly ? The youngster's acting is convincing especially Thomas Schmieder as Konrad but also Manuel Cortez as Wurst and Tino Mewes as Philip and the supporting actors. It is a lightfooted and fast comedy with some clichs but obviously made with heart and soul. The clichs do their work and are not disturbing. The whole team is mastering the task with pleasure for them and for us. It is a shame that this movie didn't get the success it deserves in Germany.".

There was no bad acting in this movie at all. The actors were all very natural and seemed like real teenagers despite the fantastic situations they were in. Anyway when this film will reach DVD on North American shores is hard to tell but if you like 80'sstyle teen comedy flicks and are a fan of zombies and gore there are some gross and violent scenes but nothing as extreme as what you'd see in a Romero film and they're mostly played for laughs then this film is good for a laugh and worth renting. It's certainly better than most teen flicks coming out of Hollywood these days!".

And this film does play like a nutty hybrid of Revenge of the Nerds and Night of the Living Dead and it's joyfully naughty undemanding fun.This particular horror spoofsend up takes place in suburban Germany focusing on group of unpopular high school geeks in all their individual expected ways. The sortof leader of this hapless gang is Phillip Tino Mewes a mildly neurotic teen with the typical everykid amiability who doesn't have a whole lot of personality but an earnest heart. However he has a hopeless crush on the school's reigning teen queen Uschi and whenever he drudges up the courage to confront her he meets an unduly comeuppance by the school's preppy heartless jocks. Of course this wouldn't be a teen movie without a pair of sidekicks best friend Konrad Thomas Schmieder an uber MichealAnthonyHallish nerd who keeps a precise daily recording of the endless taunts and vile pranks repeatedly pulled on him and Wurst Manuel Cortez a perpetual stoner who remains completely insouciant and unaffected by the group's considerable lack of a social life. And in true John Hughes' fashion there's the lovely nextdoor gal pal Rebecca Collien Fernandes one for whom is trying on a Gothic lifestyle to see if it fits who has a nonetoosubtle crush on the oblivious Phillip.And the night that puts the story's pivotal turn in motion is at a pathetic meeting of Collien's goth clique and Phillip's nerdy triad for which an inept voodoo ritual to try and reverse Phillipncrew's downward social spiral goes awry as they die in a car crash during a roadside bong haze only to wake up in the city morgue that night to realize there the walking dead! And when they return to school the next day they realize their luck is about to change not only do they crush the athletic jocks at their usually unbearable PE class with heavy reverence to The Longest Yard and find they have superhuman strength but also throw a totally radical schoolwide party at Phillip's pad for whom are on vacation completely reversing their terminally unpopular streak.But of course things don't quite go as smoothly body parts falling off at inappropriate times a conniving emasculated jock planning to bring them down and Konrad's wildly uncontrollable violent outbursts and they realize they are now on a ticking clock to resurrect themselves with a magic mixture before they officially go forever back into the grave.Now all this is a pretty predictable template but director Mattheius Dinter's goofy manic energy and the unpretentiously clever vignettes Finding ancient zombie remains on Ebay an ultracheery mother barging in on an awakening Phillip to see he has an erection under his sheets helps elevate this grossout comedyteenhorrorromance to the aboveaverage category. The movie does have a few deeper observations than expected noting that a Zombie's Hunger for human flesh reflects the boy's burgeoning sexuality but really it just wants to have fun as even the movie's climax is pretty much you would expect with some minor surprises it still works splendidly.Great fun no matter how petty it actually is.".

At this point the pretty impressive supporting cast comes into play and manages to patch over the now somewhat stolid plot. Our hero Philip chases after the posh Uschi who turns out to be the type of female sexual predator who constantly talks about getting it off and pleasing her man and who will be the first to be brutally offed by the zombies in a runofthemill USAmerican teen comedy. While this movie has taken many cues from standard Hollywood fare at least they've decided to let the sexual predator chick off in this case. The film steers towards a pretty farfetched but at least fairly original ending.I didn't get to see this movie when it came out ten years ago. Then I recently remembered it and decided to catch up. Overall this is what it claims to be a working teenage zombie comedy. Since those are pretty thin on German ground it's a fat shame that nothing much became of the director nor his primary cast.".

I must laugh out loud at various points throughout the film yet the humor at times should be subtle enough that not everyone understands the jokes this is my selfindulgent side who loves more than nothing else to break out in the childish chorus I know something you don't know. You must add a pinch of profane language and yes the perpetual hope of seeing attractive naked woman on the screen even better if this hope comes to fruition. If all these elements are thrown together you are sure to have yourself a tasty little treat that can be enjoyed time and time again. Well given the aforementioned qualities of a good film Night of the Living Dorks is a recipe I can not wait to cook up for friends. When this film comes out on DVD I am going to serve this dish on all occasions. A must see for any horrorcomedy fans!".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Nacht der lebenden Loser is a German movie from 2004 so this one will have its 15th anniversary two years from now. The writer an director of this 90minute movie is Matthias Dinter and if you take a look at his body of work then you probably already can roughly estimate the quality to expect here. Or I should say the lack of quality. The script is a mess and the actors add their best worst to sink this film even further. Even the likes of Henry Grndler who may be a talented comedian are just no quality performers in terms of film acting even if it is comedy. There are many familiar names in here but they are all more entertainers than actors. Then again the actors aren't any better. Just taking a look at the lead trio here they are all basically interchangeable with their performances and absolutely nothing about their characters stands out at all. Not through the acting. Not through the writing. This is the story of three teenagers who turn into zombies after a fateful coincidence of events. But this transformation was needed for them to find out who they really are and whowhat really matters to them. Finally the likes of actors like Hendrik Borgmann GZSZ or other actors whose most known credits is Sturm der Liebe being in here says it all about the quality of the cast. There were just so many scenes when the dialogues did not feel authentic at all but written and thus exactly what they were. You never had the impression you were watching actually existing characters of course there are fantasy elements but still and the actors sure didn't make things better. And they also never came off like zombies just like people with pretty weak zombie makeup on them. Now if this had at least been somewhat charming with the romance element attached to it and the way the central character and Ulmen's get together but it was all predictable and for the sake of it and once again the lack of talent in acting and writing makes this painful to watch. The genuine drama moments like the knife scene at the end are ones where the film actually dares to take itself seriously despite how garbage it is. If people say films today here in Germany are worse than 15 years ago they need to check out this one because it refutes the theory completely on its own. And still it is pretty famous still even today most certainly the most known work by almost everybody involved with the project and that shows how much people are curious about zombie movies. But there is not a single reason to love this one. It is a huge mess and a definite contender for worst 2004 film. I highly recommend to stay far far away from any copy of Night of the Living Dorks.".

There are boobs butts and drugs but not much gory violence as you'd expect from a classical Zombie movie. Nonetheless this movie also contains one of the mostclosely to reallife teen party scenes I've ever witnessed on screen.This movie is best watched with a couple of friends and plenty of beer for even more entertainment  and if you're able to do so in German.

So basically they spent about 75 of the film talking and I couldn't understand a lick.For better or worse it actually looked like it would be interesting if I could have understood any of it.  It was maddening.If this comes to your town I would STRONGLY suggest checking with your theater to ask about this issue.  There is soooo much dialogue that I cannot recommend seeing this foreign language film unless some kind of accomodation has been made to translate it.Good luck!".

However to fully understand Prizzi's Honor if you've seen some of the latter day mafiacomedies that followed it you have to understand that at one point it was a novel idea to make a movie where mafia dons and hit men were comedic fodder.If you approach Prizzi's Honor expecting it to pick up where its successors left off you're bound to be disappointed and will likely find it slow and its jokes stale. It's important to remember that this was the first major production to take the subject matter of The Godfather highlevel mafia families and satirize it. It therefore must have seemed quite clever and groundbreaking in 1985 to lampoon the bizarre behaviors and concepts of honor that The Godfather and all its imitators had presented to us as reality. You really can't hold Prizzi's Honor accountable because so many others realized there was a satirical goldmine here and exploited it until the mafiacomedy film was as clich as the mafia film so when approaching this movie I tried to remember nothing like this had really been done before.Prizzi's Honor opens with a wedding scene which is probably a nod to The Godfather but it is a very weak and plodding scene by any definition and especially in comparison to the masterpiece it emulates. From there it's mostly uphill though as Nicholson's tremendous acting is just enough to suspend disbelief as his character the son of a high ranking mafioso has a wacky whirlwind romance with a dashing woman he meets at the wedding only to discover she is mixed up in scamming his own mafia family and she's actually a hired killer just as he is but that his love for her is so strong that her background doesn't matter. Dating the enemy becomes more and more of a tightrope walk and increasingly their genuine wedded bliss seems to be interrupted by their real world jobs which would suggest they should see each other as a threat and both of them typically deal with threats by homicide leading to a quite funny problem that recurs throughout the film.The film is very quirky since it's basically making up a new style of film there's a lot of imagination and the plot itself doesn't fall into any clichs. However it does exploit a basketful of mafia movie clichs from the overthetop Brooklyn drawl that Nicholson somehow pulls off to the corpselike appearance of the decrepit yet ruthlessly brilliant Don Corrado Prizzi. As most of its successors have just combined mafia clichs with a basic plot Prizzi's Honor seems quite fresh with its complex plot and wonderfully offbeat characters.Prizzi's Honor seems to have fallen by the cinematic wayside at least it's not on too many short lists of great films and its lackluster IMDb rating 6.8 rates it below or alongside many works it actually paved the way for. To some extent I think it suffers from the notion that very few good serious films emerged from America in the 80s aside from the stuff Woody Allen was doing. While to some extent this movie does seem to reflect some of the mid80s filmmaking malaise there is a lot of very clever work being done here and this really is a movie worth remembering.".

The supporting are all great and the one who plays the Don is hilarious with his sadistic way of saying his lines.The direction is simple but has some original shots it works with this material. It's mostly steady camera. The music creates a contrast it's quite cheery and happy and that makes the movie funnier. It's a very dark comedy in my opinion and sometimes a romance drama.

	schema:headline " Great performances for a stylistic exit";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people refuse to believe that this is a comedy. They are wrong. Just watch Angelica Huston's screamingly funny moment as she brings in her father's dinner. She is walking towards him behind his back... calm cool suave  and suddenly transforms herself into the pitiful broken submissive daughter that her father is expecting her to be. She has the hunched martyr's pose down pat  and it is brilliantly funny. That said the problem with Prizzi's Honor  which I enjoyed immensely by the way  is that too many things just don't gel. For one thing Nicholson kills someone in California and we discover at the same time as Nicholson that his Nicholson's major love interest Kathleen Turner is in fact married to the man he has just killed. And they continue their lives as if nothing has really happened. They continue their love affair and the body in the garage is completely forgotten. But wouldn't the police or someone have found out that he is dead? Wouldn't the police have wanted to speak to interrogate his wife? None of this happens. .. which is of course nonsense. Many people have complained that they can't believe in the characters  and I agree with them. But I am not complaining  just agreeing with their statement. I don't know if the director John Huston was totally up to making this film as he was deathly sick and probably knew that it would be his last one. But I suspect that Huston decided to make Prizzi's Honor and go out in style  for that is really what this film is about  an exercise in style. Nicholson is the arch stereotype of the dumb hoodlum Turner is the vamp of all time the Godfather of the entire Prizzi clan couldn't be more brutal or ghoulish especially when he is smiling  all done with a certain camp flair. And Huston's daughter Angelica plays the longsuffering wronged woman with proud wicked vengefulness. These are all wellknown types yet here they come across as hysterically exaggerated stylized versions of what we have seen in other movies. Huston is too good a director to have done this by accident. He wanted to go out in style  and with Prizzi's Honor  he did so most honorably.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many people refuse to believe that this is a comedy. They are wrong. Just watch Angelica Huston's screamingly funny moment as she brings in her father's dinner. She is walking towards him behind his back... calm cool suave  and suddenly transforms herself into the pitiful broken submissive daughter that her father is expecting her to be. She has the hunched martyr's pose down pat  and it is brilliantly funny. That said the problem with Prizzi's Honor  which I enjoyed immensely by the way  is that too many things just don't gel. For one thing Nicholson kills someone in California and we discover at the same time as Nicholson that his Nicholson's major love interest Kathleen Turner is in fact married to the man he has just killed. And they continue their lives as if nothing has really happened. They continue their love affair and the body in the garage is completely forgotten. But wouldn't the police or someone have found out that he is dead? Wouldn't the police have wanted to speak to interrogate his wife? None of this happens. .. which is of course nonsense. Many people have complained that they can't believe in the characters  and I agree with them. But I am not complaining  just agreeing with their statement. I don't know if the director John Huston was totally up to making this film as he was deathly sick and probably knew that it would be his last one.

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt in my opinion one of the best and most underrated films of all time has to be 1985's Prizzi's Honor. The film to some may seem like a black hearted comedy and somewhat of a Godfather ripoff yet for me I found enough drama intrigue and chemistry between the characters to go along with a well written script that made it an instant classic. The performance from Jack Nicholson is great and along with the veteran cast the support is the backbone of the film.Directed by legendary John Huston in one of his last works Prizzi's Honor is a wickedly sly and well crafted mob tale of romance family conflict and defending pride and honor that comes with family. Set in Brooklyn New York the Prizzi family the oldest and richest well known crime family starts off with the wedding of head Don PrizziWilliam Hickey's granddaughters wedding. As the relaxing theme and face shots of the characters gets the viewer attached early to the drama from start to finish. Enter Charley Partannaplayed to perfection by Jack the head hitman of the Prizzi family who's tough and gritty and direct and to the point with a high temper. Yet upon Charley's meeting of an elegant and attractive sexy blond an out of town lady named IreneKathleen Turnerand after Charley visits Irene on the west coast at her California home it doesn't take long before the two develop a hot and steamy passionate romance affair based on sex which both mistake it for blind love.As the film develops the viewer quickly sees that the Irene Walker character has a dark and hidden past with a closet full of secrets yet Charley soon accepts her hand in marriage once some things are ironed out. Now family conflict and displeasure arrives when the Prizzi's tell about the real identity of Irene and her real job and mission shocks Charley. This also hurts an ex flame of Charley's that being Prizzi granddaughter MaeroseAnjelica Hustonand Anjelica was wickedly fantastic in her performance her character is so intelligently cunning with advice.The drama heightens as with all mob dramas when watching you have to figure out what's next and think about who's gonna double cross who next and the plot has many subplots that you must pay attention to. As one can see that both Irene and the Prizzi's are sly and greedy as they will look out for their own self interest and wealth. The support of the family members of the Prizzi's like EduardoRobert LoggiaAngelo Pop PartannaJohn RandolphDominicLee Richardsonand last but not least legendary Don CorradoWilliam Hickey finally wear on Charley making him choose between family and love proving that blood is thicker than water and that honor and being loyal is most important with family.As in the films ending as the viewer can see the final scene between Charley and Irene proves that love hurts and it cuts like a knife! It may be amoral yet some relationships weren't meant to last. Overall Prizzi's Honor is a classy film that's one of my best to watch numerous times the performances and story just works so well with the characters chemistry. As the supporting performances from Loggia Randolph and Richardson are good backbone and William Hickey's performance is old and crafty yet beautifully stunning and at ease. As for the females Anjelica was marvelous and sly and cunning yet you feel sorry for her depressed Maerose character and Kathleen Turner is fabulously sexy and super erotic as the sneaky and deceptive and stunning Irene Walker. Last but not least the legend and all time greatest actor Jack Nicholson puts the icing on the cake with one of his better and more underrated performances as tough and gritty mob hitman Charley Partanna who's walk talk and dress along with actions made him seem so real and believable. John Huston really had a winner here proving that the most important thing is family honor them and respect them and that's all that matters. Remember family is the most important thing and it should be special.".

Mafia hitman Jack Nicholson Oscarnominated meets the supererotic Kathleen Turner at a wedding and of course ends up dumping girlfriend Anjelica Huston in a welldeserved Oscarwinning turn. The fact that Huston is the daughter of one of Nicholson's associates only makes the plot thicken. What Nicholson does not know is that Turner is really an assassin herself. Will he find out that his lover by night is really a hitwoman by day? And will he learn in time that the two have actually been hired to kill each other? Also along for the ride are scenestealers Robert Loggia and William Hickey who received an Oscar nod as the family's don. Prizzi's Honor was the final venture for legendary director John Huston who was near death when he was Oscarnominated for this. That little tidbit does not change the fact that Prizzi's Honor is really a strange experience that does not completely succeed. It is a movie that serves its purpose but the ending does not justify the means used to get there. The Oscarnominated screenplay makes itself out to be much more intelligent than it really is and ultimately Nicholson and Turner have to carry the production. Still a good movie but overrated and even a bit disappointing when all is said and done. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "The humor in Prizzi's Honor comes from the everyday humanity of its characters juxtaposed with the fact that the family business entails killing people so like in the funeral business death is discussed and dealt out matteroffactly. The screenplay sparkles throughout character driven and organic despite the many plot twists with a masterful consistency of style. Its point of view is completely amoral which maybe makes certain 21st century viewers uncomfortable. Anjelica Huston is a force of nature in the film  by turns defiant vulnerable manipulative sexual heartbroken and innocently delighted. Every moment she's on screen she delivers absolute raw conviction.The film suffers slightly from the need to condense a novel's worth of material into 2 hours and maybe certain plot points and motivations could have been a little more developed. For example Kathleen Turner is strong and believable but it would have been great to see a little deeper into the darkness and contradictions of her character. The cast of supporting characters seems to embody facets of John Huston's persona and his dry macabre sense of humor. William Hickey's performance as the Don is a spectacle unto itself. Have another cooooookie LOL. John Randolph the Jeffrey Tambor of the '80s Lee Richardson and Robert Loggia are all flawless.Fascinating to see Jack Nicholson play completely against type as a simpleminded and earnest character. He pulls it off brilliantly although it's a bit puzzling that the Don would entrust him with running the business  again probably something that fell through the cracks when adapting the novel.How weird that none of the online reviews or comments mention the time period. They obviously had a lot of fun with it  at first it seems to be the 1920s as Anjelica Huston mentions that as a decorator she does Art Deco a term that I believe was coined well after the actual period in which it was in vogue then Kathleen Turner tells Jack Nicholson her car is an Excalibur which is an '80's car made to look like something from the olden days. Later they're driving a Ford van from the '60s. Anjelica at one point goes to meet an informant in fullon Alexis Carrington drag but most of the sets and costumes are '40s film noir inspired.".

So 'Prizzi's Honor' which ridicules its protagonists and shows them to be anything but wise is a welcome sort of mafia film. Unfortunately although it's reasonably entertaining the film ultimately doesn't wholly succeed in any respect too daft to work as black comedy too slow to work as riotous farce to humorously conceived to work as tragic drama. Jack Nicholson is good as the dumb hit man Charley but the plot leaves us unsure whether we should laugh at him or cry with him and in the end I felt inclined to do neither.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure Richard Condon has ever written a serious word in his life. The Manchurian Candidate had its pathos but it was largely masked by Condon's prose style  detached ironic and humorous. In another novel he describes a typical meal for his Alfred Hitchcok character and it takes up half of a full page. So many rashers of bacon a joint of mutton three apple pies and so on. John Huston has got the style pretty much down pat in this film although if you're not prepared for it the intentionality might slip by you and you wind up with a pale drama.I guess by 1985 the year this film was released the mob movie was ripe for a parody. Some seventeen years elapsed between Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and about thirteen years between The Godfather and Prizzi's Honor. When a genre is so near exhaustion it doesn't have many places left to go.No one in this movie seems authentically Italian as we've learned that authenticity from the mob movies not even Robert Loggia. The most hilarious impersonation is given by William Hickey. He's a wizened gaunt Don Corrado a tiny frame his voice a hoarse goaty whine with more ups and unanticipated dips than a roller coaster ride. The other performances are good too. The dialog is out of a comic book. People clip one another or they zotz each other. Nine hundred thousand dollars is nine hundred dollars. Everyone is evil but some are more evil than others just as in The Godfather. There is a happy ending for Jack Nicholson as Charlie Partanna a hit man who winds up murdering his own wife. Man what happened to the code? You probably won't respond to this very warmly if you are looking for another movie about the Mafia with lots of tragedy and gore. But if you're able to accept this as an adumbration of movies like Analyze This a much more obvious and funnier movie you'll get a kick out of it.".

John Huston has got the style pretty much down pat in this film although if you're not prepared for it the intentionality might slip by you and you wind up with a pale drama.I guess by 1985 the year this film was released the mob movie was ripe for a parody. Some seventeen years elapsed between Frankenstein and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein and about thirteen years between The Godfather and Prizzi's Honor. When a genre is so near exhaustion it doesn't have many places left to go.No one in this movie seems authentically Italian as we've learned that authenticity from the mob movies not even Robert Loggia. The most hilarious impersonation is given by William Hickey. He's a wizened gaunt Don Corrado a tiny frame his voice a hoarse goaty whine with more ups and unanticipated dips than a roller coaster ride. The other performances are good too. The dialog is out of a comic book. People clip one another or they zotz each other. Nine hundred thousand dollars is nine hundred dollars. Everyone is evil but some are more evil than others just as in The Godfather. There is a happy ending for Jack Nicholson as Charlie Partanna a hit man who winds up murdering his own wife. Man what happened to the code? You probably won't respond to this very warmly if you are looking for another movie about the Mafia with lots of tragedy and gore. But if you're able to accept this as an adumbration of movies like Analyze This a much more obvious and funnier movie you'll get a kick out of it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great movie. It has substance it has style it has humor and it has some excellent acting. Nicholson is wonderful as Charley Partana William Hickey is both funny and frightening as Don Corrado Prizzi and Anjelica Huston does a great job as Maerose. The plot is full of depth and intrigue as Partana falls in love with Turner's character only to find out she's a hitman like him. So in Prizzi's Honor Nicholson and John Huston are working together again but this time Huston is the director and Anjelica Huston is on screen this time as the daughter of a powerful mob family. Anjelica really steals the whole film and wins an Oscar for her performance. It helps I guess if your father is the director if you are going to steal a film from the ostensible leads but though John Huston may have been an accessory to the crime it was really Anjelica's performance that got her that Oscar.The performances are great all around. The old don William Hickey in this movie is incredible  creepy and decrepitly sinister a very unique 'don' character in the catalogue of mafia movies. Charlie's father was great and of course Nicholson does a great job as Italian gangster Charley Pattana  his acting is distinct and fitting i.e. he goes beyond himself as himself. Kathleen Turner as his love interest then wife Irene was likable as well. I wasn't always sure I bought the chemistry 100 but the movie is bigger than just their relationship  which certainly wasn't bad by any accounts  just not 'sizzling' for all the love that was professed. Then again this is love between a hitwoman and a gangster so I don't know what exactly one could hope for. There was a certain touchiness in the trust that develops between them and of course there's a comic tone that lightens the whole thing in the first place  but never to the detriment of the story.Overall rating 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Huston was able to adapt this Richard Condon novel well to the screen. Many felt Prizzi's Honor was a dark comedy but I saw it different enough drama and suspense is present to make this organized crime drama a classic winner. If you've read some of my other comments I guess you know what a big Jack Nicholson fan I am. And once again Jack delivers a bold performance in fact one of his best ever. Nicholson once again proves his preparation to be impeccable everything from the wardrobe and the strong Brooklyn accent that Jack displays makes him seem so realistic as the tough and direct to the point Mafia hitman Charley Partanna. Nicholson's tough and bold performance is helped along with the great supporting cast of Kathleen Turner and John Huston's daughter Anjelica. In fact Anjelica caught the eye of the industry as she received an Academy award for Best Supporting Actress. I couldn't agree more Anjelica's offbeat performance made her very deserving. William Hickey gives maybe behind Nicholson the strongest performance of the film as Don Corrado Prizzi the oldest crime figure of the Prizzi family and when the camera is in front of William he is magical his words and expressions just steal the show. Not only does Prizzi's Honor offer crime and drama but romance steals a good portion of the movie. From the beginning of the film when Nicholson discovers a beautiful blond stranger Kathleen Turner. Instant chemistry between themnot unnaturally perhaps because she is secretly a hired gun for the Mafia. A love affair develops into passionate sex then when the former fiancee of Charley Maerose Prizzi Anjelica Huston begins to wry her way to seduce Charley the twists continue. As the film progresses it shows just how organized greed corrupts all. In the end I felt that John Huston's most important message was to never fall in love and I agree with that message and have adopted it in many ways. That message is presented so perfect in the final scene when Irene Walker Kathleen Turner and Charley Partanna Jack Nicholson are together for the final time. No matter how much love it dies even if individuals have similar backgrounds. Believe me love hurts. Remember stand and support honor pride and most of all family take those things over hot passionate love because love can really hurt in big ways and Prizzi's Honor proves it. I must say this is a great movie to add to your home video collection and cherish for years I know I have and I was once again pleased with Jack Nicholson hey aren't we always.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Huston made movies mainly during the 40's and the 50's.  He is well known for some of his great movies like The Maltese Falcon 1941 and The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre 1948 two movies who earned themselves a position on AFI's top 100 list and what many consider to be his best picture ever 1951's The African Queen which was ranked 17th on AFI's top 100 list. His major collaborations with Humphrey Bogart also made him quite popular in the beginning of his career.  Unfortunately he died in 1987.  However he did not leave us without giving us an 80's classic  la John Huston. Prizzi's Honor was his final stand and what a stand it was.  The Mob is probably the topic that has been the most used in Cinema. Movies like Little Caesar 1930 and The Public Enemy 1931 are the young classics that gave us a taste of things to come for the more modern classics such as Goodfellas 1990 and the ultimate movie of alltime The Godfather 1972 and its terrific sequel The Godfather Part II 1974.  As with every other common movie topic Hollywood has produced many disappointing movies about the Mob such as Scarface 1983.  However it has produced the ultimate disgrace to the Mob movies with 1998's Mafia which tried to parody The Godfather Scarface and many others.  This is something that I can not tolerate to make a parody of such great movies.  So looking at Prizzi's Honor I thought this might be a movie that had a similar objective to Mafia with a few big stars in it.  I was mistaken.  Charley Partanna Jack Nicholson is a wiseguy.  At a wedding he sees a beautiful tall blond woman Kathleen Turner with whom he immediately falls in love with.  He finally meets this woman.  Her name is Irene Walker.  He soon finds out that she had made a hit for the Prizzi family the family of which he is part the day of the wedding.  The two of them fall in love and make plans for marriage.  But Irene goes back to California for a few days. During her trip Charley also learns that a scam has been going on in one of the Casinos owned by the Prizzis and that the man who orchestrated this scam is a man named Marxie Heller.  So Charley is sent by the family to get the money back from Marxie.  Charley goes to Heller's house and knocks off Heller.  He waits for Heller's wife to return as she apparently had something to do with the scam. But surprise surprise for Charley as Heller's wife turns out to be Irene Walker.  Charley spares her after she returns half of the stolen money and goes back to Brooklyn claiming he could only find that and he marries Irene. But complications are bound to arise and they do.  Huston's smart directing does not allow the viewer to call out a mistake in the movie an Richard Condon's script is intelligent as it releases all its small twists and turns in the correct order at the right moments.  One of the key actors in the movie is Anjelica Huston's role as the rejected daughter of a second level boss for the Prizzi family.  Without her the movie would probably not end the way it does.  Jealousy greed love... these are the principal themes of this blackcomedy along with of course the theme of murder.  But as I said at the beginning this is a typical Huston classic and is not to be missed.".

Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi's Honor? It's certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a policeman's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about 'your favourite Mexican cigars' which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years I failed to spot anything of a comic nature  and I did try. There is a lot of Mafia clich but clich doesn't constitute humour in my book.Is it a romantic comedy of sorts? Never. The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli.Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody.With onedimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces. Well it isn't enough even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression Jack Nicholson repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of Brando's padded jowls in The Godfather?... Oh! Who cares?... all I know is it isn't funny.Throw in some slow plodding direction this film drags on for 2 hours some hopelessly daft and clichd dialogue such as You remember the Camora? Well we're far bigger we'll track you down wherever you go and clichd mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say capiche?. Prizzi's Honor is far from being Huston's masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work.

Later that night she calls him and they get together have sex hang around and gradually fall in love. He finds out later that she is also a professional killer and is an easy choice when he is given a kidnapping job to do that involves taking out some bodyguards. However Irene is forced to kill a woman that sees them in the act  only to find that the woman was married to a police chief. With the police cutting all ties and coming down on the New York families Charlie and Irene end up in a perilous situation.For all its class and reputation something doesn't quite satisfy about Prizzi's Honour because although it is mostly enjoyable the variable style means that no one approach works really well even if they all work a bit. The plot sounds pretty good and it does move along well enough but it is regularly a bit too slow without giving depth in return for the patience it asks for. At turns it is a comedy emotionally deep a mobster saga and a romance  it cannot seem to decide which one it wants to be so it tries to blend all aspects in an attempt that never really comes off but still works well enough for the film itself to be enjoyable. Personally I found it to still be rather unsatisfying because since it didn't go one way it felt like most of it was halfdone. So instead of being a deep mobster epic it only had aspects of that instead of being a satisfyingly tragic romance it tried but was unengaging and instead of having dark laughs it only hit comic here and there.The cast help but they tend to be part of the mixed style rather than trying to get above it. Nicholson tends to overplay the simplicity of his character and thus prevents any real depth to come out  although the final scenes are moving this tends to be despite him and not because of him. Turner is better because she has a better character to play with ultimately she cannot do it alone but she tends to lift the film a little bit. The two of them have to move between styles as the film does and it is too much for them. The rest of the support tend to exist within one main style to the film and generally benefit from it  for example Hickey Loggia and Randolph all exist within a mob epic of sorts and have pitched their performances more or less to there. Huston is enjoyable and small turns from Tierney and Pounder are nice finds.Overall this is an OK film but it could have been better by either focusing on one or two aspects and doing them better. It is a nice try at a nice mix but it doesn't totally come off despite doing enough and having enough class to still produce an enjoyable film if rather muted in most areas.".

I recommend this to only the biggest fans of the people involved in making it and urge most anyone else to just skip this one... it's no great loss. The loss is the great chance that was wasted in the production of this film... with an interesting premiselater made into a Hollywood flick that manages to be more entertaining than this a or so I've heard this is the first of his films I watch competent director and a highly talented cast this could have been simply breathtaking.

	schema:headline " His American 39 Steps";
	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man wrongly accused on the run sometimes really running sometimes not to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control the first one being The 39 Steps which really made him popular in Great Britain. It really is his signature theme.Others include Young and Innocent Saboteur Spellbound Stage Fright Strangers on a Train I Confess To Catch a Thief The Wrong Man North by Northwest and finally Frenzy. Saboteur starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his coworker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. He meets up with model Patricia Martin played by actress Priscilla Lane during his run from the law and later of course the various NaziFascist sympathizers along the way.Saboteur is mainly like The 39 Steps even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning a race across the country in one case London to Scotland and in the other California to New York and meeting the colorful locals along the way. And so just like The Man Who Knew Too Much I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works.I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American sort of an everyman with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is a more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in The 39 Steps and Ruth Roman in Strangers on a Train. As mentioned elsewhere though Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle his lines are great. There are some funny touches all along the way for some comic relief such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane's character on them and circus sideshow performers and the truck driver Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here there aren't too many characters who believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately.There are some slow parts mainly when the action first moves to New York but it picks up quickly when the last planned act of the fifth columnists gets underway.It's one of my favorite films from Hitchcock I put it in my top 5 especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits home.It makes you think Could my coworker be involved in something evil? In fact one of the movie posters for Saboteur proclaimed Watch Out for the Man behind your back! Imagine how that played in the mind of adults during the Second World War.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hitchcock made at least 11 films about the ordinary man wrongly accused on the run sometimes really running sometimes not to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control the first one being The 39 Steps which really made him popular in Great Britain. It really is his signature theme.Others include Young and Innocent Saboteur Spellbound Stage Fright Strangers on a Train I Confess To Catch a Thief The Wrong Man North by Northwest and finally Frenzy. Saboteur starts Robert Cummings as Barry Kane a wartime aircraft plant worker during wartime accused of murdering his coworker and best friend during an act of sabotage on the plant. He meets up with model Patricia Martin played by actress Priscilla Lane during his run from the law and later of course the various NaziFascist sympathizers along the way.Saboteur is mainly like The 39 Steps even including similar plot devices such as handcuffs the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning a race across the country in one case London to Scotland and in the other California to New York and meeting the colorful locals along the way. And so just like The Man Who Knew Too Much I believe this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock's earlier works.I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he comes across as a very ordinary American sort of an everyman with whom the audience can identify. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is a more involved in the action than Madeline Carroll in The 39 Steps and Ruth Roman in Strangers on a Train. As mentioned elsewhere though Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's performance as the blind uncle his lines are great.

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur is not one of his bestregarded films made between two vastly more popular and critically praised pictures Suspicion and Shadow Of a Doubt it's generally regarded as a lesser effort. I agree that the later film is groundbreaking drawing Hitchcock wholly into the American mainstream for the first time but Saboteur is in its way at least as lively as Suspicion its chief flaw being its less than charismatic star players Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane.In Saboteur we find Hitchcock feeling his way around America literally as its lead character travels from California to New York in search of an arsonist for whose crime he was accused. Cummings is very youthful here and quite engaging. His boyishness but not immaturity perfectly suits the character he is portraying and seems appropriate as the director though middleaged was in the process of reinventing himself and an older more established star might have thrown things off. Priscilla Lane's spunky heroine which not a typical type for the director was very much a common type in American films at the time and she and Cummings provide an openness and a youth the director needed both in his life and work at this time. I cannot imagine older more solid typesCooper and Stanwyck for instancedoing any better as they would have between them carried well too much baggage.As is the norm in Hitchcock's films nothing is as it appears. Where Saboteur differs from his better known films is that the audience is let in on the game early. Though Cummings is an accused arsonist we know that he is innocent. The villains become apparent fairly soon and the movie hinges more on its plot than its ironies. What pleasures there are are incidental and here the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting Tod Browningish interlude with some circus freaks who help Cummings elude capture. In another scene reminiscent of James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein Cummings spends some time in the cottage of a blind man who as it turns out is Lane's uncle. Was the director perhaps studying key American films of the previous decade? Whatever the case these and other offbeat and discursive aspects of the movie give it a playfulness and variety which when one adds the factor of quite youthful leads makes the picture seem like the work of a younger man still learning his craft.The film's later scenes in New York are more suspenseful and typical of the director as the picture gradually becomes more Hitchockian as it moves along. In the end I find it a satisfying work and as neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor neither does the movie have one. It is deliberately lightweight and I suspect semiexperimental an attempt by Hitchcock to see if he could pull off in an American setting the sort of story he had done so well in England. He succeeded admirably. The next logical step Shadow Of a Doubt a film in which the main character travels east to west and with a wholly different set of values and plans.".

It's a very entertaining innocent man on the run thriller a theme he had previously used to great success in 'The 39 Steps' and would later recycle in one of his most popular movies 'North By Northwest' and one which still gets used time and time again by Hollywood  see 'The Fugitive' 'Enemy Of The State' 'Minority Report' and countless others.  Some people slam Robert Cummings who later appeared in Hitchcock's 'Dial M For Murder' as being a bit lightweight but I think he's actually pretty good as a leading man and Priscilla Lane 'Arsenic And Old Lace' is also not bad and the two do show some on screen chemistry. Of course with more charismatic leads 'Saboteur' would have been greatly improved but as it is it's good enough. One actor in the cast I think is really terrific is Otto Kruger 'Murder My Sweet' who plays Tobin one of Hitchcock's best ever villains. 'Saboteur' is action packed and keeps things interesting. There's a good sequence with a traveling circus memorable bit parts from a truck driver and a blind man and the climax is great stuff and vintage Hitch. If you are new to Hitchcock I could name at least a dozen of his movies to watch before this one but if you've seen his greatest hits try 'Saboteur' it's lots of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overall this is entertaining and odd film. Don't try to make sense of it. There are more holes in the story than a computer could keep up with but Robert Cummings and a cast of minor characters are mostly fun to watch in this Fugitivelike story.Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie this fugitive isn't looking for a onearmed man but a twoarmed Nazi saboteur by the the name of Frank Fry. Cummings Barry Kane gets blamed when a defense plant blows up in Los Angeles and goes on the lam looking for the man who did it Fry to clear his name.The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then Priscilla Lane Pat Martin enters the story and it starts to bog down a bit with some sappy dialog. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did that with his female characters to the point I wonder if he had a clue how woman talked. Lane's character here was a little lame.Actually the villains played by Otto Kruger Charles Tobin and Norman Lloyd Frank Fry were the best in my opinion......just fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialog was especially good.If you haven't seen this film but saw Hitchcock's wellknown North By Northwest you'll chuckle at the ending and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore here we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State Of Liberty. As usual Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to view.".

Think of it as being in the same class as say The Lady Vanishes or North by Northwest. Aside from a speech Robert Cummings makes to the Nazis at the mansion  about you and your kind  none of this is meant to be taken very seriously. This is also the first use Hitchcock makes of an American landmark or even an identifiable American landscape in his films. It isn't his first use of landmarks as setting for a chase since he earlier used the British Museum. He does better here with his mockup of the Statue of Liberty which also carries a rather heavy symbolic weight.The score is kind of sweet and musically a little tricky but there is no music at all while Cummings is holding the villain Norman Loyd by the sleeve at the top of the statue. The scene cries out for explosive dramatic suspenseful collossal stupendous orchestration  and Hitchcock keeps it silent except for a few whispered words from Loyd. The plot has more holes than a slice of Swiss cheese but it doesn't matter much. The FBI arrived at my ranch says the suave Otto Krueger. Luckily I was just leaving. The mother of the victim at the beginning seems to believe that Cummings the victim's best friend may have deliberately murdered him. A hole has been drilled in the wall of a deserted shack so that Cummings can find a telescope and look through the hole and see what appears to be Boulder Dam and cotton to what's going on. Oh well.The makeup department should have been penalized or drafted. In some scenes Cummings is so plastered with makeup that he resembles a silent screen hero like Valentino. And sometimes the delectably creamfed Priscilla Lane looks almost ordinary.The best performances are from Otto Krueger who switched from music to acting fortunately and from Alan Baxter as the soft spoken and not entirely unsympathetic heavy. We first see Baxter as he enters the abandoned shack at Soda City with Clem Bevins brushing the dust fussily from the sleeve of his dark jacket. And he has a truly amazing conversation with Cummings in the back seat of a car while they are being driven to New York. It's a complete non sequitur dealing with Baxter's two young sons. He describes them lovingly and then talks about how much he wanted a girl. He asks Cummings if it would be acceptable to raise a boy nowadays with long hair adding that when he himself was a child he had beautiful long golden curls. You might do the kid a favor if you got him a haircut advises Cummings! It's sometimes easy to make fun of Hitchcock and call him nothing more than a successful commercial hack but it's almost impossible to imagine scenes like these appearing in another director's work not with such consistency. As far as that goes few other directors would have the imagination to roll the credits against a blank wall and afterwards have an ominous black shadow of smoke unfurl itself against that background. But that's only visual flair. Not that it should be dismissed but that conversation between Cummings and Baxter I think tells us much more about what exercised Hitchcock's interest aside from patterns on a silver screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can't help but marvel at Hitchcock's early work. Saboteur for example is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do laterlike using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In North by Northwest of course it's Mt. Rushmore.

	onyx:emotionText "You can't help but marvel at Hitchcock's early work. Saboteur for example is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do laterlike using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In North by Northwest of course it's Mt. Rushmore.

Wrongly accused of being both a spy and a murderer Kane must run from the authorities whilst also pursuing the film's real villain. Sounds familiar?

The film jumps from sequence to sequence until it concludes with a typically grand Hitchcockian climax. Critics accuse the film of being trite  the plot exists only to lay the foundation for thrills  but Hitch knows this. He cater's lovingly to an audience whose needs are both base and very human sex violence romance thrills and a little comedy.Released in 1942 Saboteur was one in a long line of subtle propaganda pictures by Hitchcock. Here our hero  typically Hitchcockian the poor guy is a bundle of paranoia and anxiety  uncovers a Nazi spy ring which he eventually defeats on the Statue of Liberty. This is silly  the Nazi's started off and were fanned by as a tool of wealthy westerners against communism and antimonarchist movements  but the plot leads well to the film's ironic final act. Here Kane must literally become a saboteur to defend his country lending Hitchcock's title a double meaning a suspected saboteur and a real one.810  Worth two viewings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saboteur is the second of three wartime propaganda thrillers that Hitchcock directed. Espionage adventures like this had made up the bulk of his midtolate 30s work in Britain and Saboteur provides some good examples of the very precise method he had by now developed.Important to these thrillers was the idea that this could happen to anyone and it was not enough simply to create an honest John Doe character  he had to show the hero's ordinariness that he was a random victim. This was before Hitch began using the device of panning over a city before homing in on one window but he achieves a similar effect here with protagonist Robert Cummings emerging as a face in the crowd of factory workers. For different reasons it was also important to establish the villain as an apparently nonthreatening family man  the last person anyone would suspect. Hence we first see Otto Kruger playing with his granddaughter.Once he has established that his hero is an average Joe Hitchcock's aim is to keep us with the character and draw us into his experiences. We of course have plenty of pointofview shots so we see what he sees and these are not only used to show us information but also to reveal his paranoid state  for example with those ironic billboard slogans. A subtler but equally effective trick is to cut to a close reaction shot while another character is talking. This is done for example in the scene where he gets a lift from a truck driver. As the driver prattles away we see them both framed together but whenever he says something worth listening to we cut to a closeup of Cummings. This not only draws your attention to crucial information it also really focuses you on the character's thoughts.Finally to keep us watching Hitchcock needed to keep the action balanced and varied. Each of Cummings' escapes is played for a different effect. When he gives little Suzi a piggyback to prevent his getting shot at we are impressed by his cunning. The scene in the river is pure nailbiting action whereas cutting through the handcuffs is an exercise in raceagainsttime tension. The episode with the blind man is a neat little reference to Bride of Frankenstein drawing the parallel between the outcast monster and the innocent fugitive. This sequence also contains some of the picture's few decent gags and is marred only by the appalling acting of Vaughan Glaser.Speaking of acting this is unfortunately one of the blandest casts Hitchcock ever worked with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane being ironically very average leads. None of the supporting players really stands out with one exception Otto Kruger who brilliantly manages to capture that blend of decency and villainy. Add to this dull cast a lifeless screenplay full of patriotic rhetoric  understandable in the circumstances but still rather clunky and clichd  and short on wit and sparkle. The score is by Frank Skinner one in a long line of composers who failed to get Hitchcock's style.For all the meticulous construction of Hitchcock's Hollywood pictures he had already made his best espionage adventures in England in the 30s. I think films like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes were more effective simply because they were successful at merging comedy and action with a lively cast that made them fun and breezy. Saboteur has plenty of strong set pieces but is otherwise fairly flat. Conversely though Hitch's mastery of his method was beginning to pay dividends in his domestic crime thrillers as can be seen in his next feature Shadow of Doubt.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I post this comment IMDb currently rates Alfred Hitchcock's subpar Saboteur a 7.310. Personally I rated it less than half that. Honestly I can't tell how a movie this bad could've come from what is probably the most consistently good director I know of. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30's60's. Vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while Saboteur is easily the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch used the very same formula in The 39 Steps far more competently. My recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie that I turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest. If you must watch it then rent or borrow. Don't make the mistake I did and buy the DVD on good faith earned through Notorious Rebecca Vertigo Rear Window etc. Even a master screws up sometimes I guess.EDIT Maybe I was a bit harder on this film than I should've been. It's certainly nowhere near Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that but there's three reasons I feel I must rate it so low1 The name Hitchcock brings with it certain expectations of quality. This film delivers on a few of them but they're way overshadowed by the darn near nonsensical plotting.2 I want to compensate a bit for all the 8 ratings this film is getting. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. True fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art but the high rating on IMDb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is. 3 I spent 18 on this. Maybe if it'd cost me 5 or even 10 I'd probably be a bit less bitter. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films I've always wanted to see but didn't get around to it for years. After buying the DVD on sale and sitting through it I was hugely disappointed. It's just not good Hitch fans when it's not outright bizarre and terrible. Plot holes and absurdities and on the nose dialogue abound. Sure the Statue of Liberty sequence shows a bit of the director's early genius as well as a few other signature touches but for the most part this film is a badly acted badly structured and badly written mess.Nothing in this story unfolds with any believability or credibility it almost plays like a bad Twilight Zone episode where the hapless protagonist keeps making impossible escapes via doors held open for him by some invisible guardian angel. It's outrageous to watch Robert Cummings get let off the hook time and again on simple faith that he's a noble American defense worker innocent beyond question of sabotage. A real piece of WW2 propagandist pap.The only other bright spots are a deliciously despicable turn by Otto Kruger as the main villain and Norman Lloyd who successfully looks and acts the part of a slimy agent of evil though he's hardly involved in the plot long enough to be a 3 dimensional character.As Barry Kane our righteous hero on the run Robert Cummings turns in one of the worst leading man performances in the history of Hollywood's golden age. He's even more shrill and wooden than Lew Ayres and Robert Taylor in their worst moments. The only decent speech he delivers is when he confronts Kruger near the end a speech which resonates particularly well in this era of George W. Bush Kruger could be playing Dick Cheney. The rest of the time he's overbearingly skittish and meek when he's not chewing the scenery with histrionics.The interplay between Cummings and Priscilla Lane is completely lifeless and devoid of any romance and humor. This film needed Howard Hawks to oversee that aspect of the film and Hitchcock to handle the suspense.Not nearly one of Hitchcock's best. A ratings travesty at 7.3".

	schema:reviewBody "Saboteur is a fairly routine Alfred Hitchcock film. It is in many ways an update on the director's first big hit The 39 Steps with its story of a wronged man on the run. Although it also was a forerunner for the later North by Northwest which also shared this idea as well as a finale set on a famous monument that represented America. Although Saboteur is not amongst the director's best it still is a movie with several great sequences. The opening fire is filmed in a very stylish manner with black smoke slowly engulfing the screen the setpiece with the circus troupe is quirky with memorable characters such as a fascistic dwarf a highly creepy bearded lady and a human skeleton who is at best slightly thin there's also a great sequence in a cinema where the characters act out action that is mirrored on the big screen backdrop but best of all is the final setpiece atop the Statue of Liberty it's exciting stuff with excellent set design too.The story itself is fairly derivative. It's about a group of rich 5th columnists who organise activities to sabotage the war effort. An innocent man is accused and is forced to try and clear his name.It's not the most involving story but decent enough. Main man Robert Cummings is okay but not overly charismatic. There is a typical Hitchcock romantic subplot where our hero hooks up with an atfirst reluctant ice blonde woman. This girl is introduced by way of a scene where the man on the run is taken in by a kindly blind man who seems to be the only one who doesn't see him as a criminal. It's very similar indeed to the famous sequence in the Bride of Frankenstein where the monster's only friend in an unjudgemental blind hermit.This is not classic Hitchcock but a stylish thriller nonetheless. Worth a look if you appreciate the older flicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things. It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. Saboteur however is not creative or prolific at all. Rather Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster American Pride a certain calltoarms supportourtroops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a fluent running storyline. Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same oncethrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems 1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.2. At the dinner party Kane and Patricia don't want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were gate crashers. Logically what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? 4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! 5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume he's the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldn't't he have some sort of credentials? I know spies don't run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? 6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house still seems no one recognizes this guy.7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They don't even show Kane talking to the FBI the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kane's story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing kidnapped or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?This is a running list. The movie is not exciting the plot makes no sense and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.".

The French title La Cinquime colonne i.e. The Fifth Column a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty.Basically Saboteur is as much lighthearted as were The 39 steps note this is another evocative phrase even McGuffin as a title but it lacks most of the humor so the characters are rather down to earth and it's definitely not as fast paced. As a chase movie across the USA from LA to NY Saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence. The sequence at the villain's lovely ranch? Lovely ranch lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole it doesn't really add up to nothing. The meeting with the blind man the mixing with Circus people the Soda City sequence the NY ball sequence? They fall flat bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value.One big problem I can point out is the relationship between the leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane which is not building up as with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 steps. Hence the whole narrative structure is floating depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages. In The 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1escaping from the police so you know the hero can't just go to the police then 2running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence.If you want a better Hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda I would advise you to chose Foreign Correspondant over Saboteur. They are both chase movies with a catchy finale well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in Foreign Correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes the umbrella crowd the tulip fields the strange mills....".

Robert Cummings was too light weight for the part of the young hero who goes on the run to prove his innocence after the aircraft factory in which he was working is sabotaged and his best friend killed. The heroine is spunky Priscilla Lane a better actress than she was ever given credit for who is a mite too quick to overcome her reluctance to believe in his innocence and the plot traverses the country from Los Angeles to New York the justly famous climax takes place on top of the Statue of Liberty. In terms of set pieces this is as good as it gets although there is an excellent sequence at a society gathering that just about redeems the film. Otherwise it is all very jingoistic made at the height of the war effort and directed on this occasion on auto pilot.".

Robert Cummings was too light weight for the part of the young hero who goes on the run to prove his innocence after the aircraft factory in which he was working is sabotaged and his best friend killed. The heroine is spunky Priscilla Lane a better actress than she was ever given credit for who is a mite too quick to overcome her reluctance to believe in his innocence and the plot traverses the country from Los Angeles to New York the justly famous climax takes place on top of the Statue of Liberty. In terms of set pieces this is as good as it gets although there is an excellent sequence at a society gathering that just about redeems the film. Otherwise it is all very jingoistic made at the height of the war effort and directed on this occasion on auto pilot.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1938 Orson Welles' Mercury Theater Group put on a classic stage production of Shakespeare's JULIUS CAESAR in which Welles reset the story from the Roman Empire of 44  43 B.C. to 1938 Europe. Caesar was now a typical fascist dictator and Brutus and his fellow conspirators were trying to free their country. The performances were well recalled in particular two George Coulouris as Mark Antony played as a typical Fascist rabble rouser as only Coulouris could do and Norman Lloyd as a mediocre poet named Cinna. Cinna is a minor part in the play it is not even seen in the classic film version of JULIUS CAESAR by Joseph Mankiewicz with Louis Calhern Marlon Brando John Guilgud and James Mason. He is walking home shortly after the Friends Romans Countrymen speech and the Roman citizenry is in a mindless anger at the conspirators. One of the conspirators is also named Cinna. When they confront the poet Cinna they jump to a fatally wrong conclusion. The way that Welles directed the scene a nervous and frightened Lloyd is trying to get out of the confrontation...and quickly. As he has described it on television a year or so ago the stage became deadly silent for a timed pause and then the mob jumped him and frightened the audience by the stunning violence of it all. It helped make the career of this multitalented performer  he has been producer director and actor. He is best known to recent audiences as Dr. Daniel Auschlander on ST. ELSEWHERE on television. But his first movie role did not pop up until 1942. He played Frank Fry the real saboteur in Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTEUR. Hitchcock wanted to do SABOTEUR as a sequel of sorts to FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT where he used Herbert Marshall as representative of suspect English pacifists possibly Cliveden Set types who were actually agents of Nazism. Being Hitchcock he made sure that Marshall's character was actually dignified proud of his real patriotism even if misguided to Germany and eventually heroic to redeem himself for his daughter's sake. In his original plan for SABOTEUR he planned to make Harry Carey the villain  and a type of American First leader like Charles Lindberg see KEEPER OF THE FLAME. It was a smaller version of the debacle of trying to make Cary Grant a murderer and villain in SUSPICION the previous year Hitch could not buck RKO and Grant's agent on that one even though Grant was willing to try it because of Grant's image. Here it was Carey's following as a popular fatherlike character actor and western star. So Hitch could not do what he really wanted to do.Robert Cummings gave a decent performance but no more as the suspected saboteur who blew up a factory in the film. He crisscrosses the country trying to find the real saboteur Lloyd and running into many interesting fifth columnist types like Clem Bevans playing a particularly bitter old man who is helping the Axis. The head of the sabotage ring is wealthy Otto Kreuger who gives a nice performance as a sophisticated villain. His first comment on meeting up with Cummings in his townhouse is to say it reminds him of the title of a novel. He pulls out of a bookcase THE DEATH OF A NOBODY by Jules Romain. Apparently he likes 20th Century French literature. Cummings is hampered at first by Priscilla Lane but she becomes an ally of his when she slowly realizes he was framed. Together they try to prove his innocence. They are fleeing the police and the enemy agents at the same time with mixed results. We have seen this situation before. Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll had gone through the same thing chasing Godfrey Tearle in THE THIRTYNINE STEPS set in Great Britain. Unfortunately Donat and Carroll were better performers and their script was better too.But Lloyd is properly sinister. And he was to have as memorable a conclusion here as he had on stage in JULIUS CAESAR. SPOILER COMING UPThe conclusion of SABOTEUR was one of the best known in the films of Alfred Hitchcock. The Statue of Liberty is the setting when Cummings confronts Lloyd in the torch of the statue. Lloyd falls over the side and Cummings tries to pull him up or hold until help comes. But the coat Lloyd wears starts ripping and he falls shortly after clearing Cummings in the hearing of the police. It was a good sequence to conclude the film with. And it was a wonderful way for Lloyd to be introduced into movies.".

It's important to try and fix it before it comes into the atmosphere. The NASA man Bob Gerson tries to find out who designed it and discovers that it was designed by Frank Corvin an Air Force pilot who 40 years ago was part of the team who was originally suppose to go to space but when NASA was formed and Gerson's influence they were dropped. Gerson asks Frank to help but Frank still holds a grudge. But after some prodding he agrees but only if he and his team can go there so he can fix it. Gerson reluctantly agrees so Frank recruits his former team members Tank Sullivan Jerry O'Neill and Hawk Hawkins to join him. After some strenuous tests they're cleared. And they go up with two other astronauts and check out the satellite and discover that they weren't told the whole truth.";

	schema:reviewBody "Space Cowboys builds its humor around a quartet of aged characters who seize their first and last opportunity to fulfill their lifelong goal of going into space. Space Cowboys satirizes the traditionally romanticized conception of the young hero by portraying its characters as sagacious yet imperfect old men.Space Cowboys revisits its embittered protagonist the retired Air Force test pilot Frank Corvin Clint Eastwood forty years after a humiliating episode where he is replaced by a monkey for a 1958 NASA mission to space. Unexpectedly Frank is summoned by exboss and NASA official Bob Gerson James Cromwell to fix a Russian communications satellite that is soon to crash and that contains the obsolete guidance system that he and his colleagues designed for the earlier satellite Skylab. Realizing he is the only one who can fix the system Frank coerces the desperate Bob into rehiring his old team pilot Hawk Hawkins Tommy Lee Jones structural engineer Jerry O'Neil Donald Sutherland and navigator Tank Sullivan James Garner all seemingly unlikely candidates for the task at hand. Gaining the trust of NASA Engineer Sara Holland Marcia Gay Harden and the mistrust of flight director Eugene Davis William Devane the reunited Team Daedalus face the biggest mission of their lives.Space Cowboys which benefits from the performances of four seasoned actors successfully establishes its four main characters as the source for all its comedy. Space Cowboys' initial introduction of its protagonist in the brief black and white sequence which includes the humiliating incident with the monkey offers a convenient setup which allows the ellipsis of forty years to hyperbolize the four characters' emotional states and to justify their subsequent actions. Furthermore this initial sequence which also depicts the four characters as audacious US Air Force pilots establishes itself as a point of reference against which the present inconsequential lives of Frank Hawk Jerry and Tank will be contrasted.Space Cowboys subtly and effectively creates an analogy between the characters and the troublesome guidance system while the men's present occupations are portrayed as rather useless the guidance system's design is described as old and obsolete yet neither the men nor the system are entirely expendable. This suggested duality of mansystem is emphasized by Frank's ironic statement ...it wasn't designed for this duration. While Space Cowboys draws its humor from the characters' efforts to revert to their prior occupation and regain importance the second part of the film the mission serves a dramatic purpose where the characters' true mission is to disprove the others' belief that they are outdated and replaceable. Narratively Space Cowboys' space sequence does little more than simply prolong the characters' task of proving themselves yet visually it offers eyecatching special effects and set design.Nevertheless Space Cowboys succeeds more as a comedy that deconstructs its heroes than as a drama that exalts their heroism.".

While Space Cowboys draws its humor from the characters' efforts to revert to their prior occupation and regain importance the second part of the film the mission serves a dramatic purpose where the characters' true mission is to disprove the others' belief that they are outdated and replaceable. Narratively Space Cowboys' space sequence does little more than simply prolong the characters' task of proving themselves yet visually it offers eyecatching special effects and set design.Nevertheless Space Cowboys succeeds more as a comedy that deconstructs its heroes than as a drama that exalts their heroism.";

	schema:reviewBody "The year is 1958. Frank Corvin a bit of a rebel and a hothead leads Daedalus a small Air Force team training to be the first men in space. However his lead pilot William Hawk Hawkins is even wilder. He pushes a test flight beyond its limit. They have to bail out. The plane is destroyed and it leads the project director Bob Gerson to pull the plug on Daedalus and set his sights on putting a chimp into space first instead.We cut to the present circa 2000. A Russian communications satellite is experiencing problems and will return to Earth if it isn't fixed. We see a Russian General Vostow Rade Serbedzjia and Gerson James Cromwell now a NASA director agreeing to attempt repair. The only problem is that the guidance system is so antiquatedit's the same as the old Skylab guidance systemthat no one in NASA can quite figure it out and they only have a few weeks to act. It turns out that Corvin Clint Eastwood designed the guidance system. Gerson and Corvin understandably hate each other because of the events in 1958 but Gerson gives the okay to contact Corvin to see if he can fix the system somehow or train others to do it. Corvin finally agrees but only if Gerson consents to a seemingly crazy planCorvin wants the four members of DaedalusHawkins Tommy Lee Jones Jerry O'Neill Donald Sutherland Tank Sullivan James Garner and himself all now senior citizensto be sent up in the space shuttle to fix the satellite.As many have pointed out Space Cowboys seems like a bit of a riff on Armageddon 1998 and understandably soan unlikely gruff motley crew are sent into space by NASA on short notice to stave off some kind of impending disaster. However it would be difficult to say that Space Cowboys was directly influenced by Armageddon. They're too close in time and scripts have a tendency to float around Hollywood for a while before they're picked up and greenlighted. What seems more likely is that Space Cowboys was just another one of the films riding on a trend in the late 1990s for sending motley crews into the face of danger in some kind of insular vehicle against all odds to save the planet. It wasn't only Armageddon that had that plot and at any rate anyone who regularly reads my reviews knows that I disagree with the cult of originality. Films aren't better just because they're unprecedented. Space Cowboys does the plot just as well as Armageddon.Besides like Armageddon there are other stories happening here too. The focus is much more on the geriatric crew and their relationships to each other and a few select NASA employees. After the period intro the bulk of the film focuses on Corvin fighting for the agreement to get his friends into space trying to get his friends regrouped fighting against Gerson who is trying to sabotage him in various ways and Daedalus' training period.Given that structure the casting was extremely important. Eastwood who also directed produced and contributed some of the music put together an excellent bunch. Eastwood Jones Sutherland and Garner mesh extremely well even if Sutherland and Garner do not get nearly as much screen time. This is a fairly serious film in many ways but it also has a strong comic element running throughout. Eastwood and scriptwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner find a nice balance between the film's various modes. Although the NASAoriented material works well enough the best moments arrive through the core cast's more mundane interactions including the scenes where Corvin first tracks his friends down.We know that Eastwood as a director is extremely skilled and multifaceted. Even at that it was surprising initially to see him tackle film with scifi elements but he's just as adept here whether it's creating suspenseful moments that hinge on dialloaded equipment or achieving attractive space cinematography. He proves a natural at the latterthe closing scene of the film is one of the more poetic yet economical in cinema history.However some of the film's minor flaws also arrive with the scifi material but seem to emanate from the script. The dialogue can become too jargony andor gobbledygooky to follow especially during a few crucial moments. I never did quite follow the final solution to the dilemma despite rewinding the DVD a couple times and putting on the subtitles although I was able to figure out the gist of it so it made sense in a more fantastical way.But even without a full comprehension of the plot details when it came to technologyoriented ideas Eastwood as a director is able to completely wrap you up in the film emotionally. The climax is sustained and will have you on the edge of your seat ready to cheer the penultimate scene despite realizing how ridiculous it is to do this towards your television.Although it's not a perfect film Space Cowboys delivers just what it shoulda very entertaining ride with a fair amount of poignant subtexts about friendship loyalties and our culture's offbase conventionspopular beliefs about age and ability.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much about Space Cowboys that is unrealistic and if you think about it silly. But it manages to tell this story in an entertaining fashion. So my advice is just turn off your brain and enjoy.The story begins in 1958. Despite all their training towards orbital travel NASA is created and the Air Force folks who were working towards space were told to stand down. This part of the story is true and some of the pilots from all different branches of the military went on to become NASA astronauts. But some didn't...and the story now jumps to the present 2000. Frank Clint Eastwood is still rather bitter he never got a chance to go to space when his project for the Air Force was canceled...but now in his senior years an opportunity arises. A Soviet satellite is falling out of orbit and somehow the only person on a planet of 7000000000 people who can fix it is Frank!! He insists that he doesn't want to tell a young astronaut how to fix it but will go to space himself...provided NASA also allows his three friends who were ALSO with project Daedalus to join him on the flight. What follows are lots of old geezer jokes and montages. Eventually the four guys are shot into space with two young hot shots. Unfortunately there are two huge problems. The satellite is NOT a communications satellite AND one of the crew members might just endanger millions because he's a horse's butt.So is any of this believable? Not really. But it is engaging and the special effects quite amazing for 2000. My only real quibbles are that James Garner's character is poorly written as he acts nothing like a Baptist minister how many Baptist ministers say the Rosary as well as quote Alan Shepard instead of making a simple prayer?? and a lot of what surprises everyone in the film seems telegraphed. But the good far outweighs the bad and the picture is never dull.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is so much about Space Cowboys that is unrealistic and if you think about it silly. But it manages to tell this story in an entertaining fashion. So my advice is just turn off your brain and enjoy.The story begins in 1958. Despite all their training towards orbital travel NASA is created and the Air Force folks who were working towards space were told to stand down. This part of the story is true and some of the pilots from all different branches of the military went on to become NASA astronauts. But some didn't...and the story now jumps to the present 2000. Frank Clint Eastwood is still rather bitter he never got a chance to go to space when his project for the Air Force was canceled...but now in his senior years an opportunity arises. A Soviet satellite is falling out of orbit and somehow the only person on a planet of 7000000000 people who can fix it is Frank!! He insists that he doesn't want to tell a young astronaut how to fix it but will go to space himself...provided NASA also allows his three friends who were ALSO with project Daedalus to join him on the flight. What follows are lots of old geezer jokes and montages. Eventually the four guys are shot into space with two young hot shots. Unfortunately there are two huge problems. The satellite is NOT a communications satellite AND one of the crew members might just endanger millions because he's a horse's butt.So is any of this believable? Not really. But it is engaging and the special effects quite amazing for 2000. My only real quibbles are that James Garner's character is poorly written as he acts nothing like a Baptist minister how many Baptist ministers say the Rosary as well as quote Alan Shepard instead of making a simple prayer?? and a lot of what surprises everyone in the film seems telegraphed. But the good far outweighs the bad and the picture is never dull.";

Clint Eastwood has still to make a poor movie and his part in this is no less absorbing than his earlier titles. Best of all it is a film in which age and experience appear to win out against the young  well I am 58 so it naturally appealed to me. It takes your through all the emotions from laughter to tears. Overall a brilliant family movie based on a really good yarn which I highly recommend for all the family to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an utterly forgettable movie and the flaws are ordinary and uninteresting. But there are some interesting things about it.Clint Eastwood is a rather highly regarded director he is not someone who can get inside a script and create and pare to a unique vision. Rather he is a no nonsense sticktotheschedule craftsman who focuses on performances. So he's very popular in the business while keeping his distance.Here we have four actors. None is a great actor but each has mastered a particular approach. The problem in this case is if we let these men do what they do and each has a different contrasting style how we pull off an ensemble piece?We do have radically differing styles here. Garner is a natural comedic with an emphasis on body movement. Eastwood is purely facial. His comedic strength is in his vocal stance when speaking while Garners is in his timing. Both are external' actors meaning they put on' their role. Jones attempts the most in his general approach the standard method' and is the least accomplished while Sutherland has thoroughly mastered his simpler but similar goal. Both are internal' actors. It must have been quite a set with Clint trying to get some shared vision of what to project and how.All the ensemble scenes other than walking are cut and we have instead individuals and pairs. That works well enough for this film though I think more Garner would have been funnier.I have been in most all the places at Johnson Space Center where the film is set and that took some of the fun out. That's because folks NASA uses really OLD technology partly because they are not the brightest kids on the block partly because of they way they buy things and partly because older stuff is more reliable. And they have many many old guys on board mostly as doubletriple dipping consultants. So the notion of an obsolete' guidance system is laughable. The shuttle's flight control system was essentially designed 35 years ago! But Clint doesn't know that I guess.The nearly final shot is a panning shot of the moon which seamlessly zooms in a few thousand miles to normal' figure distance. This computer generated effect is best in class.".

But anyone with a fighting chance at a tripledigit IQ will know they're going to make it.In the film's closing sequence the camera's point of view zooms up from the Earth to the Moon while Frank Sinatra belts out Fly Me To The Moon in the background to reveal the wreckage of the satellite then pans to Tommy Lee's spacesuit propped up against a nearby boulder then tightens to a closeup of the moonscape reflected in his visor. Wow.Look I'm more willing than most to suspend my disbelief but that satellite would have been traveling so fast like several miles per second when it smacked into the Moon there wouldn't have been enough left of Mr. Jones' character to fit on a postage stamp.I guess that  at the last possible instant  Tommy Lee jumped off and was able to hit the Moon running.

While I admit that this film had a few good points it seemed to have more bad points.My main complaint is how completely formulatic this film is.  As the astronauts entered their shuttle and gave a glance to the crowd I leaned over to my friend and remarked Gee I wonder which of these guys isn't coming back.'  It's completely obvious.  I wish the screenwriters had at least attempted to break the mold here and throw a few surprises at us.  I must give a little credit to Clint Eastwood as the director however. There is an interesting effect in the opening sequences in which he uses voiceovers to convince the audience that the young pilots are the same characters as the old ones.  While this is a good attempt it just doesn't work.  Tommy Lee Jones' young character was particularly laughable. but nice try guys.  I think they must have realized that it wasn't really going to work because they made every attempt they could to cover the mouths of all the actors.Secondly it seems like a lot of elements were just glossed over.  For example we don't really spend any time with the main character's wife. We meet her in the beginning but then we don't see her again until the launch during which she never says a word.  It would have been interesting to know what she thinks about the mission.  Is she excited for her husband? Is she nervous?  How did he break the news to her?  Does she not want him to go?  Additionally when a main character sacrifices himself the film doesn't spend much time on his departure.  At least the movie didn't create a typically sappy goodbye' scene but in a sharp contrast the scene seems rather rushed.  In fact the whole space section of the film is rather rushed.  And in the end what happens to the villains' of the film?  Are they punished?  Are they even exposed?  There's no real payoff there. As a side note why WHY are NASA and air force guys always chewing gum in films?Final complaint I promise.  Why does Hollywood insist on bending the laws of physics and creating sound in space?  Can't they find a creative way to deal with this?  Let us concentrate on the silence of space for a change or allow us to listen to the film's score.  With a film like Star Wars sound in space is forgivable because the story is a fantasy.  Here we have a film that pretends to be based around scientific facts.Donald Sutherland does an excellent job thanks to his fine acting skills and the humorous dialogue in the script.  There are some genuinely smart funny moments in the film but I'm afraid it just doesn't make a good film. I suppose the purpose was to create just a fun entertaining film without anything substance.  If you like those kinds of films you'll probably really like this one.  I haven't seen Armageddon but if people consider this film to be significantly better then I must NEVER see Armageddon!".

As a side note why WHY are NASA and air force guys always chewing gum in films?Final complaint I promise.  Why does Hollywood insist on bending the laws of physics and creating sound in space?  Can't they find a creative way to deal with this?  Let us concentrate on the silence of space for a change or allow us to listen to the film's score.  With a film like Star Wars sound in space is forgivable because the story is a fantasy.  Here we have a film that pretends to be based around scientific facts.Donald Sutherland does an excellent job thanks to his fine acting skills and the humorous dialogue in the script.  There are some genuinely smart funny moments in the film but I'm afraid it just doesn't make a good film. I suppose the purpose was to create just a fun entertaining film without anything substance.  If you like those kinds of films you'll probably really like this one.  I haven't seen Armageddon but if people consider this film to be significantly better then I must NEVER see Armageddon!";

The four main characters all do excellent jobs in portraying their respective characters. I especially enjoyed the comic relief presented by Donald Sutherland's character. The characters are all wellwritten and their actions are credible in nearly every scene. The special effects are pretty good they look very real and do a good job of convincing the viewer that it is actually happening or at the very least it could happen. The end could be called poetic without giving it too much credit. The actors all share very good onscreen chemistry. You believe that these people could have that friendship with each other.

Donald Sutherland portrays the group's horn dog James Garner the kindly country preacher and Tommy Lee Jones the showoff who never grew up. Marcia Gay Harden is as always lovely and charming as the NASA Mission Director who must make sure the group can qualify for the flight. William Devane is the cranky Flight Director and appearances by Barbara Babcock and Blair Brown make the show a little easier on the eyes as if that were necessary. The photography is uncanny and had to incorporate some of NASA's footage of the Space Shuttle and some EVA's extra vehicular activities and the entire film breathes realism from start to finish.

Surely I thought I should be rushing to see both of these given my fondness for that period of the director's career. Surely they would conform to this extraordinary block of raw talent.An ex Air Force scientist denied the chance to go into space following the establishment of NASA Frank Corvin is called upon to bring down a dangerously unstable Russian satellite which employs a nowarchaic system he designed. Spying the opportunity to achieve his onetime dream he rounds up the old team for one last mission.I think it way have been the nature of Space Cowboys which perhaps subliminally kept me from getting around to it. A cast littered with highly esteemed names a massive budget a highconcept premise. None of these things were ever present for the slew of masterpieces which followed some big names appeared I grant you but never so many simultaneously a factor I must have considered an ill omen for this film's chances with me. I like my Eastwood dark and dramatic not lighthearted and actionfilled. Nevertheless I was willing to get invested and involved the cast offering names the like of Eastwood Jones Sutherland and Cromwell all of whom I'm deeply fond of. The plot is of course rather farfetched and requires a considerable leap of faith. If you approach this film with cynicism you will be lost immediately upon learning that NASA is willing to send a force of geriatrics into space. That said it is explained as best as possible given that Corvin is literally the only man for the job the government's acceptance of his terms is somewhat less fantastical especially considering the delicate balance of international relations thereon dependent. The narrative structure is beyond the age issue pretty standard following the well established path of gradual training and the resolution of whatever issues are encountered. When a serious problem threatens the success of the mission a creaking clich steps in to fix it. We all know the story for so many times have we seen it unfold. And yet in spite of all the problems of sheer unoriginality and a formulaic implementation the film is damn enjoyable. There is a heartwarming charm to be felt in seeing these actors occupying the screen together and having quite so much fun in the process. They crack jokes compete physically and sexually and behave like little boys. Maybe that is the key to the film's charm the participant's tongueincheek acceptance of their own age and a bold defiance of the societally imposed limitations thereof. In a way the absurdity and ridiculousness of the premise is entirely intentional allowing these onetime cowboys to ride again and feel the vigour of youth. And who are we to deny them that?Though it is completely and utterly ludicrous and requires quite a substantial suspension of disbelief one gets the impression that Space Cowboys plays upon just that very aspect of itself breathing a renewed life into its elderly participants and vicariously so into its audience. An ode to youth and a firm middle finger to the limitations of age one cannot help being drawn into its fantasy.".

Cinderela Bahiana a movie so bad that misspells its goddamn title it's supposed to be baiana someone from the state of Bahia and not bahiana.Among the breathtaking scenes that make this an absolute dogsht is a fight featuring a countrywideknown singer Alexandre Pires and introducing one of the most famous actors from Brazil the excellent Lzaro Ramos that used his salary in this to pay for acting classes  at least one good thing this film brought to the world ears are pulled punches are thrown in the air and all of that is accompanied by a thrilling soundtrack of random animal ??? noises. My personal favorite scene.Probably one third of the movie is made of random people dancing at dance classrooms Cinderela's mother fights with little kids on a highway for 5cent coins thrown by truck drivers and then dies from a snake bite the Pierre character is played by the amazingly bad Perry Salles in such an atrocious and overthetop way that is almost unbelievable and please pay attention at the absurdity of this the movie ends with Cinderela dancing around nuns yes NUNS and dozens of children while a dubious choice of song plays with lyrics that could be closelytranslated as Everything that's perfect we pick up by the arm  take her in the middle stick it up and stick it down  after nine months you can see the outcome. So appropriate.To sum it up not Ed Wood not Bob Clark not Adam Sandler and not even Tommy Wiseau were able to make something as awful as this piece of garbage.

We see familiar faces from previous parts make a reappearance neatly tying things together. Gabriel himself having lived as a human for many years since part 2 has come to see the world from an entirely different perspective changing his role in the series and making for some interesting and funny scenes and dialogue.On an action level this does not disappoint either. The angels fight in interesting ways their fights and jumping around seem kind of Matrixinspired but not as overthetop CGIed as in Matrix.All in all this movie is great fun.

It has some weaknesses but overall I didn't mind watching it.The Weaknesses No recognizable angelic names in it with the exception of Gabriel. The bad guy Zophael is a total noname so you don't really know how to rank him powerfulnot powerful which wasn't really a problem in the first part. There you knew that Simon was more powerful than Uziel that Gabriel could beat Simon's ass and that Lucifer could smack them all to hell in a handbasket. Funnily this works to advantage for the movie as you don't really know which side of the factions Zophael and who actually is the goodbad guy until somewhat in the middle of the movie. The actors aren't all that good with the exception of Walken Spano  who brings that charisma back to the angels that was so severely lacking in the second part and the Coroner who has grown to be one of my favourite characters in the three moviesStrenghts The storyline is closed. I won't argue that it's the most coherent storyline but it at least makes some moderate sense in itself. The musical score has always been one of the big things about the trilogy and they kept it wisely unchanged for the most part. This time around we have more funny scenes and even some jabs at the original 'The Prophecy' while not making it campy and keeping all the good bits fights heart ripping supernatural powers etc.. Some of the moves seem very Matrixlike but that was already the case in 'The Prophecy II' so I don't really know who copied from whom It just seems so similar Humans fighting against some overly powerful and nigh unkillable opponents in cool long dark suits. No matter It's fun to watch. This time we also don't get treated to some candy sweet religious thing in the end where the main character suddenly becomes a devout Christian  that's a big plus.Overall I'd recommend seeing this film. Best if viewed together with the other two or you will not get many of the references.710".

In fact you could put the three movies together back to back to back and have a coherent movie and think you're watching one big movie.

I especially like the continuity from sequel to sequel kind of like catching up to familiar old buds. The acting was pretty good the terminatorbad angel was pretty appealing and Danyael was played well. No big sfx to speak off this is a dtv after all and the female lead goes from mediocre to just plain can'tactherwayoutofabag bad. In fact the movie lags only when the Maggie character is onscreen. She has very little charisma and has even less talent. Everything rings fake and in a movie where there are angels running and walking around in longcoats credibility is already stretched thin  it doesn't help if your female lead looks like she got the part not because of her acting skills but because she looks good in a shirt that shows off her midriff.Good movie if you like the Prophecy storyline which I think this movie was made for. Budget couldn't have been more than a few million and I'm pretty sure most of that went to Walkens who got top billing despite being a supporting character. The kid who played Danyael was also pretty good and the terminatorangel was also good.At the end of this movie I can't help but hope for a 3rd sequel. I just love this storyline it'd be nice to see what happened in a Prophecy 4. Since they spent so little money on this and I'm pretty sure the returns are pretty good here's hoping for a 3rd sequel.".

The finale did not seem to be worth making a trilogy about. Plus it is somewhat confusing what happened at the end. The scope of the first two films led me to expect something grander. On a positive note the special effects in this installment were the best of the trilogy.The pace was a little stopandgo for my taste too many flashbacks and too long between the action. The humorous parts were funny but at the same time it undermined the atmosphere that the series is based on.Christopher Walken again stole the show. He has perhaps the best delivery of any actor and can manage to handle lines that should have never been in the script. The two costars I thought lacked screen presence or at least compared to Walken.Overall this was an enjoyable ending to a surprisingly good trilogy.".

The finale did not seem to be worth making a trilogy about. Plus it is somewhat confusing what happened at the end. The scope of the first two films led me to expect something grander. On a positive note the special effects in this installment were the best of the trilogy.The pace was a little stopandgo for my taste too many flashbacks and too long between the action. The humorous parts were funny but at the same time it undermined the atmosphere that the series is based on.Christopher Walken again stole the show. He has perhaps the best delivery of any actor and can manage to handle lines that should have never been in the script. The two costars I thought lacked screen presence or at least compared to Walken.Overall this was an enjoyable ending to a surprisingly good trilogy.";

Christopher Walken delivers what I think is one of his best performances.If you like thoughtful movies that will keep you pondering past the credits this is a good one.

It's almost as if the writers were making up their own religion on the spot with no apparent sense of direction or purpose. In any case this film essentially fastforwards a bit from the last movie The Prophecy II to the point where the nephalim Danyael Rosales Dave Buzzotta is now a young man being hunted by the angel Zophael Vincent Spanno because Danyael might interfere with the plans of another angel named Pyriel Scott Cleverdon. As everyone probably knows Zophael is the spy of God whose allegiance is uncertain to everybody in Heaven and Pyriel is the angel of genocide who wants to be the savior of mankind by possibly killing everyone. Danyael on the other hand is the word and that apparently means something to somebody. In any case Danyael has to be stopped. So does Pyriel for that matter. Meanwhile the archangel Gabriel Christopher Walken is still in his earthbound human form but has allowed his hair to grow and has learned how to drive. Throw in some dull performances by everyone except Christopher Walken and the film pretty much winds down to yet another strange conclusion which will certainly be addressed in the next installment. Definitely below average.".

The Prophecy trilogy isn't just about angels  action it's the story of Gabriel played as none other by the incomparable Christopher Walken. That's about all I'll say about the plot because I don't want to ruin it.What made the original Prophecy so great wasn't just the story  the actiondrama but it was the way they blended some hilarious comedic moments into the mix. In that respect I compare the original Prophecy to dark action comedies like Pulp Fiction which features a lot of actors who also appeared in The Prophecy. If you liked those surreal Prophecy laughs like when Gabriel  Rachel stop at a roadside diner or the comedic wit of the coroner Joseph etc you'll see more of that here in the 3rd installment.Gabriel stops in at the same roadside diner to irritate the stonefaced Madge once again. We also get some great moments from Joseph the coroner Steve Hytner from Seinfeld... Gold Jerry! Gold! and of course the great oneliners from Gabriel instantly reminding us that this is a characteristic human movie.The action scenes are very good using the new at the time wire techniques like in Crouching Tiger. There is a relentless tension that builds due to one character's unstoppable hunt for another like in Terminator or Westworld. But this movie throws you a curve ball at the end showing you the story is actually about something completely different.I haven't yet seen The Prophecy 4  5 but I can't imagine anything that could follow this film as the best conclusion to the angelsbehavingbadly series.

In The Terminator a man was sent back in time to protect a predetermined mother of the chosen one.

In the Prophecy 2 and Angel comes to earth to impregnate a predetermined mother of the chosen one. Ends up dying at the hands of Gabriel who becomes human in part three and protects the chosen one against a new evil. Really all they did was exchange Cyborgs for Angels and instead of a HumanCyborg war it's a humanangel war. Now the movie was pretty decent but because it's a total rip off you'd be better of watching The Terminator and Terminator 2. Better story line and waaaaaaay better graphics.".

	schema:reviewBody "This final chapter of the trilogy brings together all the unanswered questions of the first two films. Walken Hytner and delightfully Sandra Ellis Lafferty reprise their roles with amazing clarity. Walken is the mortal Gabriel who was cast to earth after the final scene in Prophecy 2 and he makes it apparent whose side he is on. By becoming one of the talking monkeys he now understands the value of their existence and realizes he can no longer oppose God's plan. Dave Buzzota in his premier performance is intense and powerful as the Nephalim who soon discovers he has been kicking against the pricks. When his destiny is revealed he throws himself into the role with such vehemence that you get caught up in his mission. The characters are consistent with the first two films and the overall feel of the movie is enticing and thrilling. Rated R for violence language and some brief nudity this is a good film for followers of modern horror and a must see for anyone who enjoyed the first two film. Collectible with the set meaningless without the others.".

Well nothing really but there is so little new stuff that it comes across as a pale facsimile of the first two films. At least the filmmakers seemed to realise this and didn't try to stretch it our unnecessarily by putting in pointless subplots and scenes this is a pretty merciful 80 minutes.Get in. Tell story. Get out.At the close of the second film Valerie was Knocked up by an Angel which sounds like the logical follow up to the old Touched by an Angel TV show but apparently is unrelated.She is toasted  literally  in the first scene here but apparently her young child named Danyael survived although the second scene throws that on thought its ear as he is gunned down in cold blood while attempting a backroom sermon of sorts denouncing God as a deadbeat dad.As always the plot has Character A needing to get to Point B while Character C Gabriel in the first two films and evil angel named Zophael here tries to stop him usually by a technique known as death. It worked for the first two but seems a little tired here.Walken is back as Gabriel once more along with the morgue attendant as the only familiar faces though now Gabriel is human and homeless. He can drive but he can't get a job apparently he spends the bulk of the week saving for hookers so he can find momentary release. Gabriel pops up from now and then to give unsolicited advice but in reality he is only here because Walken agreed to show up once more the same film could be made without him and you wouldn't notice.Once Zophael shows to take Danyael's heart the movie kicks into the same old formula. Danyael rises from the dead stronger and better than ever with a new sixth sense style warning system that seems to twig when he is in imminent danger. Now that he is reborn he is basically  Angel and apparently is therefore the only guy that can stop something quite dramatic from happening due to the continuing Angelic War.So off they go to stop Pyriel from basically supplanting God and creating Hell on Earth Apparently.Zophael takes Danyael's girlfriend Maggie as both chauffeur and aide Danyael heads off to a distant spot apparently being lead by some sort of internal holy GPS and Mary from the first film returns for a very brief  30 second cameo.There is some pompous sounding talk from those currently or once Angelic some disbelieving from the humans despite what they continually witness and some serious sounding theological discussion that makes these films either more or less watchable depending on your viewpoint. Put another way if you like the first and second films you'll think this a 7.5  10.I've seen all 3 2 more still to come and if I separate me from my love of the first film and respect for the 2nd I can impartially say this is a 6.5  10 when viewed in isolation. OK but merely OK.Final Rating  6.5  10. It still holds true to the tone that made the first film a minor classic it just has nothing new to say.".

This one at least is more exciting and entertaining to watch though it still is far from a great movie itself.Seems like they actually got to spend some money this time on the movie. Visually the movie is good looking and it has a nice overall style and some standout visual sequences.It also certainly helps that the movie that it has plenty of action in it. It gives the movie lots of pace and make it a pleasant and at times also exciting one to watch. Seems that the movie its action got mostly inspired by the success of the first The Matrix movie but that's OK really. I still don't understand though why these movies all need to be so confusing and hard to follow. They are hard to follow not because they are deliberately complicated or brilliant written but because of the opposite really. It are some really messy stories and the director seems to have an hard time trying to tell the story. The whole idea behind the movies of having angels battling each other on Earth but the way it all gets presented in these movies make it hard to keep interest in them. It's far instance really hard to say who are supposed to be the good and bad guys in this one and what it is that they want also of course due to the fact that this is something about its characters that constantly changes throughout the movie.The movie rapidly starts to get worse as it heads toward its ending. At this point the movie its story isn't even trying anymore it seems. It all becomes quite bad and you simply stop caring what is exactly going on because of it.I also don't really know why Christopher Walken got pushed a bit to the background this time. He pops up ever now and then but once you start thinking about it was he really needed in this movie? He must have felt the same way since this was the last movie out of the series in which he appeared. He is the foremost reason why the series ever became such a fairly popular one in the first place. He's still great and fun though in the sequences that he is in. He still looks weird though with that long fake hair.Far from anything too great but it's more watchable and entertaining than the previous movies out of the series I have to give the movie credit for that.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

I do remember that Walken's character had been stripped of power and became a human at the end of the previous movie. But his character here seems different not the villainous figure he previously was. He seems to have some kind of supernatural powers now. He actually seems to be angling to be a good guy at times. But anyway I found his character to be very inconsequental  he could have easily been written out of the movie. Maybe that's why Walken gives an underwhemling performance here.I found the other characters to be poorly constructed as well. The main bad guy was simply not that interesting with murky motives. By the time the underwhelming climax rolled around I simply didn't care anymore.Anything positive to say about this movie? Well for a madeforvideo movie the production values are overall okay. Despite many costcutting measures like frequent closeups and unimaginative L.A. and desert locations chosen the movie looks okay to the eye. But even bigbudget filmmaking would not have helped the sorry script.".

The fact that there's finally answers to the storyline are a major one even though there's nothing about it in the beginning and there's only a few at the ending but these are enough to make it feel really conclusive to the story. The story lines are done and settled with no loose ends left with the several stories here still leave the film with no questions about what's going on in the series. All of them are tied up and given explanations making this one really feel nice in it's conclusion to the series. There's even a few really good action scenes in here to make it even more interesting. There's a spectacular footchase through a series of buildings and streets that really gets the excitement into the film. It has a fun conclusion that is pretty otherworldly and combines a lot of action into it. There's also a few fistfights that incorporate some highflying martial arts into the proceedings and a rather bloodsoaked finale that has enough bodypiercing and heartremoving to leave the gorehounds satisfied. The device is pretty nice and actually has a painfullooking purpose for it. That's what it should be and manages to do it successfully. These here are what really help the movie.The Bad News This one here doesn't have that many flaws to hold it down. One of the main ones is that there's a whole lot of scenes in the beginning which are just dull. The film is beginning to get it's mystery started and there's nothing in the film that really matters all that much. It takes a long time to set up the mystery and from there it isn't too long to really get the film going but with the points it has to deal with until then are just too dull to matter. When that ends there's also the film's embarrassingly brief running time. This one really should've been stretchered out to a much longer time as this makes the final epic battle seem relatively weak. It's all dealt with too quickly and there's nothing in here that really makes that feel any different. The final confrontation is distressingly weak and with a little more time it could've been something. It has a little bit of something there but it's handled way too differently to really have the grandiose feeling that it really should've had from where the story was going. Even worse with the film feeling too short it's over before it feels like it and the with the grandiose feeling that it was going for the quickness really detriments it from feeling that way. Otherwise these here the film's really bad points.The Final Verdict More of a conclusion to the series than anything else this one here accomplishes the task rather well. This one is really only for the fans of the series or the incredibly interested otherwise this one should be used with extreme caution.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity".

	schema:reviewBody "'Airplane!' the funniest film Mel Brooks never made came out in 1980 and became one of the year's biggest hits. This wild spoof of '70's disaster movies did not as some believe kill the genre  it had burned itself out well before then  but certainly made a fitting headstone.Interviewed at the time Jim Abrahams said a sequel was in the offing to be provisionally entitled 'The 747 Strikes Back'. But when it finally appeared two years later it was called 'Airplane 2 The Sequel' and neither Abrahams nor Jerry and David Zucker had anything to do with it. Ken Finkleman writer of 'Grease 2' served in the dual capacity of writer and director. He retained most of the original's characters  except for Leslie Nielsen's 'Dr.Rumack' .After the events of the original film Ted Stryker  Robert Hays  became a moon pilot but got incarcerated in a lunatic asylum  named after Ronald Reagan  following a major screwup while the love of his life the beautiful Elaine  Julie Hagerty  is stewardess aboard the maiden commercial space shuttle flight to the Moon. A faulty computer sends the craft hurtling towards the Sun. Luckily a passenger  Sonny Bono  had the foresight to bring along a bomb in a briefcase. But who can bring the craft down? Guess who?The problem is that 'Airplane!' did not need a sequel. The original's freshness was bound to be lost  and was. I would imagine that the people who found this really funny in 1982 were those who never saw the first. Many gags are recycled the hysterical woman being slapped by a long line of people the 'what is it?' exchanges MacCroskey  Lloyd Bridges  leaning on his desk and mimicking the pose on the picture behind him someone throwing away a cigarette and causing an explosion etc.Some gags are lame  when someone says 'this panel is so hot you could fry eggs on it' we next see just that!But there are absolute corkers the poster on the inflight movie is 'Rocky 38' starring an elderly Sly Stallone in boxing gloves a topical gag has E.T. trying to phone home and getting trouble from the operator an elevator plays 'MacArthur Park' incredibly loudly Stryker escapes from the asylum and a searchlight picks out Jack Jones singing the theme from 'The Love Boat' a dogowning family is told that 'Scraps' must have his shots and then the customs officer pulls out a gun and shoots the animal and a boy plays with a computer navigation system thinking it to be a game and almost kills a plane's passengers.William Shatner hams it up wonderfully as the Commander of 'Moonbase Alpha Beta'  a reference to 'Space 1999'  and the presence of Peter Graves  once more 'Captain Oveur'  allows for a dig at 'Mission Impossible'.Despite the overfamiliarity of the material 'Airplane 2' manages to outclass dismal recent attempts at spoof movies most notably the 'Scary Movie' series.Funniest moment  MacCroskey shouts Stryker's surname and a man misunderstanding him punches out a woman. I do not endorse brutality towards women but it creases me up each time! 'Airplane 3' touted at the time went unmade.".

But when it finally appeared two years later it was called 'Airplane 2 The Sequel' and neither Abrahams nor Jerry and David Zucker had anything to do with it. Ken Finkleman writer of 'Grease 2' served in the dual capacity of writer and director. He retained most of the original's characters  except for Leslie Nielsen's 'Dr.Rumack' .After the events of the original film Ted Stryker  Robert Hays  became a moon pilot but got incarcerated in a lunatic asylum  named after Ronald Reagan  following a major screwup while the love of his life the beautiful Elaine  Julie Hagerty  is stewardess aboard the maiden commercial space shuttle flight to the Moon. A faulty computer sends the craft hurtling towards the Sun. Luckily a passenger  Sonny Bono  had the foresight to bring along a bomb in a briefcase. But who can bring the craft down? Guess who?The problem is that 'Airplane!' did not need a sequel. The original's freshness was bound to be lost  and was. I would imagine that the people who found this really funny in 1982 were those who never saw the first. Many gags are recycled the hysterical woman being slapped by a long line of people the 'what is it?' exchanges MacCroskey  Lloyd Bridges  leaning on his desk and mimicking the pose on the picture behind him someone throwing away a cigarette and causing an explosion etc.Some gags are lame  when someone says 'this panel is so hot you could fry eggs on it' we next see just that!But there are absolute corkers the poster on the inflight movie is 'Rocky 38' starring an elderly Sly Stallone in boxing gloves a topical gag has E.T. trying to phone home and getting trouble from the operator an elevator plays 'MacArthur Park' incredibly loudly Stryker escapes from the asylum and a searchlight picks out Jack Jones singing the theme from 'The Love Boat' a dogowning family is told that 'Scraps' must have his shots and then the customs officer pulls out a gun and shoots the animal and a boy plays with a computer navigation system thinking it to be a game and almost kills a plane's passengers.William Shatner hams it up wonderfully as the Commander of 'Moonbase Alpha Beta'  a reference to 'Space 1999'  and the presence of Peter Graves  once more 'Captain Oveur'  allows for a dig at 'Mission Impossible'.Despite the overfamiliarity of the material 'Airplane 2' manages to outclass dismal recent attempts at spoof movies most notably the 'Scary Movie' series.Funniest moment  MacCroskey shouts Stryker's surname and a man misunderstanding him punches out a woman. I do not endorse brutality towards women but it creases me up each time! 'Airplane 3' touted at the time went unmade.";

Instead Simon Chad Everett is going to get married to her as soon as they get back from the first commercial flight to the moon where Elaine is stewerdassing. And what does Ted do? Buy a ticket. And what happens? He has to fly it.But the controls are out of human hands. A computer ROK is driving the ship. It's a notsosubliminal parody of 2001 A Space Odyseey. And what happens to ROK? He becomes drunk with power and becomes demented. Oh yeah and there's a crazy person Sonny Bono who brought a time bomb onto the ship. And there's a horse.Hays strikes right on as Striker and cheery Hagerty outplays everyone. Unfourtanetly as you watch you'll be waiting in vain for Leslie Nielsen. Where is he when you need him?A2TS is still very funny even though the jokes are used over from the first one Austin Powers anyone?. They're played in different ways. More what is it and war is hell jokes are here but they're still funny. One setback is the numerous flashbacks which hinder the course of the plot. I'm not saying they're not funny but in a run of jokes it's not necessary. And it seems like a comedy where they don't know they're in a comedy the jokes are always funnier that way.Luckily Lloyd Bridges reprises his role as Steve McCroskey the vicedriven commander. And Rip Torn makes a miniscule appearance. How could we forget Stephen Stucket the delightfully quirky Jacobs Johnny in the first who can lighten up any dank situation.So it's still funny even if it reuses jokes it's got Sonny Bono and it's got Raymond Burr on the other side of the courtroom in a flashback.My rating 810Rated PG for nudity language and comic violence.".

Airplane II just resurrects most the original cast from the first film and puts them on a spaceship instead of an airplane with the same jokes. In addition the humor is a bit more crude. A joke of a dog being shot with a fake gun I found disturbing. There are also some sexual references in the film that I think should have made this movie rated PG13. However because this rating was not available from the MPAA at the time of its release in 1982 the film is rated PG. However I do NOT recommend it to anyone under 13.The cast however makes an honest effort with the time worn material and there are a couple good laughs but nothing really memorable. The best summery and problem with this movie is that We have seen it all before. I give Paramount credit for not releasing Airplane III! There is a promo for it at the conclusion of the movie.

The plot is kind of like the original except on a spaceship. Pretty early on it was obvious this was going to stink it up....and it did.

Then the dinosaurs came but they got too big and fat. So they all died and turned into oil. Then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. Then Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes. I couldn't believe it! He took her best summer dress and put it on and went to town...But to say that most of the gags were jokes that hit the mark every time... as I just read here on IMDb is a clear overstatement. Case in point McCroskey There's a passenger who is carrying a bomb. Elaine A b gasps McCroskey No not a buh a bomb.Smilefunny not laughfunny but they actually took a second much worse stab at this gag a short time later.Ted Saluchi has a bomb on board. Stewardess A BAAAH? Ted No not a buh a bomb.Totally fails. In listening to the director's commentary on Airplane! I learned that the Zucker brothers and the Abrahams dude had nothing to do with The Sequel. Further in watching the Sequel today I saw the name Ken Finkelman as the writer and director. I knew I recognized that name... According to IMDb he's the actor and star in that Canadian show called The Newsroom. Since I'm a news reporter I bought that on DVD a couple of years ago to see if the cover's claims of Funniest and most brilliant CBC show ever produced was true. I watched from beginning to end but just felt like I was missing something. I'd say more but this is about Airplane!.But Airplane II felt a little more star studded... Shatner his wife Marcy Lafferty is also a lady in line James Noble Governor Gatling from Benson Rip Torn the guy from Battlestar Galactica Sonny Bono Wheel Of Fortune's Pat Sajak as a news anchorman his editorial AAAAAAAAHH! David Leisure Empty Nest and the Isuzu guy Rick Overton Herve Villaichaize as the little breather and IMDb sez Joyce DeWitt Janet from Three's Company and George Wendt from Cheers even have uncredited roles! But clearly Howard W Koch thought he could capture lightning in a jar more cheaply... with Finkleman sted ZAZ and it came off as a cheap knockoff more than a real ZAZ production like Airplane and Police Squad.

Most of the time the sequel rides the wave that the first movie created and the writerdirector of this movie did nothing to help it only hurt it.This time the ridiculously silly movie starts off like the last Airplane movie except that this time it's the first commercial shuttle flight to the first colony on the moon. Ted Stryker played by Robert Hays Dr. T and the women was the test pilot to test the shuttle and after the prototype crashed he was sent to the insane asylum. Meanwhile the shuttle goes forward with its mission. Stryker escapes and tries to get on the shuttle to stop it. Of course he does and he tries to stop the mission and get back together with his girlfriend Elaine played by Julie Hagerty What about Bob? OK the first movie was written and directed by Jim Abrams and the Zucker Brothers David and Jerry. Airplane II was written and directed by Ken Finkleman. I mention this because Finkleman appears to have nothing to do with the first movie and with very few exceptions he steals every joke from the first movie makes a minor change to the joke and then puts it in the new film. Doing it once or twice say like in Austin Powers its OK but if most of your jokes are based on the original jokes from the first movie then it quickly becomes tiresome and unfunny.There are a few jokes that are funny the beginning with the Iran Air Courtesy shuttle is one and most of the stuff with William Shatner was funny until the very end. There are some bits and pieces in the middle but Finkleman depends too much on the original jokes and end the end it kills him.The failure of the movie is on Finkleman. Haggerty and Hays and everyone else did a fine job but they weren't shooting another film as much as performing an encore of the previous show. However the one actor who was missing from this movie which was noticeable was Leslie Neilson. He had an uncanny ability and timing for these kinds of movies which made the Naked Gun series so wonderful. His absence hurt the movie.I say if you have never seen the Airplane movies get the first one it's the best. Ignore this one unless it's on TV but don't see the sequel before you see the first Airplane movie or any of the Naked Guns it is a poor imitation.This review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com".

My favorite part of the movie is when he sees the open door which says. danger Vacuum The music is also great which i learned is from Battlestar Galactica from 1978.

Assistant controller Pretty much the same way as ReganNow that's GENIUS! Every time you watch it you see something new the cannabis deal in the background the advert for Rocky 26 with a geriatric boxer on the poster the Iran Air courtesy bus which must have been damn near the knuckle in 1982! the warning light in the shuttle's cockpit marked 'Odd' with 2 marked 'Strange' and 'Bizarre' on either side the boys downtown it just goes on. If there was one thing missing I would say it is the lack of a song and dance number Ted and Elaine's disco antics in the first film was one of the greatest scenes. That said the storyline does allow us to mock not only disaster movies as the first one did but also to satirise science fiction the sophisticated machine you see in the background of every scifi epic but which actually has no useful purpose funny because it's so so true! Never fails to raise a smile no matter how many times I watch it although I'm glad they stopped the series here it wouldn't have worked if they'd tried to milk it for a third instalment.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was quite looking forward to Trance I had heard a critic say that it was a real effort by Danny Boyle to get out from under the national treasure status he had obtained by how well he opened the Olympics in 2012 and that as a result Trance was very much against that image. He was correct because this is a very graphic film in many ways but before that we get to the plot. The plot is simple  an art robbery goes wrong for some reason with the painting lost when the inside man hides it but forgets where he hid it due to damage inflicted during the robbery. The gang go to a hypnotherapist to try to get it out of him and from here it only gets messy.I can see what the plot was trying to do because it is constantly twisting and turning as minds are messed with actions may or may not be programmed events may or may not be happening and those who appear in control may or may not actually be in control and even if they are or aren't they soon won't be or will be because everything will change in a minute. I guess the aim is that the film was aiming for a narrative similar to that of Inception or Usual Suspects where the story the audience is being told may not be the real story at all. At the end of both these films the effect is to be impressed by how well it did it and I'm sure for many like myself there was the desire to watch it again to be able to see the film in the new context you have. With Trance I did not have this feeling when things did fall into place I only felt that it was such a messy pile that it had fallen into and I had not enjoyed or been engaged in the manner in which it got there or indeed where it got me at all. You can sense it wants to be smarter and more thrilling that it is but where Usual Suspects is slick and stylish on its journey this really just bumbles and blasts it way to the finish hoping it can carry you with it by force alone.This force comes in the style of Boyle's direction and mostly it is good from this point of view  it is a good looking film but it does really feel like he is forcing the excess for the sake of it rather than it being part of the film. So the very extreme scenes of gore felt like the complexity of the story  there for the sake of being there. Of course this is not to say that I didn't appreciate the extreme almost no holds barred nudity from Rosario Dawson but again even for the teenage boy in my head it felt forced and unnatural the use of her nude  not her as a nude. The cast go along with it the best they can. McAvoy is good while Cassel always has a mean presence. Support cast is decent but I am really not sure about Dawson. It is not that she herself is not good it is just that the film asks too much of her character and it is clear that Dawson doesn't always know who she is be  in any one scene she can be what is required but in terms of making it one whole character or making links between these scenes she cannot do it. I do not think the fault is all her  I guess the relationship with Boyle didn't help with this aspect but for sure her performance seems unsure and a bit erratic.Trance will try to bluster and bully you into thinking you're watching something really smart and well structured but this is not the case. The film is confusing for the sake of it excessive for the sake of it and ultimately tries to ride this to a satisfying conclusion but in the end you will not be left with feeling that you immediately want to see it again but rather the lingering doubt as to whether you should have bothered in the first place.".

	schema:headline " Danny Boyle continues on his campaign to never repeat genres  Trance falls just short of greatness";
	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle continues on his campaign to never repeat genres by giving us a stunning psychological thriller that crosses so many boundaries I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable even using the word thriller  the only thing for certain is that it is definitely psychological. Borrowing elements of film noir this exhilarating ride is just short of greatness. Just as you could imagine from the title Trance is a visual aural and intellectual dreamlike experience. Trance stars James McAvoy as Simon an auctioneer who gets mixed up with the wrong group of thieves. Simon's auction house is selling a painting 27 million Roughly 41 million when a thief by the name of Franck Vincent Cassel breaks in and attempts to steal it. Before Franck can do so he and his crew notice the painting has gone missing and Simon is the only person that knows where it is. Unfortunately for Franck Simon suffers a serious blow to the head during all the chaos and cannot remember where it is. After trying to divulge the location from him proves unsuccessful they turn to a hypnotist Rosario Dawson who can unbury any memory and that's where the audience joins in this psychological trip to find the painting. This film will leave you as hypnotized as any member of the cast was I assure you.Dawson and McAvoy deliver excellent performances they handle their roles with such control that every little subtle facial movement reveals more than it should especially within Dawson's character. Vincent Cassel alongside them brings the story to full force and together with Danny Boyle they all bring Joe Aherne's gracefully twitchy screenplay to life.Boyle interestingly enough stuck to his 18A rating not willing to dilute his story so he could hit a broader audience the man isn't afraid to have graphic imagery in his film like other directors who have attempted the genre in a similar way i.e. Chris Nolan Inception. The cinematography is  as always with Boyle  beautiful and in fact rather charming in its own sense. He handles the camera with such precision it's impossible to question his cinematic choices. The coolest aspect of the film being his declaration of war on the senses with a chaotic soundtrack and fast paced editing.The film however is not without flaws. The film so heavily relies on tricking the audience that it's actually very easy to get lost and unfortunately lose interest in the film. While I didn't particularly feel this way I can see why others would have. While I've always been fascinated by the idea of an unreliable narrator to tell your story when you're switching between three perspectives trying to decide which one is reliable it can sometimes take too much focus away from your plot.

	onyx:emotionText "Danny Boyle continues on his campaign to never repeat genres by giving us a stunning psychological thriller that crosses so many boundaries I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable even using the word thriller  the only thing for certain is that it is definitely psychological. Borrowing elements of film noir this exhilarating ride is just short of greatness. Just as you could imagine from the title Trance is a visual aural and intellectual dreamlike experience. Trance stars James McAvoy as Simon an auctioneer who gets mixed up with the wrong group of thieves. Simon's auction house is selling a painting 27 million Roughly 41 million when a thief by the name of Franck Vincent Cassel breaks in and attempts to steal it. Before Franck can do so he and his crew notice the painting has gone missing and Simon is the only person that knows where it is. Unfortunately for Franck Simon suffers a serious blow to the head during all the chaos and cannot remember where it is. After trying to divulge the location from him proves unsuccessful they turn to a hypnotist Rosario Dawson who can unbury any memory and that's where the audience joins in this psychological trip to find the painting. This film will leave you as hypnotized as any member of the cast was I assure you.Dawson and McAvoy deliver excellent performances they handle their roles with such control that every little subtle facial movement reveals more than it should especially within Dawson's character. Vincent Cassel alongside them brings the story to full force and together with Danny Boyle they all bring Joe Aherne's gracefully twitchy screenplay to life.Boyle interestingly enough stuck to his 18A rating not willing to dilute his story so he could hit a broader audience the man isn't afraid to have graphic imagery in his film like other directors who have attempted the genre in a similar way i.e. Chris Nolan Inception. The cinematography is  as always with Boyle  beautiful and in fact rather charming in its own sense. He handles the camera with such precision it's impossible to question his cinematic choices. The coolest aspect of the film being his declaration of war on the senses with a chaotic soundtrack and fast paced editing.The film however is not without flaws. The film so heavily relies on tricking the audience that it's actually very easy to get lost and unfortunately lose interest in the film. While I didn't particularly feel this way I can see why others would have. While I've always been fascinated by the idea of an unreliable narrator to tell your story when you're switching between three perspectives trying to decide which one is reliable it can sometimes take too much focus away from your plot. Besides that Trance is an intellectual delight with enough twists and turns to keep the majority of people interested. Its performances style and tremendous attention to detail is enough make a very balanced film. If you love movies similar to Memento this is definitely something to check out.7.510Be sure to check out my review site thejoshlreviews.com and my video review of this film here httpyoutu.bexpCWBi5N6ew";

	schema:reviewBody "An art auctioneer suffers amnesia when a robbery of a Goya masterpiece went wrong. A hypnotherapist was recruited to jog the memory out of him. Thus begins the multilayered puzzle that is Trance. I could not say more about the story as this remains for you to watch the unfolding of each scene that complicates the one before it.Danny Boyle was very much in the news in the past few years because of his Slumdog Millionaire as well as his London Olympics gig. Now he returns to the big screen directing this Rubik's cube of a film and that itself makes this film an event to witness.James McAvoy plays Simon the art auctioneer with a huge gambling debt caught in a bigger web with the necessary cluelessness and helplessness. In fact I could imagine Boyle's trainspotting discovery Ewan McGregor in this role had it been done ten years ago. Rosario Dawson lends her exotic appeal as hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb. It was her character that provides this film that complex structure which would keep the audience wondering which is reality and which is just a trance. She was credible treading that delicate balance between good and bad realistically keeping the two other male characters guessing at her real intentions. Her brave moment of frontal nudity was key to how the story turns not gratuitous. Vincent Cassel plays Franck the ruthless mastermind of the art heist. His character would have been a onedimensional bad guy in a lesser actor's hands. Here Cassel gives Franck another level of what seems to be vulnerability or then again maybe not.Fans of film noir of films that make you think will enjoy Trance. I am sure many fans of this film will watch it again to try and get it the second or third time around. Boyle has given us Inception without the grand special effects. So good. Mustwatch.".

It takes a while to get to the reason of his involvement but that bit is the easiest you'll have to contend with. At the risk of spoiling some of the plot I'll go ahead and let you in on the part where he intended to doublecross a gang of thieves and in so doing he gets hit in the head trying successfully to prevent his cohorts the thieves in question from finding out too soon. The head injury and perhaps getting hit by a car as he was getting away landed him in the hospital with you guessed it lost memory where he hid the painting is of course now the mystery or is it? His partners in crime were none too appreciative of his treachery and so spare little efforts to shake that memory loose the leader of the gang Franck played by Vincent Cassel was resourceful to say the least in how he went about that but nothing worked until he figures that hypnotherapy might just be the solution.Then the plot thickens quite a bit because the therapist Elizabeth played by the stunning Rosario Dawson is a character a most fascinating one whose depth cunning and determination has no equal not even for the likes of Frank and his gang. She and Simon have history but to discover that history is the whole adventure. Hypnosis is suggestion and who is subjected to it but the audience. It does get messy at times unless you keep in mind that characters well Simon at least are in a trance subconscious in nature.You'll wonder if Elizabeth is not the mastermind she might I won't say. That is one of the reasons I liked this movie the twists and turns. McAvoy and Cassel are performing just like you would expect actors of their calibre would as for Dawson well she impressed me something like Halle Berry did in the movie Monster's Ball. If you have a limited attention span or if you like your thrillers less messy this movie is not for you. The usually friendly McAvoy character is as it turns out not a nice guy and the opposite holds true for Cassel and that was refreshing. You will likely use the rewind button with Rosario Dawson I won't believe you if you say you didn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "2012 was the year that Danny Boyle became a national hero for many in his domestic Britain after masterminding a stunning opening ceremony of the Olympics. Seemingly able to satisfy even the sternest of sceptics with a rabid display of flair and flamboyance he became elevated to a hallowed level of reverence. In the weeks that followed he seemed to acquire an approval rating that most politicians would have gawped at green eyed with envy. He stands tall as an icon of the every man with an unaffected regional accent and amiable demeanour with a dose of easy going charm. Beneath this genial appearance is a voracious talent that is testament to many years of hard work alongside any natural ingenuity. Lauded with plaudits and success it would appear he can do no wrong. Or can he?Returning to his day job Boyle reenters the film arena with Trance a Londonbased psychological thriller that rushes around with about as much calm and patience as an ADHD sufferer. He has said that he was finishing this project whilst he was working on the Olympic opening ceremony and that this should be viewed as its 'dark evil cousin'.Starring Vincent Cassel James McAvoy and Rosario Dawson Trance undertakes a card shuffling roll call of sympathy and understanding. Early on McAvoy's Simon misplaces a valuable painting. Under the persuasive encouragement of Cassel's band of criminals he ends up seeking the counsel and help of hypnotist Elizabeth Dawson to retrace his steps. Although the backdrop for the film is that of a common theme a heist it is merely window dressing for what is an indeed dark and heck schizophrenic joyride into the mind.With a nodded cap to the disorientating freewheeling narrative of Nolan's Memento this film glides along a bumpy path. It takes pleasure in scrutinising the tricks and tics of memory. Boyle plays chess with the players and moves them around with the devilish glee of a ringmaster induced with the cruel egomaniacal urge of a cartoon villain. You can almost hear the grind of his hands rubbing together as he plots each skittish twist and turn. This is aided helpfully by Joe Aherne's source material and the screenplay's joyfully itchy nature. The film also has echoes of Inception. But with added sex.Daring to make this an adult film and not dilute it in order to make it accessible for a wider and broader audience he does not eschew from graphic and explicit depictions. He performs with the cinematic frisson of a British Tarantino but without Quentin's fondness for a baggy screenplay. Having said that and although such comparisons make for neat phrases for critics to write Danny Boyle is very much his own man. His films are all underpinned by his stylistic stamps of authorship. In fact as it tends to be a defining quality of all of Boyle's films this one does not disappoint in its assault on the senses. The thumping soundtrack plays havoc on the ears and the fast cuts fix into the eyes with the precision of a laser beam.Not everything is welcomed wholeheartedly and with open arms however. As much as the virtues of Trance are easy to spot and identify it is also somewhat flawed. So much emphasis seems to be placed on tripping the audience in every possible sense that the film renders itself a little distant to the sense of touch. The characters are slippery and the consequence of such skillful toying with the assumed integrity or lack thereof of the protagonists leads inevitably to an arms space from empathy.In addition to this the relentlessly florid displays of directorial showmanship makes the pacing a little too onesided. So persistent is the pace that the runtime feels a little longer than the 101 minutes that it forms and you may well emerge exhausted as the lights come up. Maybe the frenetic nature of Trance is a deliberate counterpoint to the relative stasis of 127 Hours. As it stands this film zips along at a speed that would make even Usain Bolt baulk and cower with fear.Any quibbles mentioned do not deviate the bottom line verdict. This film is on balance a mighty success. It may not be as charming and lovable as the Oscar garnering Slumdog Millionaire but it is a relentlessly entertaining thrill ride. It stands as an hour and forty minutes at a cinematic equivalent of the best theme park you could name. Hold on tight and buckle in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of every other Danny Boyle movie up until last night when I saw Trance. In its way it is riveting. The pace is unrelenting and the soundtrack does its job admirably creating a tense atmosphere and general air of sexiness. The acting for the most part was skilled but I'm sorry to say James McAvoy whom I have loved in numerous other movies didn't play this particular character on the right note.Briefly the plot involves Note POSSIBLE SPOILERS a priceless Goya painting that goes missing during a botched heist at an auction. James McAvoy plays Simon an employee of the auction house and he seemingly tries to get the painting to safety out of the thieves' hands. In the process the main thief Franck played by Vincent Cassel hits Simon on the head causing serious injury and steals the bag containing the painting. But Franck then discovers that the painting is not in the bag and when Simon finally recovers from his injuries he has amnesia and cannot remember where he hid the painting. SPOILER It becomes clear he was working in cahoots with the thieves and he goes to see a hypnotherapist in the hope that the therapy will jog his memory. It becomes clear very early on from that point that there is more to the therapist Elizabeth Rosario Dawson than is immediately apparent. Insidious games are afoot.Where this film lost me is in the wild inconsistency of the character Simon. Yes because of his memory loss he is an unreliable narrator. What was clear to me is that here is a character whose torment is deeply buried but is brought back to the surface by a blow to the head. In my opinion James McAvoy treated it too lightly. He has shown intensity in other roles but it seemed to me that he didn't bring that intensity to bear here. The character is supposed to be deeply confused but it comes off as mere puzzlement instead. But getting back to unreliability even in the flashbacks it was clear to me that the impact of hypnotherapy on the character's actions was applied only when it served to further the plot. If you were following a logical path SPOILER hypnotherapy could've solved all of Simon's not to mention Elizabeth's dilemmas. I mean if you can control someone via hypnotherapy how far does that control extend? The film blatantly skips over this leaving a gaping plot hole. In the latter half the film starts to descend into absurdity...without getting too spoilery all I'll say is shaving scene. After the movie was over just thinking back on this scene made me hoot with laughter. Another note Vincent Cassel had a thankless role in Franck. Here is an actor who can really dig his teeth into complex characters and Franck is merely a plot device. Cassel is wasted in this role.This film also features what is a particular pet peeve of mine which I realize is entirely subjective all of the main characters are more or less amoral. A movie without a moral center is a rudderless one for me. You could argue that SPOILER Elizabeth's motives have a moral origin but her subsequent actions negate this for me. However it could be in keeping with an early observation put forward in this film about greed  maybe this film is just an exercise in a portrayal of our capacity for greed and our supposed willingness to excuse ourselves our sins and that is all. In the end however it all rang hollow for me.".

Cassel is wasted in this role.This film also features what is a particular pet peeve of mine which I realize is entirely subjective all of the main characters are more or less amoral. A movie without a moral center is a rudderless one for me. You could argue that SPOILER Elizabeth's motives have a moral origin but her subsequent actions negate this for me. However it could be in keeping with an early observation put forward in this film about greed  maybe this film is just an exercise in a portrayal of our capacity for greed and our supposed willingness to excuse ourselves our sins and that is all. In the end however it all rang hollow for me.";

	schema:headline " A disappointing example of technique in search of effect";
	schema:reviewBody "Trance is an extremely convoluted film by director Danny Boyle not necessarily because of the narrative structure but how the film is stylistically pronounced. There are audiovisual red herrings used to mask over the absurdity of a plot that switches from a heist movie to an internal psychodrama. However once you overcome the deliberate sensory overload the story and characters don't make enough sense to hold any emotional investment. Despite Boyle's experience and imprint as a deeply stylised filmmaker Trance is a disappointing example of technique in search of effect. The film starts off with humour and an energetic heist but the story and the character motivations are extremely convoluted buried deep beneath the electronic sound and fury. Simon James McAvoy is an auctioneer or is he? who describes the changing methods of stealing art over the years. It turns out that he is actually part of a job himself and in the chaos of a raid on an auction he snatches a Goya painting. As he escapes he is hit over the head by crime figure Franck Vincent Cassel. Due to the blow on his noggin Simon can't remember where he hid the painting. Franck tortures him for the location but this fails. Simon is then instructed to see Elizabeth Rosario Dawson a hypnotist who Franck and his men believe will be able to work his mind and reveal where the painting is. Simon must lie to Elizabeth about what he is actually trying to find. Aside from the heist there's very little here that's believable or clear. There's an early scene for example where the thugs wire up Simon with a microphone and listen in on the sessions from their car which doesn't ring true. One of the major problems with the film's plotting is that there is little time establishing who the characters are. The screenplay by Joe Ahearne and John Hodge is hesitant to revealing the inner life of the main players only so that they can withhold a huge plot twist at the end. It's not a gamble that pays off because the 'gotcha' moment feels more like a conventional thriller twist rather than a psychological insight into Simon's character. Failing to establish the characters properly weakens their credibility and motives and makes them seem more like plot devices existing in a vacuum instead of real people. You will be wondering why Elizabeth strives so persistently to help Simon and when those answers are revealed late in the film they're improbable and unsatisfying. The narrative twist will remind you a lot of Inception which Trance draws heavily from in the way it plays with memories but it is without the same clarity or the emotional investment failing to earn its story turns from the start.Realising the generic hide and reveal structure of the narrative Danny Boyle has employed an aesthetic resembling a music video to disorientate the viewers. I was impressed with the bravery of his formal choices in 127 Hours 2010 but it's like he's forgotten how to be calculating as a filmmaker. The stylistic choices he makes either lack purpose or overstate the theme. Camera angles are frequently tilted sideways and a neon lit colour scheme is employed to remind us tiredly of Simon's confusion. The blaring electronic soundtrack also raged so loudly and needlessly that I stuck my fingers in my ears at one point. If these superficial techniques weren't distracting enough the film also tries its hand at melding the real and the fantastic together in overlapping scenes so that we're not sure if we're in a dream or not. The film becomes very messy super violent and not much fun. I found it so confusing that it took me out of the story and I didn't care one iota about the characters. If there is a point to their story the film is about the way that people try to suppress trauma and personal responsibility in their minds. Yet for a movie striving to be psychological it is the personal and human weight that is notably missing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Full disclosure I might not have been as harsh on this film if Danny Boyle wasn't the director but with Boyle I expect more Trainspotting was a very cool film. I have always given Danny Boyle films a chance even if they don't appeal to me after Trance I will stop that. Trance didn't look that interesting to me but I thought I would give it a shot and it just didn't quite add up. I mean at best you could say yea its an average decent film not bad but i was expecting good or great even possibly.The basic plot is this and I am sure I will hit some spoilers so be aware of that. The film starts and you aren't sure if McAvoy is a victim or in on the crime of stealing the painting he narrates the first segment of the film and from that I was excited that this would be a good experience. So McAvoy works at an art gallery some guys come to steal a piece of painting they get it or they think they do but McAvoy has hidden it. Problem is during the robbery he got hit in the head so he can't remember. Thus they go to a hypnotherapist  Rosario Dawson.From there everything turns into a mess up until he goes to see the hypnotherapist the film is at 1010 really great. It slows down when she comes in because things start to just get illogical she goes from mild mannered therapist to wanting in with the criminals who at this point McAvoy turns out to be in with to a degree as well.The arrangement was McAvoy had a gambling debt Cassell has some money so he paid the debt off with the understanding that McAvoy would assist with getting a very valuable painting. Now here's where it gets all spoilery McAvoy really has no reason to keep the painting for himself so why would he be so stupid to keep it those thugs would just come after him. Well the reason is because he used to date Dawson the therapist and he became abusive so she stopped dating him but he kept coming to sessions where she brainwashed him into forgetting her and bringing her a valuable painting.OK now none of this makes sense why would Dawson turn out to be this vindictive and willing to involve herself in crime and it is never indicated that McAvoy is a violent sociopath who would become obsessed with his girlfriend and beat her. Thats my huge problem with this film that the character make absolutely no sense. So as a viewer I feel cheated I feel like the filmmakers think I am too stupid to question the flow of things so they can just throw stories at me as facts and I will accept it without needing any kind of visuals to back them up.So apparently this film thought it would get points for plot twists and while plot twists are appreciated in films you need evidence to back them up later which we do not have. There is nothing earlier in the film that would support why or how Dawson would want to involve herself in criminal activities and there is no indication that McAvoy goes around beating women. This film demands too much in the way of suspension of disbelief.Also they pull one of the cheapest tricks that I hate where an action scene goes down you are all intrigued and excited and then ohhh wait never mind all fake it was all a hypnosis dream. from that point forward I couldn't really trust this movie and I was largely just annoyed by its presentation.".

He is Simon who works for a fine art auction house where one of his duties is to whisk away to a deep vault the most valuable artwork in the event of any attempted robbery. Of course their is a robbery masterminded by Franck played by Vincent Cassels the only problem is he has stolen a picture frame but no canvas. Simon is hit on the head during the robbery causing amnesia and cannot remember what happened to the canvas. Franck isn't too chuffed about this so employs Elizabeth  Rosario Dawson a hypnotist to delve into Simon's mind to find where he may have secreted the artwork. For at least the first half I was gripped by the plot and characters plus Boyles camera work is spot on as always. I did however feel completely puzzled at one point when the plot seemed to zigzag a bit too much and I began to wonder whether I had lost concentration. I wasn't being dim however because at this point one of the characters explains in flashback what's going on. Although an adequate enough watch this was for me a below par Boyle movie. But I suppose with a back catalogue including two of my top ten films he can be excused for not 'hitting a coconut every time'. Overall I was not disappointed to have caught the bus to view this and neither should you be. If you are a Boyle fan just lower your expectations a little.".

	schema:reviewBody "First rule of Trance is You don't talk about Trance. And that makes  reviewing it difficult. It's too easy to give too much away. This is  one of those films to consider avoiding the trailer and going in blind.  Certainly don't talk to anyone about it first! My immediate thought as  the final credits scrolled was I need to see that again tomorrow!  It's tempting to say Trance is Danny Boyle's finest offering yet but  that would be a disservice to the brilliance of Trainspotting and 28  Days Later et al. It isn't going to hit the general populace in the way  Slumdog Millionaire did mostly because it isn't an 'easy' film they  can sit back and be entertained by. Trance requires a great deal more  thought and investment on the viewer's part to fully appreciate the  experience than any of Boyle's previous films but the rewards are  great for those who make the effort.  Simon James McAvoy is a good guy if a little nerdish who works at a  major art auction house. When a gang aims to steal a 20 million  painting he endeavours to follow protocol by slipping the painting in  the safe but things don't go according to plan and the painting  disappears. Gang leader Franck Vincent Cassell is far from joyous and  opts to torture the information out of Simon. The trouble is Simon is  suffering a severe case of amnesia following a crack on the head by a  wall. Then Franck hits upon the idea of recruiting a hypnotherapist to  unlock Simon's memories and reality starts bending.  Trance is a head spin but that's the greatest attraction of it. If  Inception ticked all your boxes this though an entirely different  subject matter will be a ride you'll thoroughly enjoy. Forget  Oscarwinning effects Trance is stylish and absolutely engrossing  without them relying instead on good performances and a detailed  complex and absorbing screenplay.  Ten years ago Trance would have starred Ewan McGregor and often it  feels as though Joe Ahearne and John Hodge have written with him once  again in mind but James McAvoy makes Simon his own and yes he does  atone for his laziness in last week's Welcome to the Punch. McAvoy is  on riveting form here as a character who seems at ease with his work  and life only for confusion and panic to take over and then as his  mind is probed something else entirely to emerge.  Boyle has crafted some of the finest character evolution we've seen on  the big screen for years not only from McAvoy but from also Rosairo  Dawson in particular. Her hypnotherapist Elizabeth is beautifully  performed at first controlled and elegant but her subtle glances and  facial twitches suggest a strength of character not to be messed with.  Cassell is as always bang on the money as the crook with a brain and  a stomach for aggression when required. He's one of 'those' actors who  crops up in all manner of films and can always be relied upon to add  gravitas and occasionally an air of menace that might steal the film  from under the principals' noses but neither the strength of their own  performances nor the skill of the director allows that to derail this  stunning feast for the brain cells.  Though the focus is naturally on the trio of stars the supporting  actors in Trance are gifted parts and dialogue they can breath life  into and many of them could easily take control of the scenario if the  screenplay dictated. Danny Sapani Nate a TV stalwart of staples The  Bill and gems Misfits alike lands a rare film role that must surely  lead to a greater presence on the big screen and though credited  simply as 'Young Woman in Red Car' Tuppence Middleton seizes our  attention with her brief moments in the limelight. With the lead in  Trap for Cinderella in the can two Pierce Brosnan films Love Punch  and A Long Way Down slated for release later this year and currently  shooting the Wachowski's Jupiter Ascending Middleton is an actor to  keep a close eye on.  But no matter how good the actors they cannot hope to save a film if  the screenplay and direction have gone AWOL W.E. being a recent case  in point. In Trance they have the best possible opportunity to shine  because Boyle is on fire here.  He weaves his story around an intricate structure of rabbit holes and  avenues that many people won't get understand or cope with. So switch  on your brain absorb the music open your eyes and start running with  it. It's a hell of a ride and worth every effort.

	schema:reviewBody "Trance is directed by Danny Boyle and adapted to screenplay by John Hodge from Joe Ahearne's film of the same name from 2001. It stars James McAvoy Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. Music is scored by Rick Smith and cinematography is by Anthony Dod Mantle. Art auctioneer worker Simon McAvoy does the doublecross on Franck Cassel his partner in an art heist but after taking a blow to the head suffers amnesia and can't recall where he has hidden a stolen Goya masterpiece. Franck and his thug sidekicks decide to send Simon to hypnotherapist Elizabeth Dawson in the hope of unlocking the painting's hiding place. However once the therapy starts secrets come tumbling out and nothing is ever as it at first seems. Already this early in the day after the film's release we know for certain that Danny Boyle's foray into neonoir is going to split his fan base considerably. Admired for his ability to turn his hand at any genre he fancies Boyle reaches back to his earlier movies and comes up with a mind bending neonoir that crackles with the kind of sexual edginess that Paul Verhoeven thrived upon. It sounds snobbish I know and I have been called a neonoir snob recently but if all things noir are not your thing then this really is a film you should stay away from. Think Basic Instinct meets Inception and they take out a 40s Heist movie for drinks and you get an idea where we are at with Trance. All the hallmarks of noir both neo and conventional classics are evident here from characterisations to visual smarts it's a noir head's dream and very much a must see on the big screen or on Bluray formats. Forget any notion of having someone to root for in this there is scarcely a decent human bone on show. Characters are either fuelled by greed lust jealousy or vengeance or quite simply just not smart enough to operate in the circles they move in. Amnesia is a key component of the story something which again features a lot in olde noir as does the central character being a complete dupe...To expand upon more would be stupid of me the less you know the better it actually is upon first viewing. It really is a difficult film to discuss without delving into why it is such a trippy and deliciously cheeky piece of film. That's not to say that narratively it's smarter than a brain pie because that's not the case. For as the threads untangle several times the mind meld aspect will fall apart if plot dissection is your thing? Also cramming so much brain food into the last quarter of film kind of feels like too much overkill if you will. While Franck's sidekick bad boys are irritatingly disposable. Yet it's a film that begs to be seen more than once twice thrice even... Visually it's superlative it's clear that Boyle and Mantle know and admire noir's visual splendours with an awareness of atmospheric importance noir is an atmosphere not a genre. There's the snob in me again! pulsing throughout. Set in London but filmed out of Dungeness in Kent the backdrop is a city of steel and mirrors a thriving city of wealth and mistrust. The tricks of the trade are here but never once is it style over substance the visual ticks matter to the narrative. Night time overhead shots of a bustling city come and go different colour tones for different character's apartments are clever oblique camera angles ensure distortion of frame is equal to distortion of antagonistsprotagonists minds whose trance is this really?.... Smudgey silhouettes through bronze glass outrageous POV shots and caressing camera shots of the human form no shot is wasted in the name of adding detail. Rest assured Boyle brings his A game here. All of which is covered over by Smith's slow rumbling score that acts as a foreboding observer ready to unleash itself when the carnage begins. The three principal actors come out firing and clearly are enjoying themselves. McAvoy cements his A list credentials with a multi layered performance Cassel is as usual a mighty presence and Dawson in a bold role does her best work so far and hints she's ready to move into the big league. While it has to be noted that all three actors have to play their cards very close to their chests throughout and do so admirably. Boyle's action construction is kinetic with the precredits sequence one of the best opening sequences lately and Hodge's script has a playfulness about it that ensures those paying attention know the film is selfmocking and not taking itself half as seriously as some film fans seem to think. An audience splitter it is sure to be but for those with a bent for noirish sexy mind bending heist capers? Get in there! 910".

As it transpires Simon was the inside man on the job and he's forgotten where he's stashed the painting and the gang aren't in any mood to let Simon's amnesia foil their criminal dividends . Simon undergoes hypnosis with a beautiful female therapist in order to regain his memory knowing if he fails the art thieves he's involved with will have no further use of him I had high hopes for TRANCE as soon as it was announced . Danny Boyle stole the show at the Olympics with his opening and closing ceremonies the screenplay is written Joe Ahearne who was the main director of the all too short era of Christopher Eccleston's DOCTOR WHO and like Boyle can work visual miracles on a limited budget which leaves me puzzled why Boyle and Ahearne haven't relocated to Hollywood but I very much appreciate both film makers have stayed in Britain and are involved in British film making . That said when ever I look forward to a Boyle movie I'm always left with after I've seen it with a slight feeling of disappointment and wonder if his undisputed masterwork is around the corner TRANCE get off to a great opening and is similar to his earlier work in travelling through the metaphysical psyche of a character very much like the audience see in to the mind of Renton in TRAINSPOTTING . The opening sequences of the movie as the language of cinema are used to a breathtaking effect as Simon breaks down the fourth figurative wall of cinema . The whole look of the movie is hypnotic as a combination of cinematography  editing and the in your face blasting soundtrack grips you harder than one of the infected from 28 DAYS LATER The much voiced criticism of Danny Boyle is that he can't sustain the second half of a movie . With the exception of 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE it's not something I've really noticed and when I have noticed it it's obviously been the fault of screenwriter Alex Garland rather than Boyle and the director manages to keep up the visual assault on the audience but the more the film continues the more spanners are thrown in the works and these are down to Ahearne and fellow writer John Hodge This movie belongs in the subgenre with the likes of TOTAL RECALL  THE MATRIX  MEMENTO and INCEPTION that use the theme of altered reality to tell a story . Several times you think the narrative plot turns are cheating the intrigued compelled audience but then you have a character explaining the twist and the audience gasp that they're not victims of contrivance or cheating . However the more the story continues the more and more you realise the characters are spouting the mechanics of the plot which is a mistake . Add to this by the final third the characters are still spouting exposition but by then you're relatively lost as to what's happening  only to have the protagonist behind the set up once again go in to a long monologue what their agenda has been . On top of that none of the characters are likable in any way and when the least hateful character in a film is played by Vincent Cassel something has gone wrong somewhere In summary TRANCE lives up to the old clich that  If a film is good it's down to the director and when it's bad it's down to the screenplay  and this is a movie that lives up to that well worn adage . Certainly it's enjoyable and even someone like myself who is against petite bourgeois nationalism feels a surge of jingoistic patriotic pride when a film stamped with Made In Britain tries to be a mainstream success . Unfortunately one suspects this won't be the international success SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was due to it being far too clever for it's own good".

Certainly it's enjoyable and even someone like myself who is against petite bourgeois nationalism feels a surge of jingoistic patriotic pride when a film stamped with Made In Britain tries to be a mainstream success . Unfortunately one suspects this won't be the international success SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was due to it being far too clever for it's own good";

	schema:headline " Danny Boyle Excels Once Again";
	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle has had a bumper few years earning an Oscar for Slumdog  Millionaire making his dream project 127 Hours and earned massive  praise for the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony. After years away  he has returned to making a British set film with Trance which pleases  as both a mainstream crimethriller and a more cerebral psychological  thriller.  At a London art auction Frank Vincent Cassel and his crew attempt to  steal a painting valued at 25 Million. Simon James McAvoy is hailed  as a hero when he tries to stop the heist and gets hit in the head for  trouble. But Simon was the inside man for the heist and suffers  amnesia due to the blow he received during the action. When Frank  discovers he does not have the painting he becomes determined to find  out where it is by any means necessary. When torturing Simon does not  work Frank turns to more unusual techniques and makes Simon see a  hypnotherapist Elizabeth Lamb Rosario Dawson and forces everyone  involved down a dark and twisted path.  Boyle reunites with writer John Hodge and Trance does feel very much  like an early Boyle film. Like Shallow Grave and Trainspotting Trance  focuses on people on the fringes of the criminal world who get  embroiled into much wider scheme and get in over their heads. The film  starts with a great heist sequence and has at the start a slightly  darker comic tone before turning into a fast paced thriller.  As expected Trance has all the visual flair you want from a Danny Boyle  film with all the cross cutting between flashbacks and the present  time and Boyle does gets to play around with the dreamscape. Trance  also serves as a great example of how a music score can amplify the  action on the screen being a fast and pumping when the action picks up  to being calm and tranquil for the hypnotist sequences. Boyle does get  to audience absorbed into his dream worlds with his use lens flare  camera movement and music.  Trance is similar to other thrillers like Memento and The Machinist  twisting and turning constantly. Boyle starts the film as a heist flick  and then slowly turns the genre gears and turns the film into a  psychological thriller. Like Christopher Nolan Boyle and his writers  set out to explore themes of memories relationships manipulation and  trust and it was done to an expect level. Throughout the film it  changes courses constantly leaving to the audience guessing but Boyle  and the writers do leave some clues about the eventual ending and I am  sure there's more to the film during a second viewing.  The characters themselves are also enigmas as their motivations change  and we get to see more pieces of the puzzle. Simon starts off as a  victim but as the film progresses we see his dark and twisted side and  McAvoy effectively brings this out of his character. He was much better  fitted for this role than his recent action antihero role in Welcome  to the Punch. On a whole the characters are generally unsympathetic  and the film constantly shifts both its focus and who the audience  should root for. But added to the film's theme of who we are meant to  trust as relationships the motives in the film that shift along  coincide with its themes and makes some sense overall.  Whilst Trance is a fun ride people might begin to see multiple plot  holes and raise questions about how characters know certain actions and  reactions were going to happen. But it can be argued that The Dark  Knight Rises had plot problems if you held it to any form of analysis  and people still enjoyed that film. The aim of Boyle and the writers  was to focus on the themes and how the puzzle fit together once you get  more information even if the foundation itself is a little shaky.  Trance is a highly entertaining and engaging crime and psychological  thriller. It is a fun ride as it brinks through its 101 minute running  time. Whilst there are some logic and logistical problems in the plot  when everything is revealed it is still a well made film that explores  the themes of memory trust and the framework of the mind. Fans of  Boyle's previous work will certainly be pleased.".

How can wonderful actors like Rosario Dawson Vincent Cassel and James McAvoy all competent and successful in their own rights be a part of this? How can I a man who has watched and scored nearly 3000 movies on IMDb.com sit through this crap? The general public obviously agreed with me as Trance only earned 2000000 at the U.S. box office. That's about what a documentary on Newt Gingrich would do.This is the essence of directorial masturbation! There is nothing redeeming about this movie! Cassel does his damnedest to save it but McAvoy seems lost. That has been kind of his shtick in the past but here I was just as lost as he was and neither of us ever got found. And Dawson...you are hereby relegated to making straight to video Bmovies. She was just terrible. Although if that was Rosario's naked body shaved and all walking into the bedroom I am dulyimpressed. If it wasn't her that body should receive a credit all on it's own! Danny Sapani as one of Cassel's thugs was the only likable character.Trance ranks right up there with Plan 9 from Outer Space and Endless Love as one of the worst movies of all time. Offtopic I know but Shana Feste who has turned out two miserable excuses for movies is remaking Endless Love. Somebody take away her keys before she kills someone.It takes 101 minutes to kill off just about everyone. I could have done so in 18 and saved an hourandahalf. The movie goes back and forth so often between hypnotisminduced fantasy and reality that after about 20 minutes the audience has no idea what is real and what isn't. Right up until the end. That worked for Memento and Matrix but not Trance.Maybe if you spent your childhood in a druginduced coma and thought Trainspotting was genius you will relate to Trance. Maybe if I was on X when I watched it I could relate. Maybe I'll stop spewing out this vitriolic review and go watch a brilliant Greg Kinnear movie like The Matador that nobody knows about to get the regurgitated popcorn out of my mouth.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Danny Boyle's not orchestrating Olympic Ceremonies he's making moving picture thingies called films. Trance is his latest Apple iPad commercial I mean film starring that bloke off of Shameless a French Chris Martin and that naked actress from Alexander. In all seriousness the film stars pretty boy James McAvoy as Simon a fineart auctioneer. Due to gambling debts he becomes involved with bully and Mob leader Franck played wonderfully by Vincent Cassel. The two pair up to steal an outrageously priced painting from within Simon's own gallery. After a failed endeavour at doublecrossing he develops amnesia after a meaty blow to the head from Franck's subtle gun choice of a shotgun. In order to regain the lost memory of the painting's location the gang sends Simon to sexy yet audacious hypnotist Elizabeth played nude by Rosario Whatshertts. The opening sequence begins with a narration from McAvoy a stylistic choice that is subsequently abandoned and doesn't return to resolve the film after eloquently opening it. This first sequence is reminiscent of a discarded episode of BBC's dangerously underrated Hustle the heistgonewrong plot along with the exterior backdrop of London makes it difficult to draw comparisons. However the film can't seem to make its mind up about what genre it is. It's heist it's action and then it's an unconvincing love triangle between the three main characters.But towards the end of the film the audience is treated to the most ridiculous plot twist since M. Night Shyamalan's Twister. Simon discovers that he has had already had a lengthy relationship with Elizabeth but she had removed all memory of herself after a measly one hour session  because that's how the brain works. Put down that Freud or neuroscience bullst and pick up a fresh copy of Hypnotism for Dummies!The film ends with an ambiguous Inceptionesque shot of Franck deciding whether Elizabeth removes all memory of her as she did with Simon. At this point the audience is still scratching their head over the last 30 minutes of the film they haven't even begun to process let alone comprehend the next mind fk. The film's contrived style struggles to support itself on a tenuous plot that is disguised as the most complex plot since Primer. Yet Primer is a perfect example of how low budget and subtlety can be used to great effect whereas Trance ignores potential for substance in favour of generic action and Baysplosions. One violent sequence in which one of Franck's droogs gets his poor bllcks blow to kingdom come resembles a Quentin Tarantino film parodying a Quentin Tarantino film.There's no denying Trance is an adrenaline fuelled ride with the sheer number of twists and turns you'd think you were watching Thorpe Park The Movie. But a film doesn't need to be highly convoluted in order for it to be interesting and enjoyable. Akin to Nolan's masterful Memento the film demands multiple viewings. Except instead of it getting better you gradually realise how shallow and lacking of substance it is. Of course I shouldn't be expecting an intellectual experience on the level of bldy 2001 A Space Odyssey but to have Boyle a mainstream filmmaker representing Britain seems like an insult when we have superb filmmakers such as Chris Morris Mike Leigh and Shane Meadows who don't get the recognition they deserve while this hack gets a free handj0b from cinephiles across the country. His most critically acclaimed Trainspotting is undeniably a great film but Boyle seems to come across to me as extremely hitandmiss. The equally acclaimed and financially successful Slumdog Millionaire is also a good film but an overpraised 2hour preachfest. There's also 127 hours which feels like you're sat there for 127 hours watching some poor sd pss in his mouth and hack through his arm with a plastic army knife. But back to Trance.The film is so stylistically incoherent you'd think they had a new director every 10 minutes. As with most recent Boyle films they do not have a specific style or themes to them. He is the British equivalent of Ron Howard if you were to watch Apollo 13 and The DaVinci Code you'd have no idea they were directed by the same person they could have been made by anyone. Although in a desperate bid to add slick and quirky style to the film the Director of Photography appears to have had an epileptic fit while setting up every shot resulting in an abundance of hideous canted angles. This along with the use of an emphatic electronic score leads you to believe you are engaging with the film in a cathartic manner. But it's not really Boyle doing this or the films surprisingly stellar performances but the obtrusive and overpowering music serving to compensate for the director's inability to convey emotions to the audience. In contrast to this 28 Days Later's penultimate sequence executes this beautifully. But it's not just the aesthetic qualities that should be under attack.The film shifts between the protagonists questioning who is really the moral guidance of the film. Elizabeth's motives for using Simon and Franck are virtually nonexistent so the audience has to either root for a greedy French twt or a whimpering martyr. The characters are so one dimensional it's as if they were picked out from a box of Joe Carnahan's discarded clichs. Franck's gang are a bunch of moronic tts whose stupid comedic antics seem out of place in a film that is trying to take itself seriously. In fact the whole mob concept is so unconvincing it entirely destroys any immersion you had along with the preposterously effective hypnosis from Rosario Dawson's steaming hot naked body I mean mouth. As in words. But who cares what I think? I'm just a mrn with an inflated sense of selfimportance and a keyboard. Watch the film for yourself well don't actually. Watch something good instead.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Trance";
	schema:reviewBody "To say that Trance is this year's Inception is to do either films a disservice. But if I were to lean toward a preference then Danny Boyle's latest movie has an edge for being succinct in its tale little loopholes and while fewer characters is no less complex but equally stylish in treatment and bold in its storytelling dealing with the premise of a heist gone wrong and hypnosis being the last resort to get into the deepest recesses of the mind for the secrets it harbours.James McAvoy is probably in one of his best roles yet opening the film as Simon an art auctioneer who apparently has reasons to turn corrupt giving the lowdown on the security measures on how to secure the most valuable art piece of the session in the event of an interruption of the process. And lo and behold a team led by Franck Vincent Cassel comes in forcefully to seize that same valuable asset only for Simon to have hidden it away both physically and psychologically into his mind that it seemed a peek into his subconscious would be necessary to unlock the location of the stolen painting. Enter Rosario Dawson's Elizabeth a hypnotist with skills so sublime she can lull you into anything if your guard is not tip top.But you know I'm just scratching the surface of the premise because even understanding the premise will take away the fun you would experience when watching the narrative unfold. What worked here is the multiple perspectives and shifts in the narrative that Danny Boyle puts you under being the real mastermind and hypnotist at work in lulling us the audience into lapping up just about everything being thrown at us. Who you thought was the lead in the film gave way to some other character and then more putting you in a spot yet being terribly engaging from start to finish that you'd want to have a go at the story again being enlightened the second time round as to who the real puppet master was.Credit has to go to writers Joe Ahearne and John Hodge the former who was responsible for an earlier television movie of the same name in which this film was partially based upon. What I love about the film is that everything was neatly planned and didn't entail crafting escape clauses for itself for a less than well thought out narrative. Everything was in place from the start and the movie magic came from astute direction and intricate editing to shift perspectives chronology and the like together with absolutely wonderful performances from all three main leads to pull off this psychological thriller.Danny Boyle once again proves to be one of the most eclectic filmmakers of this generation taking on varied genres without a bat in the eyelid and delivering impressive results in coming up with a film's powerful imagery with that knack of blending in a top notch soundtrack and coaxing stellar performances from his cast. Trance becomes that fine balance of substance and style extremely well made and very much less confusing than Inception but no less complex in execution.James McAvoy retains his boyish qualities while contrasting that with darker emotions that hasn't been seen in most of the films he had starred in. Vincent Cassel is no stranger to playing morally shady characters and his chief instigator and mastermind being the heist could have been a walk in the park role but once again he brings an edge to the character like none other if not for his experience. And the surprise performance of all was Rosario Dawson. She's been in the industry for sometime already but nothing really stood out until now. Not to mention it being one of her boldest acts yet and the sacrifice having to really bare herself on screen.There are many layers to this film than I dare reveal but let's just say at its core I'm buying into its love story about the dangers of obsession which touched upon a raw nerve in how perverted it developed into and how it enveloped all motivations of the players involved. The twists and turns in the last half hour will leave you breathless filled with some gory moments that's quite Cronenberglike. A definite recommend for its all round solid approach and it's little wonder if it finds itself in my top films of the year listing.".

Who you thought was the lead in the film gave way to some other character and then more putting you in a spot yet being terribly engaging from start to finish that you'd want to have a go at the story again being enlightened the second time round as to who the real puppet master was.Credit has to go to writers Joe Ahearne and John Hodge the former who was responsible for an earlier television movie of the same name in which this film was partially based upon. What I love about the film is that everything was neatly planned and didn't entail crafting escape clauses for itself for a less than well thought out narrative. Everything was in place from the start and the movie magic came from astute direction and intricate editing to shift perspectives chronology and the like together with absolutely wonderful performances from all three main leads to pull off this psychological thriller.Danny Boyle once again proves to be one of the most eclectic filmmakers of this generation taking on varied genres without a bat in the eyelid and delivering impressive results in coming up with a film's powerful imagery with that knack of blending in a top notch soundtrack and coaxing stellar performances from his cast. Trance becomes that fine balance of substance and style extremely well made and very much less confusing than Inception but no less complex in execution.James McAvoy retains his boyish qualities while contrasting that with darker emotions that hasn't been seen in most of the films he had starred in. Vincent Cassel is no stranger to playing morally shady characters and his chief instigator and mastermind being the heist could have been a walk in the park role but once again he brings an edge to the character like none other if not for his experience. And the surprise performance of all was Rosario Dawson. She's been in the industry for sometime already but nothing really stood out until now. Not to mention it being one of her boldest acts yet and the sacrifice having to really bare herself on screen.There are many layers to this film than I dare reveal but let's just say at its core I'm buying into its love story about the dangers of obsession which touched upon a raw nerve in how perverted it developed into and how it enveloped all motivations of the players involved. The twists and turns in the last half hour will leave you breathless filled with some gory moments that's quite Cronenberglike. A definite recommend for its all round solid approach and it's little wonder if it finds itself in my top films of the year listing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Danny Boyle's Trance certainly is a hypnotic 101 minute therapy session that leaves you feeling you received the treatment you paid for though it is not a transcendent masterpiece and many may have been hoping for more. Providing a synopsis here would simply be unnecessary regurgitation of the trailer's concise expression of the film's premise. What we receive in the end is near enough what the trailer delivered with some unwelcome changes in direction that caused the final product to be vaguely unlike what you ordered as it had the potential to be of greater quality.From the establishing shot we enter Boyle's trance which is so mesmerising that for the initial third of the film someone could be throwing popcorn at your face and you probably would fail to notice. Unfortunately however from this point in the film onwards we begin to fall in and out of this state of cinematic hypnosis which is essentially your own battle between liking and disliking the film. This basically results in the effectiveness of the experience diluting. After a fantastic and intriguing opening that stays loyal to everything that one could have possibly assumed about the film it diverts into what I find most despicable about any motion picture narrative its focus shifts to be all about romance while trying to clutch onto what literal and figurative artistic integrity that it still has. Trance both languishes and prospers into the grasp of a predictable inevitable and certainly disappointing descent into a story about love that conflicts an already complex relationship between the film's three primary characters played by James McAvoy Rosario Dawson and Vincent Cassel.A much appreciated relief at the film's climax is that Boyle concludes his power over the audience in the way that he began in an entranced state. Perhaps the simplest way to describe one's structural enjoyment of Trance that is how we go back and forth in liking the film is to compare it to a sandwich. With two delicious layers of bread to just about maintain the overflowing filling the start and finish to Trance certainly make up for some tasteless and unwanted revelations in the middle. Boyle's steady hands manage to leave you more than satisfied at the last bite and the pacing and length of the film are perfect. It is also worth crediting the sound department for their excellent ability to consistently explore the hypnotic tone that is needed and adored for a film that explores the mind.Trance is an effortlessly watchable and often therapeutic experience that is undoubtedly worth a chance. Some will probably adore its attempts at narrative complexities and more often than not solid execution at achieving its objectives. Meanwhile others may find the fairly unnecessary sexual and romantic themes to be the demise but not the surprise in Danny Boyle's latest cinematic endeavour. Whatever the consensus or lack of Trance most indisputably remains devoted to encapsulating everything that its title suggests though the manner and extent to which we are convinced by the film enjoy the film or even will remember the film is questionable. My scrutiny for Trance may appear to be more negative than my actual quite positive stance. The main issue is that I wanted the film to be so much better as it had such extraordinary potential to be a magnificent thriller but the execution at particular moments simply digresses from the greatness that other parts of the film exhibit. Trance hovers between all of Boyle's other films that I have seen at least as it demonstrates an enormous amount of ingenuity though unfortunately gets caught up in the web of romantic deceit which is the unwelcome revelation and eventual destination of the film.".

Granted this is my personal hangup  and the trailer clearly showed as much so I can't blame that  but it's just so boring to hinge a story on precisely because there are no boundaries. Constraints add suspense. It's like listening to people go on and on about their dreams. Who cares? If it had been a straight whodunnit art heist movie it would have been ten times better. At least then it would have had purpose.I also read in reviews how everyone thinks this is Rosario Dawson's best role. Did we watch the same movie I wonder? I love the girl but here she was at best phoning it in from another galaxy. Everyone else is just about passable at best perhaps disillusioned by the terrible premise of it all. Shame with such actors like Cassel etc. I wish I could give this more than 1 star but I can't. I like you Danny Boyle but this was the first movie in over 10 years where I asked my mate if we could leave after 30 minutes. He didn't so I had to sit through the whole mess until the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "GONE IN 60 SECONDS  2000  out of fourGone in 60 Seconds is an energetic slick stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. If you are a viewer interested in cars this production by producer Jerry Bruckheimer Con Air The Rock is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.The film stars Giovanni Ribisi The Mod Squad as a young crook named Kip Raines who as the movie opens fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri Christopher Eccleston. When Kip's life is threatened because of such his older brother Randall Memphis Raines Nicolas Cage a retired but skillful car thief is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival steel fifty carsspecified by model color year and makein only four days.Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara Sway Wayland Angelina Jolie a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business a fellow named Mirror Man T.J. Cross the aging and wise Otto Halliwell Robert DuVall as well as Tumbler Scott Caan Atley Jackson Will Patton Toby William Lee Scott and Donny Astricky Chi McBrde. Contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives Roland Castlebeck Delroy Lindo and Drycoff Timothy Olyphant who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.There is not much time for character development here the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone. I am not stating I think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish I actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an Rrating. However I do believe in a movie such as Gone in 60 Seconds to strongly develop the character's enlightenment dialogue needs to be believable and authentic.  In spite of problems the characters are effective due to the top notch perfectly cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi Scott Caan Robert Duvall Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.The film contains standard structure with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives sets up a fastpaced theme of action but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems the story wastes time during much of this segment never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time and a sex scene provides a solid midplot  not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious walltowall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.The soundtrack to Gone in 60 Seconds contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in Gone in 60 Seconds which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion thrills and excitementbut not much more.".

I am not stating I think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish I actually honor the director's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an Rrating. However I do believe in a movie such as Gone in 60 Seconds to strongly develop the character's enlightenment dialogue needs to be believable and authentic.  In spite of problems the characters are effective due to the top notch perfectly cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi Scott Caan Robert Duvall Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.The film contains standard structure with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives sets up a fastpaced theme of action but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems the story wastes time during much of this segment never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time and a sex scene provides a solid midplot  not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious walltowall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.The soundtrack to Gone in 60 Seconds contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in Gone in 60 Seconds which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion thrills and excitementbut not much more.";

However before his decent into depressinglybad cinema he made some pretty fun films. Yes he's won an Oscar in his time for his deep and meaningful acting but you won't find any of that here. Just fun.Nicholas Cage plays basically Nicholas Cage  only a Nicholas Cage who used to steal expensive cars only to retire. However his loose cannon of a brother steals or doesn't steal  I forget  it doesn't matter! for or from the wrong mobster in L.A. meaning Nicholas Cage the now notso retired car thief must steal a load of flash motors in one night or his brother ends up in the car crusher literally!.If you like fast cars driving even faster and judging by the 'Fast and the Furious' franchise a lot of people do then this one is basically for you. It's an action film and it's pretty much by the numbers but when it's such fun who cares? Everyone cranks their performances up to eleven and it all comes across as one of those adorable eighties and nineties 'overthetop' action flicks yes I know it was made it in 2000 but it sure feels like a nineties movie with a real cartoony vibe to it. You have Christopher Ecleston plays the 'evil Brit villain' much like any other evil Brit villains you've seen in cinema. Vinnie Jones and Angelina Jolie are on hand to show their faces but feel a little underused for what they could have been.Ultimately it's all on Nicholas Cage's manic shoulders and he does the film proud. It's loud dumb and it's basically one long car crash that you'll probably be unable to tear your eyes away from.".

	schema:reviewBody "As much as I like big epic pictures  I'll spare you the namedropping  it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes. Films where the plot takes a backseat to the setpieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares that picture's ethos but not quite it's execution. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster  see the pugugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it  but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors Sixty succeeds.The plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write IMDb about. Often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections. A lot of people found this annoying I find it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with Cage Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here. The chemistry between good ol' Saint Nick the stalwart see date of review and Angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.The villain is not even a little scary  I've seen Chris Eccleston play toughguy roles before so I know he can handle them but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. We know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we're just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far incheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. In fact I wouldn't have minded some fourthwall breaking winks at the camera it's just that kind of movie.All this style and not so much substance  something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so  would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part it is. Wonderfully so. I've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fastcut extreme closeup shots to direct action these days. I personally find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life I mean  his character clearly doesn't care and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slowburning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish  and FUN  way possible.So yes this movie isn't an epic lifeaffirming post911 picture with obligatory social commentary effort. The pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!I'd take it over the numerous iterations of The Flaccid And The Tedious guess the franchise any day. 710".

A remake of the 1974 cult hit this film may not be destined for the same cult status but it is entertaining.Surprisingly it's the action that keeps you watching not the acting. Although loaded with stars none of them have standout performances including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comers Giovanni Ribisi.  Even Jolie coming off her recent Oscar win is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.Can a series of beautiful cars and the car chases they become involved in make a great film?

At its heart this film is about cars.  Many reviewers have criticized the film's characterizations and character development.  Let's check the credits... uh huh yeah executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer.  I think it's a little unrealistic to walk into a Jerry Bruckheimer film and expect Citizen Kane.  That said I thought the characters were certainly adequate.  The villain was suitably unhinged and nefarious and I thought Nic Cage did a great job as Memphis Raines.  He is one of my favorite action stars unlike Arnie Sly or Jackie he can actually act and this adds a whole new dimension to his characters that none of the other big action stars have.  The closest comparison I can come up with is to the epitome of cool himself Steve McQueen.  The supporting cast was solid.  Giovanni Ribisi Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie are all capable of far more than they are given here all three of them could sleepwalk through their roles but they do a solid job with what they're given.  Angelina Jolie's character Sway was essentially throwaway eye candy I would like to have seen the MemphisSway story developed further and made an actual part of the movie or scrapped altogether.  Mirror Man is a wonderful character and Scott Caan one of my favorite young actors from his performances in Boiler Room and Varsity Blues did a good job in his alltoobrief role as Tumbler.Enough with the characters let's move on to the real stars the cars. Many reviewers seem to have been disappointed with the car chases faulting them for failing to turn sufficient numbers of exotic cars into flaming cartwheeling wreckage.  I say HALLELUJAH!!!!  The cars Memphis's gang steals are not just transportation.  These cars especially the '67 Mustang Eleanor the '70 Hemi 'Cuda the '70 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbird and that flamethrowing Merc are breathtaking agonizingly beautiful.  They are truly works of art on wheels.  Would viewers have been up in arms if filmmakers had destroyed a Van Gogh on film for sheer dramatic effect? Hell yeah.  That's how gearheads feel when watching priceless historic automobiles meet ugly ends simply because a movie studio can afford to trash them to make a profit.  That said I was glad to see Gone avoid the destruction of any truly cool cars other than Eleanor and gearheads will be pleased to note that the Eleanor crushed in the junkyard was a junk '67 stripped of all useful parts and given a good paint job.  While on the subject of Eleanor many reviewers have said that it was a replica '67 Shelby and was a bad replica.  Well yes technically it was meant to be a '67 Shelby.  A trickedout customized bad Shelby.  It's not a bad replica it's a spectacular custom.  No no Shelbys left the plant looking like Eleanor.  If only they had.  Aftermarket lighting ground effects hood wheels nitrous roll cage... the list of modifications that have been clearly made to the car goes on and on and the end result is one of the most beautiful cars the world has ever seen.  The chase with Eleanor was very well done except for that horribly fakelooking jump honestly with 90 mil to blow couldn't you make that look better? and the activation of nitrous at 7000 RPMs I know all car guys got a laugh out of that.In the final assessment this was a fun movie.  If you want character development get Citizen Kane.  If you want to see scads of cars trashed for no reason whatsoever get the original GI60S or Ronin home of the most overrated car chases in movie history.  If you want to see truetolife absolutely realistic car chase action watch Steve McQueen's green '68 Mustang GT390 duke it out with the black Charger RT in Bullitt or better yet switch on NASCAR Winston Cup racing next Sunday. If you want to have a good time enjoy a movie watch some cool cars and some sweet driving get Gone in Sixty Seconds.Postscript if you liked this you definitely need to check out the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever home of another amazing Ford Mustang chase sequence.".

In fact the car chase scene at the end is one of the best you'll ever see. Nice soundtrack in here too and a pretty good cast with Nicholas Cage leading the way.The bad news?

Though a little too long and not really full of action until the final twenty minutes it moves well and has a good cast Nicolas Cage Will Patton Robert Duvall Giovanni Ribisi Delroy Lindo Christopher Eccleston and others. Angelina Jolie is the only weak point. She's in desperate need of a talented hairstylist and while she's hardly a good actress she really doesn't do much in the film when you look at it which is a good thing. But the film has style and a good pace with some great theft scenes wellspotted humor and a final chase that while not among the greatest ever filmed is certainly a wild ride.

	schema:headline " A film about 51 times the HOT STUFF";
	schema:reviewBody "To make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about Kip Giovanni Ribsi a car thief who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars 50 in total. He is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order'. The objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days with the help of Randall Nicolas Cage a retired' booster and also Kip's brother and a couple of old friends of Randall's. As you can see this is the same old big bro' needs to get lil' bro' out of trouble routine and of course Randall is the best thief there ever was. Of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of but at times it is predictable too so there is nothing fancy about the story. You are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the HOT STUFF since there are only 50 beautiful fast cool and expensive cars to be stolen. Well the other hot item in this film is Sway Angelina Jolie who will be a big STAR trust me. She is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft but she is pretty hot too. OK not hot as in pretty but hot as in damn cool and sexy. She was very believable in this role probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too don't believe me read her biography and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man. I only know that she plays the kind of girl I like in this film because she is not too mainstream a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo.OK the only downsides I felt while watching this movie was that there is not very much action there is one totally unrealistic scene the story is only OK and that there are not much jokes. Hey but after seeing the whole film I must say WHO CARES. Why must I say that well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some Bruckheimer scenes where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool wild sexy lady yes I mean Mrs. Jolie and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with. So some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie. All in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall OK movie with a cool  feelgood ending.As for Nicolas Cage well He is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as The Rock Con Air Face  Off Snake Eyes and finally this one. Plus what actor has had so many good action  thriller's in the last years and such successful ones ? Well no one!!! Maybe Jackie Chan but he is one of my favourites too. One thing that is true though about Mr. Cages Bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse. The Rock was a clear 9 Con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7. Not that that mark is bad. Does it not show that his films under Bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe Cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? No it doesn't show us that because almost all of Cage's films were successful in the last few years except for 8mm and Bringing out the Dead. 8mm was not great I admit that but that was never Cage's fault and the story seemed good to me. About the latter film I can not say anything cause I have not seen it yet. One thing though I know for sure if Bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films I would have said YES to all of them. I would have said yes to The Rock because the story was great and because you would get to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I would have said yes to Con Air because there would be a lot of action in it because the story was good and because you got to act with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. In this one I would have starred because I would have gotten a big paycheque I would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because I would have been able to kiss Angelina Jolie can't wait to see her in that Lara Croft outfit. This one was a good choice of Mr. Cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7 out of 10".

He has to get together his old crew that he can trust to help him pull it off and get his bro out of dutch. But the cops are onto him so can he pull it off? This was one of the great candidates of a film to remake as the Original was far from a classic. And if you don't go into it expecting much and turn the thinking portion of your brain off so you can ignore the plot hole ans just take the movie for what it is. You'll end up enjoying the ride. Watch it on a doublebill with The Fast and the Furious for a night of highspeed hijinks just don't take the car out for a spin right afterwards.My Grade B DVD Extras 7 minute Jerry Bruckheimer Interview Bruckheimer BioFilmography Action Overload Highlight Reel The Big Chase 0 To 60 featurette Wild Rides featurette Stars On The Move The Cult Painted On The Heart music video Theatrical Trailer and Trailers for Shanghai Noon Mission to Mars and Coyote Ugly";

	schema:reviewBody "I have mixed feelings about this movie. I do prefer movies that are a little more... intelligent per say but I still feel Gone in Sixty Seconds is quite underrated. Actually my biggest complaint is that the movie was too short. There was simply too much story and way to many characters to fit into the movie's time frame.The basic story is about a car thief Cage who has achieved legendary status and then retired. His younger brother trying to be like his brother falls into car boosting too but soon gets in too deep and ends up on the hitlist of a ruthless crime lord after he messes up a very important job. Now the only way to save his brother's life is for Cage to come out of retirement and finish the job Strealing fifty high profile cars in one night. Together with many other top thieves they set out to do the impossible.While the cast is truly star studded with big names such as Nicholas Cage Angelina Jolie and Rober Duvall most of the acting and characters aren't that sympathetic. The movie simply has too many characters to really get deeply into any of them. Delroy Lindo does a fairly engaging job as the old archnemesis of the protagonist and Cage is good as usual but the rest of the cast is nothing special except perhaps for the mysterious coroner who never talks Sphynx.But the movie is still worth watching for the suspenseful action and the truly incredible chase scene at the end. Is there anything more beautiful then that Shelby Mustang GT nicknamed Eleanor roaring down the streets of Los Angoles? There are many other exotic cars in this movie too from a very unique Hummer to a Lambourgini Diablo.Don't go into this movie expecting a deep and involving dramatic story. While it does attempt at this it doesn't necessarily succeed. But the action is suspenseful and although a tad unrealistic at times it is a great kick to watch. This movie is better then the average action movie. A true classic for the car chase genre.My rating 12 out of  Other recommendations Bourne Supremacy The Italian Job 1969 Smokey and the Bandit".

As an example the pace of the movie grinds to a halt when having found the keys for three Mercedes cars they need the dog swallows them. There's then an entirely unfunny set of scenes involving exlax and waiting for the dog to crap out the keys. All the while you keep hoping the movie will continue but it doesn't until the dog poops up the keys.The film is saved only by the final car chase which rivals anything the Matrix series has provided and which has the only halfway decent cinematic portrayal of what a compressed gas cylinder will do if the valve snaps off. Also a saving grace is Vinnie Jones  awful actor but you can't help but like him anyway. His few scenes are worth looking out for.And that's about it for Gi60S. Mostly dull with a few spots of brightness and a good car chase at the end.".

But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable.  For those who don't know the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors.  Who would suspect them.  But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original the remake is a very good movie until we get to the final chase scene the part of the 74 version that made it great.  The one in this version is watered down only 10 minutes and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase.  Where the original chase was very believable the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes.  My advice if you want to watch a classic car chase film fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake.".

One can only assume that the writer and director were targeting 15 yearold redneck boys with this one because every line every emotion displayed every plot twist was comicbookish sophmoric and portrayed in the way that a high school boy would think it should be portrayed. The writing was hands down the worst of all the movies elements. We're supposed to feel empathy towards the lead character played by Nicholas Cage because his brother was targeted with a death threat by some lowlife foreign crime boss whose main beef was that he couldn't let his criminal reputation be spoiled by the young brother's botched car heist. Who gives a crap. Wow that guy was peeved. I the movie audience member sure hope his seedy reputation is kept in tact! Why did Nicholas Cage and Robert Duvall say yes to this movie script? Just reading it alone had to signal NO PLOT to these decent actors. One can only assume they were taken over by the same 15year old boy mentality when they found out that the sexy Angelina Jolie would be on the set looking like a mechanic's dream.

When the Bruckheimer style is used as the film's fuel as it is in Armageddon Con Air and the disaster that is Gone in 60 Seconds it abruptly puts a stop to the quality. The plot is too simple and dumbfounding Nicolas Cage and his Pennzoilcovered merrymen must steal a plethora of damnnear unattainable and valuable cars within a time limit for a stereotypical British villain or else the captured brother is killed. I've never seen the original film this remake tries to fire up but I feel safe in assuming that nothing was improved. The star power of this cast with names like Cage Angelina Jolie Robert Duvall Giovanni Ribisi Delroy Lindo Will Patton and Vinnie Jones doesn't bring anything worthwhile anything at all to the table You might as well go see their likenesses at a wax museum.. After sifting through this garbage I found my favorite scene is the deadline cruncher car chase between Cage and the popo the stunts and car are both kickas. Aside from flying cars every bit of this accumulation of gunk is irritating to the bone. If you would like to see any of the actual cars of Gone in 60 Seconds without actually enduring the flick itself I'm sure a few are still on display at Ripley's Hollywood Car Museum in Gatlinburg Tennessee.

Great use of silent sequences close ups slow motion black humor and mood lighting Hitch's most underrated talkie Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools. It's irrelevent. Fun all the way including the opening theatre curtain and the closing one thump. Dietrich is a splendid bitch and this may be the best performance Wyman ever gave. Also look for Everley Gregg Patricia Hitchcock Miles Malleson and Ballard Berkeley. Dietrich's final close up and the coach scene with Wyman and Todd are gems. Sim and Thorndike are hilarious as is the always wonderful Grenfell as Lovely Ducks. A Must See.".

Great use of silent sequences close ups slow motion black humor and mood lighting Hitch's most underrated talkie Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools. It's irrelevent. Fun all the way including the opening theatre curtain and the closing one thump. Dietrich is a splendid bitch and this may be the best performance Wyman ever gave. Also look for Everley Gregg Patricia Hitchcock Miles Malleson and Ballard Berkeley. Dietrich's final close up and the coach scene with Wyman and Todd are gems. Sim and Thorndike are hilarious as is the always wonderful Grenfell as Lovely Ducks. A Must See.";

Managing also to string along Michael Wilding as the ubercool Inspector Ordinary Smith she might sound like some cold calculating wench who uses up people like Marlene goes through hats.

The scene at the garden party when she switches from Dietrich's cockney maid to Smith's innocent date with every turn is delightful.It is the masterful presence of the great Alastair Sim however that makes Stage Fright one of Hitchock's most enjoyable to watch.  Few actors have his ability of making the most average of dialouges sound like a powerful oration and as Eve's doting father he makes the movie.  His Commodore Gill is always at the ready to harbor a fugitive clip off a snappy witicism or scrounge blackmail money for his beloved daughter.  He is equally at home playing comic relief as he is to serving as the plot glue that makes Eve's capers possible.  But live with his wife?  Thank you no!  He is content to live on his boat.  Whether he is staging an amusing diversion to aid Eve dispensing sage bits of fatherly advice or merely strolling out in public the man bleeds coolness with every move.Some can argue that Stage Fright gives but an average treatment to the usual whodunnit murdersuspense formula that Hitchcock and countless others have used.  This is perhaps true.  But compared to the whole lot of crappy facsimile suspense films made since 1950 Stage Fright is quicker to entertain than most.Be sure to check it out if you want to see Hitch cast his own daughter Patricia in the supporting role of Chubby Banister.  Is that some kind of sick joke or was that name flattering in the fifties?P.S. I can't watch Marlene Dietrich anymore and not be reminded of Madeline Kahn's Teutonic Titwillow.  Is there some free therapy I can get for this?".

	schema:headline " So Who Cares About Conventions?";
	schema:reviewBody "I like this film. It has gotten a bad reputation due to Hitchcock's daring to break another film convention about the truth of a flashback. Hitchcock had already broken other conventions over the years some being of a technical variety the nine minute uncut takes on ROPE for instance. Here the film begins with Richard Todd describing what he claims happened to the murdered man to exgirl friend Jane Wyman. Subsequently we learn that the explanation is not totally true.What I find interesting about this particular issue is that the same people who denounce Hitchcock for cheating on this probably have found other films acceptable despite similar cheating. Take Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION. We hear Tyrone Power give Leonard Vole's version of what happened to the rich elderly woman Norma Varden about how they met about what he was doing on the night she was murdered. We do not SEE the actual view of his activities for the night of the murder but we accept his comments  until the end of the film shows what happened. Also check out Kurasawa's film classic RASHOMON where we see flashbacks of five people who show what happened and at the conclusion we really don't know if we heard the truth or if everyone has lied. The same can be said of the American remake of RASHOMON THE OUTRAGE. Even a musical comedy LES GIRLS leaves us all guessing at the end.Yet Hitchcock was condemned for his cheating. I think he should be praised for his daring for this film of all Hitchcock's movies develops in a unique way. Wyman is determined to prove the truth of Richard Todd's story and keeps meeting criticism and common sense from her father Alistair Sim and from the police led by Michael Wilding who don't believe him. And as a matter of fact at the conclusion it turns out that some if not all of Todd's flashback has elements of truth in it.Hitchcock told Francois Truffaud that he saw STAGE FRIGHT as an opportunity to work with some great British character actors Sim Joyce Grenville Sybil Thorndyke Kay Walsh. The film was definitely lower budgeted than other films SPELLBOUND even THE PARADINE CASE that he had recently made. The most expensive aspect was working with Dietrich which was costly for her salary and her designer clothing. But Hitchcock wanted a chance to work with Dietrich here just like he had made MR. AND MRS. SMITH to work with Carole Lombard in 1939. The results were quite good. The British character actors did the most with their parts including Todd who shows a nervousness and uncertainty in most of the film that is suggestive of possible insanity at the end. Dietrich also in her closing moments on the screen shows a bitterness and hatred that I don't think she ever showed in any other film role. Jane Wyman was criticized by Hitchcock for insisting on dressing up as the film progressed. However she does show a resourcefulness and pluck not usually seen in most of her movies. On the whole the film works pretty well to me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deep down this is a film about the way people use each other. Whereas many films present us with love triangles 'Stage Fright' explores the sharp edges of a love pentagon in which all five characters are engaged in subterfuge and manipulation. At the heart of it lies Richard Todd's Jonathon Cooper ruthlessly playing on Eve's affection for him in order to protect both himself and the woman he really loves Charlotte. However actress Charlotte is using him just as he uses Eve whilst behind his back she's involved with her manager Freddy. And sweet little Eve actress in training is far from innocent  she lies to the charming 'Ordinary' Smith whilst concealing the man she thinks she loves  Jonathon.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about 'Stage Fright' is that this daisy chain of betrayal is dismantled with barely a broken heart in sight. Unflinching insights into emotional cruelty and power imbalances in relationships are one of the most underappreciated aspects of Hitchcock's films 'Rebecca' 'Notorious' 'Vertigo' and 'Marnie' in particular although even the minor barbs James Stewart throws at Grace Kelly in 'Rear Window' hit the mark squarely but here one of the most calculated betrayals in all of his work has absolutely no emotional resonance. Eve has already conveniently fallen into the arms of Smith so there's no sting when she learns of Jonathon's deceit. Charlotte's betrayal of Jonathon carries no greater weight because by this point the viewer has no empathy left for him. Only 'Ordinary' Smith's rather hurt reaction to learning the truth about Eve means anything but it feels like a betrayal of a much slighter nature  she's a wellintentioned deceiver. Compare with the treachery of another Eve in the similarly comic and 'lightweight' 'North by Northwest' and the sheer toothlessness of this film's emotional unravelling becomes apparent.In fact the only emotional impact made in the film's finale is by Marlene Dietrich's Charlotte Inwood mulling over her actions in a beautifully shot scene. Dietrich's sheer luminosity can't help but draw the viewer in and the direction certainly favours her here. The perversity of empathising with this great manipulator probably appealed to Hitchcock who would later do the same with Robert Walker's Bruno Anthony and Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates and I think it's possibly the one great scene in the film if there's another it would be Dietrich's selfchoreographed rendition of 'The Laziest Gal in Town'.Mention of Walker and Perkins draws attention to the great failing of this film which is the character of Jonathon Cooper. Richard Todd has been much criticised for his stiff portrayal and I think it's fair to say he's rather a plodding performer even if he's never truly bad  although his psychosis under the stage is tremendously effective. The real problem is the script which denies the character a sense of humour. Almost all of Hitchcock's villains are witty and charming certainly all his best ones are but Jonathon is charmless. This is a real problem in a comedy thriller where almost every character has a comic appeal  even Kay Walsh's character has her own sour humour. By contrast Jonathon seems repellent  he isn't entertaining in the way everyone else is so we don't root for him. We should surely empathise with Eve's desperation to clear his name but he doesn't seem worth the effort. Whilst Dietrich is appealing even at her most cruel a true Hitchcockian villain Todd is unappealing even in innocence.The other performances range from the adequate Wilding just a little too lightweight as Smith to the wonderful Alistair Sim it scarcely needs to be pointed out shares the comic spoils with Dietrich and both Sybil Thorndike and Kay Walsh do great things with limited roles. Joyce Grenfell meanwhile somehow turns an irrelevant bit of comic business into a transcendent piece of physical comedy. Jane Wyman seems a little uncertain in places but funnily enough I think she's most effective in her 'Doris' guise able to show off her comic skills and sparking nicely with Dietrich.The false flashback is a neat gambit but unfortunately it unbalances the beginning of the film  Eve is sidelined for too long  and forces the script into some rather ugly expositional dialogue. However the rising curtain is a lovely conceit.".

	schema:headline " Frightfully good!";
	schema:reviewBody "This superb film incredibly contains Marlene Dietrich and Alistair Sim among its great cast in a blend of Hitchcock thrills and chills humour and even musical interludes. It is mostly overlooked due to it's original 'failure' with fans and critics caused mainly by misguided hatred of a plot device used in the film. Also people fail to cope with the very different moods the film moves between. From whimsical British comedy to chilling psychological drama. It may not be one of Hitchcock's perfect 1010 best but is easily 9 12 out of 10.Hitchcock did something in the film as he did in his classic Sabotage which upset filmgoers and critics because it was 'not the done thing'. I wouldn't wish to spoil the film for a 1st time viewer by saying what this was but it is mentioned in the spoilers section of trivia on this films IMDb homepage. It is a mistake I feel to overlook this film especially due to this 'unconventional plot device'.I find the 'unconventional plot device' in Sabotage one of a great many highlights of the film and it lifts it beyond what it would have been with the predictableconventional resolution of that scene.

	onyx:emotionText "This superb film incredibly contains Marlene Dietrich and Alistair Sim among its great cast in a blend of Hitchcock thrills and chills humour and even musical interludes. It is mostly overlooked due to it's original 'failure' with fans and critics caused mainly by misguided hatred of a plot device used in the film. Also people fail to cope with the very different moods the film moves between. From whimsical British comedy to chilling psychological drama. It may not be one of Hitchcock's perfect 1010 best but is easily 9 12 out of 10.Hitchcock did something in the film as he did in his classic Sabotage which upset filmgoers and critics because it was 'not the done thing'. I wouldn't wish to spoil the film for a 1st time viewer by saying what this was but it is mentioned in the spoilers section of trivia on this films IMDb homepage. It is a mistake I feel to overlook this film especially due to this 'unconventional plot device'.I find the 'unconventional plot device' in Sabotage one of a great many highlights of the film and it lifts it beyond what it would have been with the predictableconventional resolution of that scene. The same is true in Stage Fright. Filmgoers who cannot cope with being confused by clever directorial choices are people I pity.

	schema:headline " Excellent! One of Hitchcock's most underrated. 910";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Like any good film enthusiast I consider Hitchcock one of the best directors who ever lived right along with the likes of Fellini Bergman and Welles. Hitch consistently made films that were not only as entertaining as a film can possibly get but also films that were extraordinarily intellectual and human. Films such as Lifeboat Rear Window and Vertigo work as art as much as any other films ever made studying the human condition and utilizing the tools of cinema to the utmost.Hitch was also the most prolific film artist of all time. He made over 50 films. He made more masterpieces than any other filmmaker too. Several such as Vertigo Psycho and Rear Window are bona fide masterpieces. No one in their right mind would disagree with their status as some of the best films ever made. But everyone has that one Hitchcock film that they feel that they understand better than anyone else and always claim that it deserves to belong in the same status as the more accepted masterpieces. I seem to have discovered several. In fact every time I see one of his less popular films I think that it has gotten a bum rap. Rope is my favorite underrated Hitchcock film but I think that it is starting to be accepted by the masses more. Two other great ones that are less popular are Lifeboat and I Confess Lifeboat is well respected by Hitchcock fanatics but I Confess is usually dismissed. This sort of dismissal happens because of financial failure upon first release. Hitch certainly was an artist but if you've read the Truffaut interview book you realize that he took a film's financial success or failure very personally.Now we come to Stage Fright. I don't think that it was an enormous failure but it was also not an enormous success. Truffaut says something like this film neither added to nor took away from your reputation. The main complaint is that the opening flashback is a lie and that audiences could never accept that. I think that that technique works better now than it may have in 1950. It was sort of daring but it failed at the time. Although most people still don't want to ever think that the characters in a film are lying you still see it especially in neonoir think Chinatown Body Heat etc although those aren't flashbacks per se. Truffaut also derides it for being a whodunit which Hitch did not like. I don't think that Stage Fright is at all a whodunit. We assume through the entire film that Marlene Dietrich is unquestionably guilty in the crime.There are just a few very minor problems in the film most of them stemming from the trick ending trick endings are in style right now but they hardly ever work. This one does mostly but as soon as we realize we've been tricked just as happens at the end of The Sixth Sense a very good film otherwise we begin to go over the earlier events to see if there was any cheating. There is in Stage Fright and it loses a tiny bit of credibility from this. The other main problem is just how the police deal with the criminals at the end. It's hardly believable and they kill the main criminal in a very gruesome way that I would think would get them reprimanded by their superiors although it was cool. Anyway it's nowhere near as bad as the way the police act at the end of Hitch's next film Strangers on a Train where a cop shoots randomly at a crowd with the criminal in it and accidentally kills an innocent man!The gold of this film comes in the complex situations and characters. One reason why Hitch's films stand so far beyond the runofthemill thriller is that his characters are so well developed. The actors in Stage Fright are also superb. Jane Wyman the main character has an extraordinarily complicated role where she has to act at several different levels she plays an actress who believes that her skills can help her learn more about a murder she pretends that she's someone else and as she meets more people the more difficult it becomes to handle the situation. She also switches horses in midstream where she begins to doubt her relationship with the man whom she is helping and to fall for a detective on the murder case simultaneously. Richard Todd plays a man framed for murder. One excellent twist in the script is that his character is not intelligent. We're so used to characters being as astute as Sherlock Holmes in mystery films but he's an illogical hothead who takes very stupid risks. Marlene Dietrich has a lot of fun here playing a demongoddess. She's just hilarious trying really hard to act depressed over her husband's death and she's one of the most terrible singers you'll ever hear!. I love how she controls everyone in the film even those who are trying to be her enemies. You just can't refuse Marlene! Possibly the most memorable and amusing performance in the film is that of Alastair Sim most famous for playing Ebenezer Scrooge a year later. He's hilarious as Wyman's father. Micheal Wilding playing the detective who is falling for Wyman is also great especially when he finds that she is betraying him and may have only been using him. There are a few very memorable cameos too including the bibulous gent a turtlelike man who offers Wyman comfort and the shooting gallery matron the whole shooting gallery scene is great.Stage Fright has been trampled by the more outstanding Hitchcock pictures. It is a small gem not boring in any way. It deserves to be rediscovered by more people.".

A glancing reference to her having been educated in America doesn't solve the fact that she's supposed to be British.Marlene Dietrich is 50 and looks it.

Quick name another film starring Michael Wilding. You can't. Hitchcock takes his time with the characters. Wyman and Wilding in the taxi on the way to the garden party are wonderful.Is it necessary for Hitchcock to insist on superimposing a bloodstain on the doll's dress to let us know what Alastair Sim is thinking?

	schema:reviewBody "Stage Fright 1950Offhand Marlene Dietrich and Alfred Hitchcock seem like an unlikely pair. But it works! Even if you find Dietrich wooden as an actress you have to appreciate her aura which was legendary and which Hitchcock incorporates and bounces against with real virtuosity. There are two or three long scenes as when Dietrich is trying on her mourning clothes and smoking under her veil where the filming the fast dialog the light the movement of the characters and the editing are breathtaking.Taken in pieces like this or seen as a whole the film is a masterpiece of directing and construction. And at least three of the principle characters are just perfectJane Wyman as the innocent woman in the middle of it all Alastair Sims as her father and Dietrich. A fourth surprise performance is by Michael Wilding who appears in many different scenes and is charming funny and smart as a whip playing a detective in love and in the dark. The plot itself is classic Hitchcock with seeming innocence and guilt shifting as you watch and ordinary people getting too involved in the solving of the crime. Including the viewer. Even the use of the flashback that anchors the beginning of the film as two of them speed away gets a huge twist by the end both a narrative thrill and a logical one in terms of filmmaking. Talk about verisimilitude getting in the way of realism.We know that the stage will play a large role throughout and Hitchcock loved to include the theatre in his films. Christian Dior designed Dietrich's wardrobes and the song is by none other than Cole Porter. The song is clever but not his best and Dietrich's performance though supported by a fabulous set for a small time theater is dull. The writing throughout is rather fabulous partly thanks to Hitchcock's wife who worked on it and look for their daughter by the way at the lawn party. There is so much going right here what keeps it from quite becoming a masterpiece? I think the key thing is the startling disparity in acting styles. I mean Wyman Sim and Dietrich are about as odd a threesome as you get in terms of acting style. Wilding is a kind of lubricant throughout he appears in scenes with all of them and seems to make them sensible. The other noticeable flaw might be the last several minutes when a climax is building and yet there is an odd diffusion and a sudden end to it all as if an opportunity was lost to wring us out a little.But don't let this stand in your way. It's a terrific movie in all. I liked this more this time than any previous viewing and I was left wondering why I had forgot so much about it. There is some really nice filming it never gets boring the sets and locations are fabulous and some of the individual acting is a wonder. Including Dietrich.".

	schema:headline " Forgotten Hitchcock Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine movie by Director Hitchcock in which Jane Wyman shines as the aspiring stage actor trying to get to the truth of a murder. It is usually overlooked or forgotten in evaluations of Hitchcock's overall work. Wyman's friend Richard Todd is on the run from the police. In an effort to out the guilty party she enlists the help of her father played by the great Alastair Sim. She worms her way into the household of a far more accomplished actor Marlene Dietrich impersonating a servant. She also wins the heart of a police inspector Michael Wilding. She is at the forefront of this entertaining little film as she changes wardrobes and accents going back and forth from London to her country home. The cast is strong allround and in addition to the above are the talented Dame Sybil Thorndike Joyce Grenfell and Kay Walsh not to mention Patricia Hitchcock the director's daughter who often performed very capably in his movies. The movie is a black comedy that moves along at a great pace with interesting vignettes and the long takes that Hitchcoock used so effectively. The onlocation shooting in London gives the movie a reality missing in Hitchcock's earlier films. I liked this movie very much and with Wyman's acting and Hitchcock's direction it works well.".

It is usually overlooked or forgotten in evaluations of Hitchcock's overall work. Wyman's friend Richard Todd is on the run from the police. In an effort to out the guilty party she enlists the help of her father played by the great Alastair Sim. She worms her way into the household of a far more accomplished actor Marlene Dietrich impersonating a servant. She also wins the heart of a police inspector Michael Wilding.

But this film is so much more than that once I viewed it. It might be the only film where Hitch does 2 Cameos  though one is so subtle that it is hard to catch while the other is very obvious. The film does continue most of the themes of his prior work. Stairways are a central theme within the plot. Camera angles are used with very great care.Mostly this is a great performance film. For whatever reason the cast all have some of their best roles acting on film. Jane Wyman  Marlene Dietrich are both great. While Dietrich might have a better performance someplace this is the best Wyman I have ever seen anywhere. The male cast is fantastic every one of them. In this film Alstair Sim who would play Scrooge the next year has his best performance in any film of his I have seen in addition to the classic as Wymans father. The support in this film is so strong that by the end the viewer does not care about the beginning not making complete sense because Hitch  the actors have overcome that with a well made movie.Hitchcocks next Warner film would be Dial M For Murder. While that one is more famous this movie filmed in London with a strong British cast is worth while viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Stage Fright 1950' certainly isn't one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films but I like it  quite a lot in fact. From 19491950 the Master of Suspense took a temporary break from Hollywood filmmaking and produced two UK productions the first being 'Under Capricorn 1949' a fascinating but relatively unengaging melodrama with superb camerawork. The second a return to his standard narrative form after two noticeably experimental pictures was an adaptation of the story Man Running by Selwyn Jepson. With a wonderful British supporting cast centred around Hollywood stars Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich the film has a distinctly British feel to it and not just because of the actors and setting. Hitchcock's whimsical sense of humour evident in a great many of his pictures is allowed to permeate the traditional dramaromance storyline and the film would certainly have felt comfortable alongside the Ealing comedies of the late 1940s and early 1950s many of which employed darkly comedic overtones.There's something about Jane Wyman that immediately caught my eye while watching this film. Behind her rosy cheeks timid eyes and soft voice there's a certain innocence and vulnerability about her demeanour that really drew my sympathy. Her character Eve Gill is basically a petty schoolgirl driven by silly but unwavering aspirations to uncover the truth and her delicate personality is punctuated by moments of stubbornness and indeed some occasional bravery. I've never really taken to actress Marlene Dietrich and I find her distinct European accent and stunted linedelivery to be rather distracting however she does passably well as Charlotte Inwood demonstrating an arrogant disposition that forms a strong contrast with the mild personality of Wyman's character. As far as the male actors are concerned strong performances are given by Richard Todd as the wronglyaccused boyfriend for some reason or another the Irish actor reminded me of Joaquin Phoenix Michael Wilding as the honest and romantic detective with whom Eve inevitably falls in love and Alastair Sim is a lot of fun as our leading lady's loving and playful father.In comparing Alfred Hitchcock's films with those of his contemporaries it's interesting to note how the director made stunning dynamic use of the camera. Both 'Rope 1948' and 'Under Capricorn 1949' had made pioneering use of longtakes sweeping the camera across the room with astonishing style and grace. For the first time Hitchcock and cinematographer Wilkie Cooper integrated these techniques into a more traditional filmmaking style and multiple sequences play out in a single take my favourite shot follows Cooper Richard Todd through Charlotte's front door and smoothly rises with him as he ascends the staircase. Another interesting element to the film which met with much criticism upon its release is the ingenious use of a false flashback as Cooper's recount of past events is revealed to be little more than an elaborate lie. As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events I see little dishonesty in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise  though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.".

The photography is beautiful and so is the music making some scenes like the one in the taxi very touching. The script is well crafted and while you think you know what's happening the final solution is very unpredictable. My only complaint for the film was the last couple of minutes the film just ended abruptly without a rounded finish or even a monologue. I liked the story about a man who is accused of murder and a friend of his sets out to clear his name it is well told and doesn't have a sense of contrivance and I did fear it would do. As for the acting I had very little problem with it Jane Wyman was perfectly alluring as Eve. Michael Wilding delights as Ordinary Smith and while he started off a tad wooden Richard Todd was fine too. Two of the film's stars impressed me the most though. One was Marlene Dietrich who was deliciously frosty as the stage actress and singer Mrs Winstead. I find Dietrich quite captivating with her lovingly designed clothes beautiful face and distinctive voice I thought she was a great actress. The other was Alistair Sim who I consider the best Scrooge ever with George C. Scott close behind he had some very funny moments the most notable one being at the garden party and the doll stall. Even Hitchcock himself has a cameo 30 minutes into the film as does his daughter Patricia. I didn't know until the end credits that Kay Walsh Nancy in Oliver Twist played the maid. All in all a very overlooked film that is actually very clever. It isn't Hitchcock's best but it is a very good film. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " The master of movie mysteries does it again";
	schema:reviewBody "My title may seem a little offbase since Stage Fright comes about in the middle of the nearly five decades that Alfred Hitchcock thrilled audiences with his films. But whenever it was that one saw a Hitchcock film we always had a sense of Wow he did it again. The again of course was his clever shooting scripting and direction that entertained and beguiled us while keeping us in the dark about many parts of the film and its outcome.One could have fun with lots of m's  as in mayhem and murder  to describe Hitchcock movies. But we should remember that Hitch also did some comedies and romance. While he wasn't known for those I think they give us a little hint about the subtle humor that he likes to weave into some of his stories. Not all but some. Including his cameo shots in almost all of his mystery films. Stage Fright has a touch of comedy in the dialogue and more in the mannerisms of one of the main characters  Commodore Gill played by Alastair Sim as the credits note billed as Alistair Sim. Sim will forever be known to movie fans as Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1951 filming of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. And although he did have some serious roles in earlier mysteries and dramas Sim was very successful the last half of his career with comedies. In Stage Fright Commodore Gill's wit and lighthearted manner gives a sense of calm to contrast the high tension of Jane Wyman's Eve Gill. Wyman excels in her role and the other main characters are all very good. Marlene Dietrich is not the star of this film but she has a main role of suspicion that she carries us along with very nicely. Richard Todd's Jonathan Cooper is very good and Michael Wilding Sybil Thorndike and Kay Walsh are excellent as Ordinary Smith Mrs. Gill and Nellie Goode respectively.I won't discuss the plot because I think that reveals too much and the suspense is a big part of the enjoyment of these films. Suffice it to say that Hitch has done it again. He dazzled movie goers for more than four decades with many of the best crime mysteries ever put on film. No one could do them better. And while he did receive five Academy Award nominations he never did win an Oscar. This is one of those uncanny things about Hollywood the movie industry and the Oscars. Films that Hitch directed received nearly 50 Academy Award nominations. They won six Oscars and two Golden Globes  for others. And if nothing else Hitchcock was one of the most successful movie directors in the U.S. and England. Most of his films from the 1930s through 1960s were huge boxoffice successes. Many big name stars appeared in Hitch films  some in more than one. Cary Grant James Stewart Gregory Peck Laurence Olivier Sean Connery Peter Lorre Charles Laughton Claude Rains Paul Newman Henry Fonda Rod Taylor James Mason Raymond Burr Ray Milland Robert Cummings Montgomery Clift Joel McCrea Karl Malden Joseph Cotton George Sanders and Robert Donat had some of the male leads. Ingrid Bergman Julie Andrews Janet Leigh Carole Lombard Maureen O'Hara Joan Fontaine Diane Baker Doris Day Anne Baxter Kim Novak Eva Marie Saint Shirley MacLaine Grace Kelly and Laraine Day were among the female leads.At the time of my writing this review in January 2014 nine of Alfred Hitchcock's films are among the top 250 rated movies on the IMDb list. Rear Window from 1954 is IMDb number 30 followed by Psycho from 1960 at number 31. North by Northwest from 1959 is ranked 57 Vertigo from 1958 is 67 Rebecca from 1940 is 134 and Dial M for Murder from 1954 is 168. The last three are Strangers on a Train 1950 at number 186 Notorious 1946 at 191 and Rope from 1948 at number 240. Is there another director who has more than nine films in the top 250 IMDb list in early January 2014?Viewers may note that Birds from 1963 isn't on the IMDb top250 list. Nor is Lifeboat longconsidered one of the great movies of all time since it came out in 1944 smack dab at the height of World War II. Or how about Spellbound from 1945? Or The 39 Steps from 1935? Or Marnie from 1964? Indeed the list of great films by Hitchcock goes on and on. Most are mysteries but some are romance and comedies. I recommend the above films to younger viewers who may want to see more of Hitchcock. And the following list is sure to provide many more hours of movie enjoyment. The Man Who Knew Too Much 1934 Secret Agent 1936 Sabotage 1936 The Girl Was Young 1937 The Lady Vanishes 1938 Jamaica Inn 1939 Foreign Correspondent 1930 Suspicion 1941 Saboteur 1942 Shadow of a Doubt 1943 I Confess 1953 To Catch a Thief 1955 The Troubles with Harry 1955 The Wrong Man 1956 Torn Curtain 1966 and Frenzy 1972.".

	onyx:emotionText "My title may seem a little offbase since Stage Fright comes about in the middle of the nearly five decades that Alfred Hitchcock thrilled audiences with his films. But whenever it was that one saw a Hitchcock film we always had a sense of Wow he did it again. The again of course was his clever shooting scripting and direction that entertained and beguiled us while keeping us in the dark about many parts of the film and its outcome.One could have fun with lots of m's  as in mayhem and murder  to describe Hitchcock movies. But we should remember that Hitch also did some comedies and romance. While he wasn't known for those I think they give us a little hint about the subtle humor that he likes to weave into some of his stories. Not all but some. Including his cameo shots in almost all of his mystery films. Stage Fright has a touch of comedy in the dialogue and more in the mannerisms of one of the main characters  Commodore Gill played by Alastair Sim as the credits note billed as Alistair Sim. Sim will forever be known to movie fans as Ebenezer Scrooge from the 1951 filming of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. And although he did have some serious roles in earlier mysteries and dramas Sim was very successful the last half of his career with comedies.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I am slightly puzzled as to why 'Stage Fright' is not generally considered one of Alfred Hitchcocks' finest works as on every viewing I remain glued to the screen right the way from beginning to end.The film opens with a theatre curtain rising and we are immediately introduced to a postwar London still containing the ruins of World War Two. Eve Jane Wyman a Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts actress is driving Johnny Richard Todd who has run from away from the scene of the murder of the husband of Charlotte Marlene Dietrich a major star of the theatre. Any sign of the police? she asks him as they escape. Eve do you hate me now you know about me and Charlotte? Johnny asks her. Eve regards Charlotte as cold and calculating and is convinced that she is using Johnnys' affections towards her to get him convicted of the murder. From here until very late in the picture Eve does all she can to prevent Johnny from being convicted of a crime she is sure Charlotte has committed.As the film progresses there are plenty of indications as to who might have done the crime but it takes a dramatic twist towards the end of the picture for us to discover who out of Johnny and Charlotte is actually guilty. The conclusion very much goes against what we are led to believe for much of the films' running time due to an early flashback something which Hitchcock apparently regretted. In my opinion this makes the movie hugely interesting and somewhat unique.The other reasons for me liking this picture are plenty. The attractive Jane Wyman as Eve is outstanding in the lead role whilst Marlene Dietrich steals much of the limelight notably when she performs the song 'The Laziest Girl in Town' surrounded by smartly dressed men. Alistair Sim is very charismatic as Eves' father who goes out of his way to try to get Charlotte to confess even using a doll with a bloodstained dress to unnerve her whilst she performs at a wet garden party What vermin some vermin are Charlotte remarks. Charlotte suffers from 'Stage Fright' in front of an audience when she is presented with the doll and is a fascinating character who uses her acting skills to get herself out of tricky situations in real life. Eve turns the tables on Charlotte by posing as her dresser and when she reveals her true identity a horrified Charlotte tells her I'll give you anything if you keep me out of this. The film harks back to Hitchcocks' origins as it contains many quintessentially British characters notably Eves' parents and Charlottes' maid and it is set in London which is where many of his early British films from the 1920's and 1930's took place. One notably British location is a pub where Eve meets the police detective Smith Michael Wilding who takes quite a fancy to her.Overall I think this is an excellent picture and very worthwhile viewing for all Hitchcock fans.".

Kwan does little to help us through this film and it easy to mistake Rosa for Moon after all they look identical! However make no mistake Rosa whom Jie meets in Taipei is not Moon. Several people I know who have seen this film are convinced that Moon faked her death and snuck away to Taipei to live with Jie. But astute viewers will note that in the airport scene that opens the film and replays later we see both Moon and Rosa about to board the same flight. Rosa misses it and therefor lives. Interviews with Kwan confirm that Chingmy Yau is playing a dual role not just changing her name halfway through the movie. This is consistent with Kwan's favorite theme of split identities see Red Rose White Rose.Having said that this film is ambiguous enough to allow for multiple interpretations without having to compound the confusion by mixing up the characters.".

But astute viewers will note that in the airport scene that opens the film and replays later we see both Moon and Rosa about to board the same flight. Rosa misses it and therefor lives. Interviews with Kwan confirm that Chingmy Yau is playing a dual role not just changing her name halfway through the movie. This is consistent with Kwan's favorite theme of split identities see Red Rose White Rose.Having said that this film is ambiguous enough to allow for multiple interpretations without having to compound the confusion by mixing up the characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of great adventure movies came out of the 80's like the Star Wars sequels Indiana Jones The Goonies etc. Romancing the Stone is one of those little gems no pun intended that somehow gets lost when we think of a great adventure movie. I just adore this movie ever since I was a little girl I just wanted to live this movie. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas had this amazing chemistry that made you wonder how the heck they were not a real couple in life. Though like Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio their friendship shows so well on screen as well as off that you're grateful they could bounce off each other so well. Romancing the Stone is such a fun film that shows off DeVito Turner and Douglas' talent so well that we saw them all again in War of the Roses. Romancing came first though and what a great movie.Joan Wilder is a lonely New York romance novelist who receives a treasure map mailed to her by sister Elaine who calls Joan and begs her to come to Cartagena Colombia because Elaine has been kidnapped by bumbling antiquities smugglers Ira and Ralph and the map is to be the ransom. Hastily flying to Colombia Joan is detoured from the rendezvous with Ralph by Colonel Zolo the man who killed Elaine's husband. Joan ends up in the jungle and is almost killed by Zolo but is saved by the swashbuckling American exporter Jack T. Colton. For getting her to Cartagena Joan promises to pay Jack for getting her to Cartagena so she can save her sister. But she ends up living one of her romance novels as her and Jack grow closer as they discover the map holds a stone that they will romance.Romancing the Stone is a perfect mixture of adventure romance and humor. It is literally like a romance novel but one that even the guys could get into. I really like how Kathleen's character Joan goes from this antisocial caterpillar into a woman of the world by the end. It had such a great story arch for her. Michael Douglas as Jack couldn't have been a more perfect choice like his daddy he reminds me of one of those old Hollywood actors who has been doing it for years. He's handsome charismatic funny and strong so perfect for the role. Danny DeVito was so funny I nearly died laughing when his cousin was leaving him to take the fall and Danny screams When will you come back his cousin screams Soon! he asks How soon?! and the cousin replies with very soon! how sweet to do that to your family right? The villains are great and very scary. Everything about this film is just a ton of fun I guarantee there will be something that you can connect with in this film. Wither it's the action the romance or the humor Romancing the Stone is a film not to be missed.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Truth be told  I came a little late to the party when it comes to having seen Romancing The Stone.  I didn't see it for the first time until the Fall of 1993 but had seen it's sequel Jewel of the Nile numerous times since its initial theatrical release in 1985.  Normally when it comes to seeing sequels I almost always prefer the original to the sequelbut for many years I absolutely loved Jewel of the Nile not knowing about Romancing the Stone.When I finally did see Romancing the Stone nine solid years after its theatrical release on some premium cable channel I was blown away by it. All those years spent raving about Jewel should have been spent raving about Romancing the Stone.  The original is leaps and bounds superior to the sequel  even though Jewel of the Nile does have its own charmsto a degree upon reflection and contains what is arguably Kathleen Turner's best onscreen performance.  Have we ever seen her better in anything else? Maybe in Peggy Sue Got Married or in Prizzi's Honor perhaps even in Body Heat but it's safe to say that without her enormously captivating thoroughly fabulous performance as Joan Wilder opposite Michael Douglas' career best comic performance as Jack Coltin the movie wouldn't be such the modernday classic it is and always will be.As far as I'm concerned Turner was robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress in 1984 for this film.  So often the Academy favors dramatic performances over comedic performances when everyone worth their Screen Actors Guild card knows comedy is infinitely trickier to pull off convincingly than drama. How many actresses could have been as perfect as Turner is as Wilder? Only Susan Sarandon comes to immediate mindshe would have been magnificent come to think of it.Also there hasn't been a successful romantic adventure film made since that even comes close to comparing with Romancing the Stone I believe.  And I've looked long and hard to find one even compatible to this and have failed.  There may be many knockoffs but no real diamonds in the rough.Danny DeVito as always was a hoot to watch and Holland Taylor as Joan's book editor Gloria is simply sensational in a brief but memorable turn at the beginning and tailend of the movie.  It's a mystery why she's never really been a bigger star before now with her groundbreaking Emmy Awardwinning work on The Practice at least giving us a taste on what we've been denying ourselves by not making a big noise in support of her landing bigger juicier starring roles.So 16 years later Romancing the Stone is still unequivocally the best of its genre and makes you wish the Turner would get the chance to work far more than she's been in recent times.  The woman is a comic genius and we need to let the powers that be in Hollywood know that we want more of her and quickly.One suggestion  If Turner Douglas and DeVito ever do reteamlet it not be in a second sequel.  Romancing is just too perfect to capitalize on any further.  They couldn't do a sequel to The War of the Roses for obvious reasons if you've seen the movie you already know why.  Just imagine how great they would have been in Primary Colors as Jack and Susan Stantin. John Travolta on target for sure and especially Emma Thompson in a surprisingly weak performance take note.  It's a shame the film's writer Diane Thomas didn't live long enough to have written any other films of this magnitude.  This one produced gem of hers has given millions of people the world over countless hours of funfilled escapist delight.  A true classic in every sense.GRADE A".

Douglas and De Vito are great but to me the film belongs to Kathleen Turner she's fantastic and looks absolutely stunning. Its also very well directed from the future director of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump amongst others. Its often mentioned as a rip off of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but I don't really think it is that apparent the scenes in the Jungle at the start of the film are really good especially when they find the crashed plane There's nothing like a good fire!!!. Danny De Vito is really funny as the comic relief and his cousin has some funny lines Look at them snappers would ya. My only small complaint is the romantic stuff is a little corny but I suppose thats for the female audience. They followed this up with Jewel of the Nile just a year later! Sadly like most sequels it wasn't nearly as good as this actually its not really worth bothering about unfortunately Douglas Turner and De Vito also teamed up again in another film War of the Roses but that film has no connection with this or Jewel of the Nile. So if you haven't seen Romancing the Stone look out for it it's excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie.  I'm sure that it's in my topten somewhere because ever since I was a kid I've never gotten sick of watching it.  The premise is one of those that's just so damn crazy it actually works.  It starts with a successful romance novelist Joan Wilder who has just finished her last book but lacks the sort of lovelife that she writes about.  When she learns that her sister has been kidnapped and is being held hostage she takes off to South America to help her out.  It seems that the kidnappers want a treasure map that is in Joan's possession.  Joan is very much a city girl and doesn't fully realize the bind that she and her sis have gotten themselves into.  Once in South America she takes the wrong bus which breaks down in the South American jungle.  When she's held up by a corrupt Police Chief a very rugged unshaven shotgun toting Michael Douglas Jack Colton shows up and kicks some ass.  See Jack is a birdtrapper who wants nothing more than enough cash to buy himself a yacht.  Realizing that Joan is lost in the jungle and fully incapable of surviving on her own Jack agrees to take her to the nearest town for 300 in travellers' checks so off they go.  By now we've learned that besides the two goons who've kidnapped Joan's sister one of which is Danny DeVito in one of his funniest roles EVER the South American police are after the map as well.  Everyone wants what's at the end of the map.  What follows for the next hour and a half is one of the most exciting and funny actionadventure movies ever filmed.  Michael Douglas is absolutely perfect in the role of Jack Colton and delivers some of the funniest oneliners I've ever heard.  Kathleen Turner is equally great as the naive romantic and as always she looks great.  A great script is brougth to life perfectly by Robert Zemeckis and his direction is airtight.  Please go watch this movie even if you've seen it a hundred times already......Oh YEAH!!!! Now that's a campfire!!!!".

	schema:headline " Superb adventurecomedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Romancing the Stone is argubly my favorite adventure movie of alltime. Yep in my opinion it surpasses all three movies in the Indiana Jones trilogy which are right behind in terms of greatness. This movie has action adventure comedy drama and romance all rolled up into one great motion picture. Kathleen Turner stars as Joan Wilder a romance novelist who flies to the South American country of Colombia to rescue her kidnapped sister. She's ordered by the kidnappers to bring a treasure map that she received in the mail with her to the Colombian city of Cartegna. Ms. Wilder ends up getting on the wrong bus that ends up taking her deep into the jungle where she meets a fortune hunter who saves her life in more ways than one. He also seems to resemble the hero in her books. Jack Colton the fortune hunter is played by Michael Douglas who also produced the film and he talks her into using the map to find the treasure. But they're not the only ones who are dying to get their hands on the treasure. A couple of bad guys are in hot pursuit of the two adventurers. There's Zolo Manuel Ojeda an evil colonel who's on to Ms. Wilder and is the real nasty bad guy of the bunch Ira Zack Norman one of the crazed kidnappers who's obsessed with crocodiles he's always saying Look at those snappers! and Ralph Danny DeVito Ira's bumbling cousin who goes to the airport to pick up Ms. Wilder see's at the last second that she got on the wrong bus and is forced to go into the jungle to find her. Even Ralph and Ira know that Zolo is bad news. There are also minor supporting characters in the film. There's Gloria Holland Taylor from TV's The Practice Ms. Wilder's publisher Elaine Mary Ellen Trainor Ms. Wilder's sister and Juan Alfonso Arau a Colombian native who actually turns out to be a huge fan of Ms. Wilder. In one very funny scene Ms. Wilder and Mr. Colton go to the house of this man and ask him if they can borrow his car. The Colombian tells them to get lost until he finds out that the woman is actually Joan Wilder the novelist and admits that he's one of her biggest fans who has read every one of her books. He proceeds to help the two get out of a jam. Romancing the Stone has plenty of exhilarating action scenes and a load of big laughs. This was director Robert Zemeckis' first hit movie which he made before the original Back to the Future and I still think this is his best film. Zemeckis is one of our best directors working today and rarely like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron does he make a bad film. Romancing the Stone is a great movie. Turner is splendid as the novelist up to her neck in trouble Douglas is terrific as her sidekick and Norman and Arau are hilarious in smaller roles. But the one who provides the biggest laughs in the movie is Danny DeVito. He is literally a scream in Romancing the Stone. I kept falling down on my side because he had me laughing so hard. This is one movie that's a mustsee for people who like a mix of action suspense adventure romance thrills and lots of comedy. One of the '80s best. Followed by the very good sequel Jewel of the Nile. out of four".

The chases are pretty standard and the climax is laughably bad. There is a fairly good setup though to the movie's credit including a great introduction. Michael Douglass is his trademark egotistical self while Kathleen Turner is satisfactory.

It is everything entertaining exciting thrilling great fun hilarious involving dark sometimes scary very pleasant and a timeless classic.Adventure is something which isn't missing in this movie by any means. This is adventureaction in the nostalgic 80's style. Lots of 80's elements are in this film music cars the quality of filmmaking hair styles clothes and even in the sounds of the guns they have a formidable sound. Nothing to do with the excessive violence and noise of nowadays's action films and also with no need of any special effects at all  and it works so well! This movie proves that a simple but good story with no special effects can make a quality film and such thing is certainly much better than a movie with only special effects but no plot.The movie is supposed to take place in Colombia but it was filmed in Mexico. Who cares anyway? The scenario is one of the many solid attributes of the film. Cartagena is a beautiful place and the colombian jungles are amazing either. The backgroundslandscapes are simply brilliant forests mountains rivers waterfalls clouds etc...This film features the talents of actors such as Michael Douglas Kathleen Turner Danny DeVito Zack Norman Alfonso Arau Manuel Ojeda Holland Taylor Mary Ellen Trainor Kymberly Herrin Ted White and others. All of them are very well in their roles. It was directed by the great Robert Zemeckis who also directed Back to the Future Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Polar Express.The characters are all well developed and interesting. Jack T. Colton is a funny fortune soldier the T means trustworthy according to himself and he's greatly played by Michael Douglas. Joan Wilder is the romance novelist of the story very well portrayed by a beautiful Kathleen Turner. Zolo is a very dangerous and persistent villain well played by Manuel Ojeda. Ira is obsessed by crocodiles and often says Look at those snappers  he's portrayed by Zack Norman. Ralph is a funny very tense nervous and stressful villain comically played by Danny DeVito. But despite being villains both Ralph and Ira fear Zolo and his men because they know how dangerous they are. Juan is a very humorous character beautifully portrayed by Alfonso Arau.The movie contains some swear language but with moderation. They don't overdo it so this detail doesn't ruin a movie with little to be improved for me. This movie also contains some cool Spanish lines. The emerald called El Corzon is a gorgeous precious stone! Romeo Joan Wilder's cat is beautiful adorable and fluffy. I wouldn't mind to have a cat like him and Romeo is a cute name for a cat.As a fan of cars I also have a word to say about some of the cars used in this film. The Ford Bronco is the offroad vehicle that really shines here. It is a bulletproof pickup offroad vehicle baptized as Pepe the little mule by its owner Juan. That is a fabulous car! Wow! That is war material. It's also delightful to see the legendary Renault 4L also known as quatrelle but internationally known as simply the Renault 4. The Renault 4 is one of the best cars in the world. It has charming lines a bulletproof reliability and is an indestructible and very robust car. There's also a Shelby Cobra replica in this film a fantastic and charismatic car driven by a boy who looks like Joaquin Garay III but I don't know for sure if that's him.Romancing The Stone is one of the best movie choices to watch on a Saturday afternoon. It is without a doubt one of the best films of the year 1984. Eddy Grant's song Romancing the Stone is great why wasn't it included in the film?This should definitely be on Top 250.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Zemeckis serves up an enjoyable if derivative South American adventure with Romancing The Stone. The main positive to emerge from the film is the onscreen chemistry between stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. They remind one of the oldfashioned tradition of a hero and heroine who bicker their way through an entire movie while we in the audience know that secretly they're in love with each other. Perhaps the main drawback with the film is the curiously bloodthirsty climax which seems out of keeping with the oldfashioned tone established in the rest of the film.Shy lady novelist Joan Wilder Kathleen Turner a hopeless romantic receives a package from Colombia. Shortly afterwards she discovers that her sister Elaine Mary Ellen Trainor has been kidnapped in Colombia and Elaine's husband has been murdered. Seems that someone is particularly keen to get hold of whatever is in the package and Joan must personally take it to South America if she wants her sister to be freed. From the minute she arrives Joan is sucked into a world of danger and sudden death. But  like a mysterious hero from one of her many novels  a handsome soldier of fortune Jack Colton Michael Douglas comes to her rescue. Later Jack and Joan discover that the package contains a treasure map showing the route to a priceless emerald. Smalltime crooks Ira Zack Norman and Ralph Danny DeVito are desperate to get hold of the treasure. But they are bungling strangers in a strange land and they have had to join forces with the ruthless guerrilla Zolo Manuel Ojeda in their hunt for the loot. After many narrow escapes Jack and Joan successfully find the emerald themselves  then make plans to save Elaine from her captors using the precious stone as bait.With its fastpaced story and entertaining action scenes there's nothing boring about Romancing The Stone. It's certainly easy viewing but beyond the polished surface sheen there's not that much to it. Diane Thomas's script is straightforward slambang stuff offering a simple premise and punctuating the story developments with action set pieces. One benefit that does emerge from having a script penned by a female is that Turner's character has a bit more substance than most screen heroines from these kinds of pictures. Douglas and Turner bounce off each other well and of the supporting characters DeVito generates some welljudged humour as a crook in over his head and Alfonso Arau puts in a brief but energetic turn as a helpful driver. The plot is never less than preposterous but this is one of those films  in a similar vein to the Indiana Jones movies  that never pretends to aspire to realism. The overthetop action and comedy is meant to do one thing and one thing only to entertain. and that's exactly what it does. Romancing The Stone is fast humorous actionpacked fun. It might be thin it might be derivative and it might climax more violently than necessary but these are minor flaws in an otherwise wellpackaged adventure romp.".

	schema:headline " fun flick. not a polished gem.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film tries to do it all adventure comedy and romance. Romancing the Stone succeeds but Crocodile Dundee and other films have done it better. Kathleen Turner stars as romance novelist Joan Wilder a city girl who unintentionally finds herself stranded in the Colombian wilderness miles away from modern communication and transportation. She encounters her opposite a rugged outdoorsy soldier of fortune named Jack. Their clashing personalities are fun to watch. Of course Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presented a similar relationship and did it better but let's give Romancing the Stone credit for doing it first by a few months. Good cast. Danny DeVito is especially entertaining. I liked how Joan's experiences transform her character. Good plot premise. But parts of the script are a bit sloppy. The story moves forward at a good pace but the progress of the story relies too often on coincidences. Imagine if you read a Superman story where every time Superman is about to catch the bad guy a piece of kryptonite falls from the sky and knocks him unconscious.I was shocked that this film was nominated for best editing. In some getaway scenes the editors apparently cut the part where the hiding party realizes that their pursuers have just arrived. The editors simply cut to the shot where the hiding party is attempting their escape. Fixing this problem would have extended the film's runtime by about 10 seconds. Also there are some goofs involving stunt doubles one of which could have been fixed by simply cutting the shot a second earlier.I was disappointed that we never learn the history of the treasure or the map. Nor do we learn how or why Elaine's husband acquired the map or why he was in Colombia in the first place.Despite its flaws this movie is fun. Check it out if you enjoy adventure flicks.".

	onyx:emotionText "This film tries to do it all adventure comedy and romance. Romancing the Stone succeeds but Crocodile Dundee and other films have done it better. Kathleen Turner stars as romance novelist Joan Wilder a city girl who unintentionally finds herself stranded in the Colombian wilderness miles away from modern communication and transportation. She encounters her opposite a rugged outdoorsy soldier of fortune named Jack. Their clashing personalities are fun to watch. Of course Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presented a similar relationship and did it better but let's give Romancing the Stone credit for doing it first by a few months. Good cast. Danny DeVito is especially entertaining. I liked how Joan's experiences transform her character. Good plot premise. But parts of the script are a bit sloppy. The story moves forward at a good pace but the progress of the story relies too often on coincidences. Imagine if you read a Superman story where every time Superman is about to catch the bad guy a piece of kryptonite falls from the sky and knocks him unconscious.I was shocked that this film was nominated for best editing. In some getaway scenes the editors apparently cut the part where the hiding party realizes that their pursuers have just arrived. The editors simply cut to the shot where the hiding party is attempting their escape. Fixing this problem would have extended the film's runtime by about 10 seconds.

But still I can positively say that adventure is something it definitely doesn't lack.There are no special effects but who cares anyway? On a movie like this special effects would have little purpose and add nothing. This film has a good plot lots of adventure and action but in a way that makes it so much fun to watch and without excessive noise action and violence although there are ultraviolent scenes. All of this in a way that only an 80's film could do. In conclusion a successful case of simplicity over complication.Alan Silvestri's soundtrack is majestic. Although very calm and relaxing it is appropriate for the movie in question. Hilariously it takes place in Colombia and yet was filmed in Mexico. I don't mind about that. The exotic settings are beautiful and inviting.Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner shine as the lead actors Jack Colton and Joan Wilder with a flawless chemistry. Danny DeVito Ralph Zack Norman Ira and Alfonso Arau Juan the bellmaker are great fun as some of the bad guys and well portrayed by the actors. When it comes to the bad guys I especially like Ira and Juan. Although a bad guy Juan suddenly becomes so sympathetic and delightful and even helps the lead characters that you have to love him to which the actor's impeccable performance is one precious help.Manuel Ojeda portrays the baddest of all the bad guys Zolo but unlike the others he ain't funny. He is a criminal of the worst species. Zolo and his army are feared even by Ralph and Ira. Nevertheless the fact that Zolo is so bad only means that the actor is good because he is quite convincing.Even the actors who play minor roles were selected by finger including the very few children seen in it such as the kid who kidnaps Elaine and drives her car.'Romancing the Stone' is a movie filled with charm. A successful combination of American charm and Latin charm. Latin not only because of where it takes place and was filmed but also because of the nationalities of certain actors and the use of some Spanish words. Robert Zemeckis directed this great movie but refused to make its followup 'The Jewel of the Nile' which stars once again Michael Douglas Kathleen Turner Danny DeVito and Holland Taylor. Much against Douglas's and Turner's will.Title in Portugal 'Em Busca da Esmeralda Perdida'.".

It's about a lonely but beautiful romance novelist who must return a treasure map to Columbia in exchange for her sister's safety. Her sister's husband had been murdered and she kidnapped over a map which leads to a priceless stone. Joan WilderTurnerflies to Columbia is sent towards the wrong direction by a violent revolutionary ZoloManuel Ojeda where she meets up with a rugged loner Jack T ColtonDouglaswhen the bus she was riding crashes into his jeep. On foot fleeing Zolo's soldiers Jack and Joan must evade death or capture in order to save Elaine's life. Elaine Joan's sister is played by director Zemekis' thenwife Mary Ellen Trainor. Also in pursuit of the map is the kidnapper's cousin RalphDanny DeVito an inspired bit of casting. Plus Jack and Joan make the decision to seek out the priceless stone using is as a bargaining chip..or so they plan but of course other factors prevent this from going as smoothly as they'd like.Essentially the movie is about two people falling hard for each other as they move through Columbian jungles fleeing gunfire and certain death. It's fluff really an exciting way to spend 90 minutes. It's no wonder the movie was a blockbuster because the leads all turn in entertaining performances and there's plenty of stunts and nicely orchestrated action sequences..such as a rope swing from one side of a mountain to another a lengthly mud slide and a jump from a vehicle into a river. Romancing the Stone is popcorn fodder that goes down nicely and doesn't hurt. This was a wonderful period for Kathleen Turner she was sexy and had a presence many actresses could die for. I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with her while watching this movie. Douglas is rarely as likable as he is here.".

I was only in high school but I really enjoyed the set up and the execution of this smart 'JungleLove' story. The real test is how does it do over time and watching it 21 years later it still holds itself in a practically perfect place. I know it was eightyfour then but it just still plays out well everything is still as it should be. It is amazing that the original role of the male lead was offered to Christopher Reeves Superman that would have been a whole different Jack Colten character no doubt about it in my mind.Two convincing actors and a right on supporting cast a location that is very odd for a romance to take place however it takes shape along the way. You understand the story as it unfolds and does it very well! The acting was vaudevillian at times and very 'festive' at other times and made for an interesting combination. The 'adversarial' Ira and Devito's Character 'Ralph' was quite a surprisingly wise choice as an assistant Villain. For as much suspense filled activity really great performance and dialog between the characters in this first a second installment was made as a continuation of the story. This was 'The Jewel Of The Nile'. Now this with a few great scenes setup shots framed really 'smart' and the 'Jewel' his performance in the movie that was sort of a heartwarming attribute beside that what cooled it for me was taking a natural order of people and inserting Americanpop music into their midst and trying to make as if it was all just happening that way. I didn't understand that. It may be small to someone else but to me it is an authenticating problem. There was a change of directors for 'Jewel' as well and just a bit too much hustle and bustle just kind of going through one tribe and nationality to another then a 'scenery' change at one point that if it was the same country and area they were filming in it didn't seem like it was the same area once the change of camera shots had happened. It ended the saga and connected the story but I am quite satisfied with the original storyline and Zemekis's Directing. ".

I've seen it a hundred times and still laugh out loud! Robert Zemeckis must be credited with keeping this film going at an incredible pace pushing all the right buttons knowing what the audience wants and obviously gaining much influence from Spielberg.

	schema:headline " One of my favorites";
	schema:reviewBody "Looking back at the early 1980's it seemed almost like a minigolden age for movies. Romancing the Stone was one of those gems to come out of that period. As an actioncomedyromance it struck gold in a market hungry at the time for Indiana Jones type adventures and succeeded by delivering nonstop fourteen carat entertainment from start to finish.OK enough with the precious stone analogies  Seriously more than anything this movie is just plain FUN. Kathleen Turner is Joan Wilder a New York romance novelist and indoor girl who writes about adventures she can only dream of having. But then when her sister suddenly winds up in some big trouble down in Columbia SA and needs to be rescued she is reluctantly thrust headlong into her own adventure tale. Naturally the adventure involves a hidden treasure and a love interest along the way as well as some people that are about as evil as they got back in 1980's Hollywood. So right off the bat there is action mystery and suspense. First Joan finds herself in the possession of a strange package the contents of which will be the source of all her troubles down the road. Then her sister calls frantically from a distant phone in far off Columbia demanding that Joan deliver that package to her or she may lose her life. Finally a mysterious man shows up at Joan's apartment door and shoots a witness in cold blood. All of this takes place in New York and it's only the beginning. Soon enough the action shifts to Columbia.Once in South America Joan's adventure really takes off and so did mine. In fact I fell in love with this movie while watching the bus she had mistakenly gotten on climb a lush tropical mountain road the morning after her arrival. You could feel the tension now and also a sense of foreboding. Joan is now terrifyingly alone in an unfriendly exotic land and already she is being pursued by dark forces. Not only that she is on the wrong bus headed for nowhere! So clearly she is in need of a hero when all of a sudden in one of Hollywood's most memorable entrances Jack T. Colson Michael Douglas arrives to help our damsel in distress. Well perhaps somewhat reluctantly at first though... Anyway I can't give it all away. But suffice it to say the two proceed to team up and then fall in love while evading their pursuers at every turn. The action meanwhile is often funny. It is also often beautifully photographed against a backdrop of South American uplands. And it is often poignant. You see Jack is kind of a macho guy and is completely at home in the bush but otherwise he's a nobody. While Joan is.....well pretty green as a bushwacker but a really big deal as a romance novelist especially in South America. So all of this makes for some incredibly funny moments as well as fodder for an unlikely romance. And little Danny Devito who lurks in the wings when he's not falling off of counter tops is everyone's favorite bad guy especially when stacked up against the sadistic Zolo. Backed by an ingenious score that used electronic drums for the first time in movie history the magical scenery and the sometimes funny sometimes harrowing action the viewer is kept entranced for the next hour or so of screen time. Meanwhile Jack fumes then gets upstaged then ultimately falls in love under a canopy of fireworks. Oh yeah and what about that treasure hunt that has everyone good and evil scrambling up and down mountainsides? What good is a romance without a prize to cement it with or a prize to finance a honeymoon with? Jack's lonely man's dreams are about to be fulfilled.....But wait there is more. Before the honeymoon can begin the evil ones strike back and a tense grizzly climax ensues. I was a bit put off by the ending here though. Apparently some felt the need to have the most evil character severely punished at the end. Maybe he deserved it but the whole tone of the movie changed for me at this point and I was uncomfortable with that. In a way it was almost as if the film attempted to achieve not only comedic plateaus but actionviolence plateaus as well. But the result for me was a bit unsatisfying and sort of like attempting to cram intense sweetness sourness and bitterness all into one flavor. Such contrasts will inevitably repel to some extent and on the balance which one remains for you to savor?But that was a relatively minor issue for me when compared to the hugely positive affect the movie had on me overall. I think what I will savor the most from this movie was the scenery the opposites attract romance and one particularly memorable scene in a mountain village that was quite possibly the funniest to ever appear in a film of this genreJoan Wilder?.....THE Joan Wilder?? So go see Romancing the Stone if only for those reasons.  You will not be disappointed.".

Basically Joan Wilder Kathleen Turner is a romance novelist and one day receives a treasure map from his recently murdered brotherinlaw she also finds out her sister Elaine Mary Ellen Trainor and taken to Colombia and the villains she go there to exchange the map for her sister. She gets there alright but she finds herself stranded in the jungles but she finds help with soldieroffortune Jack T. Colton Michael Douglas also producing who agrees to bring her back to civilisation. Soon enough the villains start coming after them and Jack now also has to deal with that i.e. killing them and rescuing Joan. These villains include Ralph Danny DeVito and Ira Zack Norman who are determined to get that map with hardly any concern for the ransom exchange. Soon enough Joan and Jack know that if they get to the treasure on the map first the villains will have nothing to look for but Ralph is on to them with that plan. Also starring Alfonso Arau as Juan Manuel Ojeda as Zolo Holland Taylor as Gloria Eve Smith as Mrs. Irwin Joe Nesnow as Super and Jos Chvez as Santos. The action you can't take your eyes off of the stars all have their great giggly moments this is just great fun Indiana Jones eat your heart out! A sequel The Jewel of the Nile followed in 1985. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  ComedyMusical. Michael Douglas was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!".

It's a feast to see them all time will go and each one will follow a different path here they are together in their young years these legends of the film universe.I saw the movie for the first time by the end of the sixties. I was very young and I liked Polish movies very much. This one took me totally by surprise as I was expecting something different. I realized it was a movie with heroes of my generation people in their twenties now we are the babyboomers of late sixties. However the plot came to me as a nonissue. I was a fan of Polish movies and I loved the films of Wajda and Kawalerowicz. This one was not that kind. And it was directed by Wajda! Actually this movie is stamped Skolimowski! The director was indeed Wajda but he played faithfully the hand of his scriptwriter. Michael Open who reviewed the movie for IMDb says it bluntly the creative force is here Skolimowski not Wajda. Innocent Sorcerers is hundred percent New Wave and by that time I wasn't familiarized at all with this current.It looks quirky and it looks cynical because that's the way New Wave looks like. Quirky because it throws away some respected cinematic conventions and not only cinematic and cynical because it doesn't believe in the system be it political system be it any other blahblah system.I watched again Innocent Sorcerers recently on youTube. Years have passed and I saw many great movies of the New Wave. This time I understood it and I had a feeling of nostalgia just because of that. A movie made when my generation was in the twenties with heroes of that age with mentalities of that age speaking to the person I was at that age no more to the person I am now.So the movie made me a bit nostalgic. In the same time I was charmed. I had been hundred percent wrong when watching it first time. It's far from being a nonissue. This film is perfect and watching it brings something like organic satisfaction such an artwork comes as naturally as air or water.Maybe the title was translated in Romanian more appropriately than it was in English Inocentii fermecatori it could mean Innocent Charmers also Charming Innocents. Charmers is more fit than Sorcerers this movie is superbly ambiguous beginning with its title. It also is ambiguous beginning with the beginning the very first scene shows a woman passing the street and leaving behind huge posters of this movie! So is Niewinni Czarodzieje Innocent Sorcerers or Innocent Charmers whatever a movie about itself? For Krystyna Stypulkowska the female lead it was her first movie. She would play only in two more films. I looked for further information without success. Well she played here amazingly the perfect charmer who never let you tell what's behind the charm the good and the evil who never let you know where she came from and where will she go.The title of the movie comes from a masterpiece of Polish literature Dziady Forefathers'Eve the poetic drama created by Adam Mickiewicz. It's a line in the first part of Dziady that names the niewinni modzi czarodzieje innocent young charmers who wasne swe nadzieje poison their own hopes.Dziady has four parts very loosely related each one created by Mickiewicz in a different period of life. The first part follows the sentimental tribulations of a young couple confused about the path to take in their relationship the innocent charmers who burn their own hopes. But it's not only the first part love comes as an important theme in the whole poem. Dziady is about Polish ethos both individual and collective. Giving and returning love is viewed by Mickiewicz as essential for the salvation of that ethos individual and national. While keeping on the innocent charm level will poison hope and ultimately life personal life and national life.Coming back to the movie there is a scene by the end in which the main hero asks someone on the street what is over Faith and Hope. Love comes the answer. It's a quote from I Corinthians 13 and it gives us the clue this movie is a replica to the first part of Dziady played in our epoch. The innocent young charmers must recognize and assume their love to not burn hope.The movie was made in 1960. In 1968 Dziady will come once again in the picture a representation of the poem will be forbidden which will bring the Polish students on the streets against the Communist regime.".

	schema:headline " Great film on several levels...";
	schema:reviewBody "What a great film!!! A true sleeper! Foremost I think this film works on a comedic level mainly because Matthau and Williams play off each other so well. Williams plays his comedy in that typically frenzied style of his injecting a good dose of physical humor to bootpardon the pun. Matthau plays more of a straight man but with his own style of deadpan humor figured in. Vigard's daughter character has her moments as well her facial expressionsespecially during the staircase scene are very funny.This film also works as a commentary on the early Eighties scene touching upon a number of issues faced by American society. This is the real reason why I believe this film is such a great movie it gives a funny glimpse at what was happening in America on many different fronts. It covers topics such as losing your job job hunting and that interesting socialeconomic phenomena unemployment compensation. It sheds light upon big corporate America's lack of allegiance towards its employees a concept that was just beginning to take hold of the employment scene at the time. I'm sure that just about everyonein middle class America at least can relate to what Matthau's character experiences in the job montage sequence in the film. It also shows examples of the ever changing face of American society such as the Spanish immigrant trying to collect unemployment and the Indian clerk Matthau encounters upon his application for unemployment touching an issue that has gained tremendous momentum at the present day. It also covers the concept of Americans becoming so disenfranchised with their own society that they are driven to paramilitary lifestyles which William's character explores through several really funny momentsyou shot my gun!!. It also examines America's never ending fascination with guns.The film also covers ground on relationshipsas all good films do mainly between the two main characters and the ways they try to help each other through their personal woes. Matthau helps Williams on a more direct level but Williams helps Matthau's character in the sense that his antics help to distract Matthau from his own unemployment dilemma. Also covered to a lesser degree is the relationship between Williams and his fiance which underlines the balance between devotion and sensibility. The scene between Reed's character and his wife is both funny and insightful as well.Finally the film's comedy itself is a very good blend of slapstick that will make you howlthe staircase scene!! as well as the verbal aspects of well written comedypolice stationphone booth to name a few. Matthau and Williams are constantly playing off each other quite humorously. This film has several catchy lines I find myself and my brother recalling them from time to time for a really good laughTell young Kojack what he done and ...you've got the technique down. So these are the reasons why I believe this film deserves a good look it provides a rather serious look at American done in a very funny way. 1010".

Walter Matthau is excellent as Williams' straight man in this movie that precedes Falling Down by about a decade. Where the main character in Falling Down makes us feel sorry for him because of his misfortune The Survivors namely Robin Williams and Walter Matthau as Soony Paluso doesn't get our sympathy because we know they're going to get through their trials as they have good humor and good friendship. The movie deals with real issues like unemployment and a failing economy. There is even a subplot that involves a militia movement that feeds on the fears that Donald Quinelle is experiencing. It is all done in fun as Donald and Sonny run from the bad guy Jerry Reed who is not the hit man he makes himself out to be.I saw this movie when it was originally released in '83 with some friends of mine and now 22 years later we still quote this movie. It is definitely a hidden treasure and why it didn't get great reviews is a mystery to me. There is one scene that may have been a detriment to the success of this film although I cannot imagine why...In the first actWhen Donald is in his hospital bed and gown recovering from the robber's gunshot wound there is a brief instant when he is watching the news editorial on the hospital TV regarding his own dumbluck he turns his backside toward the television and shows his backside to the TV. We don't see his bare backside however as he returns to his original position in the hospital bed Donald reveals a little more of himself under his hospital gown than we bargain for. I think that one got by the editor but the sack is there for all to see. Not a big deal but should have been caught by someone other than us the audience. I highly recommend renting The Survivors.

	schema:headline " Smoking trees satire and early political correctness";
	schema:reviewBody "When this 1983 Columbia comedy was made American society was in a place of flux with an uneasiness and uncertainty about life and the future. The Cold War was old and wearing. The sexual revolution of the 1960s had since passed into history but its tentacles were everywhere in society. Secularism was just becoming vogue in society if not yet in conversation. And political correctness was about to emerge. There seemed to be a malaise over what comes next. I thought about that malaise when reading the comments about this movie. Few others saw the satire or could appreciate the farce. Some thought it was just a funny movie. This film pokes fun at many of the social conditions of the time. It breaks ground on social commentary that was beginning to emerge as critique of some of the foibles of the American system and society. Some of those things in years ahead would become more agitating. We didn't know it then but we do now looking back. So I'm somewhat surprised that so few people who have commented on The Survivors could see how it spoofed so much of what was going on and emerging. Much of the movie is devoted to the survivalist training and escapism by Robin Williams as Donald Quinelle. Closely connected to that is the effort of Walter Matthau's Sonny Paluso to keep from getting killed by a criminal Jack Locke played by Jerry Reed. But feeding both of these subplots within this film are many nuances of things that don't seem right about society. Williams Matthau and Reed all play their parts well as do a few people in the supporting cast. The film has a good share of antics especially by Donald. And the screenplay is filled with witty farcical and outrageous lines. These and some of the early situations leading up to the survivalist confrontations are what build on the satire. But for some unnecessary profanity and occasional crassness I would have this movie in my library of satire films. Before I give some sample lines of the humor consider these few situations that spoof the culture of the time. After Sonny loses his gas station and is out of work he can't draw unemployment relief while he looks for work. He tells the social worker he has paid into the unemployment insurance for 15 years as an employer and asks rhetorically why he can't receive any assistance when he has lost his job? The woman says You cannot be unemployed. You were an employer.The irony and political correctness spoof are so clear in this scene. The government employee is a Hindu woman who has a red jewel bindi on her forehead. She has an accent so she is a recent immigrant. Yet she has a job and tells the nativeborn Sonny that there's no help for him. She tells him to go stand in another line but Sonny protests. He stood in line six hours just to see her and now she tells him to go stand in another line. He says You can't treat people like cattle. Oh excuse me. She glares at him and I laughed all the harder. Once more Sonny protests and she sprays mace in his face. Of course that wasn't funny.When Sonny and Donald take Jack Locke into the police station to turn him over they're told to wait in line. The police are all busy and there's a line. No one pays attention to them looks up or listens to what they have to say. It's just get in line. The survivalist stuff is a poke at that type of social craze that reared its head a couple of times in the 20th century. And Sonny's reticence to get involved or report a criminal is a jab at an attitude that was quite prominent in that time that further enabled smalltime crooks and others to get by with thievery and other crimes. There were some other satirical jabs in places i.e. Sonny's 16year old daughter watching a porn video she got from a teacher. Here are some of my favorite lines from this film. Masked Jack Locke robbing the caf S man you ain't got no money. What did they pay you in food stamps? You oughta be robbing me.Donald is lying on the floor after being shot in the arm. He's frantic.

	onyx:emotionText "When this 1983 Columbia comedy was made American society was in a place of flux with an uneasiness and uncertainty about life and the future. The Cold War was old and wearing. The sexual revolution of the 1960s had since passed into history but its tentacles were everywhere in society. Secularism was just becoming vogue in society if not yet in conversation. And political correctness was about to emerge. There seemed to be a malaise over what comes next. I thought about that malaise when reading the comments about this movie. Few others saw the satire or could appreciate the farce. Some thought it was just a funny movie. This film pokes fun at many of the social conditions of the time. It breaks ground on social commentary that was beginning to emerge as critique of some of the foibles of the American system and society. Some of those things in years ahead would become more agitating. We didn't know it then but we do now looking back. So I'm somewhat surprised that so few people who have commented on The Survivors could see how it spoofed so much of what was going on and emerging. Much of the movie is devoted to the survivalist training and escapism by Robin Williams as Donald Quinelle. Closely connected to that is the effort of Walter Matthau's Sonny Paluso to keep from getting killed by a criminal Jack Locke played by Jerry Reed. But feeding both of these subplots within this film are many nuances of things that don't seem right about society. Williams Matthau and Reed all play their parts well as do a few people in the supporting cast. The film has a good share of antics especially by Donald. And the screenplay is filled with witty farcical and outrageous lines. These and some of the early situations leading up to the survivalist confrontations are what build on the satire. But for some unnecessary profanity and occasional crassness I would have this movie in my library of satire films. Before I give some sample lines of the humor consider these few situations that spoof the culture of the time. After Sonny loses his gas station and is out of work he can't draw unemployment relief while he looks for work. He tells the social worker he has paid into the unemployment insurance for 15 years as an employer and asks rhetorically why he can't receive any assistance when he has lost his job? The woman says You cannot be unemployed. You were an employer.The irony and political correctness spoof are so clear in this scene. The government employee is a Hindu woman who has a red jewel bindi on her forehead. She has an accent so she is a recent immigrant. Yet she has a job and tells the nativeborn Sonny that there's no help for him. She tells him to go stand in another line but Sonny protests. He stood in line six hours just to see her and now she tells him to go stand in another line. He says You can't treat people like cattle. Oh excuse me. She glares at him and I laughed all the harder. Once more Sonny protests and she sprays mace in his face. Of course that wasn't funny.When Sonny and Donald take Jack Locke into the police station to turn him over they're told to wait in line. The police are all busy and there's a line. No one pays attention to them looks up or listens to what they have to say. It's just get in line. The survivalist stuff is a poke at that type of social craze that reared its head a couple of times in the 20th century. And Sonny's reticence to get involved or report a criminal is a jab at an attitude that was quite prominent in that time that further enabled smalltime crooks and others to get by with thievery and other crimes. There were some other satirical jabs in places i.e. Sonny's 16year old daughter watching a porn video she got from a teacher. Here are some of my favorite lines from this film. Masked Jack Locke robbing the caf S man you ain't got no money. What did they pay you in food stamps? You oughta be robbing me.Donald is lying on the floor after being shot in the arm. He's frantic. Sonny says You're not going to die. Donald They always say that to people who are going to die.Donald's girlfriend Doreen played by Annie McEnroe Donald I'm sure no one who matters watches the five o'clock news.Jack Locke I was raised a Southern Baptist and I place a high value on human life. 20000 minimum.Donald This will be like skiing except for the booby traps.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that many people have enjoyed The Survivors and as a huge Walter Matthau fan I sure wanted to be one of them. The Survivors is a muddled mess with script problems and most curiously problems with the casting of its leading actors Matthau and Robin Williams. Just reading that would make you thing that the casting is inspired but it ends up working against the film. Matthau and Williams have two very distinctive styles of comedy that work against each other and that aspect is clear throughout the movie. These two appear to be starring in different movies even when they are on screen together. Director Michael Ritchie appears to have let Williams and his manic sense of humor go crazy with no attempt to reel him in to a calmer level more suitable for the film. Take a look at The World According to Garp where Williams worked with the great George Roy Hill to see a restrained and terrific performance. Sure some of Williams' manic comedy sneaks through there but it was at a minimum. Here Williams is all over the map which is surprising considering director Ritchie's track record of only good movies up to this point The Candidate Smile and The Bad News Bears among others.Another problem with the film is the tone of the script. It wants to be satirical farcical and dark all at the same time. Had it stuck with just one of those tones we might have had a better movie. Perhaps a satirical look at the difficulties of big business which is suggested in a funny opening scene when Williams is fired by his boss' parrot. Or perhaps a dark comedy about two down on their luck guys who happen across a hit man trying to stay alive or even perhaps hoping to be killed as they get their lives in some sort of order. This is hinted at but the story falls flat with the casting of Jerry Reed as the hit man who turns out to be a likable guy. Reed never convinced me he was anything more then the Snowman with a gun waiting for Burt Reynolds. He always seems to be winking at himself and never comes off as menacing. And the last act of the film at the survivalist outing is so mundane and silly it doesn't even belong in this film.The Survivors could have been a really special film had director Ritchie reigned in and restrained Williams some and having the script go through major overhauls instead of looking like they shot a first draft. As it now stands there are a few laughs and it's not a total waste of time but will be a huge disappointment to fans of the lead actors.".

One scene that would be quite scary was when Jerry Reed pointed a gun at Sonny Paluso Matthauwhile he was in bed.  Nevertheless Sonny didn't seem too frightened.  One thing that was odd was at the end where Jack Donald Sonny and Sonny's daughter Candice were driving away. Apparently they had made friends with Jack.  Or do you suppose it was all a trick to turn him in?  I guess we'll never know.";

	schema:reviewBody "1979 saw the reworking of the 1922 silent horror benchmark 'Nosferatu' by famed director Werner Herzog and on the other end of scale to follow that up we see another there's a few but this was a British film adaptation inspired by John Willard's play of the 1928 silent murder mystery 'The Cat and the Canary' by kitsch softporn director Radley Metzger. I haven't seen any seen of the other versions so I don't know how close it was to them but I found this effort to be a hot and cold fable. A wonderful starstudded cast including Honor Blackman Olivia Hussey Edward Fox Carol Lynley Daniel Massey Wendy Hiller Beatrix Lehmann and delightfully riveting cameo part by Wilfrid Hyde White lend strongly to the theatrical and eccentric comic styling that Metzger opts for. The offbeat interplay and rapports between the actors were authentically drilled and sprucely delivered. The isolated mansion comes into its own with its baroque etched details that create character with its shadowy interiors creaky sounds flickering lights various rooms and secret passages. A stormy backdrop with the sidesplitting thunder was the tip of it. Materialwise it's an often told but twisted and cunning tale of mystery murder corruption greed and insanity with a wicked sense of humour underlining it. The thick script is talky with many lyrical exchanges and goes about things in a slowtempo. It takes a good hour to really kick into gear and this can make it feel a little too sluggish as some urgency and suspense could've gone done much more for the beginning setup. Nonetheless the edgy tension effectively builds and eeriness showers the air towards the latter end but it never feels like enough by the end. Steven Cagen's music score is atmospherically good the art direction is polished photography placement is crisply crafty and Metzger directs with sophistication. One thing that did strike me was how the film ends with its revelation on who's doing the murderous acts and somehow it had me thinking did this have an influence of Wes Craven's 'Scream 1996'? It's more about the way the killers in both films go about setting things in motion and then presenting themselves to their desirable object.".

There were several films in the 1970's set in the 20's 30's or 40's that suffered similar fates particularly if they had any European connections. This is not the place to discuss it but when you see this film you'll understand what I mean. And you should see this since its good but far from great.

Annabelle has a tough night ahead a killer on the loose and a greedy grouping of dubious relatives.I'll start off by saying I think it's a really great movie I prefer this to the previous version. It was produced more so as a horrorthriller then a supernatural thriller. It does have some moments of humour which work mostly coming from Paul Jones.Annabelle is set up nicely as the victim she is made sweet nice kind such a contrast to most of the others who are shown as greedy devious even murderous.

Honor Blackman too is excellent she's tough but rather creepy. Carol Lynley played the English Rose really well I had no idea she was a native New Yorker. This film was not Edward Fox's finest moment I think he's guilty of overacting somewhat he's definitely enjoying himself just a little too much.There are some excellent moments in this film some of the best ones include the disappearance of Mrs Crosbie the theft of a slumbering Annabelle's necklace and of course the finale. That torture room was a rather nasty creation although nobody lost any blood after being shot.Another good moment the attack on Susan was ruined a little as it ended in a somewhat cartoon sketch.Mrs Pleasant says to Annabelle 'The Canary in a cage almost dies of fright when the cat walks around the cage. Dies a thousand deaths although it's quite safe.' It's a great analogy for the film with the house acting as the cage and the killer the cat.Such an underrated film. 910".

And as it turns out this most recent incarnation is as fun as can be an amusing and at times pretty darn scary updating. In what is a nowclassic setup a group of relatives convenes in England at Glencliff Manor on a stormy night in 1934 to hear the reading of Cyrus West's will while outside the house an escaped homicidal maniac stalks the neighborhood. Here West's attorney Dame Wendy Hiller screens the 20yearold filmed testament of the old man Wilfrid HydeWhite whose grumpy recitation for his latterday leeches and bastards easily steals the show to a group of millionaire wannabes that includes yummy Carol Lynley lesbian cousins Honor Blackman and Olivia Hussey and American songwriter Michael Callan. Radley Metzger in his sole horror outing in a career more known for various erotic entertainments directs this film with style to spare and his screenplay is clever and at times even sparkling. Callan gets the lion's share of the script's comical oneliners and his quips regarding putting on heirs where there's a will there's a way and kissing cousins are actually very funny. But don't get me wrong despite the screenplay's cleverness this CATC does dish out the scares especially in the film's final 12 hour when that maniac who reminded me a bit of a bloodiedup Keith Richards of all people! gets into the house and things turn pretty nasty. All in all a surprisingly welldone remake. Now...when is somebody finally gonna release a Region 1 DVD of the 1939 Bob HopePaulette Goddard CATC? That's what I want to know!".

A few decent chuckles a few wonderful camera tricks but far too much chitchat and a very nasty sadistic tinge.The old dark house thriller idea is hardly given any new energy and the thunder sound effects often swamp the dialogue making some sequences a challenge to endure. I agree with other reviewers that this feels like a 70s version of the 30s with the same costumelighting ideas as many of the 70s Agatha Christie adaptations and Olivia Hussey in the cast.Wilfred Hyde White is great fun from beyond the grave and a special word for the wonderful sequence where the usually glorious but here slightly subdued Beatrix Lehmann walks behind his projection screen appears on screen then emerges from behind the other side. Also a very effective sequence where Ms Lehmann talks about her late employer with her face reflected in his photo.Far too many characters I found it hard to care about all written in very poor subCluedo dialogue. Even Honor Blackman struggles with the poor material she is given. Some sequences are frankly silly. Edward Fox leaps through a window instead of knocking on the door. After relating the saga of the escaped loony Mr Fox instructs everyone to lock up the house and hide in their rooms this comes despite his having rendered the house insecure by destroying the lounge window. There is a nasty tinge of sadistic enjoyment to the final sequences where the barking mad murderer is cornered in his lair. As much of the rest of the film tries and very occasionally succeeds in being lighthearted the unpleasant conclusion followed by a twee little happily ever after coda seems at odds with the film's intentions. Very uneven and unsure of whether to laugh or scream this really isn't very good.".

Music is by Steven Cagan and cinematography by Alex Thomson.Ah the dark house murder mystery sadly seeming now like a relic of our cinematic pasts. There are many to choose from for those of us who choose to go back in time and cosy up by a warm fire with drink in hand to involve ourselves in the standard plot formula of various folk getting bumped off by a scheming murderer during a short time period and under one roof. John Willard's The Cat and the Canary is a well mined source for such fun and fearful frolics as of the time of writing this 1979 version stands as the last attempt to transfer the play to the screen.There is nothing unduly bad about Metzger's movie it's just that it is rarely inspiring either. The cast is well assembled with one or two creaky performances aside the mystery element holds strong and period flavours are tasteful. But the mansion it's set in is too bright and unthreatening it's overtly talky as a good hour is used to set up characters and plot dynamics while there's a distinct lack of acidity in the script. Still it's never less than fun and for the innovative reading of the will segment alone this version is worth seeking out by those who decry the demise of the old dark house set mystery thriller. 610".

This one has a decent cast but rather staid direction from none other than Radley Metzger a man best known for his work in the erotic genre. Once again a bunch of kooks are assembled in a creepy old mansion for a reading of the will what follows is mildly amusing at at times just plain weird. It's also rather small scale and slow with all of the good bits packed into the second half. Wilfrid HydeWhite is a delight as the deceased host while the ensemble cast includes Honor Blackman Daniel Massey Olivia Hussey and Carol Lynley. Best of all is Edward Fox with tongue very much in cheek his entrance scene alone is a real highlight here.".

	schema:headline " I Finally Found a Copy!";
	schema:reviewBody "Boy! It took me quite some time to track down a copy of this film that I remembered seeing on HBO in the early 80's. I saw it then and remembered I rather liked the film as a smallOK not so small young man. The film is obviously a remake of a film that has been done by the same title at least twice  really three times. Paul Leni's silent masterpiece from 1927. The Bob Hope version that is easily the most fun. Those two used the same title but John Willard's play was also used in 1930's The Cat Creeps. Let us not be naive however that this is it. The Willard ply has been the basis for any and all haunted house pictures since the 1927 versionThe Old Dark House and James Whale owe it immensely. Creaky doors. Hidden panels. Masked killers. A will reading at night. A hand from a hidden panel. Eyes moving in pictures. All these and many more are due to the many versions of this wonderful play. Now I digress with a brief history of the play to say that I do not agree with those that this film the 1978 version was unnecessary and trivial. Having just watched it again I found it withstands the test of time rather well. Is it as good as the silent film or the Hope film? Probably notdefinitely not the silent but it is an enjoyable film nonetheless. The plot has been changed a bit here but the general spirit is basically the same. What I do think is that this film clearly has the best acting. We get a nice array of British acting stalwarts Dame Wendy Hiller as the lawyer Allison CrosbyIs it just me or did anyone else find her quite alluring in that welltailored business suit? I love Hiller's vocal intonations and think she is a might good actress and even though she is an Oscarwinner a generally forgotten actress. Anyway she is in top form here. Then there is Daniel Massey playing what he plays best irritating gruffy huffypuffy men. Lovely and I mean just lovely Carol Lynley. She looks like an angel in this film. She is an adequate actress as well and does a pretty good job with the comedic byplay she has with Michael Callan as the Bob Hope funny person. Callan desperately tries to be funny but mostly misfires. He is not horrible though. Honor Blackman and lovely Olivia Husseysomewhat wasted I thought play a couple in every sense of that word. Strangely I do not remember that at all in the 1927 or 1939 film versions. Spooky Beatrix Lehmann looks like she just walked out of her sarcophagus. She definitely has an air about her. Then we get Edward Fox chewing up the scenery in his small role as only he can and Wilfred HydeWhite stealing the show so to speak as the deceased who talks to his relatives contemptuously through a film. He is always wonderful. The director Radley Metzger does a good job working with his castit is actually his screenplay being used here. Metzger uses his own vision for many things in the play  I mean he changes things quite a bit but the general spirit of the Willard play remains intact. There are some very creepy scenes from Hiller's body being found to the closing one with Fox Lynley and Peter McEnery. There is also a plethora of wonderful images from the icy vault that kept the secret films in tact for twenty years to the set pieces costumes etc... Producer Richard Gordon obviously used what financial resources he had well as this film looks very stylish. It is a stylish fun film. Really its only real flaw was when it came out. Audiences were really not looking for stylish film in 1978. After all it was the dawn of the 1980's  what for me is the least stylish decade in all film history.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Cat and the Canary starts by informing us that we're at 'Glencliff Manor 1904'. There is a canary flying around in a cage outside  a black cat wandering around before long the cat has been mysteriously killed... Now the film cuts to 'Glencliff Manor  Thirty Years Later' on a dark cold  stormy English night. A car approaches the Manor as the rain lashes down it's a lawyer named Allison Crosby Wendy Hiller who knocks the door  is greeted by Glencliff Manor's long serving housekeeper Mrs Pleasant Beatrix Lehmann who says she is the first to arrive  invites her in. They both head for a room in which is a wooden coffin sized box with various bits of running machinery attached to the sides the box has been chained  padlocked shut for twenty years  only Crosby has the keys once opened they remove a smaller box inside containing some film. More guests arrive ex surgeon Dr. Harry Blythe Daniel Massey is the second a sportswoman named Susan Sillsby Honor Blackman  Cicily Young Olivia Hussey arrive together next a war hero named Charlie Wilder Peter McEnery is the fourth while an American songwriter named Paul Jones Micheal Callan is the fifth  finally a young fashion designer named Annabelle West Carol Lynley is the sixth  last to arrive. After everyone has been introduced they get down to business they are all informed that they are the last surviving relatives of Cyrus West Wilfrid Hyde White who has requested the reading of his will exactly twenty years after his death. The film that Crosby recovered earlier in the evening features footage of Cyrus as he talks his potential heirs through his will he states that only one will inherit his fortune but should that person die before the night is over or is pronounced insane then the next in line will inherit instead. Cyrus reveals that Annabel is to receive the lot everyone else are visibly disappointed  jokingly suggest that someone has a good motive for murder. Later on that night a Dr. Hendricks Edward Fox unexpectedly turns up to warn everyone that a murderer has escaped from a nearby sanatorium for the criminally insane to be careful  that no one should leave until the morning. As the night draws on sinister events start to unfold as either there is a killer running around Glencliff Manor or Annabelle is going crazy...This 1979 version of The Cat and the Canary is the sixth  to date last filmed adaptation of the play by John Willard the others are the silent The Cat and the Canary 1927 the Spanish La Voluntad del Meurto 1930 The Cat Creeps 1930 the popular The Cat and the Canary 1939 with Bob Hope  the Sweedish made for TV Katten och Kanariefageln 1961. Written  directed by Radley Metzger I thought this particular The Cat and the Canary was an OK murder mystery but ultimately nothing special. The script is simply too slow there is no foul play at all in The Cat and the Canary until well past the 50 minute point. Leading up to this the film merely sets the situation up  introduces the characters far more than is needed I was starting to become inpatient after the 30 minute mark  generally speaking the film could have done with a little less chat  few more incidents. You may figure out the killers identity you may not but I was left wondering how a character who is a complete stranger has nothing to do with anyone else  supposedly never met any of them before knew so much about their personal lives  for this reason I thought they basically stuck out like a sore thumb I'll say no more... The characters are OK  most of them have a motive for murder but the actual body count is very low just the one for most of it's run time unfortunately I really wish the filmmakers had included a couple more murders much earlier to create some tension mistrust  mystery. The Cat and the Canary has vague horror elements  overtones the old dark spooky house secret passages an escaped killer murder isolation  a constant raging thunder storm outside  while it has a nice atmosphere throughout it isn't particularly scary  I don't think Metzger intended it to be as there are no real jump out of your seat scares which seemed a bit of a wasted opportunity if you ask me. The acting is solid from all involved especially Hyde White who makes for a great grumpy old relative. Technically The Cat and the Canary is very good but I can't help thinking that the period setting didn't quite work for some reason the cinematography editing music  production design are decent enough for not to complain about anything. Overall I liked The Cat and the Canary as a one time watch  is a reasonable mystery that should have been more well mysterious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers perhaps.What I found to be quite offputting was the incestuous relationships of the cousins. All the male cousins dated Carol Lynley at one time in the past and Olivia Hussey and Honor Blackman have a homoerotic type relationship as well with Olivia playing the lipstick lesbian and Honor the butch. And no one even bats an eye about it all. Now I've never been to Britain but I can't imagine the single's pool is so dry one has to give a cousin a call.This film is a remake of an old stage play and it clearly has the stage setting one location and an assortment of characters spending the entire evening there. Descendents of Cyrus West HydeWhite gather at his estate twenty years after his death to hear his will read by none other than Mr. West himself. Cyrus recorded himself before his death so he could call all his descendants a bunch of lecherous bastardswhich he does often. One of the six relatives gathered at the house will inherit his fortune but if said individual doesn't survive the night or is deemed insane everything goes to the next in line who Cyrus will reveal in the morning.The plot thickens when a doctor from an insane asylum Fox visits warning the relatives of a homicidal maniac who believes himself a cat on the prowl. When Carol Lynley is awarded the inheritance relatives become quite charming towards her again but all could be plotting her demise. But with the maniac hiding out inside the mansion they may not have to plot too heavily for the catman may make Miss Lynley's evening her last.STORY  I fail to see why this stageplay was made for the screen as many times as it was. The entire twist ending is all but revealed when the insane asylum doctor shows up to issue his warning. He knows far too much about Cyrus' descendants than a person should. It doesn't take a seasoned mystery buff to pick up on the fact he is more than he lets on. Also the kissing cousins thing was offputting and the attempts at comedy seemed too forced. They seemed like perfect antics for Bob Hope who starred in the 1939 version and not these actors.ACTING  The acting is top notch even if the screenplay isn't. Everyone does a fine job. I thoroughly enjoyed the cameo of Wilfird HydeWhite as the eccentric Cyrus West. He belittles his relatives from beyond the grave calling them all leeches. Carol Lynley is in fine form as winner of the inheritance. Michael Callan does a good job as the only descendant of Cyrus who isn't a fixture in the papers. Wendy Hiller as Cyrus' lawyer was difficult to understand at times given her thick British accent. Olivia Hussey is marvelous as the aloof descendant who plays the doeeyed dame bit perfectly. And Peter McEnery shines as Charlie the pseudo war hero. Seems he trumped up his war record to impress ol' Cyrus.NUDITY None. There is plenty titillation however. Carol Lynley in her lowcut nighty showing off as much cleavage as modesty will allow. There is also a homoerotic lesbian scene when Honor rubs down Olivia Hussey in bed. They may not be kissing cousins but they sure are touchandrubinyournighty cousins.".

I have just watched it twice over the weekend. I am like most people who have reported on The Trap I loved it and remembered it from probably 35 years ago and always wanted to see it again. I was so glad to be able to watch it again and will definitely keep the movie.The thing that no one else has mentioned but I think I saw in the movie was how much Jean cared for his mother as he mentioned her several times often sang the song that she taught him and even from the start respected Eve as a woman. Here was a lonely Quebecois trapper with no social skills who had not been with a woman in years paid 1000 I would imagine like 500000 today for what he expected a wife would give him. He was much bigger that Eve in height and weight and could have easily overpowered her even when she held a hatchet or knife ... but he still respected her fears.I wish this movie could have continued for another half an hour so we could have seen what being together as a couple could have brought them. As far as visual effects etc. for a film made in 1966 I think it was done exceptionally well. Someone mentioned that the bad natives were portrayed by white actors and the good by real native people ... I am sure a sign of the times. I am sure I saw a cameo of Chief Dan George at the start ... I must look into this.This is the first review of a movie I have ever made ... hope it was okay.".

Reed brings a bull in the chinashop masculinity to the character Jean La Bete that at first conflicts with but then blends with the very subtle beauty and inner strength of Eve played perfectly and silently by Rita Tushingham.

The slowly changing relationship between the trapper and his mute wifeslave transfixed us in its humanity and fragility. The story centres around these two mismatched ndividuals both handicapped in their own way as they struggle to make a life together in the canadian wilderness. From initial brutality to tolerance to interdependence and finally the eventual outcome at the end. Both Reed and Tushingham give strong performances here especially Oliver. When he wasnt getting soaked he could turn out some amazing work.Sadly he is no longer with us and is no doubt propping up another bar somewhere in shakespeares heaven.He will be missed.

Surprisingly NOT overdone though it's a melodrama to beat all melodramas. Pretty neat that most of the action is centered around only two people  scenes with others in them are only at the beginning and end  and the two carry it off quite well  the action holds. Rita Tushingham did a fine job without ever saying a word. That's acting. Tough to write dialogue for Reed to get the story out  and his own back story  when the person he's talking to never speaks to move the narrative along. The scriptwriters handled it pretty well during the time they spend alone in the wild. Oliver Reed hairy and covered in skins was as masculine a hunk of man needing domestication as any young girl could ask for. Too bad he made lots of bad movie choices perhaps because that's what he was offered  being a difficult actor because he was delightfully badboy gorgeous and had incredible chemistry on camera.

The plot of sorts has Reed visiting a tradingpost after two or three winters in the wild claims the money he left with a store owner for safe keeping and is persuaded by the storeowner's wife to 'buy' the mute Tushingham she hasn't spoken since she witnessed the massacre of her family by indians as a wifecumslave for exactly the same amount of cash her husband has just handed over. From this point  about two reels in  all that is left is to show the couple growing closer until they eventually bond. That's all there is but it's more than enough and I'd happily watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost shockingly many of the reviewers here have voiced stories almost eerily similar to my own. I happened upon this movie one late night approx. 38 years ago and simply NEVER forgot it. Around 10 years ago or so I searched for and found a VHS tape of it and a couple of years ago I got a DVD of it online. This is simply one of my very most favorite movies ever. I wanted to note that as of this morning at any rate the ENTIRE film is available for streaming on you tube.I don't wish to repeat the same specific comments voiced by others but would like to focus on one particular aspect of the film its patient and tender depiction of the falling in love process itself. The lazy and impatient manner through which most modern films depict how people fall in love strains credibility and poses a real challenge to the viewer's ability to care about the supposedly deeply intense love relationship between the characters. How often do we see two characters lock eyes for a few extra moments upon meeting and voil they are committed to a passionate and lifelong love relationship ready to die for each other? All too often is my answer. In this film you believe it. Their need for each other though for perhaps somewhat different reasons is palpable and honest. Today love stories focus so much more on how characters REMAIN in love or how they overcome hurdles to their love and hardly bother to take on the challenge of making the audience believe that they ever fell in love in the first place which is for me far more interesting and apparently far more difficult to depict believably.I think of the modern films noted for their love story narratives like The Fault in Our Stars. Of course the two protagonists fell in love. They're both impossibly attractive they share this common enemy cancer and they're both incredibly clever and lovable. Even though their love was not expressed mutually until near the end really they were in love again almost from the first moment they laid eyes on each other. Far more interesting would have been a story where she and the kid who eventually lost his eyesight fell in love and the events leading up to that. But again that would have been likewise far more challenging to the author  screenwriter.But no such problem with this film. They took on this difficult challenge and succeeded in an extremely satisfying way.".

Can't wait for it to hit DVD...but with DVD coming up on 10 years maybe I'll be out of luck.Oliver Reed and Rita Tushingham are just brilliant. It is like being transported back in time. Honestly if you can see it do so. The wolf attack is scary and you never know exactly how it will end...and I'm not telling. It is a lost classic in the true terms of the words. While I have not seen it for almost 35 years it has stuck with me. It is well worth searching out but thus far I have been unsuccessful.Rita Tushingham plays her part very well and you can't help feeling like you want to protect her from 'the savage brute'.August 2016 update. Many years from first review!Still waiting for a definitive or even good DVD or hopefully BLU Ray. I bought the PAL Italian version and thought I'd share my viewsI just got it. Not great quality but if like me you want to see the movie it is all that's really out there.The Italian disc is PAL not NTSC so you need to have the equipment to play it of convert it to a playable file format. This may be the biggest hurdle for most in the US but maybe not.The Italian disk is widescreen but NOT anamorphic which makes the image low quality Its a 43 image with the center portion having the image. It does play with wide black bars on ALL sides of the image on a 169 screen. You can magnify it if your TV allows this but you get a bigger fuzzier image. Watching on an iPad works mostly because of the size and aspect ratio. On the plus side it is widescreen so you see the whole movie.Second the colors are very dull and drab. I do not recall it quite like that. The sound quality is stereo and I found sharp crisp and of good quality. It was very easy to understand the spoken word. The music and sound effects had some very nice base and complimented the movie very well. This is where the disc shines in my opinion.The movie is a TRUE classic with two of Britain's greatest stars. Rita Tushingham and Oliver Reed are great in this action adventure that has no real equal. That this movie isn't available on BluRay is almost criminal. In summary if you need to see this movie this is your only option.Pros Great sound. Widescreen. Original English soundtrack Cons Nonanamorphic picture that has a dull  drab color scheme. Sharpness lacking".

As the female star is a deaf mute there is not a lot of talking in the movie but the acting is so wonderful it is easy to understand what is happening.  It would seem to be a rough and unfair story from the viewpoint of the young woman but as the movie progresses there is a softening of the feelings of the trapper and an understanding from the young woman.  There is one scene in an Indian cemetery which is quite an eyeopener for most people brought up in a western culture.  After the first viewing I heard nothing more about this movie for 30 years then it appeared on TV one Sunday afternoon and was promptly taped by me!  The theme song actually stuck in my head all those years words and all.  This movie certainly made a big impression on me even though it was not and still is not my favorite genre.To all you movie buffs out there if you get the opportunity to see this movie DO IT!

	schema:headline " The Biggest Trap Was In The Expectation";
	schema:reviewBody "In terms of acting between the 2 leads. the acting is perfect. The very reason why I sought this film out was to see Oliver Reed and his trademark intensity and Rita Tushingham is also at her top form. That being said the blame I place of the poor aspects of this movie falls largely on the director. In terms of acting Oliver reed is SO boisterous and SO rowdy breaking into peoples houses shooting rifles off in Inn's that frankly it seems that any place of commerce would have him locked up. And the character of the woman cannot speak for some reason.... she can HEAR... which is made obvious to us in Oliver Reed's one sided dialogue. But for some reason cannot seem to speak the reason for which is never explained. However her lack of speech does pose a very interesting aspect in that she appears like the many animals Reed's character relies on for subsistence as simply THAT..... an animal. And indeed that is why Reed's character bought her as a slave and therefore knowing WHY she cannot speak would be interesting....The acting is the only meagre highlight in this film as well as the interaction between Reed and Tushingham and even that is very 1 dimensional. He is Rowdy and uncivilized she is civilized. He pressures her for sex. She abstains. In ITSELF the plot concept doesn't really pose a very interesting story. Solution?? add various irrational plot sequences to heighten the boredom RATHER than develop an intelligent and meaningful developmental relationship between these 2 main characters who now rely upon each other. First moronic plot sequence 2 WHITE natives from the village SOMEHOW track down Reed's cabin for no other reason that to kidnap the girl. They have no guns. He has a gun. BUT.. they HAPPEN to show up when she is alone after basically being abandoned by Reed in the woods. Guess who gets shot... Totally nonsensical and badly handled. Second moronic plot sequence. The wolf scene. This scene literally makes the movie a laughable excuse for what it is indeed trying to be. a movie about wilderness survival Reed is in the woods. An experienced woodsman he SOMEHOW forgets where he set his traps... and BAM... he falls prey to them... suddenly.. he is set on by a cougar... THEN he is set upon by a pack of wolves. It's not fully possible to emphasize how badly this scene is handled but 1. Wolves are not that aggressive. 2. if they attack they do not attack 1 at a time in the course of 15 minutes without end. and 3. If you fire multiple rifle shots... they will RUN.... not stay to get shot. It is also quite humorous to witness how Reed at first cannot place the slightest weight on his leg and then is kicking off wolves left and right and running completely able bodied. once again this scene sells the movie short in my view. In the end Reed must have his leg chopped off due to infection which is also ridiculous because all they would have had to do was cauterize the wound and one would assume an experienced woodsman would RATHER do that than lose his leg. But wait there's more.... Third moronic plot sequence This one has a lot to do with social etiquette of the 60's which definitely does not cohere to backwoods social etiquette of the 1800's. The entire movie Reed has been held off from having sex with the female lead possibly a 3 to 6 month period a surprising feat in itself since theoretically that would have been the only reason why he bought her as a slave in the first place. Anyhow regardless that these 2 characters have warmed to each other and have become dependant upon each other she is DEATHLY opposed to sex with him for some reason and after he finally forced himself upon her rather than being fulfilled in her love of him the next day she flees. This is a ridiculous plot point that should not have happened and very near the end of the film. she steals his boat Falls asleep gets swallowed up by the rapids and then floats ashore only to be rescued by friendly natives. What would we do without friendly natives... Before she is healed. Before she can talk. Before ANYTHING they instantaneously bring her back to the Caucasian village. This is ridiculous. Naturally they would try to heal her first before moving her and THEN ask her where she wanted to go if they were so obliging... But no.. This was simply a little trick on the part of the director to make us think she was dead.... but She's ALIVE.... and after instantly being put into a marriage at the Caucasian village she runs away back to Oliver Reed.This movie had an overall flawed and nonsensical storyline which was distracting form what this movie COULD have been a very interesting psychological study of a man and woman in the wild left to depend upon each other. But instead it falls out to cheap misused plot devices. Naturally you will ask why does this movie have such a high rating and why do I disagree. Because the acting is so fine I would say that it is the CONCEPT that appeals to people and they were willing to overlook the overall ridiculousness of the plot. The cinematography is also quite great for anyone interested in the wilderness. As to my knowledge there truly isn't any OTHER film of a man and a woman living in the wild that has quite the same angle as this film he buys her as a slave. Please view the film and think well upon my arguments against it. it was a good concept taken on by people who knew not how to properly execute it and who sold out to typical mediocre Hollywood thrills and gimmicks that were badly conceived.".

	onyx:emotionText "In terms of acting between the 2 leads. the acting is perfect. The very reason why I sought this film out was to see Oliver Reed and his trademark intensity and Rita Tushingham is also at her top form. That being said the blame I place of the poor aspects of this movie falls largely on the director. In terms of acting Oliver reed is SO boisterous and SO rowdy breaking into peoples houses shooting rifles off in Inn's that frankly it seems that any place of commerce would have him locked up. And the character of the woman cannot speak for some reason.... she can HEAR... which is made obvious to us in Oliver Reed's one sided dialogue. But for some reason cannot seem to speak the reason for which is never explained. However her lack of speech does pose a very interesting aspect in that she appears like the many animals Reed's character relies on for subsistence as simply THAT..... an animal. And indeed that is why Reed's character bought her as a slave and therefore knowing WHY she cannot speak would be interesting....The acting is the only meagre highlight in this film as well as the interaction between Reed and Tushingham and even that is very 1 dimensional. He is Rowdy and uncivilized she is civilized. He pressures her for sex. She abstains. In ITSELF the plot concept doesn't really pose a very interesting story. Solution?? add various irrational plot sequences to heighten the boredom RATHER than develop an intelligent and meaningful developmental relationship between these 2 main characters who now rely upon each other. First moronic plot sequence 2 WHITE natives from the village SOMEHOW track down Reed's cabin for no other reason that to kidnap the girl. They have no guns. He has a gun. BUT.. they HAPPEN to show up when she is alone after basically being abandoned by Reed in the woods. Guess who gets shot... Totally nonsensical and badly handled. Second moronic plot sequence. The wolf scene. This scene literally makes the movie a laughable excuse for what it is indeed trying to be. a movie about wilderness survival Reed is in the woods. An experienced woodsman he SOMEHOW forgets where he set his traps... and BAM... he falls prey to them... suddenly.. he is set on by a cougar... THEN he is set upon by a pack of wolves. It's not fully possible to emphasize how badly this scene is handled but 1. Wolves are not that aggressive. 2. if they attack they do not attack 1 at a time in the course of 15 minutes without end. and 3. If you fire multiple rifle shots... they will RUN.... not stay to get shot. It is also quite humorous to witness how Reed at first cannot place the slightest weight on his leg and then is kicking off wolves left and right and running completely able bodied. once again this scene sells the movie short in my view.

Script 6 writers couldn't put something together with a tighter script than this?????This film has a pretty low rating on IMDb and I'm not surprised. Although the concept was pretty good the execution was sloppy...just about as sloppy as the team was during the first half of the film. I had the idea throughout the film that most people involved were just going through the motions.That's not to say there aren't some good moments here. There are some good laughs. Occasionally Whoppi shines like I expected her to shine. It's all pretty good natured and some of the cameos by politicians and others are fun. Whoopi does fairly well in the lead.

Script 6 writers couldn't put something together with a tighter script than this?????This film has a pretty low rating on IMDb and I'm not surprised. Although the concept was pretty good the execution was sloppy...just about as sloppy as the team was during the first half of the film. I had the idea throughout the film that most people involved were just going through the motions.That's not to say there aren't some good moments here. There are some good laughs. Occasionally Whoppi shines like I expected her to shine. It's all pretty good natured and some of the cameos by politicians and others are fun. Whoopi does fairly well in the lead.

There fun poked at greedy players foreign imports and egotistical coaches! The film itself is about a huge fan of the New York Knicks who becomes coach of the New York Knicks by becoming close to the new owner of the Knicks Wild Bill Burgess Frank LangellaThe cameos in the film are plentiful and while MJ himself does not make an appearance it gives a funny insight into what its like to be on the court and what makes players tick. One shot of John Salley making a free throw is very striking and would send a shiver down any sports fan of any sport.Its not a blue chips type basketball film its a comedysports movie that is easy to watch and thats why i am giving it a 7!P.S look out for a rare cameo from Leroy from Fame as a dancer!".

Little known fact about Mr.Ostertag he portrayed the ghost of Christmas future in his 10th grade production of A Christmas Carol.

So he's tacky and has no regard for team tradition.  Its not a long stretch for him to arrange things to get Edwina known as Eddie to coach the team for half a game in the name of promotion.  When the current coach protests he gets fired.  So Eddie gets to be the coach full time and takes a loser team and makes them a winner..I told you it was predictable.

But in addition to believing that a fan would take on the head coach job you are also asked to believe that the owner will move the team to St. Louis IF THEY WIN..this put Eddie in an awkward situation no?Unless you never saw another movie in your life you can predict the outcome.

	schema:reviewBody "This film shows Whoopi Goldberg at her big mouth wise cracking best. The film is about a rich chairman who buys the New York Nicks and try's to turn a losing team into a freak show to make money. So he hires a big mouth fan as the head coach who he believes can't coach. The first half of the film is funniest as Whoopi Goldberg tells the Nicks coaches what she really thinks of them. Some of the misfit players are quite good to. There is a Russian who can't speak any English a great player except he won't pass the ball and a player who is more interested in his failing marriage. And let's not forget the showman owner who rides a real horse on the court wants to give the folks a good show and sees a better moneymaking opportunity once Eddie turns the team around.Sure it was kind of predictable and as many have observed it pretty much derails by the midway point. But Whoopi Goldberg as the Knicks fanturnedcoach gives a spirited touching performance. Her initial awkward moments with team members ring true enough. The ways that attempts to reach out to team members range from the plausible providing ad hoc marriage counseling to one to the highly unlikely learning enough Russian to begin to bridge the cultural and linguistic gap of a Russian born player. The contrived feelgood ending brings the film down several notches on the originality scale. But Whoopi Goldberg gives it all she's got as does the rest of the cast. They wind up giving the movie pretty much all the appeal that it's got.Overall rating 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this film but only for two specific things the acting of Masterson and Slater.  Masterson is startlingly good and Slater shows a deeper range than I previously thought.  The rest of the film though is shallow and never fully realized.  Plot elements are thin and almost unbelievable several of the supporting actors are terrible the music is trite and unoriginal the cinematography is downright boring and the dialogue falls into inanity and predictability too often.  If not for the heroic performances of the lead couple this film would be entirely forgettable.  Masterson though is truly gifted and digs deep to find the center of her character and Slater reaches a bit himself for a romantic side I've never seen.  I give it a 6 for the acting alone.".

	schema:headline " Good film if you don't dig too deep";
	schema:reviewBody "I bought this movie primarily because I am a sucker for a good love story and I also happen to love Jann Arden's Insensitive. I was quite surprised to learn who the song was directed to in the film but that's another story.On the level of light entertainment this film makes a nice viewing. But when you go below the surface there are an awful lot of problems.It's one thing to have a relatively short film 88 min. It's another to have a 3month time lapse condensed to a couple of minutes and give us no clue as to how one of the 2 characters is faring until we see the resolution. There were several times in this film when there were substantial time shifts and it was interspersed in such a manner that you tend to get thrown a bit offbalance.SPOILER Additionally this film is a bit offensive in that it uses prior child abuse merely as a plot device. It never really delves into it and keeps everything vague. Because of this Mary Stuart Masterson's character certainly comes off as alienated but only in a surface manner. One would assume that a longterm relationship might only work for her if she initiated serious therapy. This film never addresses that. If one believes that 'love conquers all' it would probably not be an issue. But that concept isn't realitybased.And there are unneccesary ambiguities in this film as well. Is the issue of Masterson falling in love being met with dissatisfaction from her boss? Has she become a better worker for not being a workaholic? These office scenes are handled very poorly and become relatively superfluous.Performancewise Christian Slater does indeed come across well as an offbeat prince charming and Pamela Segall is excellent as the best friend though she seems to be channeling Brenda Morgenstern. The biggest problem is Mary Stuart Masterson. She plays awkward and stiff well but this role could probably have been cast better. Personally I would have liked to have seen someone a bit plainer such as Janeane Garafolo in the part. It would have given Slater's motivation more depth. Could he fall in love and attempt to be a savior for a troubled woman if she wasn't especially pretty?At any rate Bed of Roses is well worth a watch. Just so long as one enjoys it for the light entertainment it is.".

His pain is easy to feel and his thoughts about the world are childlike innocent and so on target We should all go to story hour sometime! Mary Stuart Masterson is the picture of todays executive  hustling and bustling while never even giving thought to what she really wants deep inside. The two together are just the picture of how love should be. The morning after scene is something I will always wish for in life and will never achieveI honestly thought while watching this  if you could just run the credits after the morning after this would have been the perfect movie but into life a little rain must fall and so we have the second half. But even this I love because don't we all have those insecurities that cowardice hiding deep inside?? Trust me  its worth a watch  everyone I know loves it and I have to fight to get the tape back when I loan it out!!".

I loved the very basis on which the movie was based  presenting a bouquet of flowers is such a day to day affair but how beautifully this little ritual was transformed into a touching love story between two people who need soul mates. There's Lisa the busy VP of a company an orphan who has had an unhappy childhood with her foster father but whose death at the start of the movie leaves her with a deep sense of shock and loss and there's Lewis a florist living in his own floral world with a huge family but someone who is no stranger to loss himself having lost his wife. These two people from considerably different backgrounds are destined to meet and fall in love...Christian Slater's character is every girl's living dream! Lewis as a man is perfect make Chritian Slater play him and it seldom gets better than that!  This was the first movie with Mary Stuart Masterson that I saw and I was sold! The woman is excellent! I saw films like 'Fried Green Tomatoes' and 'Digging to China' later just for her! I don't agree with what one more viewer over here has written  that MSM is just not the kind of girl a guy like Christian Slater would fall for. Making Lisa too beautiful would have lessened the humanness of her character I think... Lisa that way is moderate in all ways beautiful in a class of her own not the most romantic person and with a past which makes her a trifle cautious about love since she herself has received it in grudging doses... Analysis apart see this movie for an hour and a half of unadulterated romance... With a beautiful music scoreScarlet's 'Independent love song' Sarah McLachlan's 'Ice Cream' and Michael Convertino's ethereal music! I have the OST of this film and it's one of the best I've heard! The dialogues  ..nothing like a finicky agapanthus.. ..it must have been some mistake in the floral world..  are quite witty! If not ANYthing just watch to have a peek at Lewis's dreamlike terrace garden! Sigh! If all guys had such gardens on their terraces all the girls would be bowled over like Lisa is and the ozone layer for once wouldn't be depleting!  Those are highly unromantic thoughts to occur while writing about love and romance in full bloom pun intended..! But all said and done this film is definitely for the romantic at heart! Those who're not are perhaps likely to dismiss it as rosy mush! I liked it because the film had substance. 'Bed of Roses' wouldn't fall into the Romantic Comedy genre 'cos a comedy it certainly isn't. And thank god for that! There are unfortunately very few romcoms that are mercifully devoid of the same formulaic dialogue contrived plotsettings and characters...in fact most are disappointingly mediocre'Notting Hill' is one classic example... 'Bed of Roses' is just a romantic movie  it doesn't have comedy elements that are inserted in films more often as ploys to rope in a wider audience than for the need of them in the story per se...anyone who dismisses 'Bed of Roses' because of its lack of comedy or because they think it's a chickflick  too bad! You're missing out on a good film!".

It also calls out CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are! From what I've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant selfpity. The mood of the movie is distinctly 80ish brooding and slow. Don't get me wrong the film has its moments just very few of them.".

It also calls out CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before making the movie? Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are! From what I've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant selfpity. The mood of the movie is distinctly 80ish brooding and slow. Don't get me wrong the film has its moments just very few of them.";

Nor is it a tearjerker designed to appeal to our emotions so that at the end we feel sad our hearts aching for two people who can never be together.Rather it's a drama without the tragedy A reminder that good things CAN happen to in this world while at the same time keeping human frailty in mind.It's a warm soothing madly romantic movie designed to make us feel comforted rather than exhilarated and lovely in the soft glow it projects.In an era where illness and insanity prevail it's nice to see movie a like this.You can inhale it's fragrance like a gorgeous flower arrangement.Originally Review 31Posted OnSeptember 30 2009.".

Provided there is something about the romantic story which is as intelligent and beguiling as this story is.The performances of Mary Stuart Masterson and Christian Slater are master studies in delicacy and hesitancy arising out of their characters' tragic backstories and the exigencies of the romantic plot generated by their lonely background. This is the dance of love at its most delicate hesitant subtle and intricate. The whole film is shot through with a Ravelian delicacy of music and mood and indeed the music of Michael Convertino along with some well chosen ballads is a major reason for the film's delicate beauty and atmosphere superbly combined with the excellent photography. New York has never looked so much like a city for lovers! Pamela Adlon's character is so interesting and attractive in herself that it is a crying shame she was not given her own film with her own fine romance.The story and characterisation has been more than adequately conveyed in the reviews to date. I would simply like to emphasise that the romance is sweet without being sickly particularly because of the edginess to the story at times which counterpoints the lyrical moments. With performance script music and photography in perfect sync this is a film whose afterglow lingers long in the memory of your true romantic. A minor masterpiece. Would there were more like it.".

I never believed it although he did have several good roles in such pics. But quirky and creepy don't play well for long.So I was a little surprised to find myself watching this film...and liking it. Although it took a while. The first third of the film sort of meanders along with a slightly creepy Slater romancing a workaholic loner of a girl Mary Stuart Masterson. I began to wonder if this film was going anywhere interesting...you can look at just so many flowers being delivered. Then they begin living together and she is invited to his family's home for Christmas. Can she do it? No. Christmas is a disaster. The romance is off. They go their separate ways. Will they get back together? I could see an ending where she wants to but he is already with someone new and she realizes that once again she has lost happiness. Or I could see the happy ending we expect.I thought Masterson was downright superb in her role. And Mr. Slater surprised me as well. In fact the final scene  where she expresses her need and he appears to think no not again  as fine a piece of acting as you're likely to see in a romantic film.Pamela Adlon is excellent here as the best friend. On the other hand Josh Brolin has a prettymuchnothing role as a sort of boyfriend of Masterson.So this was a much better film than I expected at least after the first third.

But it turned out to be quite different than all the other movies at the same time. Actually I think the storyline is really boring. It's just not complete. They both have difficult backgrounds but those story's are just 'put in to the movie' without expanding them. It's like pieces of a puzzle which are put in the right order but they're not actually put together.So its kind of a boring story but it really intrigued me at the same time. I think it's because of the actors like people in other reviews have said. They make the boring characters alive. And maybe it's because they talk really little in my opinion.

Also walking past your house at nice is a bit out of order. In this day and age he would have probably been arrested or served with a restraining order. Christian is so sweet as Lewis the Florist that you could forgive him anything. This is a totally lovely and feel good film and the ending is just how you wish your life could be.".

The effects are good though. I was disappointed in the writing. Akiva Goldsman is a respected writer with talent. For a bad script all the actors did a good job. The music is pretty good.

The cast is good for the most part and I love the visual FX.However once the Jupiter 2 crashes on the planet and we get caught up in the time travel older Will Robinson bit that's when the movie falls apart completely.   And the biggest mistake of all is that the older Will Robinson is not played by original Will Robinson Bill Mumy even though he badly wanted to play the part.  Having listened to the comments of the director on why he didn't cast Mumy on the DVD I have to say his explanation doesn't wash.  Especially when both he and the scriptwriter concede that the device of using the older Will Robinson didn't work on the screen as it did in writing.   It never occurs to them that maybe the scene would have worked if this new character sprung on us was someone with a definable connection to the old show.".

This movie starts off with a bang and ends with a whimper. The problem? Well it is not the terrific cast. Hurt Rogers and Oldman are wonderful in their respective roles while Graham and LaBlanc delight the audience with their wit and charm as the couple who provide the movie's romantic elements. All other cast members are quite fine as well. The production looks nice too with great costumes sets and special effects. So that leaves the uneven script. It starts off well with a quick look at the Robinsons' quest and the plotting of Dr. Smith. There are even some great lines such as the one Maureen hurls at John and Mark as they are sparring. If you guys are done hosing down the deck with testosterone... had me laughing heartily. But it all just fizzles somewhere in the middle and ends up being utter nonsense a plot without a cause. What a shame. Those of us who loved the sixties television series deserved better. If you are partial to any of the cast members from Hurt to Graham to Oldman do make time for this film someday.

Then the show progress into one that centered around three characters that of Will Robinson Dr. Smith and the Robot. Mr. And Mrs. Robinson Major West and the girls were just so much window dressing and fodder. This is what the director of the movie Lost In Space had to work with. Either he kept as close to the original show as he could or he struck out in a totally different direction such as what happen when they made Wanted Dead Or Alive for the big screen. It's not high drama but then neither was the original show. Comparing it to the TV show I believe that the director keep to the same spirit and I say it's not a bad rendering.".

Time is spinning away even while you read this!  Get off the web!  Go outside!  Breathe the air!  Bite the ass of life!  And don't watch this movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I would like to address fans of the TV show who hate this film. I am always shocked how many people feel that this film was unfaithful to the original series. I would invite you to go back and watch the very early episodes of the series before it became a campedup disaster admit it! and see how similar the two are.The 1998 film is often a straight remake of the original only frankly much better.The idea of a film about a single family trying to survive and function by itself when they are all alone in outer space is loaded with potential and I think this film did as much as could be expected in what was planned to be a threemovie series.There's a lot to like in this moviefirst of all it's a science fiction movie that the whole family can actually enjoy not just the twentyyearold son living in the basement. The special effects were very impressive for the day and some of them hold up very well. There's a kickass end credit sequence how often do I get to say that? featuring a new version of the classic Lost in Space theme song. There's some exciting action scenes good performances by the adult leads cool production design some genuinely touching moments and two notoverlycute performances by a child actors which is extremely rare. Penny is actually something resembling a real character this time around. Also the fact that the queenish goofy Dr. Smith actually becomes a threatening and very creepy villain by the end of the film is no small feat.The story is sometimes episodic but all comes together very well. Small details become important plot points later in the film in surprising ways.Now there are some down sides. The script is by Akiva Goldsman best known for his Oscarwinning screenplay for A Beautiful Mind. However comic book fans will always remember him as a boogeyman who concoted the script for Joel Schumacher's infamous film Batman and Robin. This script is somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. Although it is very clever at times and manages to incorporate favorite bits from the series some of the dialogue will definitely remind the viewer of Arnold Schwartzennager's infamous Ice puns from Batman and Robin and will definitely make the eyes roll. Matt Leblanc is stuck with most of this. Akiva Goldsman has always written terrible shameless buzz dialogue quips where a character tries to say something clever and cool. It's painful at times. Gary Oldman also has a few of his own in which he actually has to refer to himself as evil. Seriously what villain actually knows that they are evil? Despite some clich moments which can easily be forgiven by young members of the audience a large chunk Lost in Space is an aboveaverage adventure movie. It's exciting occasionally funny and has likable characters. I only wish the sequel materialized I think it only could have gotten better.".

As a teenage boy back then I also registered the attractive mother Robinson and even more so the disturbingly beautiful elder daughter Robinson I have heard that I am not alone in this.The film goes to great efforts to reverse all those impressions! It starts by throwing some of the most mindblowing space battle special effects I have seen the producers are obviously guys who have learned their lessons from 2001 Space Odyssey and Star Wars and who have all the computing power they need. Silicon Graphics is a computer manufacturer who gets its name into the script go figure.Is this the point to carp at the unreality of the sounds made in space where you really can't hear any whoosh or boom as things explode or at the fighters that manoeuvre in 3D aim weapons and even nudge one another all by manual pilot control ? Nah that's an accepted style these days so let it pass.The puerile homophobic dialog between the pilots after their fighters contact in flight Does that mean we are going steady together now? I chose to forgive in view of the magnificent graphics but unfortunately such lines come back again and again in the miscast tryingtobe macho Major Don West's Matt LeBlanc passes at the coldfish elder Robinson daughter Judy Heather Graham.Sadly it quickly becomes evident that Major Don's pursuit of Judy is to be a running subtheme through the movie. I say sadly because this is not Hepburn and Bogart nor a school prom Bmovie and the characterisation neither serves the movie nor the viewer. Don to Judy I'll be happy to let you investigate my dimensions  oh puhlease! There simply is no chemistry between these two and their lines are a yawn because we don't need them to romance in this movie.I said that the producers make great efforts and those on space graphics are successful. Other efforts are on the family relationships so much so that I became convinced that Walt Disney scriptwriters must have been involved. The younger Robinson children characters work well I liked the sulky rebellious teenage daughter Penny Lacey Chabert though the dramatic device of her wristworn video diary was strained and I was rooting for the son Will Jack Johnson who nearly makes a time machine for a school project and repeatedly saves the day by tinkering with or remotecontrolling the robot who has grown from the capable but relayfilled Robbie of the TV series adopted from the precomputing Forbidden Planet movie of 1956 into a mightier cargohandling monster a RamblerCrane model we are told that owes much to its brother that Sigourney Weaver drives in the second Aliens movie I saw. This Robbie is bigger but less interesting for all its weaponry by this time we have a right to expect more from a robot than this one delivers.Unfortunately the movie's main familial theme of How Can Father Robinson Show That He Really Loves His Son Will left me cold though it may go down well with a certain kind of American audience. This is worse than just a failed theme it is supposed to motivate the final denouement that I can't spoil for you because I still don't understand it! Suffice to say that it involves time travel more by machinus ex deia than deus ex machina with by now rather overloaded special effects that serve to gloss over with thunderlightningearthquakes such paradoxes as persons meeting their timetravelled selves that obscuration also having become a Hollywood cliche since movies like Philadelphia Experiment and Final Countdown. A shame because intelligent timetravel themes have provided and will continue to provide some wonderful movie scripts.The whole movie is like the Robinsons' spaceship a concatenation of expensive items that are individually impressive and collectively ineffective. Not to be outdone are the horrid space spiders. These seem to be downplayed to limit their horror potential I think we get just a tiny glimpse of blue ? gore as a spider leg gets chopped. We think the Robinsons escape from the spiders but in true Hollywood horror tradition we were only supposed to think that and one spider makes a surprising return in the denouement and I can't explain that either. It is actually very strange to see a thing that seems to have strayed into the movie from another film set The Fly ? The Seventh Seal ? too late in the script to be meaningful in the plot and apparently also with its horror potential kept down I suppose to keep a juvenile audience rating.Yet another yawn item to mention in the movie is a computer generated monkey Blarp that is a baby she we are told perhaps because a shechimp is less demanding to model ?. For all her blinky cartoon eyes Blarp fails to impress me as cute or useful and she also seems like a character that strayed in by mistake from another movie.After watching all the movie action I feel I was served an assembly of highly crafted but utterly unoriginal elements. Yet for the earlier space graphics which nearly rate up there with those in Starship Troopers I can allow the rest as entertainment.Can you believe that the end credits really spoiled the film for me? I don't think I am peculiarly sensitive about end credits and I am as likely as anyone to leave the movie theater as soon as they start scrolling. But in this movie the end credits are used as an opportunity to dump a lot of inappropriate music and silly graphical effects to no good purpose. In the light of some truly fine craftsmanship and set design that went into this movie that ending was a cheapening that was almost insulting.".

Unlike this year's other movie based on a cultural icon namely Godzilla the producers of Lost In Space have a great deal of respect for the original tv series and this shows in the finished product. They have been able to update the story and characters even changing the tenor of the story from farce to serious drama without losing any of appeal of the original. The inclusion of June Lockhart Marta Kristen Angela Cartwright and Mark Goddard in cameos and minor parts adequately demostrates the respect the production team has for the fans of the original series which helps immensely in this adaptation. This is something that Mssrs. Devlin  Emmerich need to learn before unleashing any more destruction of cultural icons as they did this summer.All in all the movie is great family adventure entertainment. The story is simple enough told in a caring way and is suitable for all ages. The acting well done the writing  direction good and the visual effects rank amongst some of the best ever committed to celluloid.Definitely one of my favorites and quite possibly one of the best science fiction films of all times.

Two actual good actors Gary Oldman and William Hurt are trapped in this atrociously written badly directed waste of 80 million. Whether or not you liked the cheesy 60s TV series you're going to hate this.Alright this is how it goes it's the future and there's pollution world peace ugh! and terrorists. The Robinson family is going to fly through a hyperspaceportal or whatever the hell they call it to a planet on the other side of the galaxy to colonize it and save humanity. Hurt playing a respected scientist with no time for his kids says at a press conference there's a lot of space out there to get lost in ugh!. Matt LeBanc from Friends is horribly miscast as the flying ace who will pilot the Robinson's earthsaving space ship. Then we come to the children... but we wish we hadn't. The little boy is a sciencefair genius who wishes his dad had more time for him and the girl is a teenage stereotype who argues with her mother and keeps a video diary. They both have very high annoying voices and the lines they deliver are terrible on top of that. Then comes the mother. I don't know who played her and I don't want to know. They all live in a futuristic house in a futuristic CGI geodesic dome ugh!. Except for family tensions I don't want to give up the next ten years of my life the mission appears to be a shoein.Then we meet Gary Oldman the 1998 version of Dr. Smith. He would have been a terrific character if his lines weren't so terrible I think Akiva Goldsman was trying for Shakespearian. Anyway he's evil and loves it and works for the terrorists. He sabotages to mission getting himself trapped on the ship in the process and getting the Robinsons lost you know where.Along the way we see thoroughly unconvincing CGI used for just about everything including an annoying monkeycreature that's supposed to be cute. The costumes which director Hopkins had a hand in designing are really terrible glossybodymold stuff think BATMAN AND ROBIN for comparison which basically gives everybody even the kids well defined ahem! features. Even the music is bad and horribly arranged. And the end titles go above and beyond tacky being half musicvideo including a rappedover version of the original theme and soundbites from the film. And then there's the robot which the son makes friends with and teaches that it has a heart ugh!.The script and direction are still probably the worst atrocities in LOSTIN SPACE. One of the more embarrassing bits has LeBlanc explaining to Heather Graham to whom he is pathetically attracted the concept of constellations and draws Porky Pig on a window. Even during intimate dialogue scenes none of our actors seem sincere or even to be speaking to one another. These characters don't even talk like human beings.It's hard to believe the studio didn't just put this one on the shelf and leave it there. In the end LOST IN SPACE didn't even make enough money to justify its release. The world really would be a better place without this movie.".

The movie Smith is dark dangerous and potentially fatal.There are plot elements introduced which are fun and in some respects original.

What the movie has going against it is generally everything else. The cast is thoroughly unconvincing even William Hurt and Gary Oldman a good portion of the special effects are secondrate and the subplot involving time rips and time bubbles feels tackedon and pointless.

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the successful '60's television show really is a waste of some good potential. It by no means is an horrible movie but the script isn't really interesting or spectacular and the character treatment is quite poor.In a way this movie is a mixed bag. On the one hand it has some good actors in it and some of the special effects are really good but than again on the other hand the story is pretty shallow the costumes are embarrassingly dreadful and some of the special effects are below average at best. Sounds weird a movie that has both good and bad special effects in it. It's a bit weird it's like they spend most of the time on the big special effects shots and after that they raffled the rest of the special effects. At times the movie is impressive to watch and at other moments it's just laughable bad to look at. Such as the CG character Blarp. He or she? looked absolutely dreadful and it made the movie even more ridiculous and bad to watch. But perhaps worst thing about the entire character is that it's a totally completely unnecessary one that doesn't add anything to the story at all.The movie has a solid cast. John Hurt certainly adds some believability to the silly moments in the movie and he deliverers some of the bad dialog good and even credible. Gary Oldman is of course also a great actor but he plays a bit of an uninteresting villain in this movie that doesn't get enough opportunity to shine. Matt LeBlanc is most of the time convincing in his role but he at times deliver some cheesy dialog which doesn't always make him believable as a tough space pilot. Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham also walk around in the movie but they get very little interesting to do. Good in her role was also Lacey Chabert. She's a good young actress never really understood why she didn't appeared in more mainstream big Hollywood productions. She's an actress with great potential but somehow Hollywood never really picked this up. Maybe it has something to do with the failure of this movie?Because yes this movie is a bit of a failure. Not only in terms of how well it did at the box office and how well it was received by the crowd and critics but also certainly in terms of how the movie is constructed. The script is just disappointingly shallow and has some totally unlikely and unbelievable events in it that at times don't even make sense. The story also uses too many elements from the first Star Wars trilogy and even a little bit from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It doesn't only uses story elements from that movies it also rips off the looks of some of the spaceships planets and city skylights. No Lost in Space certainly isn't the most original sciencefiction movie ever made.The movie also lacks some good tension and action sequences. There are too many slow moments in the movie in which totally nothing happens. It's OK to have some slower moments in a movie but only when the script and characters are good and interesting enough to carry those slower moments. In this movie that really isn't the case.This movie is not a complete disaster and the 4.6 rating here at the moment might be a bit too harsh. The movie does provide some good and entertaining moments. But if only the movie had a better and more original script than this movie perhaps would had been a bigger success and certainly a better one to watch.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

The son Will Robinson whose genius for gadgetry is forever overshadowed by the fact that .. sob whine his Dad doesn't pay enough attention to him ends up as an evil genius as an adult who is willing to risk blowing up the world so that he can be sob whine back together with his family and maybe his dad will love him finally You said you would come back.... and you didn't! Heather Graham as the female nerd scientist gorgeous as they come but you knew it... unable to connect with her emotional side until won over by the hunk pilot. etc. etc. And my goodness how many times can you go actually through the center of a planet and miraculously survive? The answer if you haven't seen the film is more than once. I could go through the list but you all know these themes already. I felt bad for such great actors like William Hurt and Gary Oldman although maybe it is their own fault for choosing this film. They both did a decent job but I don't think any actor could have made up for the shallow and directionless script. Oldman added a little spice to his character and his haunting refrain of I feel something evil here actually felt chilling in spots.2 out of 10. Sorry every now and then I see a movie that I later wished I hadn't just because I am forced to remember the dumb scenes in it. This was one of them.".

Heather Graham as the female nerd scientist gorgeous as they come but you knew it... unable to connect with her emotional side until won over by the hunk pilot. etc. etc. And my goodness how many times can you go actually through the center of a planet and miraculously survive? The answer if you haven't seen the film is more than once. I could go through the list but you all know these themes already. I felt bad for such great actors like William Hurt and Gary Oldman although maybe it is their own fault for choosing this film. They both did a decent job but I don't think any actor could have made up for the shallow and directionless script. Oldman added a little spice to his character and his haunting refrain of I feel something evil here actually felt chilling in spots.2 out of 10. Sorry every now and then I see a movie that I later wished I hadn't just because I am forced to remember the dumb scenes in it. This was one of them.";

Matt LeBlanc is EXCELLENT as Major West and captures that same 'young pilot' aura Gary Oldman is great as always Mimi Rogers is strong and yummy. The new 'Bloop' is a bit annoying and unnecessary.

The writing didn't just take a story and slap LIS on it the script really tried to capture the feel and morality of the original show and it succeeds!

Their sequel to Airplane! their smash hit was named Airplane 2 The Sequel but to their sequel to The Naked Gun was something that would be copied forever Naked Gun 2  The Smell of Fear. From now on sequels never were just had 2' after it it's always 2 ' or 2.33'. And thankfully the title's shorter.Leslie Nielsen's hilarious character of Frank Drebin is back for more adventures. He and his girlfriend Jane Priscilla Presley have broken up he hasn't gotten over it while she's going out with Quentin Hapsburg Robert Goulet. What she doesn't know is that Hapsburg is in a conspiracy to avoid solar energy by doing a whole kidnapping scheme. It's up to Drebin Nordberg O.J. Simpson and Ed Hocken George Kennedy to save the day!Amazingly enough many of the jokes from the first one which I admit I don't remember much about weren't repeated in this sequel. It would be hard to repeat much of those jokes which would be impossible to change in any ways. Therefore most of the jokes were fresh and hilarious. It did take a little while to get started though for there was about a fifteen minute stretch where there were no laughs it was just for exposition which I guess was OK but I wanted more humor to start off with.Nielsen was perfect for the part. I'm glad that he hasn't sold out' like other comedians and gone on to dramatic roles. He delivers his lines almost like he didn't know he was in a comedy which is always funnier than any other types. Many times he misunderstands what is said and other times he says something that you wouldn't expect him to say in 100 years. One of the funniest sequences in the film is a parody of Bondish films when Drebin and someone else are fighting in a bathroom and seem to be having trouble fighting when a towel is thrown on their heads etc.For once a film has a formidable sequel. Amazingly enough it's a film that's just as funny as the first.My rating 810Rated PG13 for sexual humor.".

The plot is of course nonsense and all you really need to know is that as before Drebin uncovers a plot that nobody believes while at the same time having love life problems  but surely nobody will be watching this for the plot and don't call me Shirley. Instead you will come to this for the steady delivery of absurdly silly jokes all delivered with straight faces from all the cast. It is rather hit and miss but mostly the jokes are amusing even if there aren't as many laugh out loud moments as I would have liked. The addition of a lot of crude material didn't help and I felt it sucked a bit of the sense of fun out of the film.That is not to say that I didn't laugh out loud I did but most of the time I was just chuckling  which is good enough for my money. A big reason the film is funny is the cast. As always Nielsen is brilliant at this sort of thing when he is given the material. Here he is not as good as his best stuff due to the material but he is still the core of this film and is consistently good. Presley has less to do but is good at the straightfaced stuff. OJ and Kennedy have small roles but they are funny with what they have. Goulet is not as good as Montalban from the first film but he has some nice moments.Overall this is very funny if you are in the mood and even if you're not there is still much to enjoy here and it is consistently pretty funny with a real hatful of belly laughs.

Anyhow the film was great and i remember good as yesterday the time this film came out it came out a week before The Terminator 2 and Leslie Nielsen used to do this television spots saying Hasta la vista..baby...they were so damn funny..I hope someone remembers them...Or someone gets them for a DVD. its a definite 10 out of 10 on Comedy.".

I'm not a huge fan of the genre but even I think it's incredibly sidesplittingly outrageous  this last time I saw it I laughed so hard I cried.The sequels of course were intended to cash in on the surprise success of the original which was based on the ZAZ trio's failed TV show Police Squad hence the subtitle on the film. For the most part both sequels were entertaining and funny. Although it's nowhere near as good as the original Naked Gun 2 12 The Smell of Fear is a worthy continuation of the epic saga just kidding about the epic bit  all in all it's just good fun.Leslie Nielsen returns as Lt. Frank Drebin this time out to foil the plans of a mad industrialist Robert Goulet. It seems a respected doctor has found a new method of preserving earth's natural resources and foregoing oils gasoline and other elements. Fearing financial bankruptcy the companies kidnap the doctor and replace him with an identical clone of sorts so the truth cannot come out.However the doctor's assistant is Frank's old flame played by Priscilla Presley. Frank looks into the case while rekindling a relationship with the woman of his dreams.David Zucker returned to direct this film with the help of brother Jerry and pal Jim Abrahams. If I recall correctly the third film was not made by them so it's interesting to see them tackling a sequel to a film of theirs  something they don't usually do they also passed on Airplane 2.For the most part this film is quite funny and has some really good gags but it's also littered with some mediocre ones as many spoofs of these sorts are.Nielsen is still hilarious as Drebin and all around him act simply to accommodate his talents. George Kennedy and O.J. Simpson also return to their roles.If you enjoyed the first film chances are you'll also enjoy this. Basically it's in the same vein of the first film and delivers a good range of slapstick gags some of which will have you in a fit. But you won't be gasping for breath like you did when you saw the first Naked Gun movie.".

It is said that a comedy is the hardest type of script to write so I take my hat off to the writers of Naked Gun 2 12. I don't know how they have the creative power to generate so much visual humour.Naked Gun 2 12  as with all the Naked Gun films  is as much about the spoken lines as it is the visual comedy which is particularly thick on the ground. Catastrophe and disaster follow Frank Drebin like a shadow  especially in the opening sequence when he slams a door in the face of Mrs. Bush twice before causing her to hit her head on the table as he holds a chair out at a dinner party. There is a lot worth looking out for in this film that is imaginative particularly because it is incidental  the contorted chalk outlines on the floor of a crime scene Jane wringing her handkerchief out into a practically full bucket the background as Frank drives through Little Italy the discussion about boxing and the woman taking a shower behind his office door are all priceless.The reason why I think Leslie Nielsen pulls off the character of Frank Drebin so fantastically well is his incredible facial expressions  they truly make his character. His incompetence is breathtaking and yet also breathtakingly funny  when he's in a group of three people wearing hard hats his is the only one that manages to fall off and become mangled in machinery. He can't even manage to get the trouser section of a wetsuit on without difficulty. He has a fight with an intruder that involves a hairdryer and an electric toothbrush.I also love the number of spoofs you can find in this film  the ship Hapsburg Valdez Dr. Meinheimer's ET moment as he is catapulted through the sky the parody of the famous scene from Ghost  and the losers' bar sequence with the incredibly depressing cabaret singer is just inspired. It takes a lot of talent to write comedy and parody and Naked Gun is proof that when it's well done it can be fantastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to comedy the original Naked Gun is a classic. This sequel may not quite be up to par it is too short for my tastes and one or two of the gags come so fast you are in danger of missing them such as the items on the hostess's trayin the blues' cafe but it is very funny and enjoyable.The production values are crisp as usual with good photography and editing and striking location work. The dialogue is dumb but in a good way this is not the dumb humour where it is so stupid you forget to laugh this is the dumb humour that is silly but still makes you smile and laugh.The story is quickly paced and never fails to interest me while the gags on the whole are superbly timed and there are lots of them. My personal favourites are the wonderful sendup of the pottery scene from Ghost and the headline proclaiming that Elvis is alive and well also the beginning sets the tone of the film very well. With most of the original cast returning and some new faces along the way the cast are a delight and the characters are fun. Leslie Nielson once again gives an inspired performance and Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy give nice support. Also strong are Robert Gouletas the villain and Lloyd Bochner and seeing Richard Griffiths was fun too.All in all very enjoyable. 810 Bethany Cox".

This sequel may not quite be up to par it is too short for my tastes and one or two of the gags come so fast you are in danger of missing them such as the items on the hostess's trayin the blues' cafe but it is very funny and enjoyable.The production values are crisp as usual with good photography and editing and striking location work. The dialogue is dumb but in a good way this is not the dumb humour where it is so stupid you forget to laugh this is the dumb humour that is silly but still makes you smile and laugh.The story is quickly paced and never fails to interest me while the gags on the whole are superbly timed and there are lots of them. My personal favourites are the wonderful sendup of the pottery scene from Ghost and the headline proclaiming that Elvis is alive and well also the beginning sets the tone of the film very well. With most of the original cast returning and some new faces along the way the cast are a delight and the characters are fun. Leslie Nielson once again gives an inspired performance and Priscilla Presley and George Kennedy give nice support. Also strong are Robert Gouletas the villain and Lloyd Bochner and seeing Richard Griffiths was fun too.All in all very enjoyable. 810 Bethany Cox";

Well this is one sequel that like the original made me laugh a lot no matter how dumb the joke was. And of course for that to work the actors would have to be able to convincingly sell the jokes. And with the possible exception of O.J. every actor succeeds admirably. Leslie Nielsen has truly created a classic comedy character in the form of Lt. Frank Drebin. This sequel very fortunately resists the temptation to reuse jokes from the previous film and gives us something fresh to laugh hysterically at. I wouldn't count the opening sequence against it because it's a staple of the series. Plus it's still a riot.The Negatives I noted in my review of the first film in the series that there were a few jokes that were so juvenile and dumb that you felt guilty for laughing so hard at them. well that's present in the sequel as well though more so. But this shouldn't be a very big problem for you if you just throw any cares about it off a blimp over the orange bowl on New Years Eve wait that joke's from the first film!. O.J. Simpson doesn't provide quite as many laughs as I'd like and most of the time he really isn't given too much to do. Maybe that's a good thing though especially considering that he won a Razzie for his performance in the third film I haven't seen it yet but expect a review to come... eventually....My 3 choice words Hilarious Silly Nieliffic".

	schema:reviewBody "My one complaint with NG 2 12 is that a number of jokes that could have gone someplace even funnier seem to have gotten dumbed down somewhere along the line.WARNING  exceedingly minor spoilers concerning individual gags follow over the next two paragraphs.For instance there's a scene in which Drebin shows up at Jane's apartment with what starts off as the world's largest bouquet of flowers. Unfortunately his clumsiness on the way up causes him to slam the bouquet into one door after  another  so that by the time he gets to her door he's left with a tiny handful of pitiful mangled stalks.  He notices this at the last moment and tosses the bouquet aside into the hallway.  Kinda funny...but wouldn't it have been funnier to have him wind up with a bouquet that precisely because of his absurd over exuberance earlier on was both still beautiful and now exactly the right size? It's the kind of thing that I'm willing to bet the ZAZ team thought of but dispensed with because they thought it would be too subtle.  There are several such moments to be found here. On the other hand plenty of truly inspired sequences make it through.  For example there's a scene in which a bad guy miraculously survives a fall caused by the bumbling of the Police Squad team only to be mauled to death by a lion.  It could just have been the kind of random gag that the ZAZ team has employed successfully a hundred times with intentionally no attempt made to explain what a lion is doing wandering the streets of Washington. Yet it's even funnier once we remember those zoo animals which were released by Drebin's escapades with a tank  almost an hour earlier in the movie. Ultimately it'll always be easy for viewers to have fun with a character like Frank Drebin who paradoxically succeeds precisely because of his neartotal oblivious incompetence except perhaps at delivering some of the more memorable putdowns on the planet.  The Naked Gun movies are at their best when they're remembering this and providing Drebin with perfect occasions to play the brilliant fool whether or not he ever recognizes the real reason for his success.  They suffer only when they cheapen themselves by making the easier ha ha look at this idiot jokes at his expense. As an aside NG 2 12 actually made me think a bit more carefully about the conspiracy against renewable energy in which politicians and fossilfuel magnates play a ludicrously expensive game of mutual backscratching.  Not bad for a series that never exactly claimed to have anything important to say especially since ZAZ found a way to pull it off without ever seeming heavyhanded. I'll give it a B.".

Living in a city within an enclosed dome there is little or no work for humans to perform and inhabitants are free to pursue all of the pleasures of life. There is one catch however your life is limited and when you reach 30 it is terminated in a quasireligious ceremony known as Carousel. Some known as runners do try to escape their fate when the time comes and it's the job of Sandmen to track them down and kill them. Logan is such a man and with several years before his own termination date thinks nothing of the job he does. Soon after meeting a young woman Jessica6 he is ordered to become a runner himself and infiltrate a community outside the dome known as Sanctuary and to destroy it. Pursued by his friend Francis also a Sandman Logan and Jessica find their way to the outside. There they discover a beautiful virtually uninhabited world. Logan realizes that he must return to the dome to tell them what ...";

So when I picked it up recently on DVD and watched it for the first time in twentyeight years I was wondering how it would fare after all this time.Well not too badly. Many of the IMDb reviewers of Logan's Run hit the nail on the head when they say that this film is definitely a product of its time. Yes the special effects are sort of laughable now the teeny tiny maze cars zipping through the a model of the city that looks about six inches tall but you have to judge those sorts of things in the context of the time they were made. As strange as it may seem to people who now expect Lord of the Ringsquality special effects Logan's Run was cutting edge in its day. And a few of the special effects still stand up fairly well. The light envelope that comes down over the Carousel or the matte shots of Washington. Not great for twentyfirst century filmmaking but a minor miracle for 1976.The story has more holes than a piece of swiss cheese and the acting is a bit touch and go but that doesn't get in the way of a fairly entertaining movie. Seeing the movie all these years later I suppose the few moments of bad acting hit me more than anything else. As a kid I thought that Peter Ustinov's old man was brilliant but now it just seems like awkward overacting. Which isn't to say that his character isn't somewhat endearing.Michael York a really wonderful actor misses the mark a few times but generally he and Jenny Agutter do a fine job.Listen this isn't a brilliant movie but it does have its moments. Most science fiction movies made in the 1970s haven't endured the test of time especially well. With the purple mascara pastelcoloured costumes and hair feathered like a great phoenix. But all in all I still found Logan's Run to be an entertaining and enjoyable trip back to the strange world of 1976.".

Here in this bubbled society the young healthy beautiful people who populate it live in total and complete pleasure free of labor  strife and free to do anything  everything they want sexually or otherwise. It's a total state of hedonism.But there's one catch no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. On your 30th birthday known as Lastday the little jeweled lifeclock attached to your hand blinks and you must be expelled from this society of pleasure through an arena event known as carrousel in which the city's young people believe your soul is renewed afterwhich you will be reborn into the city's society and start all over again.But some 30 yearolds in this city know the real truth about carrouselthat it is in fact a death sentenceand they try to escape. They're called runners. The domed city has a faction of policemen who hunt down runners and they're called Sandmen. Logan Michael York is a 26 yearold Sandman. Life in the city is good for him but suddenly he is given a secret mission by his bossthe city's master computerthat will change him. Logan's assignment is to go undercover as a runner escape the city and go outside where he is to find a socalled haven for escaped runners called Sanctuary and destroy it. But Logan soon learns the truth about carrousel himself and with the aid of a beautiful girl named Jessica Jenny Agutter whom he falls in love with he must now figure out how to free his people from their horrible fate at the age of 30....1976's Logan's Run is an alltime science fiction classic and one of my personal favorite films ever since I first saw it on TV as a kid. I've always been fascinated by the storyline and although the film's Oscarwinning visual effects have long since been surpassed they're still quite colorful to look at including the groundbreaking use of holography. There's fine performances all around such as the perfectlycast Michael York as Logan the very lovely Jenny Agutter as Jessica she  York have terrific chemistry together as well as the delightful Peter Ustinov as Old Man who Logan  Jessica discover living alone with his cats outside the city Richard Jordan as Logan's best friend Francis and there's even an enjoyable appearance from Farrah Fawcett Majors in her sexy 70's prime as an attractive assistant working in a facelift shop called New You. And director Michael Anderson steers the film quite nicely from beginning to end.Some have criticized Logan's Run as being too long saying that the film bogs down in the middle when Logan  Jessica get outside the city and meet the Old Man. I say hogwashI've always enjoyed this part of the film featuring Ustinov's charming turn as the Old Man. Besides it's an important part of the story as Logan  Jessica fall in love with one another and learn through meeting the Old Man that there IS in fact life after 30. Without this segment of the film Logan's Run would be pointless. It's there for a reason and I like it just as much as the rest of the film.Upon it's release in 1976 Logan's Run was arguably the hippest scifi film ever made up to that point. Then of course the original Star Wars was released the following year which pretty much knocked Logan's Run off the scifi pedestal. But no matterthe film remains an enduring classic of it's genre with a big following to this day. Over 25 years later Logan's Run is still a ton of futuristic fun. ".

Logan's Run is one of those few.Before Stars Wars enraptured audiences with its stunning special effects and created a precedent for a string of similarly effectsladen knockoffs and genre wannabe's mirroring what The War of the Worlds had done for audiences in the 50's true science fiction films such as Logan's Run were giving us stories simply complimented by special effects not about them.  I say true because Star Wars is of the fantasy genre it is not a science fiction story though it does share some common elements.Logan's Run presents us with a vivid somewhat horrifying vision of a possible future.  It doesn't take place a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.  It happens on earth in a believable time frame.  It doesn't ask us to greatly suspend disbelief by accepting alien races and magic powers. Instead it presents us with a chilling fast forward of our own technology attitudes and policies.  Concerning the latter the film includes an almost creepy euthanasia undertone to it.Though in all honesty I care more about and become more closely associated with the characters in Star Wars the disassociation I feel for LR's characters somewhat aids the lack of individuality that the story tries to convey.  The actors however give great performances.Beautiful cinematography and settings greatly compliment the film's mood and timeframe from the sterile domed city to the decimated Washington D.C. which still provides one of if not the best visuals of a postapocalyptic world that I've ever seen.  It's right there with The Planet of the Apes' Statue of Liberty.Another thing that SW does well is disassociate itself from the decade in which it was created.  You have to overlook this aspect in LR because like so many films of the 70's it carries its decade's time stamp.Though minor another thing I in particular enjoy about LR are the weapons.  Unlike every other weapon in and out of science fiction history LR's blasters do not actually shoot anything.  There is simply an explosion at their designated target.  It may be campy or corny but it's definitely different and a fine example of real working props.Another interesting note the film varies greatly from the original novel but most people agree that the film is much better.  I tend to agree with them.For me in terms of science fiction Logan's Run takes its place among such decadedefining films as The War of the Worlds 50's and The Planet of the Apes 60's and among such thoughtprovoking science fiction as Soylent Green and Gattaca.Ask yourself this what or where is sanctuary?  Isn't that what we're all looking for?  Answer both and you'll have the film's theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the last 30 years Logan's Run has become somewhat of a laughingstock the poster child of bad '70s science fiction. Its mention evokes images of cheesy sets bad action silly plotting and heavyhanded yet ultimately empty social commentary. Is this reputation deserved? On viewing it recently I have to say no.That's not to say that Logan's Run doesn't have its flaws. Its main problem is the dialog which is often leaden unrealistic and expositionheavy. This creates an unfortunate challenge for the actors who often appear to be visibly struggling to make a scene work despite the stupid lines the script gives them.But once you get beyond that there's a lot of good stuff to be found. The plot is tight and Logan's gradual shifts from undercover agent trying to discover the whereabouts of hundreds of unaccountedfor Runners to becoming a Runner himself to revolutionary dedicated to ending the false Renewal ceremony ring true and engage the viewer's sympathies. The sets while certainly dated particularly in technological terms are impressive and evocative. And if anything the film's vision of a future obsessed with youth beauty and obedience is even more meaningful today than when it was released.The concept of Sanctuary is particularly well handled. Early in the film Sanctuary is a legendary place a haven for Runners who manage to escape which no one inside the dome has ever seen or had contact with yet inspires Runners to attempt escape from their society's strict codes of behavior. Later we learn that there is no real Sanctuary the Runners who pass beyond the final gate and escape from the Sandmen have been captured and frozen by a malfunctioning foodstorage 'bot and there is a strong implication that Logan and Jessica are the first to fully escape the dome and reach the outside. What they find is a real Sanctuary a lush green world where people could live freely without the oppressive restrictions of dome society.Other notable features include Peter Ustinov's wonderful performance as the confused lonely Old Man living in the ruins of Washington D.C. and Logan's interrogation scene on returning to the dome where holograms are used to represent the computer pulling information out of his brain.So why is this film ridiculed? I have a theory. Within about a year Star Wars was released and literally changed the audience's expectations of how an SF film should look. Logan's Run with it's clean simple design human scale and strong moralistic tones represented the last gasp of a nowobsolete style of filmmaking and as such suffered greatly in comparison to the new wave of SF films. I think it deserves another look.".

It seemed to allude to the past while hinting at the future that scifi was about to take. As a result it is very satisfying. Its mix of dark dystopian conundrums with fastpaced action works very well.It's set in an enclosed world in a postapocalyptic Earth. The inhabitants lead hedonistic carefree lives. But the catch is that everybody has to submit to forced euthanasia at the age of thirty. The vast majority of the brainwashed populace however believe what they are told by their overlords and think that they will be renewed to live their lives again. The story tells of a sandman a state hitman who starts to have doubts about this and is sent on a mission to the outside world to find a place called Sanctuary.Over and above everything what makes Logan's Run such a delight is the excellent setdesign and detailed model work. The colourful large interiors of the domed world are extremely attractive while the ice caves and overgrown Washington D.C. are very well done also. The model work may look like well model work but it's beautifully designed and adds a certain charm. The story itself is good enough although things do slow down somewhat once the characters leave their city and venture outside leading to a rather unsatisfying ending. But there is enough quality beforehand to make up for this. The film benefits from its two principal actors Michael York and Jenny Agutter. York is as reliable as always while Agutter probably steals the show as the beautiful and mysterious Jessica 6.".

	schema:headline " Whether you're Green Redor Over 30 This is Great SciFi!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Logan's Run is an excellent stylish scifi film from 1975 starring the great Michael York and the beautiful Jenny Agutter. It blew my mind seeing it as an 11yearold and was so obsessed with it my mother used to say He thinks everything's the 23rd century. Logan 5 York is a Sandman who kills runners people who reach the age of 30 but reject the chance to Renew on Carousel. As the film begins we see the cool domed city with Jerry Goldsmith's futuristic trippy soundtrack. In this world mainly filmed in a Fort Worth mall everyone has a lifeclock and when they reach 30 it starts to blink red. Those who believe in renewal attend the Last Day ritual when the 30yearolds come out with hoods and masks then Identify...be strong and you will be renewed says the female computer voice. They disrobe to reveal tights with Evel Knievel designs and start to spin around and float up and blow up to the cheers of the crowd.Logan and his friend Francis Richard Jordan go on a hunt for runners killing them with fire spewing guns. Then Logan finds an Anck key and the master computer makes him search for Sanctuary by posing as a runner some reviews of this film say Logan is 30 but he's 4yearsaway i.e. 26York was really 32 though.The best thing about this is the stylish futuristic designs the great believable acting of the stars and the offthewall nonsensical speech of the senile old man Peter Ustinov. And there's some great adventure as Logan and Jessica are chased out of the city by Francis through the labyrinthine subsystems Box the crazy robot and a beautiful ice cave scene. And for us guys our favorite line is we better take our clothes off before they freeze kind of weird that they put them back on but our wish throughout the film comes true with a quick glimpse of Jenny Agutter disrobed.  Actually there is a fully nude scene here with them in each others' arms while Box sculpts them as per the book alas it was cut from the film for a PG rating.  I never did quite get what Box was supposed to be.The plot itself has some serious inconsistencies. In the book the age for Renewal was 21 and the author got the idea from '60s youth culture it was written in 1967. The idea was that youth would take over and get rid of all adults. The reason for the change to age 30 is the stars would be unbelievable as 20 year olds. You have to make many leaps over logic to suspend your disbelief here. You could say the city used this as population control. The idea of Renewal well you can believe in reincarnation but in this world it's implied Renewal means some scientific process controlled by the computer. When the computer tells Logan there are 1056 unaccounted for runners he says no one's ever been renewed?! However his conclusion cannot be logically drawn from information on unaccounted for runners.In the cool surrogation scene with Logan in multiple hologram images saying There is Noooooo Sanctuary his answer does not compute so the city blows up....or was it his shooting the computer with his gun...or both. Here's a way to rationalize it though the computer has a secret program to destroy the city when someone prefers life outside the dome...the purpose of shelter for what's left of humanity is fulfilled and it's time for them to go outside.  And how they get outside the city to meet the old man so quickly and without a scratch on them is beyond me.  But I felt at the end what happens now?  That cool city of sex drugs and cool carousel ritual is gone.  As Francis said Is this good is this what you want?!  Now they are free to scrounge for survival and grow old and decrepid.  I believe in the book it wasn't an enclosed city it was the whole world.

	onyx:emotionText "Logan's Run is an excellent stylish scifi film from 1975 starring the great Michael York and the beautiful Jenny Agutter. It blew my mind seeing it as an 11yearold and was so obsessed with it my mother used to say He thinks everything's the 23rd century. Logan 5 York is a Sandman who kills runners people who reach the age of 30 but reject the chance to Renew on Carousel. As the film begins we see the cool domed city with Jerry Goldsmith's futuristic trippy soundtrack. In this world mainly filmed in a Fort Worth mall everyone has a lifeclock and when they reach 30 it starts to blink red. Those who believe in renewal attend the Last Day ritual when the 30yearolds come out with hoods and masks then Identify...be strong and you will be renewed says the female computer voice. They disrobe to reveal tights with Evel Knievel designs and start to spin around and float up and blow up to the cheers of the crowd.Logan and his friend Francis Richard Jordan go on a hunt for runners killing them with fire spewing guns. Then Logan finds an Anck key and the master computer makes him search for Sanctuary by posing as a runner some reviews of this film say Logan is 30 but he's 4yearsaway i.e. 26York was really 32 though.The best thing about this is the stylish futuristic designs the great believable acting of the stars and the offthewall nonsensical speech of the senile old man Peter Ustinov. And there's some great adventure as Logan and Jessica are chased out of the city by Francis through the labyrinthine subsystems Box the crazy robot and a beautiful ice cave scene. And for us guys our favorite line is we better take our clothes off before they freeze kind of weird that they put them back on but our wish throughout the film comes true with a quick glimpse of Jenny Agutter disrobed.  Actually there is a fully nude scene here with them in each others' arms while Box sculpts them as per the book alas it was cut from the film for a PG rating.  I never did quite get what Box was supposed to be.The plot itself has some serious inconsistencies. In the book the age for Renewal was 21 and the author got the idea from '60s youth culture it was written in 1967. The idea was that youth would take over and get rid of all adults. The reason for the change to age 30 is the stars would be unbelievable as 20 year olds. You have to make many leaps over logic to suspend your disbelief here. You could say the city used this as population control. The idea of Renewal well you can believe in reincarnation but in this world it's implied Renewal means some scientific process controlled by the computer. When the computer tells Logan there are 1056 unaccounted for runners he says no one's ever been renewed?! However his conclusion cannot be logically drawn from information on unaccounted for runners.In the cool surrogation scene with Logan in multiple hologram images saying There is Noooooo Sanctuary his answer does not compute so the city blows up....or was it his shooting the computer with his gun...or both. Here's a way to rationalize it though the computer has a secret program to destroy the city when someone prefers life outside the dome...the purpose of shelter for what's left of humanity is fulfilled and it's time for them to go outside.  And how they get outside the city to meet the old man so quickly and without a scratch on them is beyond me.  But I felt at the end what happens now?  That cool city of sex drugs and cool carousel ritual is gone.  As Francis said Is this good is this what you want?!  Now they are free to scrounge for survival and grow old and decrepid.  I believe in the book it wasn't an enclosed city it was the whole world.  I wonder what the world outside the DC area was like in the film's backstory.Bottom line is the film is great not because of the plot but because of the creativity and style. It won a special academy award for special effects and it's a true classic. Michael York still gets people who come up to him telling him Logan's Run was their favorite film of his even with all the other great roles he's had.  And the rumors are flying about a remake!

	schema:reviewBody "Logan's Run is a polarizing film you either like it or hate it there isn't much in between.  It also tends to be loved more by the people who saw it in the 70's and early 80's.  It features an interesting dystopian society and plenty of action plus top notch special effects for preILM 1976.Spoilers Logan's Run is based on the novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson.  The movie departs from the novel in several aspects the main ones being a lifespan of 30 instead of 21 and a domed city rather than the entire country as a playground.In the movie after overpopulation brings on a cataclysmic war society is restructured so that life ends at 30 and the citizens must go on Carousel to try to renew.  However some people don't like these options and go on the run.  Sandmen are charged with hunting down these misfits.  Logan is a Sandman who is ordered to track down these runners and destroy Sanctuary the final goal of the runners.  The controlling computer alters the lifeclock embedded in his palm and advances it three years to Logan's Lastday.  Logan encounters Jessica a young woman with knowledge of the route to Sanctuary.  Together they go on the run to find Sanctuary while Logan's partner Francis hunts for them.Logan and Jessica find a whole world outside the dome of the city and encounter an eccentric old man.  They return to the city to reveal what they have seen and tear down the system.Michael York and Jenny Agutter are excellent in the lead roles of Logan and Jessica.  Robert Jordan and Peter Ustinov make for a fine supporting cast. All are classically trained actors who bring a lot to the film.  Farrah Fawcett appears in a small role and is little more than window dressing.The effects were stateoftheart for 1976.  ILM would bring a revolution in effects work the following year but for the time and the budget Logan's effects were quite good.  Some of the model shots are obvious and the Sandman's gun takes some getting used to but it works.The costumes are pure Disco which puts them on par with other films of the era.  Even Star Wars didn't totally escape this problem.  The Sandman uniforms look fairly menacing and the citizens' clothes do fit in with the hedonistic society.The story is a byproduct of 60's and early 70's concerns the novel was published in 1967 overpopulation and a large youth culture who felt marginalized.  The story is more cerebral in keeping with other scifi films of the era like Silent Running and the Planet of the Apes films but does have a healthy dose of action.The main flaws of the movie occur when Logan and Jessica discover the world outside the domed city.  It's never quite as interesting as the city and the discovery of Washington DC is swiped  from Planet of the Apes. Although Peter Ustinov adds some color and humor to the film these scenes tend to slow things down too much.  When Francis reenters things pick back up but the time in between seems too long.I've always loved the film although it's not perfect.  I don't consider it to be the greatest scifi film of the 70's it is one of the better ones. Consider the major scifi films of the 70's  Soylent Green Omega Man Escape fromConquest ofBattle for the Planet of the Apes Dark Star Silent Running Logan's Run Star Wars Close Encounters Outland Alien Star Trek TMP Battlestar Galactica Buck Rogers Superman.  The best films came in near the end of the decade of the 70's.  Logan's Run is kind of a dividing line between old scifi films and the more modern.  Sure Soylent Green and Escape from the POTA are considered classics by some but they are still mainly cult films.  Logan's Run is closer to being a blockbuster than those early films with the possible exception of Escape.  It shares the more plot and characterdriven elements of those earlier films with the action and special effects of the later films.  It's not a perfect synthesis but it was a step in that direction.  In some ways scifi has regressed too many films now are glorified action pieces with futuristic trappings but little in the way of deep thought or forwardthinking ideas.Logan's Run is an excellent film that still mostly holds up well.  It is a blend of thoughtful ideas and action in an interesting setting.  The performances are good and most of the effects serve their purpose well. It does slow down in the later half but it has a good ending.  Definitely a must or any student of scifi cinema.".

Jenny Agutter is young and cute in the film which is about all her character requires. It's an interesting statement of a society that gets a little out of hand with it's youth worship holding up a mirror to our own. It's especially poignant if you saw it yourself when you were under 30 and see it again at a 'maturer' age. Farrah Fawcett has a brief role here and Agutter has a nice brief nude scene.

	schema:reviewBody "Logans Run is classic Science Fiction SF Don't Judge It By Star Wars or Other SF after that time. At the time it was being made Special Effects was more of a horror to Hollywood Studios than an attraction to them. Computers were nearly unheard of in film making. Budgets didn't permit computers or SFX en mass and Star Wars was a major exception. Logans Run had it's comparatively meager budget and a Director has to make what he can with what he's got financially available. At the time of it's release it was considered to have very advanced SFX.To be fair every film looks dated as SFX advances year by year to include Star Wars Jaws 2001 they all look dated now. And none have a tenth of the story content that Logans Run does. Digitally Updateing films like a mindless megalomaniac does not count here we're talking the original product OK It is always a great disappointment to come to this site and see so many people who are obviously young born in the late 70's or 80's who have no clue or appreciation for what makes a great old film like this great. The constant and unoriginal cry for remakes of great films like this is sickening. What remake has ever been worthy of it's source material not one. Imagine how Jerry Bruckheimer's production values would KILL this movie.That our culture has produced several recent generations of young people who can't see past a films primitive SFX and sets to actually get the message of this film is only indicative that Logans Run' message of the dangers of youth centered culture are dead on.Like much of 1970's SciFi Cinema Omega Man Soylent Green THX1139 Logans Run is about one man and one lovely lady set against the much larger faceless oppression of the System whatever it may be.Put yourself in Logans shoes for a moment everything you've ever known or believed is a lie and you were part of what enforced that lie. Suddenly one day circumstances and an alluring stranger demand that you give up all you hold true and all you know as safe and comfortable and you go against it all to run. Like joining a cult only for once the cult is correct. You think you are running toward the lie to find the truth. And as your world falls apart around you you realize you are running from a lie to the truth. This is Logans quandary the world beyond the domes of his City are a terrible affirmation that the malcontents within the City are actually right.Logans run has amazing moments where the main characters experience fear aloneness and love for the first time. These are amazing scenes that show the mindless danger of Utopian existence over generations and how dystopian visions of the future can still lead to humankind finding a way to endure without the total destruction of the planet.Sure I love 1970's Sci FiSF but you can't compare it to the modern stuff. Not SFX wise anyway. Movies were artistic and well written before George Lucas and Spielberg made SFX the prime motivators in film along with mega budgets. So I love the films that came before 1977 those that came before the utter stupidity of the mega priced blockbuster. They don't have the budget and eye candy but they do have something the blockbusters don't...they have a story.The path and story the arc if you will of Logans character far exceeds almost any SF Movie characters development before during or sadly to say much of after to this day.Logan's Run is a classic 1970's SciFi CinemaDramaLove Story and well worth the time to watch".

Digitally Updateing films like a mindless megalomaniac does not count here we're talking the original product OK It is always a great disappointment to come to this site and see so many people who are obviously young born in the late 70's or 80's who have no clue or appreciation for what makes a great old film like this great. The constant and unoriginal cry for remakes of great films like this is sickening. What remake has ever been worthy of it's source material not one. Imagine how Jerry Bruckheimer's production values would KILL this movie.That our culture has produced several recent generations of young people who can't see past a films primitive SFX and sets to actually get the message of this film is only indicative that Logans Run' message of the dangers of youth centered culture are dead on.Like much of 1970's SciFi Cinema Omega Man Soylent Green THX1139 Logans Run is about one man and one lovely lady set against the much larger faceless oppression of the System whatever it may be.Put yourself in Logans shoes for a moment everything you've ever known or believed is a lie and you were part of what enforced that lie. Suddenly one day circumstances and an alluring stranger demand that you give up all you hold true and all you know as safe and comfortable and you go against it all to run. Like joining a cult only for once the cult is correct. You think you are running toward the lie to find the truth. And as your world falls apart around you you realize you are running from a lie to the truth. This is Logans quandary the world beyond the domes of his City are a terrible affirmation that the malcontents within the City are actually right.Logans run has amazing moments where the main characters experience fear aloneness and love for the first time. These are amazing scenes that show the mindless danger of Utopian existence over generations and how dystopian visions of the future can still lead to humankind finding a way to endure without the total destruction of the planet.Sure I love 1970's Sci FiSF but you can't compare it to the modern stuff. Not SFX wise anyway. Movies were artistic and well written before George Lucas and Spielberg made SFX the prime motivators in film along with mega budgets. So I love the films that came before 1977 those that came before the utter stupidity of the mega priced blockbuster. They don't have the budget and eye candy but they do have something the blockbusters don't...they have a story.The path and story the arc if you will of Logans character far exceeds almost any SF Movie characters development before during or sadly to say much of after to this day.Logan's Run is a classic 1970's SciFi CinemaDramaLove Story and well worth the time to watch";

If you take the 70's production with a grain of salt what you have is an excellent scifi thriller. The movie flies by. It builds and builds and even when we approach the end of the film we only wish it would keep going...keep answering all those questions that go unanswered...which really is the appeal of the film. This is a timeless scifi cultclassic. I am very much looking forward to the pending remake but will be surprised if it is more effective than the original here. While the production values are at times questionable  the film thrives in terms of creating tension and the pacing is fantastic. It's provocative and at times quite violent and cruel. 'Logan's Run' delivers with constant thrills and intrigue but still never gives us all we want... we want more. Films like this one use the unknown of the future to hold the audience in suspenseMuch Like Planet of the Apes. We want to know how society evolved but we are only privy to so much. Such is the intrigue of 'Logan's Run'. This is merely a 'good' movie .. with the guts of a truly great movie.".

People fail to realise that science fiction films even if futuristic in nature are merely mirrors of the periods in which they were made. 50s science fiction? Laughoutloud funny. 60s? Same story. Even 80s science fiction looks incredibly silly but you have to get past the look and consider the message of the piece. Soylent Green and Rollerball look pretty dated now too but they still seem to get more respect than this one. Logan's Run is the ultimate indictment of the Me Decade. It takes on the hedonistic pursuits of the 70s swinging narcissism disco and removes them to another space and time so we can view this particular society objectively. It points a finger at those who buy the I hope I die before I get old line without question and shows them how myopic that point of view is. It shows us that the world is what we make of it. So sure laugh at the costuming the special effects the sometimes inane dialogue but watch the movie a couple of times before you jump all over it.The first time I saw Logan's Run was in a TV cut in the early 80s and I didn't really get it. Now that I have reached Carrousel age I see it differently and understand its point. See it with an open mind if that's still possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 I was still waiting for a science fiction movie to top or at least equal 2001 A Space Odyssey. To put it mildly Logan's Run wasn't it. Which explains my bias against this flick... I have quite a soft spot for vintage bad scifi I collect bad B movie SF from the 50's  60's. But I just can't seem to get into the camp value of LR. I felt ripped off when I left the theater in '76 and lord help me I'm still ticked off.This film has been nicely picked apart by previous comments so I'm going to try to condense down my litany of hate to the things that slowly brought me to a boil as I sat in the Orange Cinedome in '76. You folks that love this movie don't take this personally. I just need to vent.Picture the day... it's 1976 I haven't seen a decent science fiction block buster since 2001. Indeed it seemed like there hadn't been ANY SF movies to speak of in a while. Along comes this major SF pic from MGM... Hey the same studio that put out 2001! Ought to see some kickass effects eh? Wait a sec I have to pause while I laugh a bit... Ok.At the time what I was really wanting was a spaceship movie. What Logan's Run delivered was a shopping mall. No seriously much of it was FILMED IN A SHOPPING MALL. Possible Mitigating Factor It could be argued that Logan's Run was the darkest vision of the future ever put on film. Can you imagine a more dismal future than of all human society confined to a 1970's shopping mall? I can't. But no sorry I don't buy that either. I think it had less to do with a dark vision and more to do with a lack of imagination and budget. Thank you I could have gone to the mall for free instead of plunking down cash at the box office. And god knows I wish I had.Gad what does it say about the Academy that this thing picked up a Special Achievement Award for effects? As they used to say in the 50's YOU CAN SEE THE STRINGS! Hello?... Strings... wires... whatever. It's EIGHT YEARS after 2001 and there are strings! Keeripes! Even folks who are bored to tears by 2001 will admit that it set a new standard for effects. Eight years later MGM had apparently set the studio calendars back to 1952 or so because I swear they could have filmed Logan's Run back then and it wouldn't have looked any worse. As has been pointed out in other comments the Carrousel device was not in the novel.. so the real mind blower here is they went OUT OF THEIR WAY to create a scene they couldn't figure out how to film without revealing THE STRINGS! I love saying that... Strings! The mind boggles.Speaking of retro effects a few years prior I remember watching a European made SF movie on TV. My buddy  I cracked up at the laser pistols that fired FLAMES. We laughed during the movie and we laughed some more after the movie. Oh those silly Europeans! Butane lighter guns? Little did I know... But it's a shame I couldn't tap into that humor vibe during Logan's Run. Again we're back to the money thing I guess. I PAID to see this? As Dr. Smith would say Oh... the pain the pain!Ok so far this vision of the future has treated me to A 1970's shopping mall 1950's Special String Effects and 1960's vintage Italian cigarette lighter pistols. As a favor to the reader I've skipped some details having to do with my dislike of the story script and every actoractress seen so far. I'm sitting in the theater tensed with disgust wondering how much worse can this possibly get?Stop here for a moment and think of Kubrick's The Shining 1980. Picture if you will that closeup cut to Jack Nicholson's face where he's first got THE LOOK slack jawed wild eyes staring straight ahead. His mind has SNAPPED and you know he'd be just fine with killing every living thing on the planet right about now... Ok... That would have been the look on MY face when I first saw Box the robot of Logan's Run. Yep up to then I was merely simmering. Box brought me to a full boil. Again I'll spare you the details. Other comments have suitably described the almost indescribably pathetic and aptly named box that was Box. Again I pause this time for a shudder of revulsion. If Box didn't make you jump the shark well you and I are just two different people is all.There are a couple dozen other elements in LR that frosted my rear but I'll let most of them slide. I do have to fire a last shot at the REAL Holograms! that figured in the promotion of LR. The absurdity of trying to show off a 3D effect in a 2D movie is just well I'm back to mind boggling I guess. The same effect could have been pulled off by matting and probably would have looked better. But we used REAL Holograms!!!! the dolts in marketing would whine. Gee I guess that MIGHT have amounted to something if that had meant it would have popped out in 3D in the theater huh? Yawn.And just so's you don't forget this here is a Hollywood pichur everythin' dun blowed up at the end! Yee haw!At this point I'd want to find a least a few good things to say but honestly all I can think of were a few things that were almost good. Potentially interesting a society that practices euthanasia for essentially hedonistic purposes and also the reaction of it's members to encountering an aged person. Well it might have been interesting if the film had broken some ground in dreaming up a hedonistic future. What we got were sex orgies and plastic surgery not exactly shocking concepts to a 1970's audience. Euthanasia maybe but the concept certainly had been explored before LR. IMHO there was some potential here that was wasted by a timid and fairly unimaginative treatment presented in a silly context. Oh and the only way for Peter Ustinov to hurt a film would be for him to be badly or under used and of course bingo on both.I could sum up my feelings for Logan's Run by quoting Roger Ebert's review of North1994 but it's copyrighted so it probably wouldn't fly here. If you've got a minute look it up on the net and read the second to last paragraph I hated... It's classic and I can't think of Logan's Run without thinking of that paragraph.Again you folks who liked this film don't take my rant personally. Who knows maybe someday I'll be able to sit down and get a good camp laugh out of it. Then we can all enjoy it.".

Society is peaceful and fun loving. When you reach 30 you are to renew your life through a ritual or never live again.The story of Logan's Run is quite frightening. Director Michael Anderson does a fantastic job of keeping the frightening aspects of the story going. From the pleasant yet somewhat menacing voice of the main computer to the idea behind the Carousel you never for a minute doubt what is going on and you really pull for the central characters.The DVD transfer is good probably as good as they are going to get because some scenes of the film always looked a little muddy. The enhanced soundtrack is in Dolby and while not 5.1 is still sounds much better than the VHS. The commentary is good but nothing spectacular. And the widescreen is really nice!A word of caution. While the film is rated PG there are several scenes of brief nudity one of which really doesn't further the plot any and is unnecessary in fact in the commentary the scene takes the director by surprise and he says he forgot about it. The other is an elaborate scene in the love shop. Despite that there is very little graphic violence and little to no profanity.Logan's Run is a solid film. It looks a little dated now but still entertains!".

	schema:reviewBody "Andrei Rublev alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov is an epic film created by the Sovietera director Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in EastWest relations marked by the end of Kruschchev's reign. Within reason the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnevera censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.Fortunately for us this movie recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print may now be viewed intact and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters if taken individually could stand alone as separate masterpieces.The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself however is merely a useful device. Little is known about him and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.The movie is not about one talented monk but about Russia and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia's unique culture the growing force of Byzantine Christianity and the MongolTatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker and experienced firsthand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred the nature of art the relationship of the artist to the state what it means to be Russian and what it means to be human.It is beautiful mystical and profound but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don't know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand and stand in awe of is a continuous single camera shot just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex and so disdainful of traditional narrative form that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it watching it repeatedly and reading Tarkovsky's own comments about it one still finds it opaque in many ways.Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.".

The church influenced every aspect of people's lives from birth to death and was part of the state. It means religious leaders were as important as rulers.In Russian society men were wearing beards and women covered hairs. Remove a beard from a man or uncover woman's hair and you will humiliate them they would feel like modern people being undressed in public.Paganism is a form of religion where people believe in many gods instead of one. The main Russian pagan gods are the goddess of the earth and the god of the sun. Among others  the god of storms and lightning the mythical young women living in forests and rivers. Despite many centuries of suppression of paganism by authorities some in modern Russia still celebrate the feast of Ivan Kupala which could be translated as Ivan Gathering depicted in the movie.Also I have to mention that Soviet censors told Tarkovski the movie is too cruel. They told him the scene with a burning cow for example is absolutely unacceptable. Tarkovski tried to defend the movie. The cow wasn't harmed was his reasoning. Still the film was cut. The censors knew better what is good and what is not for the viewer.This brings us to what is the message of Tarkovski in this film. There are many messages actually. I'll be telling only about one here because it is not hidden. It is there in the dispute between Rublov and Theophanes The Greek. They both are talented both want to bring people to humanity. Theophanes is tired he says  common people live in darkness they are completely consumed by sin and the only way to make them humans is to scare them and punish them. Rublov advocates for love. He says people live very difficult life it's amazing how they endure it. We have to love them to remind them they are humans they are Russians. You see the first is the position of the Soviet system the second  of Jesus Christ.Me? I'm still sitting on the fence. I recommend to watch this movie many times. You will do it without my recommendation though if you like me will not understand everything from the first view and you like to think. The mesmerizing beauty of this movie will help you to return easier. For the first time be prepared for not a cakewalk. There are two things to consider here. One is the cruelty. Though it is absolutely necessary in this film most of us living in a comfort of modern society are not ready to it. The other is the pace. Often it is a pace of real life. Peace.".

And has moved me with superlative skill and force. Other great movies have entertained me inspired me made me think only Rublev has palpably altered my outlook on life.Andrei Rublev was a medieval Russian iconographer the film chronicles his struggle to maintain faith and artistry in a world of immeasurable cruelty and suffering.

The movie is divided into chapters the final one involving an orphaned bellmaker's son is a stunning filmwithinafilm that provides a microcosm of the whole movie. That section if it stood alone would be my alltime favourite film.Be warned Andrei Rublev is SLOW.  You have to slide into it it's not a flick which dazzles it is a world which beguiles and which demands to be inhabited.  Also there are EXTREMELY difficult scenes to watchtorture and bloodshed abounds.  Watching the Tartar attack on a Russian town is the most painful  experience I've ever hadnot just in a cinema but in life.For those willing to make the gruelling trek however Andrei Rublev is an inspiring lifeaffecting experience.  Created under an oppressive Soviet regime which banned the film for years recognizing its symbolic commentary on 20thcentury Soviet government the film shows how life can be valuable and even joyful no matter how much suffering stands in the way.Especially recommended for Tarkovsky fans Dostoevsky fans fans of medieval art and anyone grappling with questions about suffering and human expression.".

	schema:headline " The gospel according to Andrei Rublev";
	schema:reviewBody "As someone who has seen this movie roughly five times and regards it as the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema I find it difficult to fathom how anyone can think that Andrei Rublev is slow or boring. It is true that it's slowpaced and perhaps too demanding in its unconventional structure of narrative but I would prefer this to anything commercial cinema releases in its quest to appeal to as broad a market a possible. In other words given the choice between a film that treats its audience with respect and gives you enough credit to assume you are willing to sit through roughly three hours of lengthy dialogue and long takes not to mention some of the most mesmerisingly beautiful visuals ever seen on screen and one which treats its audience like a demographic that can be appealed to like consumers not individuals with their own dreams fears hopes and aspirations I know which type of cinema truly bores me.It is often the case that art serves as a mechanism used to comment on social or individuals ills rarely however if at all does it reflect on itself and its own function to humanity. This is what makes Andrei Rublev a unique and important film since it addresses the role of the artist in the world. Any questions regarding historical accuracy or rather lack thereof towards Rublev's personal life are slightly pointless since the character is merely used as a vehicle to drive the thematic elements of the narrative. That's not to say that Rublev here is an empty shell it's simply that Tarkovsky used him as a means to impose his personal views on the subject. Why create art? Does being an artist mean expressing love for humanity? If so why should one express love for something which seems to hate itself? These are just a few of the questions which arise from viewing this film and some of which Rublev seems to ask himself illustrated by at first a naive belief in the good in all humanity then disillusion and eventually a rekindling of faith but it makes the montage of Rublev's work at the end of the film all the more effective since it creates an understanding of the pain and anguish that lie behind these images.To regard Andrei Rublev as one movie assuming that the general definition of a movie is simply a big chunk of storyline would do some injustice to the brilliantly unorthodox nature of its narrative in that it's a collection of eight ministory lines all of which can be viewed as individual pieces and three of which could easily pass as masterpieces in their own right. My personal favourite is the third one Rublev's dialogue with Theophanes The Greek over the selfdestructive nature of humanity is to me at least one of the most moving moments on film this is possibly due to Theophanes voicing an opinion I personally arrived at some time before initially watching this film  and one I unfortunately happen to agree with.Like most of Tarkovsky's movies Andrei Rublev demands repeated viewings so the film can be absorbed and understood in full. But by doing so you'll begin to realise that this is possibly the most rewarding of all cinematic works and consequently the most wonderful. The best film ever made? I certainly think so.".

	onyx:emotionText "As someone who has seen this movie roughly five times and regards it as the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema I find it difficult to fathom how anyone can think that Andrei Rublev is slow or boring. It is true that it's slowpaced and perhaps too demanding in its unconventional structure of narrative but I would prefer this to anything commercial cinema releases in its quest to appeal to as broad a market a possible. In other words given the choice between a film that treats its audience with respect and gives you enough credit to assume you are willing to sit through roughly three hours of lengthy dialogue and long takes not to mention some of the most mesmerisingly beautiful visuals ever seen on screen and one which treats its audience like a demographic that can be appealed to like consumers not individuals with their own dreams fears hopes and aspirations I know which type of cinema truly bores me.It is often the case that art serves as a mechanism used to comment on social or individuals ills rarely however if at all does it reflect on itself and its own function to humanity. This is what makes Andrei Rublev a unique and important film since it addresses the role of the artist in the world. Any questions regarding historical accuracy or rather lack thereof towards Rublev's personal life are slightly pointless since the character is merely used as a vehicle to drive the thematic elements of the narrative. That's not to say that Rublev here is an empty shell it's simply that Tarkovsky used him as a means to impose his personal views on the subject. Why create art? Does being an artist mean expressing love for humanity? If so why should one express love for something which seems to hate itself?

	schema:reviewBody "This film is impossible to understand at once. You need to watch it at least twice to be able to understand something. At first it seems to be an abstract arthouse film about a painter in the 15th century a film which talks about one artist's plight towards his own ideals in difficult times a philosophicalhistorical movie. And it may be the part of the great Tarkovsky's intention.Yet as you watch it twice you realize that it is also about religion. And about the ideal of man. The first scene clearly shows how man has always strived to reach towards something higher and how he often failed. This film is also about human nature as always in Tarkovsky's films. We follow Andrei through his dark and troubled times and adventures and of special importance is the Tatar attack part. Here we see Tarkovsky depict the everlasting hunger for power and the effect it can have on a man. The Russian prince betrays his own country and must stand trial to his own conscience after watching the town of Vladimir get destroyed by the horde of wild Tatars. The scene in the church is also of greater significance as is the river scene with the pagan festival. They all show the conflict of religions and also moral values.All said the movie wouldn't be as great without the last part the one with the boy and the church bell. It illustrates the rebirth of Russia Christian Russia and the final scene with the hoisting of the bell is one of the best scenes ever in film history. It shows us that faith is a feeble thingif the bell didn't work everything would have ended differently. But thanks to a boy's dedication and hard work the bell tolled and the faith returned to the feeble heads and hearts of people.The miraculous sudden appearance of color in the very end and the wonderfulsolemn music really highlight the ultimate message of this film. Which isart is sacred and immortal and transcends time.At the time of its release I believe only Tarkovsky himself and perhaps Andrey Kontchalovsky the cowriter knew just how great a masterpiece this film really is. It has taken the world some time to discover it but it was worth it. With perfect acting specially by Anatoli Solonytsin perfect music perfect screenplay and perfect direction what else can I give it but a perfect 10?".

If you can get past any preconceived notions of what the movie is going to be likeand just sit down for a few seconds and watch it you will probably be able to see from the beginning that this is an extremely important unmissable film  not to mention captivating and exciting although very dark and disturbing throughout. The amount of skill and thought and work that went into this film echoes within the timeless imagery that the director has created. Any serious fan of the cinema would be doing themselves a serious disservice by avoiding this movie any longer. If you interested in the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky you'll be able to take something of another level from this film as there are many subtle references and parallels to their writings and teachings throughout this movie. It could be argued that the film itself is a cinematic representation of the law of three. Regardless this is a truly extraordinary thing to behold.".

Of these Malick is more abstractly sensual.After all Tarkovsky must deal with that dark cloth of Russian selfpity that tradition of grand themes and epic fate something which does not burden Malick.

During the production he was cheating on her with who was to become his second wife. The girl goes off with a Tartar leaving Rublev. Many other scenes refer to Rublev's situation resolved by Tarkovsky's action. For instance we have a sequence where Rublev hesitates to paint a scene of fateful pain. This is followed by Tarkovsky doing just that. The extension of metaphor among parts of the film ballooner and bellringer to Rublev's story extends from the film to the filmmaker and thence from him to us.What I found even more interesting was his confidence in complex compositions and long long multiperspective tracking shots. Compared to other swoopers this camera seems curious impetuous not at all as if the shots were planned. Hard to believe it is only his second feature. This alone expands one's imagination with only a couple viewings but combined with the notion of folded metaphor including visual metaphor it becomes a truly great and singular work.Some classical symmetries touch multiple places a jester within the play solitude in the context of relationship creating in the unknown broken symmetry through one twin killing another.

	schema:reviewBody "Just as Andrei Rublev faced doubt about whether or not having sinned he could continue his celebrated iconography I likewise find myself in two minds about Andrei Tarkovsky's film. My experience with the director's other work is as usual limited but I still couldn't shake that persistent expectation that I would love 'Andrei Rublev 1969.' There is certainly much to love about it but my appreciation for the film can best be described as admiration rather than affection and though I can speak with only the utmost praise for Tarkovsky's achievement it doesn't occupy that exclusive space close to my heart. The film is a deeplypersonal religious work an examination of faith and moral values and so perhaps it's inevitable that the film didn't leave such a deep impression considering my preference towards atheism one unfortunately cannot discard all personal convictions for the mere purposes of appreciating a work of art. I do however like to think that the majesty of cinema in most cases is able to transcend religious boundaries.Andrei Tarkovsky released his first featurelength film 'Ivan's Childhood' in 1962. Even prior to its release the director had already expressed interest in filming the life of great Russian iconographer Andrei Rublev even though very little is actually known about his life. Working with a screenplay written by himself and Andrei Konchalovsky Tarkvosky began filming in 1964 and a 205minute cut was screened for a private audience in Moscow in 1966. The critical response however was mixed and sizeable cuts were made to the film's running time before a 186minute version screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. I'm not entirely sure which version I ended up watching the time counter indicated somewhere around 165 minutes though my brief research couldn't uncover any major missing sequences. In hindsight I should probably have held out for longer and acquired the Criterion Collection DVD which restores the picture to its fourhour glory. In several years' time when I inevitably decide to revisit Tarkovsky's film I'll make certain to do just that.'Andrei Rublev' is divided into nine distinct segments including a colour epilogue displaying Rublev's weathered icons as they exist today. They each explore a facet of the great painter's life placing particular emphasis on his faith in God and how it relates to his work on frescos and icons. Interestingly though Rublev Anatoli Solonitsyn himself appears in most of the stories he is often hidden in the background a passive observer on the behaviour of others including Kirill Ivan Lapikov who is jealous of Rublev's recognition and young Boriska Nikolai Burlyayev who successfully casts a bell using faith rather than knowledge. One consequence of this narrative format is a lack of cohesiveness in Tarkovsky's storytelling. We adequately follow the plot of each segment but as the whole the film doesn't seem to build towards any notable climactic revelation  the completed film is equal to the sum of its parts which is still very impressive but pulls it short of being a masterpiece. Once again however I must acknowledge that the 205minute version may potentially correct this problem.One statement that can not be disputed however is that 'Andrei Rublev' really is a beautiful piece of filmmaking. Vadim Yusov's blackandwhite photography captures the exquisite delicateness of nature with almost heartbreaking intricacy even the raindrops of a midday shower are imbued with the gentle elegance of the Heaven from which they ostensibly fell. Tarkovsky finds simple beauty in the quiver of a tree branch in the breeze the leisurely flow of a river herds of livestock fleeing from an aerial balloon. In portraying the complete opposite the destruction of nature the director is capable but not quite the master he is otherwise. The raiding of Vladimir by a troop of Tatars was obviously supposed to be the centrepiece of the picture but Tarkovsky underplays every detail to such an extent that his chaos ultimately winds down into a staged conflict. Compare this sequence with Sergei Bondarchuk's burning of Moscow in 'War and Peace 1967' in which one feels as though he has descended into the fires of Hell and the contrast is telling.".

	schema:reviewBody "After being tortured with poor Russian filmmaking for my first three outings  One Day In the Life of Ivan Denisovich 1970 Night Watch 2004 and Russian Ark 2002  I was lucky enough to experience the greatness of Andrei Tarkovsky with four consecutive quality films  Solaris 1972 Stalker 1979 The Mirror 1975 and Ivan's Childhood 1962  the last of which is no less than spectacular. Riding on cloud 9 I popped Andrei Rublev into my DVD player with quiet anticipation as this film is considered by many to be Tarkovsky's greatest film and one of the best films ever made.Sufficed to say that my excitement subsided slightly after a ridiculous opening air balloon sequence and dissipated completely within the first hour of mindnumbing boredom. Tarkovsky's trademark atmospherics are nowhere to be found the dialogue consists of tireless sermonizing and the scoring is hopelessly overdramatic. I can't believe that this film was made by the same director of the aforementioned quality films. This outing feels like one of those overhyped Hollywood classics that are moreso exercises in amateurish moviemaking that are lucky enough to earn recognition from nostalgic sympathy alone. Overpraised poorly made tripe like this is why many people refuse to watch older movies.Now I've read a boatload of positive reviews that point out the various symbols and hidden meanings within this film so I revisited certain portions with added vigor. To my disappointment however the film continued to hold no more interest than an instruction manual. Give me a 150minute Yasujiro Ozu film any day of the week and I'll eat through it in one sitting. But Andrei Rublev is dry comainducing cinema at its worst. I'm sure film students and their kin will love dissecting the various camera angles but the entertainment value of this film is near zilch. Unlike some of the PETA nutcases here who rate this film a 110 due to horsekillings I dislike Andrei Rublev because it's quite simply an incredibly dull film. The running time is about an hour too long. Disregarding the fact that selfcongratulatory pretentious directors like Peter Jackson and Akira Kurosawa would find much to like in an additional 60 minutes of nothingness tacked onto an already stretched out movie I need to apply my objectivity and point out that Andrei Rublev is sheer torture to sit through from beginning to end. Nostalghia 1983 is nearly as torturous by the way.Overly long blandly shot frequently silly and hopelessly dull this exercise in overdramatic fluff proves once and for all that most people have no taste in film whatsoever. There's no valid reason for this pile of horse manure to be considered a better film than the excellent Ivan's Childhood. I know that fans of arthouse movies frequently lack the inner strength to criticize a film such as this but some objectivity would be appreciated for those of us who care more for entertaining cinema than directorial pandering. Every director has some duds in their portfolio. Live with it.One thing that surprises me is how a frankly religious film such as this is uniformly praised by IMDb users. Most of the users I know are raving liberal atheists with a giant stick up their rearend so it's interesting to see them pine over this movie like nobrain lemmings. I guess artsy pretentiousness automatically overrides their fanatical hatred for religion because the superficial preachy ramblings are laid on thick and fast in Andrei Rublev. How do all of these naturalists reconcile their subconscious thoughts  which are probably uttering the word bullsht after every line of dialogue in this movie  with their snobby lust for arthouse trash? I would pay for the research funds if a psychologist wished to perform this study. Incredibly interesting stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more I explore Tarkovsky the more I get confused. No don't take me wrong I get confused in which movie of his should be my favorite. Ivan Solaris Stalker all were 910 that is I simply loved all those but after watching this I have to rate this as 1110 and my favorite AK's creation but it doesn't seem very real as all his other movies so far I have seen are all simply beautiful. AK's movies are the link between me and Russia as I am not Russian and don't even know their language culture or even country very well. So after watching his work it seems to me as if I am getting closer to the country and everything about it. It's an amazing experience for me as a viewer and a person.Now talking about Rublev this movie is rather than a story of Rublev is a story of his times times he lived in. Turbulent times that Russia in general went through as he lived in it as a painter. I think this is a major point why this movie is so good and works so well. The photography is amazing each frame of the movie is actually as if a work of painter background score is too good blends very well with the scenes acting too is good especially the main central role. He makes you feel his problems worries soul search all as real. Coming to direction it is undoubtedly one of the best works of Tarkovsky and I wonder why this movie is not listed in any of the top 100 movies of all time as a matter of fact any other Tarkovsky's movies. Each frame of the movie is picture perfect right from the opening scene when a man is trying to fly in the hot balloon to the end when the bell is tolled perfectly to the great art work of Tarkovsky in real. The movie has all the Tarkovsky's signature element in them beautiful use of earth elements air water and fire to the great effect as well his soul searching God related questions answers explanation and all. Also most important point for many movie goers who criticize him for his slow paced movies this one is very different from his other movies even though it's long but not for a single second you will feel bored as it is not slow paced and keeps you engaged in the story. Rating 1110. I cannot wait to explore his other movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "To review Tarkovsky's crowning achievement one must realize that this is a film that goes above and beyond what anything from any other filmmaker is capable of. Andrei Rublev is a film that goes beyond the capacity of conventional cinema art film or otherwiseand becomes the essence of film as art. Andrei Rublev ceases to proclaim a message as many other films but rather offers what every filmmaker strives for a look at why art exists and its role in life for all beings. Andrei Rublev is a film that won't speak to everybody it won't even speak to all artists but to those it speaks to will become moved in ways unimaginable. The film captures not only the essence of the artist's purpose but also our purposes as individuals.The film begins with a short scene wherein a man tries to fly but comes crashing down witnessed only by a horse. This short scene alone offers so much the man representing the fall of all men or our need to become above other creatures the horse representing life or loneliness and the barren countryside representing a world that is unfriendly to all men. This scene alone is up for multiple interpretations many of which would be equally right. The film never tells you how to look at it but allows you to bring your own philosophy and meaning to it. Ultimately its basic themes are vivid but its many meanings remain as ambiguous as ever countless viewings will bring more and more to the film and in truth it is probably impossible to fully fathom the meaning of it. As with all great art it must be experienced and made to relate to one personally to find its meaning it cannot just be viewed and admired.The vivid themes of the film come from the ideas of art man's need for art and the artist's role in history. Andrei Rublev is a film that deals with both the futility of being a Christian artist in a Godless world and with the impact art can have to bring God to a more personal level. These themes are developed in seven stages each one differing immensely from the other with the core ideas and the artist Rublev being shared in every one. Though these themes seem to center around and deal exclusively with art they are very implicit to every human being's lifestyle. Art can be used as an allegory for our gifts the idea that we should not hide what we can offer the world just as the artist should not hide his art from the world. Our gifts and talents can be used to glorify God and bring hope even if the world does not have a lot of hope despite the often felt futility of doing what we are gifted in we bring goodness into the world through them.Ultimately the film offers this at its core however there are many more ideas and meanings the individual must bring out of the film to impart its full impact. Through patience and connections the viewer can make the film into a personal experience and in doing this may become moved deeper than ever before. After all isn't this every artists wish?".

	schema:reviewBody "The camera work in this movie is wonderful from start to end. Unfortunately the beauty of the camera work sometimes gets in the way of the storytelling. In almost every scene the camera lingers beautifully on scenes so that I both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. All of the acting is very good but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes not the actors.The story is episodic with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character a 15th century iconpainter. The first episode about people flying a hotair balloon seems to have no connection to the rest. In another episode Andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.A few of the episodes shared another connection besides having Andrei present. The connection is a pair of twin brothers both princes who hate each other. In one of those a prince guides a band of Tatar horsemen to Vladimir a town ruled by his brother. He invites the Tatars to loot it so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.One episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. Skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. It shows a band of workers who after building a palace for one of the twin princes set off to work on their next construction job. But their next employer is the prince's brother who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. The prince sends horsemen after them where they blind the unfortunate workers. OK no more spoilers.The best episodes are near the end. The main character in one of them is a woman Andrei had rescued during the attack on Vladimir. The woman was mute and somewhat disturbed possibly as a result of the attack. Similarly Andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. When Tatars appeared again she ran to their leader. Andrei tried to rescue her again but she resisted. Fortunately she turned out not to need a rescue that time.The final episode was the best of all and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. The teenage son of a bellmaker leads the casting of a huge church bell because all the other bellmakers had died of the plague and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bellmaking. It's a big job requiring construction of a casting pit a mold melting furnaces and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. He is very nervous because he's doing an expensive difficult uncertain job without his father's guidance for an employer who might kill him if he fails.I saw the director's original 205 minute version on the Criterion DVD. Soviet censors cut the movie troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists including moviemakers. Later distributors cut the movie further to make it accessible to a broader audience. While I would object to cuts for censorship I think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. Any editing to improve the storytelling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. For all its beauty I don't think there was even two hours of storytelling in this movie.".

In almost every scene the camera lingers beautifully on scenes so that I both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. All of the acting is very good but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes not the actors.The story is episodic with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character a 15th century iconpainter. The first episode about people flying a hotair balloon seems to have no connection to the rest. In another episode Andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.A few of the episodes shared another connection besides having Andrei present. The connection is a pair of twin brothers both princes who hate each other. In one of those a prince guides a band of Tatar horsemen to Vladimir a town ruled by his brother. He invites the Tatars to loot it so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.One episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. Skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. It shows a band of workers who after building a palace for one of the twin princes set off to work on their next construction job. But their next employer is the prince's brother who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. The prince sends horsemen after them where they blind the unfortunate workers. OK no more spoilers.The best episodes are near the end. The main character in one of them is a woman Andrei had rescued during the attack on Vladimir. The woman was mute and somewhat disturbed possibly as a result of the attack. Similarly Andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. When Tatars appeared again she ran to their leader. Andrei tried to rescue her again but she resisted. Fortunately she turned out not to need a rescue that time.The final episode was the best of all and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. The teenage son of a bellmaker leads the casting of a huge church bell because all the other bellmakers had died of the plague and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bellmaking. It's a big job requiring construction of a casting pit a mold melting furnaces and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. He is very nervous because he's doing an expensive difficult uncertain job without his father's guidance for an employer who might kill him if he fails.I saw the director's original 205 minute version on the Criterion DVD. Soviet censors cut the movie troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists including moviemakers. Later distributors cut the movie further to make it accessible to a broader audience. While I would object to cuts for censorship I think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. Any editing to improve the storytelling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. For all its beauty I don't think there was even two hours of storytelling in this movie.";

The mystery emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of.  This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month's long visit.  The Russian people among the dearest I have known have suffered as have few others in all of history.  The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones.  The music if not in a minor key evokes minor key emotions.  The literature even with Gogol clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar.  Therefore it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov.  However the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive.  The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film.  I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks.  It may sound hyperbolic but I found this film absolutely lifechanging.  I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage.  Moreover I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country.  Indeed this film has changed my life.  I cannot recommend it too highly.".

Then 3 guys are leaving somewhere they are painters you find out later they are also monks. They stop at a stable full of unfunny jesters to escape from a storm. Some guys come and take one of the jesters away and bash his head into a tree. Then they smash his balalaika. Why? Who are they? Then a church painter asks one of the monks to be his assistant. The monk says only if he comes to the monastery and asks him in front of Andrej Rublev a famous painter. Why? The church painter sends someone else to the monastery to ask Andrej Rublev to be his assistant instead. Why? This pisses the monk off and he disses everyone in the monastery then takes off. His dog follows him so he beats it to death with a stick. Why? Then a monk and his assistant are wondering in the woods and they come across some old guy who has ants crawling up his legs. He slaps the assistant. Why? Then some people are in the woods and some guys ride up on horses and gouge their eyes out. Who are these people? Then Andrej is very upset and smears something on a wall. It is after the people have had their eyes gouged out so is it blood? This is a b  w movie. It looks chunky on his fingers. Paint? He is supposed to be painting the wall. The some woman comes along and touches the stuff on the wall and smells it a few times then starts crying then smears it around with her hands. Who is she? More disjointed slowmoving confusing scenes such as these and no character development. I didn't watch the second tape yes there's 2 tapes of this stuff. I had to force myself to watch the first tape all the way through. It didn't even have beautiful cinematography. On the box it says dazzling a masterpiece beautiful harrowing mesmerizing soaring majestic an adventure hypnotic beauty a wild epic... What?

Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God the Artist and the Power. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me the last chapter of the film The Bell is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it.

Basically this story divided into eight episodes charts the life of the famous iconic painter artist Andrei Rublev Anatoli Solonitsyn who lives in 15th Century Russia. The film is essentially a study and insight into the meaningfulness and importance of art religion and faith and how these ideas are challenged with the events played out. The historical events that occur include an attempt at the first hot air balloon the decoration of Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow and of course the Tsardom of Russia which included the invasion by the Tatar people. Starring Ivan Lapikov as Kirill Nikolai Grinko as Danil Chorny Nikolai Sergeyev as Theophanes the Greek Irma Raush as Idiot Girl Durochka Nikolay Burlyaev as Boriska Yuriy Nazarov as The Grand Prince  His Brother The Lesser Prince and Rolan Bykov as The Jester. In the leading role Solonitsyn is a good noble character with a keen eye for his works being set in a medieval period the most memorable scenes for me were the battle sequences a crucifixion the unearthing raising and ringing of a large bell and a short breakaway from black and white to colour to see the real works of Rublev I will confess I found it hard to understand what was going on but for the imagery such as costume and sets this is a worthwhile biographical drama.

	schema:reviewBody "Boaz Yakin the enormously talented writerdirector of Fresh has done the impossible a real movie about real things that offers a sharp contrast with other films about the subject we have seen before. Mr. Yakin working with what appears to be a cast of non professional actors mainly presents a gripping tale of life in the ghetto that will probably be a classic in this genre.If you haven't seen the film please stop reading now.Fresh is the young boy at the center of the action. We follow him as he runs illegal drugs for the dealers of his area. Fresh comes from a broken home where the mother is not around and the father is absent from the picture. His kind aunt Frances has gathered about a dozen youngsters in the home she shares with her mother who is the grandmother of all of them. In spite of the poor surroundings this is a decent home.Fresh probably learned quickly in his young life he must be a step ahead of the drug dealers and their henchmen in order to survive in that world. It's a heavy trip for a young child to deal with in his own life and still have a head in his shoulders. What Fresh does of course is illegal but this is a determined young man that is looking for a better future in spite of what he sees around him.Fresh loves to play chess. We watch him win games in Washington Square Park over more skilled players. Sam his absent father is a master of the game. Sam teaches his son the game and how to think the way the champions do. Sam is a highly intelligent man who has had the misfortune of falling victim to the bottle. His son admires him but bears a resentment against him for abandoning him and Nicole his sister. One thing is sure Sam always wins when he plays Fresh. Only after all the big events at the end of the film Fresh beats the old man up. In doing so we see tears coming out of him because maybe then Fresh realizes the enormity of the events he's been involved in and the fact that his father in yelling at him perhaps shows the boy how much he cares for him.There is a scene in the film involving pit bull fighting that will make even the coolest viewer cringe. Fresh's dog wins a match but it is a menace that has to be put to sleep. The scene where Fresh hangs the dog by his collar is one of the most horrible things we watch in the movie. Fresh is venting his frustration at a dog he clearly loved but now he cannot keep. The acting by all the principals is first rate. The only problem is that sometimes some of what he hear in the dialog is incomprehensible because of the use of street slang most of the viewers don't know. Sean Nelson makes a perfect Fresh. He is one of the most natural actors we have seen in a while. The lack of formal training works out as we watch a portrayal that is devoid of any mannerisms or other cute poses that someone with more experience would have done with this role.Samuel L. Jackson makes another incredible appearance as Fresh's father Sam. Mr. Jackson's take on this man is an excellent example why he is on of the best actors working in films today. Giancarlo Esposito as Esteban the nasty drug dealer adds another great role to his brilliant film career. Adam Holender the cinematographer has given the film the right look. The dreamy scenes where Fresh is seen looking toward Manhattan at different times of the day is pure poetry. This is an important movie dealing with an important subject. Thanks to Mr. Yakin we go into that world that for some of us might as well be in another continent but never right here in another part of town!".

This is NOT a typical 'hood' film  there are no banging hiphop beats no flash cars and no cheesy action scenes.It tells the story of a clever 12 year old brought up in a culture of danger mistrust and urban decay. Sean Nelson displays a maturity which would guarantee any adult actor many millions a film and the film never wavers from the incredibly high standards set by its fabulous scripting and casting. The storyline is oddly compelling throughout and never veers either towards the 'nannying' line that plagues so many drugs films or the insane satire that kills off others. It moves at a healthy but not crazy pace and there are some truly chilling moments which really make you ponder over humanity's capacity for mindless violence.This is certainly the best film I have ever had the pleasure of seeing and I advise anyone who craves intelligent thoughtful films to go out and buy this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now I have witnessed the third truly great film to have come out of America in 1994.  One that can hold its own and more against such films released that year as Pulp Fiction Natural Born Killers and Vanya on 42nd Street.  It's called Fresh and I'll go out on a limb to say it's as powerful an urban drama as any other I've seen in my life.There are no fancy cinematic magic tricks going on in this film aside from an instance of superimposed images that is so simple it almost seems like a throwback to old silent dramas.  There are no choreographed gun fights no switching film stocks to produce psychedelic effects nothing like that. Not to say that these things cannot be used appropriately and judiciously to enhance the effect of a particular film but Fresh is stripped bare and must depend on its performances direction and writing alone.For starters a young Sean Nelson delivers a performance that puts the lion's share of veteran actors to shame.  He's completely lacking in selfconsciousness almost like he's unaware that the camera is on him for nine out of ten of the shots in Fresh.  His character for which the film takes its title may be the smartest youth in motion picture history for whom genius is not a gimmick or a joke i.e. Good Will Hunting Real Genius stuff like that.  Watching him you see a wise old actor in a teen's body he does not act any emotions or thoughts but merely feels them and thinks them.  He seems to embody bits of screen legend  a little Bogart stalwartness there some of Jimmy Stewart's quiet charm here and most of all Morgan Freeman's ability to communicate much while doing or saying very little.That'd be just enough for most movies but Nelson is backed by a choice supporting cast the two most recognizable names are obviously Samuel L. Jackson Fresh's chessmasteralcoholic father and Giancarlo Esposito the slimy highliving drug dealer Esteban and both are perfect in awardcaliber performances.  Two lesser known actors N'Bushe Wright Fresh's junkie sister Nichole and Jean LaMare as Jake the hot tempered lowmanonthetotempole employee of Corky are also terrific in key roles.The screenplay by director Boaz Yakin is doggedly unpredictable but in retrospect it all makes perfect sense  nothing in the movie pushes the bounds of credibility.  I've seen truckloads of thrillers most of them are wearily proficient at making you guess what's next.  None but a few however kept me guessing WHEN to guess or surprised me with such affecting emotional developments.  None but a few moved along with such selfassured grace and style.  Fresh knows its territory the time and place it's set in and it provides characters who talk like they do in real life  not ones that sound like they're in a movie where they talk like they do in real life.The use of violence is admirably restrained.  Most of it takes place off camera silhouetted or cut away from quickly.  The two scenes of bloodletting when they are shown to us are literally heartbreaking.  Not only does Fresh keep us off guard on a psychological level but on an emotional one as well something few films ever think of doing.If I were to offer one criticism it would be that the chess metaphor was pressed just a bit too hard by Yakin though the final scene is devastating  we already know that this kid is thinking like a master strategist we don't need quite so many shots of him playing the game in his room.  That's a small quibble though because the chess metaphor is entirely appropriate and Jackson's early speech about the game is an ingenious device.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fresh is one of those movies that you never see coming. From the opening credits until the end it provides you with this deep gritty yet utterly realistic portrayal of a youth's mind on the streets. While our normal society will shrug a struggling African American living in the ghetto as someone without the intelligence to go forward in life. It is a sad reality in which we live but it is a thought that goes through suburbia's minds. This film proves the ageold saying that you should never judge a book by its cover. What begins as a normal urban drama quickly unfolds into this tightly woven crime story where we have this unexpected hero that arrives from nowhere to pull of this incredible feat. With perfect acting the right combination of drama and action coupled with suspense and a story that literally keeps you glued to your seat until the very end it surprises me that more people haven't discovered this cinematic gem and attached themselves to it.To begin Sean Nelson is brilliant. I have not seen better acting from a young adult in my entire film life. Dakota Fanning comes close but Nelson's emotion seems to be raw and uncreated by Hollywood. His reactions and passion behind his eyes is intense and compelling at the same time. You cannot watch this movie without keeping your eyes glued to this kid. I am very surprised that he has not done more roles that would be able to showcase this young protg's talent. He interacts well with the other actors as well giving us this rare glimpse into a world that many of us may not be familiar with. He takes us away from the clichd child abandoned on the streets with nothing to loose and gives us faith in the family structure and bonds that are created between humans. Sometimes I think we forget this as we watch our televisions buy our cars and spend our money. There are important aspects in life but at times our ideas of that can be skewed. That is what I love about Sean's role in this film. He defines himself early and allows us to see his change clearly throughout the film. He begins as wanting to have a lot of money and power to using what he has earned to save his family and his friends. There is something redeemable about that which isn't shown as much in films today.Add to the brilliant work of Sean Nelson are a couple of actors that really played well of the emotional child. Giancarlo Esposito N'Bushe Wright JeanClaude La Marre Ron Brice and the unquenchable Sam Jackson are just a few. Nelson's ability to play off Jackson's intensity with the greatest of ease is just another glowing example of the power behind this film. You can honestly see where Fresh's talent began with the strong fatherson dynamic that director Boaz Yakin has created. Yakin has crafted this beautiful story of a child's inner demons and desires with the greatest of ease. As a director he has pulled more emotion out of these children than I have ever seen with any other child actors. Where he takes his story is bold and realistic. The dirtiness and grime of the streets contrasted with the intelligence of this child was nerve racking and intense. I loved it. Yakin had to be proud of himself to find such a great cast to work with as well as create this story that could be enjoyed by audience throughout the ages.Finally I would like to comment on one of the most important themes of this film that I didn't realize until closer to the end. Chess is a huge element in this film and at first you will not see this but by the end it will hit you like a brick. The power that Jackson brings to this young boy's mind simply by teaching him the strategies of chess is insurmountable. While I thought that Yakin was just trying to define the fatherson relationship with this game there was so much more going on underneath the top layer that I wasn't expecting it from this small title. I think that is what impressed me so much.Overall this film is great. It is boldly honest and originally beautiful in repetition of myself that needs to be rereleased or remembered time after time. I am so glad that I discovered it and cannot wait to show it to friends and family. It is nothing short of the perfect film! Grade  out of ".

Itstands out head and shoulders above the rest as an engaging andintelligent film. Part of 'Fresh's strength is that it beliesmany of the genre's expected conventions.

Unspoiled by the gangsta rap and glamorisation of street culture that normally pervades a 'black' film it tells the story of the 12year old chessplaying drugdealing streetwise genius Fresh.Living in poverty with 11 others in his aunt's house and using his wits to survive he slowly gets trapped deeper and deeper in the world of drugs a world in which all his loyalties are challenged.Most 'hood films either satirise black culture completely with their loud cool attitudes or on the other become touchyfeely antidrugs schmaltz. This is the ONLY film I have seen to tread the thin line between them and come away looking not only credible but superbly enjoyable.Both Giancarlo Esposito the smooth talking drugs dealer and Samuel L. Jackson the alcoholic chessmaster tramp give strong realistic performances in challenging roles. The other characters like N'Bushe Wright's portrayal of Fresh's sister are also incredibly well played and every single one of them is believable.However the main credit HAS to go to Sean Nelson. I have never seen such a dignified performance and i can honestly say that I was AMAZED at how involving the film was. You could empathise with him every step of the way. He was never overly emotional yet never came across as being arrogant and calculating. He plays the 'streetwise genius' role to perfection again remaining completely credible.The script was also fantastic. Full marks to Boaz Yakin for such an accurate picture of life in the ghetto. This is not a film for those who want the cheap formulaic thrills of violence sex and guns that are so prevalent today. There are no special effects no overly violent scenes. Instead the movie relies on superb acting and a relentless drive for gritty realism.I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone who appreciates drama  it will really open your eyes.".

N'Bushe Wright shows up in her most depressing role as Fresh's underconfident sister  you really feel sorry for her in this as well as a few others. Giancarlo Esposito is cool to watch as Esteban A drug dealer that looks out for Fresh and the other toptier performance comes in the form of Ron Brice as Corky the other drug dealer who is ruthless and demands that you do what you have to while he's looking and not behind his back.  We already know Samuel L. Jackson would give a good performance that's no surprise at all. Good story about the ghetto life and the drug game from the eyes of those around it.  The ending in this epitomizes the saying every man for himselfanother gunshot in the air for the ghetto genre 1010".

This movie is one of the few that is close to cinematic perfection...yes it's THAT good.Young Michael or Fresh witnesses the horrors of street life every day. His mother is gone his father is a virtual bum he loses his friends to violence his sister is a prostitute and he is a runner for the drug lords of his neighborhood.  Not surprisingly Fresh isn't content with his lifestyle and is determined to make life better not only for him but for his sister as well.The movie sounds like a standard cliche film but this is far from the truth.  Fresh is a breath of fresh air in the realm of movie redundancy and predictability.  There is no overacting use of gratuitous violence or sex or unbelievable plots to spoil this little gem.  Young Sean Nelson is as gifted as any veteran actor and carries this movie on his small shoulders. Yes he is simply that good.  Fortunately he is supported by a fabulous cast in Samuel Jackson as his father N'Bushe Wright as his prostitue sister and Giancarlo Esposito as the local drug dealer. There are no big budget shootouts no computer enhanced scenes or ridiculously cliche special effects.  No Fresh relies on the very basics of moviemaking acting plot setting and direction.  And it succeeds where so many others  have failed.All of this is woven into an intelligent and entertaining movie that is as close to perfection as Pulp Fiction.  Undoubtedly it is that good.Fresh earns a 10 out of 10 stars rating and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys seeing what movies SHOULD be.".

	schema:headline " Excellent cross of hood movie and thriller with great delivery across acting score cinematography and direction";
	schema:reviewBody "If you will allow me a personal moment Fresh was one of the films that I saw at a time when I was really in love with film. I had just moved to England in 1995 and had gone from being a 20 minute drive to a small multiplex chain cinema to being a 5 minute walk away from the Light House independent cinema in Wolverhampton. Not only was it close but it was cheap and I would regularly go there to see films big and small. I was lucky because this rough period was throwing up things like Usual Suspects Pulp Fiction and many other really strong films. Fresh was one of these and I remembered thinking it was great but not having seen it since I wasn't sure if maybe the period in my life was also giving it a rosetinted memory in my head.I watched it again last night and did so as a different person  35 instead of 18 living comfortably instead of a struggling student regardless of time and place though the film still gripped me from start to finish and justifies my memory of it being an excellent film. The plot starts out as a ghetto film that fits into the genre of the early 90's Menace II Society Boyz n the Hood etc but then in the middle it becomes much more of a thriller where young Fresh tries to turn the table on his dealing employers in revenge for the murder of one of his friends. Both parts of the film work equally well and merge into each other seamlessly. Just like the construction of the city environment in the opening titles the film builds on the details and at times the viewer will be a few steps behind Fresh in terms of his plan. It is a dangerous game and there are quite brutal moments in it but these just help up the tension of which there is lots.Yakin directs really well throughout the film and is aided by excellent cinematography capturing a sense of place really well. The patient orchestral score also fits with this and the slower pace that it can at times have however all of these qualities however good they are tend to get lost in the background of the praise because front and centre is a terrific performance from a very young Sean Nelson. He is the heart of the film and the ability to deliver his character is key  and he nails it. Fresh isn't on a moral quest for what is right he is very much on a personal mission and he does it by playing cynically with those around him making sacrifices of both himself and of them. It is a great performance throughout and it is hard to imagine anyone else but him in that role  perfect bit of casting. That he stands up on his own with such a strong support cast is also impressive. Esposito is great despite hamming up his accent and his abs a little bit  amusing to watch this character back through the filter of Breaking Bad as well! Jackson was pushing to the front on the DVD cover due to Pulp Fiction's success but he is only in a small role albeit a good one. Beyond them La Marre Brice Wright and others are also good.Almost twenty years old Fresh is an excellent film that is well made across the board as both a hood movie and a thriller  my memory was not faded this is a great film.".

Its a coming of age story like no other he goes through school crushes friends fights and his parents but set in the projects where violence and drugs are a commonplace. In fact it would be an insult to pigeonhole this movie into one genre it is one of the best dramas and action movies I have ever seen. The final scene was such a devastating moment and I'll admit I started weeping. Rarely do I cry because of a movie and even rarer will I admit to it. Go see this movie you won't regret it.".

I caught this movie midway through in the middle of the night on one of the movie channels. I was intrigued by the honesty of the characters the lines and the idea of Samuel L. Jackson in a cameo. Fresh as he is known is a boy dealing with the harsh realities of inner city life and a broken family but rises above his circumstances although he is walking in them. This movie is a drama and a thriller. Just a heads up there is a lot of brash language and situations but none gratuitous and no glamorization of crime. I found it to be a deep thoughtful heartwrenching tale of the realities of life's circumstances and how one little hero overcame through the wisdom of chess.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie did a lot for me and it is my hope that other new viewers will feel the same. The proof of the power of the film grabs you from the beginning with the simple musical texture of the film score by Stewart Copeland coupled with the piece by piece layering of the street scenery. It is unique and perfect revealed as an even more appropriate detail to the movie as more of the plot themes are revealed. The main character in the movie Fresh is played by a really exceptional young actor Sean Nelson who manages to steal scenes from two of my other favorite actors Samuel L. Jackson and Giancarlo Esposito. I am trying to remember the other movies that came out in 1994 and recall why one as powerful as this one would not receive much consideration for the Academy Awards that year. It was a good year for movies  Pulp Fiction The Shawshank Redemption 7 nominations but no Oscars Ed Wood Hoop Dreams received no nominations and on a lesser scale Forrest Gump which you'll recall received the majority of Oscars  but regardless 'Fresh' should have been recognized even amongst that competition. The sad truth realized from all this is that voting is usually conducted along white lines based upon publicity demographics and exposure rather than upon quality lines.Accusations have been thrown out there a number of times in the past and unfortunately the majority of those accusations are true. I used to deny the possibility for bias when movies like 'Amistad' received attention for not getting its share but the difference there was that 'Amistad' was not a good movie and 'Fresh' was an exceptional movie. The two are united only by their nonwhite content and not by their level of quality.Also a surprise for me is the background of the writerdirector Boaz Yakin. He is not AfricanAmerican yet the dialogue of his characters holds an authenticity of the New York streets which is phenomenal. I understand his next movie concerns Orthodox Jewish characters leading me to my final question  Who is this guy and where did he come from? No matter.".

	schema:headline " Best 'Hood Film Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "With the 1990s came the release of major motion pictures dedicated to presenting Black urban life in the United States from Black perspectives. The only predecessors of these films were either Blaxploitation films or White perspective productions with ambiguous glimpses into the essence of Black city life at best.  Until such films as Boyz 'N' The Hood and Juice Black youths had to depend on either White film executives or Spike Lee if they wanted to see familiar situations in major films.Since John Singleton's masterpiece many producers and directors followed suit with their own version of what some like to call 'hood movies after Singleton's Boyz 'N' The Hood.  Even Oliver Stone managed to concoct an exceptional addition South Central to his list of film excellence.  He even managed it without his trademark artsy camera tricks he used in JFK and Natural Born Killers which were excellent films nonetheless.The 'hood movie has one defining attribute.  It is a fulllength feature film with the United States Black andor Hispanic urban neighborhood experience as the dominant theme.  This disqualifies Dennis Hopper's Colors because cops were the main focus Sugar Hill and New Jack City they were more gangster dramas than 'hood films and Master P's I'm 'Bout It which was a gangsta rap teenybop fairytale at best.Fresh is the first and perhaps the last motion picture to bring the 'hood film to the drama level of The Godfather.  Anyone who appreciates Mario Puzo's masterpiece brought to life by Francis Ford Coppola should appreciate this film.  There are no scenes with gratuitous sex or violence.  The one instance of nudity may have been unnecessary but it wasn't tasteless.  The violence shown isn't glorified humorized nor emphasized.Unlike other 'hood films Fresh does not need an urban contemporary soundtrack infested with gangsta rap and R  B ballads to sell nor enhance it.  Such music has its place in Singleton's 'Hood and many other films but to add the like to Fresh would have been unnecessary and perhaps a mistake.The dramatic vigor of Fresh is unprecedented in 'hood films because the story does not insult the viewers' intelligence as compared to Menace II Society in which the main character's father shoots a man seven or eight times with a revolver a type of gun that exists mostly as a five or sixshooter in reality.The biggest contrast between Fresh and such films as Menace II Society is that Fresh refuses to appeal to the least common viewing denominator while Menace II Society thrives on it.  And while Boyz 'N' The Hood was indeed an outstanding film Fresh depends on no hip hop personalities to support its cast.  The reason why Fresh was never celebrated as the other 'hood films is because the film never celebrated itself.  It's like a platinum nugget in a pile of gold.  Relatively few people appreciate it but it's worth much more than its counterparts.".

This disqualifies Dennis Hopper's Colors because cops were the main focus Sugar Hill and New Jack City they were more gangster dramas than 'hood films and Master P's I'm 'Bout It which was a gangsta rap teenybop fairytale at best.Fresh is the first and perhaps the last motion picture to bring the 'hood film to the drama level of The Godfather.  Anyone who appreciates Mario Puzo's masterpiece brought to life by Francis Ford Coppola should appreciate this film.  There are no scenes with gratuitous sex or violence.  The one instance of nudity may have been unnecessary but it wasn't tasteless.  The violence shown isn't glorified humorized nor emphasized.Unlike other 'hood films Fresh does not need an urban contemporary soundtrack infested with gangsta rap and R  B ballads to sell nor enhance it.  Such music has its place in Singleton's 'Hood and many other films but to add the like to Fresh would have been unnecessary and perhaps a mistake.The dramatic vigor of Fresh is unprecedented in 'hood films because the story does not insult the viewers' intelligence as compared to Menace II Society in which the main character's father shoots a man seven or eight times with a revolver a type of gun that exists mostly as a five or sixshooter in reality.The biggest contrast between Fresh and such films as Menace II Society is that Fresh refuses to appeal to the least common viewing denominator while Menace II Society thrives on it.  And while Boyz 'N' The Hood was indeed an outstanding film Fresh depends on no hip hop personalities to support its cast.  The reason why Fresh was never celebrated as the other 'hood films is because the film never celebrated itself.  It's like a platinum nugget in a pile of gold.  Relatively few people appreciate it but it's worth much more than its counterparts.";

Now it was not all due to him as the story was so wellwritten and the acting is dead on for all the characters. Part of the reason I love it so much might be because I was a psychotherapist before becoming a school teacher midlife crisis you know. And having worked with dysfunctional families this movie gets it right time and time again. Therapy is not a miracle cure that takes effect almost immediately like in GOOD WILL HUNTING and the parents BOTH have a strong role in keeping the family sickness alive. Donald Sutherland is the enabler who denies there is a problemeven after one son dies by accident and the other attempts suicide. He also cannot face that the family's dysfunction is mostly controlled and maintained by his very disturbed wife played wonderfully by Mary Tyler Moore. She is not mentally ill but has a very sick personality as she is cold as ice emotionally and deals with problems through massive amounts of denial as well as stuffing her anger WAY down deep. Timothy Hutton is despite his being the patient the healthiest one in the family as his suicide attempt is a strong cry for help. Finally Judd Hirsch plays the therapistand one of the most realistically portrayed therapists on film. He has no miracle cure but tries his best to get Hutton and later Sutherland to work hard at uncovering their dysfunction. Again and again and again the viewer is rewarded by a brutally honest script that is about people who would be realnot Hollywood's idea of people. The film is neither manipulative nor condescendingthis is the way more films SHOULD be.In addition as I have watched the film several times I keep noticing just how perfect the direction was. How wonderfully framed the shots were how wonderfully the music fit in and how unflinching the movie dealt with pain. In particular I love the scene with Sutherland at the psychiatrist's office as he talks about his marriage....and his eyes keep looking away and avoiding the doctor as he says how much he loves her. And the great Christmas photo sceneit just screams out this is real!!. For this to be Robert Redford's directorial debut is absolutely amazing and he surely earned that Best Director Oscar.FYIalthough this movie is rated R it is only for language. There are a few REALLY CHOICE WORDS used here and there but otherwise this is a great movie for teens. If filmed today this would no doubt be a PG13 film. I am a very conservative parent and yet I found this to be totally acceptable for my 15 yearold. It's a great film to watch WITH your kids and discuss what you see.I cannot recommend a film more highly.".

Conrad of course feels responsible and has already tried to take his own life once before.Reluctantly he begins to see a shrink at the advice of his father. Dr. Berger also played brilliantly by Judd Hirsch though there are no slouches in the cast helps Conrad through thick and thin. By the end of the movie the audience truly feels for all characters to some degree.As has been stated the acting is magnificent. The story may seem simple but this type of film really doesn't need a heavy plot. Its an excellent look at the problems we all face. When I first saw this at a young age I related completely to Conrad's character. When I saw this tonight I related more to the adults and could really feel for them a lot more than I remembered. Each character has a unique sense of reality to them. The actors really carry the film making the characters seem like real people we've known for years.Unfortunately this movie has received somewhat of a bad reputation over the years as the film that beat Raging Bull in 1980 for the Best Picture and Director Oscars. While both movies are excellent its sad that one has to be better than the other and people just don't enjoy both movies for what they are. Many people have preconceived opinions about this 'small' film they have not heard of. After all Raging Bull is an all time classic. Just watch this movie with an open mind because it really works on every level as a powerful family drama detailing the persona of many different types of people.".

But how they accomplish this makes this movie a shattering but ultimately uplifting in parts experience.Buck Jarrett drowns after he and his younger brother Conrad go sailing on a questionable day. Later Conrad feeling the guilt of his brother's death tries to commit suicide by slashing his wrists. This turns out to be a blessing in disguise because the true personalities of his parents Cal and Beth as well as his own ability to grow are revealed when Conrad returns from the psychiatric hospital after a 4month stay. Conrad is given the name of Dr. Tyrone Berger a psychiatrist marvelously played by Judd Hirsch who is unconventional to say the least. He dresses casually drinks coffee he makes in his office and smokes incessantly this is pre antitobacco. And he doesn't buy into the psychobabble practiced by many psychiatrists. At first Conrad tells Dr. Berger he wants to gain control but what he really wants is to not feel  not feel the pain of his brother's death and what he believes is his part in it. But that unravels through a series of experiences he endures as the movie proceeds. In choir practice Conrad is smitten with Jeannine Pratt beautifully played by Elizabeth McGovern a fellow singer who has an ability to recognize Conrad's pain without being amazed horrified or judgmental. And Conrad also has a friend Karen played nicely by Dinah Manoffwhom he'd met in the hospital and who can relate to his experiences there. Donald Sutherland as Cal Mary Tyler Moore as Beth and Timothy Hutton as Conrad give outstanding Oscarcaliber performances. Cal tries to keep his feelings hidden by wearing a mask of bravado carrying on and functioning in a world that has taken his son away. He loves Conrad and also recognizes his pain and his alienation fom his mother though he realizes he can't fix it. But it's Mary Tyler Moore's performance as Beth that is so amazing. She is plastic through and through and it gets to the point of being downright annoying and yet MTM's portrayal is perfect. Of all the characters hers is really the most disturbed. She wants to have things exactly as they were even though she mourns the loss of her firstborn son. She can't love Conrad because he committed the one unforgivable sin  he survived while her favorite did not. Timothy Hutton sadly has never had a movie to top Ordinary People. He has done other work of course most notably in my opinion Taps and can be seen currently as Archie in Nero Wolf on AE. But his role as the troubled surviving son who rises from the pain in Ordinary People is truly magnificent and shattering. He earned the Oscar and he truly deserved it. And as he accepted his Academy Award he remembered his father actor Jim Hutton who had died from liver cancer shortly before Timothy got the award. That was a classy thing to do. I hope Mr. Hutton gets another plum role like this one everything else he has done since pales in comparison.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful script characters and flawless filmmaking. A movie not to forget.  out of four";
	schema:reviewBody "As an aspiring screenwriter myself I envy Alvin Sargent the mastermind behind the script of the Academy Award winning 1980 drama Ordinary People. Based on the equally as heartbreaking novel by Judith Guest Ordinary People flawlessly captures all aspects of great cinema. The scenes have the perfect timing the performances are vividly descriptive and entirely convincing the direction is efficacious and focused. The filmmaker's never pretend that this movie is easy to watch but they sure do produce an emotional and mental response from the viewer. Ordinary People launched Timothy Hutton's career rewarding him with an Oscar. It's too bad his career as an actor seems to be traveling downhill. Although his award was for best actor in a supporting role he is truly the center of the movie. Hutton plays Conrad Jarrett the son of Calvin Donald Sutherland and Beth Mary Tyler Moore. The Jarretts are recovering over various recent disasters. They lost their first born son to an accident for which Conrad blames himself. His grief eventually provokes a failed suicide attempt. As the movie opens we meet the family. We never witness Conrad's suicide attempt the preceding family death nor do we see anything than happens during his hospital stay. Ordinary People knows exactly where to start and what to show. It leaves a great deal to our imagination. It gives us freedom to put ourselves in the character's shoes. This is a realistic portrayal of a crippled family trying to mend with problems. Several key characters also contribute to the rehabilitation of Conrad. Dr. Berger Judd Hirsch provides Conrad with psychological guidance the high school swimming coach E. Emmet Walsh understands Conrad's condition but still doesn't want the swim team to lose his talent Jeannine Elizabeth McGovern befriends the struggling Conrad Karen Dinah Manoff another similarly hospitalized with Conrad gives him some added confidence.Ordinary People took home Academy Awards for best picture director supporting actor adapted screenplay Mary Tyler Moore's deserving performance and earned various other nominations including the supporting performance by Judd Hirsch. It is clear why the film won so much praise by critics and audiences alike we can clearly identify with the characters and their situation.The characters are beautifully written. I cannot remember the last movie I saw that so vividly captures individual lifestyles and personal tragedies. Every character plays an important role in Conrad's life. His father feels his son's suicide attempt is due to his poor parenting. The materialistic mom finds it difficult to contend with difficulties and to forgive her son for what he did to her public image. Conrad's problems evolve into larger more complex issues of love compassion forgiveness and our personal differences. The actors really deserve the crown here. If there was even one who did not live up to the great expectations they would appear obvious and subtract from the film's emotional grasp. Timothy Hutton really portrays his character well. Every emotional aspect feels real justified and understood. Mary Tyler Moore portrays the film's potential villain believably as well. She makes is obvious that Beth would rather run from problems instead of dealing with them. After seeing Donald Sutherland in many recent film's that seem rather terse I formed opinions about his credibility and ability that his performance here proves wrong. He is definitely a gifted actor when dealt good material. In this performance easily the best of his career he captures every minuet detail of a father struggling with his past present and future. Ordinary People shares much in common with 1999's best picture winner American Beauty. That was another great film but Ordinary People contains debatably better material. American Beauty looked tragedy in the eye and found respect mockery and grace. Ordinary People never bestows comic material however but it does trace suffering to its root and finds disorientation embarrassment and sorrow.  This is not an easy movie to watch but a challenging perceptive tragic story that you are not likely to forget.".

	onyx:emotionText "As an aspiring screenwriter myself I envy Alvin Sargent the mastermind behind the script of the Academy Award winning 1980 drama Ordinary People. Based on the equally as heartbreaking novel by Judith Guest Ordinary People flawlessly captures all aspects of great cinema. The scenes have the perfect timing the performances are vividly descriptive and entirely convincing the direction is efficacious and focused. The filmmaker's never pretend that this movie is easy to watch but they sure do produce an emotional and mental response from the viewer. Ordinary People launched Timothy Hutton's career rewarding him with an Oscar. It's too bad his career as an actor seems to be traveling downhill. Although his award was for best actor in a supporting role he is truly the center of the movie. Hutton plays Conrad Jarrett the son of Calvin Donald Sutherland and Beth Mary Tyler Moore. The Jarretts are recovering over various recent disasters. They lost their first born son to an accident for which Conrad blames himself. His grief eventually provokes a failed suicide attempt. As the movie opens we meet the family. We never witness Conrad's suicide attempt the preceding family death nor do we see anything than happens during his hospital stay. Ordinary People knows exactly where to start and what to show. It leaves a great deal to our imagination. It gives us freedom to put ourselves in the character's shoes. This is a realistic portrayal of a crippled family trying to mend with problems. Several key characters also contribute to the rehabilitation of Conrad. Dr. Berger Judd Hirsch provides Conrad with psychological guidance the high school swimming coach E. Emmet Walsh understands Conrad's condition but still doesn't want the swim team to lose his talent Jeannine Elizabeth McGovern befriends the struggling Conrad Karen Dinah Manoff another similarly hospitalized with Conrad gives him some added confidence.Ordinary People took home Academy Awards for best picture director supporting actor adapted screenplay Mary Tyler Moore's deserving performance and earned various other nominations including the supporting performance by Judd Hirsch.

	schema:reviewBody "Ordinary People deserved its Oscar. There was such fierce competition in 1980 that winning the award was a real honor. The movie should have shared honors with Coal Miner's Daughter.Having said that the reality of the movie is so heartbreaking and so real that you feel every emotion and understand the characters feelings whether you liked them or not. Mary Tyler Moore's performance of Beth Jarrett is so powerful that you forget Moore's comedic repertoire and immerse yourself into her persona as a cold distant wife that can not show emotion for her son. It is disturbing that Beth can not show Conrad love and it breaks your heart when you see the awkwardness as he tries so hard to get any love or recognition from her. Her breakdown scene at the golf course and the realization at the end of the movie that she is incapable of affectionate love are powerful performances.Donald Sutherland's understated and beautiful performance is brilliant. His making up for Beth's shortcomings as an affectionate human being are so touching. He does all he can to keep the rest of his family together. Why he was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond comprehension.Timothy Hutton absolutely shines as the troubled Conrad. All you want to do is hug him love him after his rejections from his own mother. The torture and pain he is in is portrayed so stunningly. His guilt over the death of his brother and subsequent depression are heartbreaking.Growing up in suburban America the film rings many a truth to the insights of what people perceive as a normal family. The cocktail parties the school activities the socialization of Beth and her friends over the recognition of her son do happen in suburban America. Robert Redford recognized every real detail of the facades that people put up and the reality of what happens at home. They are poignantly and chillingly realized.Definitely one of the most deserved Best Picture Oscars given. Please don't miss this one.".

It is a story so close to reality and so well played by the actors. One really hates Mary TylerMoore at the end for being a bitch first class a mother with no feelings for her youngest son.

This movie concludes at a glimmer of hope for Conrad which symbolizes a demoralizing and almost hopelessly rudimentary progress for the entire Jarrett Family YES!! this is very very very DEPRESSING!!! Unfortunately this situation is extremely realistic! Ordinary People is an outstanding movie for a variety of reasons..

	schema:reviewBody "This film without a doubt is the best dramatic film I have ever seen. It is truly an extraordinary film of humanity. To start out the film begins in complete silence and gently flows into Pachalbel's Canon in D. It has become my favorite movie and I can say with 100 certainty that it deserved every Oscar it received. I cannot truly articulate with words what this movie did to me when I first saw it. I had an epiphanylike experience. I was born in 1980 and didn't see this film until shortly after I turned 19. The events portrayed by Timothy Hutton Mary Tyler Moore Donald Sutherland Judd Hirsch Elizabeth McGovern Dinah Manoff and Fredric Lehne are just as powerful and relevant in society today as they were 20 years ago. Timothy Hutton's performance of Conrad Jarrett an 18 yrold suffering from depression after the tragic death of his older brother is extraordinary. Being the age Hutton was when he made the film when I first saw it twenty years later I related to the emotions on every note. Teenagers are rarely portrayed in film as realistically as in real life. In my opinion Conrad Jarrett in Ordinary People is the best portrayal on film of a teenage boy going through the good times and the bad but mostly the bad.  Timothy Hutton is a truly amazing actor. Mary Tyler Moore also deserved all of the praise and nomination for a role that is literally the opposite of anything she had ever played before. The way she portrayed the cold cruel yet emotionallyhidden Beth Jarrett is outstanding. Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch also gave performances that made them truly believable as Calvin Jarrett and Dr. Berger. Sutherland should have received an Oscar nomination. Elizabeth McGovern and Dinah Manoff's small character roles as Jeannine Pratt and Karen are just as vivid as in the novel. Jeannine provides the excellent uplift in the story while Karen provides the semblance of reality that things are not as they seem. Every line and every scene in this film is as detrimental to the overall underlying theme as it is in the novel by Judith Guest. The words I love you and love have an immense importance in this film. Kudos to Robert Redford who shows that he is not only an excellent actor but also a truly excellent director. The color scheme music scheme setting in Lake Forest Illinois and that perfect home all provide the exact backdrop to the circumstances going on between these characters and within Conrad himself. This film relies solely on the realistic interaction between ordinary people living through extraordinary circumstances. This film had an amazing impact on me and I'm sure it will do the same for anyone else who sees it. If you do not leave this film having gained that underlying insight that this film gives then you did not truly understand the purpose of the film. You don't have to suffer from depression or go through the loss of a loved one to understand the message delivered by this film. It's definitely more than just a tissue movie. Truly one of the best films ever made.A 10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Their world is truly a perfect place with its groomed lawns and freshly painted homes and even the people are polite proper and happy with life or so we are led to believe. Robert Redford brings us this perfect world with its perfect people only to show us the imperfections that are so well hidden and are never supposed to be seen. Ordinary People is the story of a families struggle to accept the death of a son and its consequences on all who are left. The main character that is highlighted in the story is the younger son Conrad. Having recently returning home from a mental hospital after an attempted suicide he is the primary victim of this tragedy. He was on the boat when his brother Buck drowned and he blames himself for his death. The parents are almost polar opposites. The father is desperately trying to keep the family together and to understand what is happening while the mother is seen to ignore everything and continue to uphold all the pretense that is her life. Also featured in this film is Conrad's psychiatrist Dr. Burger who serves as a means of telling the background story as well as to help the family in realizing their true situation. I first saw this film twenty years ago as part of a high school field trip. The theater was filled with high school seniors and we wondered who thought up the bright idea of seeing this Boring film. This thought went on for about the first ten minuets then we were all engrossed in it. I distinctly remember the gasp of the audience when Conrad receiver the news of his friends suicide over the phone. That gasp was missing in this viewing of the film. I can only attribute it to the age of the audience. The odd thing about seeing this movie after so many years was that the first time I saw it I was seeing it from the son Conrad's eyes. This time I looked at the story and felt more for the father. I suppose age can change a perspective that one views a story from. The gasp was voiced from a room full of Conrad's twenty years ago where this time we were a room full of parents sympathizing with his plight. The ability of a director in being able to tailor a film to his audience even years later is a noteworthy achievement. Ordinary People was and still is a great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I could not take my eyes off Ordinary People a brutally honest look at moving on after tragedy. Robert Redford pulls no punches minces no words and doesn't sugarcoat a single painful scene as the story of a suburban family and the secrets they share unfolds.Athletic popular Buck Jarrett was the town's Favorite Son... and clearly a favorite son of his mother WASPish Beth Mary Tyler Moore boldly playing against type. But when Buck dies during a boat accident he is survived by his insecure mild mannered brother Conrad Timothy Hutton who incurs Beth's passive aggressive wrath. While meek father Cal Donald Sutherland struggles to keep the peace Conrad seeks the help of a hard nosed psychiatrist Judd Hirsch and begins his journey of recovery from survivor's guilt and learns that pain in life is always better than the alternative.What makes Ordinary People stand out from other movies is the fact that it shows rather tells. That combined with Moore's peerless performance reveals how little Beth thinks of poor Conrad. Take a breakfast scene for instance where Conrad refuses the French toast Beth makes for him. While Beth chatters on about her plans she roughly shoves the French toast down the garbage disposal saying You can't save French toast! Or a devastating scene that takes place late on a school night. Conrad's light is on when he should be asleep... and Beth breezes by his room without so much as a glance. It is powerful stuff.This is one of the best cast ensemble dramas I've ever seen. Hutton rightly won an Academy Award as the damaged Conrad. He bravely goes through torturous emotional scenes that threaten to tear your heart to shreds. Sutherland is also sympathetic as Cal a man who has to choose between saving his son or his marriage. Moore however owns this movie. I wanted to write off Beth as simply a villain... but I just couldn't. This is a woman who believes in hiding ugly emotions in placing reputation over familial love and who flies off on vacation when things get rough. Yet Moore makes Beth someone who at one time might have been a truly lovable person but allowed that part of her to die along with her son. Hirsch is darkly humorous as the rough edged Dr. Berger and a young Elizabeth McGovern is appealing as a sweet classmate Conrad shows an interest in.Ordinary People is a complex film that refuses to point fingers or go for easy answers but reveals how there are no happy endings in life rather precious moments of joy we should savor in spite of and because of the pain.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening shots are the peaceful but misty waters of Lake Michigan. Why is the lake the first shot? Eventually the scenes change to the sleepy suburban area off the coast of Lake Michigan in Lake Forest Illinois. The town is very reminiscent of small communities in New England with the beautiful golden leaves of Fall layering the roads and the gardens. Finally the camera rests upon a high school choir singing a transcribed rendition of Pachabel's Canon. The camera pans the many high school students contributing their sound to the musical collective. This will be a story about a certain high school student among these singers. Finally the camera rests on Conrad Jarrett played by Timothy Hutton. He is an ordinary person of high school age or is he? In the next shot he is jumping from sleep in a cold sweat as if from a nightmare. Something is amiss...Next we meet his parents Beth Jarrett played by Mary Tyler Moore in not only the role of her career but a tour De force Oscarcaliber performance and her husband Calvin Jarrett played by Donald Sutherland in probably his finest performance. At first they seem to be a contented happy middleaged couple on the uppercrust of society. They go on many vacations during the holidays they have the finest clothes they go to expensive restaurants and plays and they hopnob with the social elite of the community. Calvin is a tax attorney making very good money enough to afford his stayathome wife who keeps their house neat and orderly akin to Martha Stewart. When she's not placing expensive napkins on the dinner table she is either shopping or playing golf. All seems well. Or is it? Their only son Conrad is having trouble sleeping and eating. He's aloof with his friends at school sometimes not looking at them when they are talking to him. And his mother acts well strangely toward himnot quite a healthy and nurturing motherson relationship. As the story gradually unfolds we gather pieces about this family and find that not everything is as it seems. One of the most brilliant aspects of this film is its pacing. Pieces of backstory are brought gradually to the forefront. Each piece of the larger mosaic one that is much greater than the timeframe of the actual story comes to light only with great effort. There is a sense that the characters are purposefully engaged in hiding the larger backstory away like skeletons in the closet. When Conrad undertakes to see the psychiatrist Dr Berger he claims that family school aka everything is fine to which Berger replies Then why are you here? The two things we begin to gradually understand is that Conrad was not the only son but he had an older brother now deceased. We also learn that Conrad had been in the hospital because of an attempted suicide. But these raise more questions than they answer. For one thing with all this back story why does the story take place at this time and place? Why did Conrad attempt suicide? How did his brother die? The answers lie somewhere within the waters of Lake Michigan...This story may not only be about what happens to its characters and the crises they ultimately must face. On one level the story is a commentary on the false perception of ordinary or normal people. Particularly in America we often have a false perception of the norm. People raise families bare children see them off to college etc etc. With these larger generalities we often miss the struggles the disappointments the trauma and even the tragedy that many experience but often regarded as not happening to normal or ordinary people. Ironically the character of Beth wants to give off the false but nice veneer of normalcy. At one point she rages at Calvin for revealing at a social event that their son has started to see a psychiatrist. Beth sees friends at shopping malls and at parties but she could not bare to have any of her fellow socialites know about any of the things that are really going on. And even when she is confronted by her husband to deal with their issues she wants to go on vacation rather than the face the realities around her.In many ways Ordinary People is about secrets. The uppercrust of American society has a tendency to keep things shut within large 2story houses with manicured lawns in front. Many have felt that if they revealed their dark secrets they would be judged as being abnormal by their peers. In many ways the tragic message is that many others have these same problems and secrets but they do not understand that revealing them to others could help the healing process. Ordinary people are not ordinary people in other words but we do not yet know this. A philosophical book once said There are no such things as ordinary moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "ORDINARY PEOPLE was a nearly perfectly mounted intense emotionally draining motion picture drama based on the novel by Judith Guest which was the first directorial effort of Robert Redford who received one of the film's five Oscars. This deeply moving drama follows an affluent Chicago family still feeling the after effects of the death of their oldest son and the guilt the younger son is still wrapped up in four months after being released from a mental hospital. Timothy Hutton won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his beautifully modulated performance as Conrad the tortured teen who feels onstage after returning to school and cannot connect with his mother Mary Tyler Moore who he feels loved his brother more than he loved her and Donald Sutherland is the agonized husbandfather trying to keep the peace between his wife and son clueless anymore as how to do so. Judd Hirsch also scores as Conrad's psychiatrist who helps him to get to the root of his guilt. But what I went away from remembering about this movie was the astonishing performance by Mary Tyler Moore as Beth Jarrett. I never imagined Moore could play a character so icy and emotionally distant...so cold almost unfeeling at times. Throughout most of the film she refers to Conrad as he or him. She never uses his name. She has one brilliant moment near the end of the film where Hutton gives her a hug and she just physically recoils from the touch of her own son. It's a chilling and brilliant moment perfectly executed by Moore. Sissy SPacek won the Best Actress Oscar that year for COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER but IMO there was nothing done on screen by any actress that year that was better than Moore's performance in ORDINARY PEOPLE. She should have won the Oscar and any other awards that were available. Just breathtaking work from a surprisingly unexpected source.".

I was laying on my couch watching this movie and when the part where Conrad calls Karen and gets the news I just was shocked. The gritty reality of it all was just so well done. I'm 17 years old about the same age as Conrad and I just connected so well with the character. Finally a movie that makes you connect. American Beauty is pale in comparison to this movie. I personally loved the Ice Storm better than Beauty. But all in all Ordinary People is better than both. I love character studies where movies are character based and that there is pretty much one character in the movie you can relate to. Tim Hutton's Conrad was so perfect so intensely real it made me sick to watch. Mary Tyler Moore was just excellentand deserved an Oscar for it. Donald Sutherland played the father so softly and so calmly that at the end when he breaks down it is so poignant and powerful you can't help but feel for him. Robert Redford did such a great job at capturing emotions on film something I think Beauty lacked. That film was more plot based as someone wrote earlier and I can agree. All I have to say is that I've found a new favorite film right up there with Billy Wilder's The Apartment again a great Character movie and Fight Club just an all around great film. See this film. If your 17 or 45 you'll find some connection. I give Ordinary People 10 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " One of the finest  if not the finest  movies of the 1980s";
	schema:reviewBody "An amazing movie from the first year of the decade by a director in an unparalleled directing debut. I've always enjoyed Robert Redford more as a director than an actor and when this movie came out I remembered being very dubious about seeing it. Word of mouth at the time was pretty amazing though and that's what prompted me to get over it. But once seen and reseen several times I have made a point of catching all of Redford's directorial efforts and I'm rarely disappointed.I won't rehash the plot others have done a good job of that but I will say that this is much more a character study of a family than it is plotdriven. So many character studies are somewhat contrived Rosebud anyone? but this felt so real real family dynamics real behaviors real reactions and interactions. And the simplest subtlest scenes tell most of the story. For example pay attention to a scene early in the movie between the son Conrad and his mother in the upstairs hallway. The attention to detail is stunning and yet barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. All you know is that you have suddenly grasped a whole new level of understanding about these characters. Mary Tyler Moore is if you'll forgive the clich a revelation. Especially for those of us who grew up with her sitcoms.That said as the plot does unwind through the experiences of each family member it does ultimately pack a pretty hefty emotional wallop as in the kind you thought you should have seen coming and didn't. It still gets me every time.This movie doesn't get nearly the attention as a classic that it deserves. See it and I'd guarantee you'd help change that. And for you Welles fans out there no offense I do appreciate that Citizen Kane represented a whole new way to make a movie and respect Orson Welles' presence in the canon of breakthroughvisionary movie makers.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is said that tragedy is the mettle which tests us. In this haunting lyrical adaptation of the novel we watch as a seemingly perfect family unravels before our eyes after a tragedy strikes them. Watching them cope and in some cases not cope provides the thought provoking story of this award winning movie.The Jarretts seemed to be the perfect American family until they lost their elder son Buck Scott Doebler seen only in flashbacks in a boating accident. Younger son Conrad Timothy Hutton has such a case of survivor guilt that he attempts suicide. As the film opens this has all taken place already and Conrad has been released from the mental hospital he was placed in after his suicide attempt. He is trying to resume his life with his parents Donald Sutherland Mary Tyler Moore. This is proving difficult for him as his mother favored Buck and seems unwilling to forgive Conrad for surviving where his brother didn't. His father is caught in the middle trying to give Conrad the support he needs while dealing with his wife who simply wants to blame Conrad for all of their troubles. Added into the mix is Conrad's therapist Judd Hirsch who helps the boy deal with his conflicted feelings.Everything about this film is superb. The writing peels away at the layers of the story like an onion finally revealing the tragedy at the heart of the story and the ongoing tragedy of one whose refusal to cope with the situation holds back all of those around her.The film is beautifully shot each scene allowing time for the audience to absorb what has happened before moving on to the next.The performances are superlative. Judd Hirsch provides an excellent portrayal of a caring counselor who helps Conrad forgive himself. Elizabeth McGovern gives a sweet performance as Conrad's love interest. Donald Sutherland excels as the father who wants to keep his family together only to realize it can't be done and a painful choice must be made. Mary Tyler Moore gives a stunning performance as a woman whose warmth to those outside her family is matched by her coldness to her surviving son. Moore manages to make Beth human rather than a caricature giving the film a richness that adds to it immeasurably. Carrying the film is a young Timothy Hutton whose pain is practically palpable and whose personal growth at the end has you cheering for him.A haunting film which stays with you long after the last frame has faded away.".

Director Robert Redford and writer Alvin Sargent clearly understand their subject matter. And in fact this film so closely mirrors many of the personal circumstances of my wife and her family my wife even established a productive relationship with a Jewish therapist who works out of Skokie no less that we joke that the film is really about her. Maybe it's my closeness to the subject matter that gives me my appreciation of the movie but even without that I still think that I'd consider this film to be a superb drama flawlessly acted.Speaking of the acting Mary Tyler Moore Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton were all recognized with Academy Award nominations Hutton won for their work in this film all deservedly. Moore especially is memorable in her portrayal of a brittle power mom who must constantly hide behind a veneer of icy aloofness for fear that one tiny crack in her facade will send her crumbling to pieces. But two other actors deserve praise as well Donald Sutherland as a suffering father who's illequipped to deal with his family's problems yet whose heart is in the right place and Elizabeth McGovern who brings a sense of normalcy and healthiness into the film like a fresh breeze off Lake Michigan.There's a lot of talk about whether this film is better than Raging Bull which came out the same year and lost the Best Picture Oscar to Ordinary People which only goes to show how lame award competitions are when it comes to movies  how can you possibly compare the two? See them both.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Redford's debut as a director really is that good. From Judith Guest's novel about an outwardly prosperous American family struggling with the loss of the beloved older son Redford and screenwriter Alvin Sargent have crafted a beautiful actor's film. This is not in the sense of a Glengarry Glenross where there is a pervasive theatrical sensibility and all is driven by the dialog. Many of the finest touches here are unspoken. It's the bestcase scenario for a film directed by an actor and one of underrated talent at that. The performances are flawless all around. If top honors are to be awarded they might best go to Moore. Playing against well established type she crafts a superbly observed and all too believable character a woman who has let her visceral habit of selfprotection get so out of control it has utterly crushed her humanity. Hutton who won an Oscar and Sutherland are also superb as the the husband and surviving son the other two legs of the highly unstable familial tripod. Look also for fine supporting work from the likes of James Sikking Elizabeth McGovern and M. Emmet Walsh. I confess to being a complete stranger to the milieu of the American preppy class how ordinary are these people? I don't know anyone with a livein maid. but the representation of them and their world seemed to me at least meticulously realized  right down to maybe the most extensive collection of sweaters ever assembled on screen. Redford's done some good work since but with Ordinary People he started off at the top and found there was only one place to go. No matter. He's left us with a truly brave piece of filmmaking never making easy choices and staying true to each and every memorable character to the end.".

	schema:headline " Ordinary in depicting American family degeneration but Extraordinary in being the best film on the topic";
	schema:reviewBody "The debate regarding how Raging Bull should have won the Best Picture Academy Award over Ordinary People in 1980 apparently has more to do with how poorly received this masterpiece is than what a lasting effect it had. Perhaps many viewers just couldn't sympathize with what I think is a typical problem in American families that our mothers and fathers disagree and often play favorites with their own children.  Inevitably someone will be left out and if it's you a tough road lies ahead.  Ordinary People is a vivid portrait of this reality and it's fair to assume that Terms of Endearment The Ice Storm and American Beauty would not exist without it's critical success.  Ordinary People defined the American family genre and gave it the strength to march on.  Looking back on the last twenty years I can say with ease that while Ordinary People predated it's present counterparts it remains the absolute best of the family genre films.  It did not require strange speeches about masturbation and overacting by Annette Bening American Beauty to get it's point across.  It rose above the abyss of the TVmovie that defines Terms of Endearment.  It did not require an ice storm reliance on plot over character to show how unfeeling the characters were The Ice Storm.  Instead it delved into the hearts and minds of every character and trusted enough in it's actors to rise above the topnotch material they were given to work with.  It all began when Mary Tyler Moore appeared on the screen and I thought to myself This will never work she's Mary Tyler Moore for goodness sakes!  We adore her and she is always incredibly funny.  Was I ever wrong.  I thought back recently to all of the incredible roles we have watched that merited Academy Awards for leading actresses.  Mary Tyler Moore puts to shame the other best performances in Oscar history Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice and Vivien Leigh in Gone with Wind and Moore never even won.  What was so incredible was her resolve to play this difficult role as mother Beth Jarrett straight and unphased she never smiled unless with Donald Sutherland in a scene and even when Timothy Hutton reached out to her as Conrad the way she looked at him with so much hate said more than 1000 words could ever say.  What made the role so amazing was the ability by Mary Tyler Moore to relentlessly say with her face what her mouth could not find the words for.  And Moore did it all so effortlessly and chillingly without breaking a sweat.  Donald Sutherland has been vastly underappreciated in his role as father and husband.  I have always been fond of his work in Ordinary People because that guy is my own father and I believe countless fathers in the United States.  He's a tax attorney that like a lot of babyboomer dads let's his son make mistakes and go on his own path but is there for him no matter what he does.  While Beth Jarrett breaks down because of the embarrassment that she believes the family will incur from Conrad's suicidal tendencies Donald Sutherland acts as a lifepreserver for the sinking ship that is his son's life.  He can take it because for goodness sake this is his son and he just doesn't care what the neighborhood will think.  His ego in this pursuit is at direct odds with Beth Jarrett's and it ultimately tests the marriage.  Not enough praise can be given to Sutherland in this performance.  Certainly much ink has been spilled about Timothy Hutton in his breakout performance and first feature film and his Academy Award was very well deserved.  There is something very significant about a boy so cut off from real society because of his mother's behavior that he is forced to get her attention through extreme measures.  When Conrad tries to be the adult and dispel Beth's embarrassment about the entire situation he is shot down and he finally realizes it is all too late.  Even more sad is when his mother plays favorites and consistently shows that her love lies in the grave with her deceased son.  Sadly enough she fails to realize that you should always love your children equally and at the very least realize that you have a younger son left who is dying to be your favorite.  This is so true of reallife.  Many mothers and fathers ponder the misfortune of having stillborn children and children who died before they did.  They spend so much time stuck in this phase that they neglect to realize that they have a child whose alive and well and needs attention.   The film could have degenerated into a sweet hugfest of an ending but completely refuses.  Too dark for some but very significant for me.  And did I mention that Robert Redford effortlessly directs his first feature and deservedly wins at the Oscars?1010".

Instead it delved into the hearts and minds of every character and trusted enough in it's actors to rise above the topnotch material they were given to work with.  It all began when Mary Tyler Moore appeared on the screen and I thought to myself This will never work she's Mary Tyler Moore for goodness sakes!  We adore her and she is always incredibly funny.  Was I ever wrong.  I thought back recently to all of the incredible roles we have watched that merited Academy Awards for leading actresses.  Mary Tyler Moore puts to shame the other best performances in Oscar history Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice and Vivien Leigh in Gone with Wind and Moore never even won.  What was so incredible was her resolve to play this difficult role as mother Beth Jarrett straight and unphased she never smiled unless with Donald Sutherland in a scene and even when Timothy Hutton reached out to her as Conrad the way she looked at him with so much hate said more than 1000 words could ever say.  What made the role so amazing was the ability by Mary Tyler Moore to relentlessly say with her face what her mouth could not find the words for.  And Moore did it all so effortlessly and chillingly without breaking a sweat.  Donald Sutherland has been vastly underappreciated in his role as father and husband.  I have always been fond of his work in Ordinary People because that guy is my own father and I believe countless fathers in the United States.  He's a tax attorney that like a lot of babyboomer dads let's his son make mistakes and go on his own path but is there for him no matter what he does.  While Beth Jarrett breaks down because of the embarrassment that she believes the family will incur from Conrad's suicidal tendencies Donald Sutherland acts as a lifepreserver for the sinking ship that is his son's life.  He can take it because for goodness sake this is his son and he just doesn't care what the neighborhood will think.  His ego in this pursuit is at direct odds with Beth Jarrett's and it ultimately tests the marriage.  Not enough praise can be given to Sutherland in this performance.  Certainly much ink has been spilled about Timothy Hutton in his breakout performance and first feature film and his Academy Award was very well deserved.  There is something very significant about a boy so cut off from real society because of his mother's behavior that he is forced to get her attention through extreme measures.  When Conrad tries to be the adult and dispel Beth's embarrassment about the entire situation he is shot down and he finally realizes it is all too late.  Even more sad is when his mother plays favorites and consistently shows that her love lies in the grave with her deceased son.  Sadly enough she fails to realize that you should always love your children equally and at the very least realize that you have a younger son left who is dying to be your favorite.  This is so true of reallife.  Many mothers and fathers ponder the misfortune of having stillborn children and children who died before they did.  They spend so much time stuck in this phase that they neglect to realize that they have a child whose alive and well and needs attention.   The film could have degenerated into a sweet hugfest of an ending but completely refuses.  Too dark for some but very significant for me.  And did I mention that Robert Redford effortlessly directs his first feature and deservedly wins at the Oscars?1010";

	schema:headline " a film that revived the Western genre";
	schema:reviewBody "During the early 80s the Western genre was beginning to lose its position in Hollywood and losing its impact on the audience. And the financial disaster of the Western Heaven's Gate did not really make very many producers any more enthusiastic about putting their money in to make Western films. But one of the producers more famous as an actor and director who was willing to make another Western was Clint Eastwood. Maybe because Westerns like The Good the Bad and the Ugly had started his career in the 60s he felt he owed it to at least himself to try and revive the genre before Hollywood officially threw it in the scrap pile.Pale Rider was and still is a phenomenal success of a film. After its release the Western genre was saved and brought back to life for several more years. It has fallen down nonetheless but has not disappeared from cinema screens. And we really owe it all to Clint Eastwood for this film. Pale Rider is one of his best Westerns. It is wellacted well characterized has plenty of action and is overall a great achievement.As one might expect Clint Eastwood plays a mysterious stranger in this film. Very much like in the Dollars Trilogy and High Plains Drifter his character is never given an actual name. The character Eastwood plays in this film however is different than the squinting gunslingers he played in the past. This character is more antiviolent than the previous ones and doesn't even put his hand on a sixgun until the film is more than halfover. He mingles with the bad guys plenty of times but rarely ever with a shooting iron. He's still a man of few words but isn't as cold and selfconcerned.Along with Eastwood we have a cast made up of fine actors such as Michael Moriarty the late Chris Penn Richard A. Dysart and one of the most popular of Western villains John Russell as a corrupt marshal by the name of Stockburn. Russell's character is one of the coldest cinema villains I've seen in a long time and his limited screen time aids in his impact and appearance. Russell's cold almost lifeless voice added with Lennie Niehaus's eerie background music score brings a spinechilling atmosphere to the film when the character speaks some of his first dialogue in the film. Like Eastwood's character Stockburn is a character that says little yet still delivers an enormous impact.Scenery in Pale Rider was absolutely beautiful especially when combined with the effective lighting and cinematography. Many times in the film we see a mountain directly smack center in the background. The cinematography is most of the time dark and eerie. Dark scenes are even darker than usual making this vision of the Old West even dirtier and savage than in most Westerns. And yet it isn't shown as being entirely savage for it wasn't. True the West was a tough place to live in the 19th century especially during feuds over gold but it wasn't a day of just regular killing.Some people have accused Pale Rider was being a rip off of the classic 1953 film Shane. I will not deny the fact that they are very similar in a lot of regards and share similar scenes. A stranger coming to a settlement in the Old West during a feud between a successful land tycoon and homesteaders on land he wants was used in Shane. But Pale Rider is in no way shape or form a ripoff. Any similarities to Shane is a homage a tribute of respect. After all Eastwood was attempting to save the Western genre and perhaps this was his way of reminding the audiences of the great films of the past. Yet he could do it without copying it. He just revisioned it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood made this film in 1985 and at the time many people said it was the best movie that he had ever made. Some people even went further and said it was the best western ever made. But the raucous shootemup Silverado came out that very same year basically foisting Kevin Costner onto an unsuspecting world and it ended up making a bigger splash in 1985 than did Pale Rider. Then after that two more things happened Costner went on to make Dances With Wolves 1990 and Eastwood went on to make The Unforgiven 1992 and with all that Pale Rider slipped into obscurity. The Unforgiven now wears the mantle of being Clint's masterpiece his finest western of being maybe the best western ever. And other people marvel much the same way at Dances With Wolves. Meanwhile nobody thinks about or even remembers Pale Rider a sorry fate that this fine film doesn't deserve.There are two distinctly remarkable things about Pale Rider On the one hand we have a return to The Stranger the character Eastwood played in High Plains Drifter 1973. But he's no longer called The Stranger maybe because he has evolved in life and he's now known as The Preacher. But he seems to be the same guy at a different place in his life's journey. When you think about it The Stranger from High Plains Drifter was pretty much just an Americanized presentation of the noname character Eastwood played in the spaghetti western dollar series for Sergio Leone. And if you're going to categorize it that's probably where this film belongs as a part of that Sergio Leone series A Fistful of Dollars 1964 For a Few Dollars More 1965 and The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1967. Add High Plains Drifter and this Pale Rider into that mix and you have a complete set. And it's noteworthy that Eastwood never again returned to the character. Eastwood's The Stranger appears to be finito.All that's on the one hand. On the other hand we unmistakably see Eastwood using Pale Rider to pay homage to what was once regarded by many as being the finest western of all time Shane 1953. In fact it's more than mere homage that's being paid here. Pale Rider is really a fullblown retelling of Shane updated done in Eastwood's style and with Eastwood's trademarked mystery man stepping into Alan Ladd's boots for the classic Shane role. Same story. Same plot dynamics. The biggest difference from Shane being that in Pale Rider the young lad is replaced by a blossoming adolescent ingnue the gender change altering the tensions between the characters. Whereas in Shane the boy compared his father to Shane and found his father lacking in Pale Rider the girl competes heads up with her mother for The Preacher's attention. Another difference from Shane is that here the dirty deed is accomplished. Yes Mama beds the manly stranger. In Shane's life and times the cowboy way was to resist that temptation to rise above it and walk away. But here The Preacher takes off his boots and drops trousers. I suppose in Eastwood's view the world changed between 1953 and 1985. Of course one aspect of the story was fixed to make this acceptable. While in Shane Mama was ostensibly an otherwise happily married hausfrau here she was a widow unremarried thereby rendering the tryst at least technically nonadulterous although Mama was in a semicommitted relationship with her intended. But don't misunderstand. Pale Rider is a fine film. I like it a lot. I like it as much as Shane. I like it almost as much as The Unforgiven. It ought to be remembered. It deserves to be remembered. It is a welltold western from the 1980s and there weren't many of those made. If you like good westerns I strongly recommend it.".

Add High Plains Drifter and this Pale Rider into that mix and you have a complete set. And it's noteworthy that Eastwood never again returned to the character. Eastwood's The Stranger appears to be finito.All that's on the one hand. On the other hand we unmistakably see Eastwood using Pale Rider to pay homage to what was once regarded by many as being the finest western of all time Shane 1953. In fact it's more than mere homage that's being paid here. Pale Rider is really a fullblown retelling of Shane updated done in Eastwood's style and with Eastwood's trademarked mystery man stepping into Alan Ladd's boots for the classic Shane role. Same story. Same plot dynamics. The biggest difference from Shane being that in Pale Rider the young lad is replaced by a blossoming adolescent ingnue the gender change altering the tensions between the characters. Whereas in Shane the boy compared his father to Shane and found his father lacking in Pale Rider the girl competes heads up with her mother for The Preacher's attention. Another difference from Shane is that here the dirty deed is accomplished. Yes Mama beds the manly stranger. In Shane's life and times the cowboy way was to resist that temptation to rise above it and walk away. But here The Preacher takes off his boots and drops trousers. I suppose in Eastwood's view the world changed between 1953 and 1985. Of course one aspect of the story was fixed to make this acceptable. While in Shane Mama was ostensibly an otherwise happily married hausfrau here she was a widow unremarried thereby rendering the tryst at least technically nonadulterous although Mama was in a semicommitted relationship with her intended. But don't misunderstand. Pale Rider is a fine film. I like it a lot. I like it as much as Shane. I like it almost as much as The Unforgiven. It ought to be remembered. It deserves to be remembered. It is a welltold western from the 1980s and there weren't many of those made. If you like good westerns I strongly recommend it.";

If you are a fan of Westerns or even when you only like to watch one occasionally than you should know more than enough. In my opinion Clint Eastwood is the one and only true Hollywood cowboy.When a mysterious preacher  noone knows where he comes from what his past is they don't even know his real name  comes to a gold mining camp near a small town in the mountains the local miners are in great danger. A ruthless landowner has decided to take their land he doesn't mind using violence and he has the support of the sheriff. No one seems to be able to stop them. But than the preacher proves to be more than a man of God. He's a good shooter the sheriff is afraid of him and he's the only one brave enough to rise against the landowner...If you are looking for an original movie than you'll have to look somewhere else. This movie uses all the possible clichs that can be found in this kind of Westerns. But on the other hand I must also say that all is done in a very proper way. Eastwood is a fine director and he did what he was best in at the time he made a Western. The story the direction the acting the scenes... it all looks professional and more than OK and especially thanks to Eastwood's acting performance in it this movie is still a 'mustsee'. I'm not a big fan of Westerns but every time that I'm able to see one with Eastwood in it I'll not let it pass. My advice if you can see past the fact that it isn't very original you will almost certainly enjoy it. I certainly did and that's why I give this movie a 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pale Rider is ProducerDirectorStar Clint Eastwood's unofficial remake of George Stevens' Shane 1953. I've never heard that he's acknowledged it as such but the two stories are more than a little similar. The film also presents Eastwood in another variation of his man with no name character similar to the one he portrayed in High Plains Drifter 1973.The story begins with a raid on a small mining community by rival miners trying to drive the residents off of their claims and take them over. Among the miners are Hull Barret Michael Moriarity his intended Sarah Wheller Carrie Snodgrass and her budding teenage daughter Megan Sydney Penny. When Megan's dog is killed during the raid she prays for someone to help her against the oppressors.Out of the mist comes a mysterious stranger Eastwood whom the scriptural passage Megan is reading describes him as death riding a pale horse. The stranger saves Barret from a beating at the hands of the town bullies and comes home with him wherein he reveals himself to be a preacher. We learn that mining magnate Coy La Hood Richard Dysart and his son Josh Christopher Penn are behind all of the troubles.When LaHood's men including McGill Charles Hallahan and the gigantic Club Richard Kiel are unable to handle this preacher he sends for gunslinging Marshal Stockburn John Russell and his six deputies. Meanwhile one of the miners Spider Conway Doug McGrath goes into town alone after striking it rich and is goaded into a gunfight with Stockburn  Co. Conway is brutally gunned down in front of his two young sons after which Stockburn tells the boys to tell the preacher to meet him on the street the following morning.The preacher then goes to retrieve a strong box containing his hardware and into which he tosses his preacher's collar. He and Barret then start for town where............Eastwood's character as in High Plains Drifter appears to embody elements of the supernatural. We see the scars of several bullet holes in his back and at one point is recognized by Stockburn as someone he had killed years before. The teenaged Megan throws herself at the preacher she's only 14 in the story but he wisely for the sake of the censors let's her down easy while having an eye for her mother.The comparison between this film and Shane is inevitable. In Shane we have the squatters versus the cattlemen here its between the powerful miner and the tin panners. There's the solitary gunfighter who helps out the underdogs the vicious hired gun the loner who gets gunned down in the street the bad guy who turns good and the hero who rides off into the sunset all common to both films.Though not Eastwood's best western it is nevertheless good enough to wish that he had made more of them.".

	schema:headline " The Man With No Name Rides Again.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Westerns is what gained Eastwood mainstream recognition and he returns to prosperous grounds with this movie. Much like his character he returns the Western from the dead and avenges their loss of appeal at the box office. A few years later he was to strike gold with Unforgiven' and although this story is not as gripping as Unforgiven' it is well crafted with minor flaws.The similarities between this movie and his wellknown Spaghetti Westerns are vast but the difference lies with the superior quality. Once again he is the Man With No Name' defending the weak and settling an old score. Where this one differs from his earlier work is that the characters and dialogue are realistic surpassing the one  dimension norm for the genre. The characters are credible in the sense that each has believable motivations for their actions. The Hood are motivated by their greed and the gold miners are motivated by their dreams. The credibility is thus intact with regards to the characters drives meaning that we now do not have to rely on suspension of disbelief as we witness the action unfold. The dialogue is in sync with each character. The Hood speaks with an educated tongue but his desperation is apparent as the Preacher stands his ground. The miners speak with little sophistication thus reflecting their social status of the times. The Preacher speaks as we would expect The Man With No Name' to speak. He is cool and rational and what little is said carries a lot of weight. The dialogue thus enhances the rich diversity of characters.Of special note is the casting. All the actors are well suited to their roles. Stockburn and his deputies are particularly memorable. The deputies look like they are all recruits from Hollywood B type action movies. This by no means understates their significance. Instead of playing their usual outlandish bad guys they relied on their natural ability to exude devilish intent. They look cold dark and menacing. There was no dialogue which accentuated their malevolence  talk did not interest them. They were there to do a job and small talk was meaningless. Their movements were slow and methodical thus adding to their character's coldness and creating tension as the harbinger's of death prepared to deal out their own brand of justice  the kind of justice that only dollars can buy. Although the screen time dedicated to these characters was limited their impact was far greater.The casting of Stockburn as a Lee van Cleef look  alike was also very good. This could be construed as a lack of originality but it was ideal for the story. He looks like a weathered tough baddie much in line with the impression we have of those times as provided by Hollywood who had dealt with many situations such as these with a cool ruthless hand. His dialogue with assistance from a menacing voice mirrors his appearance  hard and to the point.Eastwood is the archetypal Man With No Name'. His natural coolness forms the basis for the character. He has the ability to limit his dialogue and communicate to the audience with the assistance of minimal body language the emotions of his character. The sharpening of a glare was all he needed to show that he was a man with a past who could be dangerous. This was vital to the character since it helped create the enigmatic figure that the Preacher was supposed to be.An indication of the craft of the movie is the scene where the Preacher starts to help his freind break the rock. The rock became an obstacle that they would have to overcome and they began to realise that if they pulled together not only could they beat the rock but the Hood as well. Scenes such as this elevated this movie beyond the Spaghetti Western. Attention had been paid to the story and gratuitous action was obviously never the intention. This is not to say that the movie lacked action it means that action scenes were an integral part of the story and not as eye  candy offerings for a hormone charged audience.As well crafted as it is it is not without flaws. The first is the scenes within the town. It is easy to tell that the town is a small set for the movie due to the camera angles. This became particularly evident when the Hood is trying to bribe the Preacher with an offer of a church in a rich town. This immediately draws attention to the shots within the town which thus highlights the flaw. I have not checked to see whether this is a consequence of a low budget which would be feasible since Westerns were not as bankable at that time as they were in the past. Even with due consideration of this fact the cinematographer could still have made more creative use of camera angles to negate this limiting factor.A more minor flaw is the how the character of Megan is used in the movie. The book has her name in the title which is indicative of the fact that the story is told through her eyes. The telling of a story through the eyes of a young innocent can add various dimensions to the story. The adventures that unfolds before her would have a greater impact on the audience since the struggles of a child will touch the audience more than that of an adults. People always sympathise for the young. It can add complexity to the story since a child's emotions and pre  conceptions will create more opportunity for conflict. There was effort made in this direction but I feel that if Megan had been given more opportunity to tell the story from her perspective the story would have been more emotive appeal.Westerns will always have an audience although their popularity may fluctuate over time. The lawlessness of the times set the stage for good storytelling and unfortunately also poor storytelling. In the past they concentrated on a Hollywood B style movie with characters existing as an excuse to pull a trigger in the outlawed West. This formula worked for a while but the stories lacked the substance to withstand the test of time. This has led to the present situation where the few that have now been on offer have shown an increase in quality. This is probably due to the fact that the limitation in audience appeal has meant that the story has to be of solid value in order to attract the investors. As with all genres they have actors that are naturally adept to the role. Eastwood was such a man for the Westerns. We now wait for his successor to carry on the legacy of The Man With No Name'.".

The story though is way too clich and forced. There is nothing good in fact about it. It's a boring and clearly uninterested film to pledge the viewer. The acting is horrendous cringeworthy. The plot is surreal and almost everything isn't explained at allhow the manwithnoname got the priest clothes and etc. Storyline as I said clich. The old and overused 'rich wants to take the poor's lands' kind of plot. But of course wholly uninteresting. You know how it's going to end in the first twenty minutes or so. And what bothered me more is the fact that the 'manwithnoname' made both daughter and mother to fell in love for him. Just laughing. And worse there is a lot of time wasted in that pathetic subplot. It alone definitely lowered a lot the level of the entire film.And even the climax is a mess because there isn't any tension on it. All we knew is that the 6 bandits had killed a drunk man. That's all. What to expect from these villains? Obviously they would gonna lose to mister badass and as I said previously it was predictable in the very first twenty minutes. Onedimensional characters clich storyonly the cinematography is worth I guess. Maybe not even it. Don't waste your time with that film. 5.610".

	schema:headline " 'Shane'' Revisted  Another Eastwood Western Winner";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a solid western one of many through the years from Clint Eastwood who knows how to make an entertaining film. Pale Rider is almost like a modernday Shane in which the quiet stranger enters to help the pickedon landowners and then winds up with a showdown with the evil men in town. In this film Eastwood plays a preacher that's all he's called in this movie but he's really a gunfighter who saves the day for the town miners led by Michael Moriarty who is always good in lowkey roles. Eastwood's Preacher handles the immature lovestruck teen Sidney Penny well but blows his moral reputation by having sex with Moriarity's fianc Carrie Snodgrass near the end although no one knows that except the viewer. So  as usual  there are a lot of mixed moral messages in this film.A couple of things that are not mixed are 1  the interesting characters 2  the convincing bad guys 3  the beautiful scenery and photography 4  the involving story that makes you care what happens. All of these make this an entertaining film you would watch a number of times.".

	schema:headline " A strange preacher comes to defense miners in their struggle against the nasty owners";
	schema:reviewBody "A drifter Clint Eastwood comes to a mining village in the Old West just in time to reckoning gunslingers and owners . He is a mysterious preacher who comes to the aid of gold prospectors and protects a humble embattled prospector Michael Moriarty and his woman Carrie Snodgres from a greedy mining company ruled by LaHood  Richard Dysart and his son Josh LaHood  Chris Penn trying to encroach on their land . Meanwhile  the Good Stranger is idolized by their daughter named Megan Sydney Penny. As the wealthy owner contracts a group of outlaws as hired gunfighters led by John Russell who also acted as villain in Rio Bravo to kill miners . The title The Pale Rider refers to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation chapter six  Megan is reading the exact verse when she and her mom first see Preacher ride up to their house. Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay written by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack . Although atmospheric  it's also sometimes slowmoving and winds up into a spectacular showdown . This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people as well as an enjoyable message about faith and hope . Clint Eastwood is unforgettable in the title role coming to help a group of struggling miners and homesteaders . Clint Eastwood revealed in interviews that his character is in fact a ghost. Other clues to the Preacher's true nature are the ghastly bullet wound scars seen when he is dressing and his sudden appearances and disappearances throughout the movie . During shooting Clint Eastwood sustained what he describes as the worst injury he has ever had on set when a horse he was riding fell through thin ice and launched him forward as Clint suffered a dislocated shoulder . Good casting with several secondaries as Carrie Snodgress  Chris Penn  Doug McGrath  Richard Kiel  Charles Hallahan  Billy Drago and special mention to John Russell as a downright nasty. Exquisitely shot in Panavision by Bruce Surtees  son of classic cameraman Robert Surtees  with a magnificent cinematography on the wooded exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Acceptable production design by veteran Edward Carfagno  though the train station built for production was used again late in 1988 for Back to the Future Part III . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Lennie Niehaus . The film is made in somewhat similar style to Shane by George Stevens  and which so much cloning of High plains drifter also directed by Eastwood only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices . Star producer  filmmaker Eastwood realizes an excellent film and perfectly directed . This classic Western as good as the notorious Josey Wales is splendid in every way . Later on  Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western Unforgiven1992 also with some common theme.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know if this is the best Western of the 1980's it wouldn't be too hard I suppose as there wasn't really that many made in that decade or now unfortunately. Its the best Western of that decade that I have seen the only other good one I can recall is Silverado and Young Guns was pretty good though the sequel was even better. The 1990's was a much better decade for Western fans Dances with Wolves Unforgiven Tombstone Wyatt Earp Young Guns 2 The Quick and the Dead and of course Bad Girls Only joking!. Anyway Pale Rider seen Clint Eastwood return to the Western after quite a few years doing other types of movies and luckily Pale Rider is a great film. As has been mentioned in numerous other user comments it does borrow very heavily from the Classic Western Shane and Clint's own High Plains Drifter but it never tries to hide this fact and its a great film in its own right. Very moody and beautifully shot with great performances all round. Clint was on top of his game on this one and produced a top notch Western that ranks amongst one of his best below The Good the Bad and the Ugly Unforgiven and The Outlaw Josey Whales. I would love to see Eastwood make another Western but find it highly unlikely as he couldn't possibly top his last one Unforgiven but at least Kevin Costner has got one coming out later this year. Look out for Richard Kiel in this one he played Jaws in a couple of Bond films and Sean Penns brother Chris who was a lot thinner in those days! Highly recommended 810".

To put it as directly as I can this story is a ripoff of the 1953 emotionallyunparalleled western 'Shane' with Alan Ladd.The plot is identical only instead of cattle farming it is gold mining. Instead of the menacing gunfighter Wilson we get a less menacing crooked lawman who is no good without his deputies. Instead of cute little Joey there is a dumb adolescent girl who just wants to have sex and then there is the lead role of the Preacher.Clint Eastwood seems a little unsure of how to approach this character. He is not sure whether to make him a tough brutal gunfighter or an emotionally warm human being. as a result he is not much of either. I will say this the first half hour of Pale Rider is sufficiently strong and engaging enough so that you don't even notice the Shane connection. It is only when the conflict starts to emerge that things get worse and worse until the ending. Whereas Shane ended in a heartwrenching tear jerking way Pale Rider ends in a bore. This is Clint Eastwood's weakest western and it is not one I recommend.".

	schema:headline " Mystic Rider...";
	schema:reviewBody "Pale Rider is a Western with such an aura such an attitude and such a stance over the Western myth that it's almost a miracle it could flirt with selfconsciousness while never sinning by it. Clint Eastwood might be the only director still capable of such miracles. The actor has always been a man of a few words of stares that could speak more ominous statements than a Samuel L. Jackson's monologue. His ways of standing looking existing could exude more magnetism than the Magnificent Seven put together. But more than his natural blessings that made him a man women liked and men wanted to be like Eastwood had an allAmerican attitude toward the frontier spirit. He who was made a star through Western before Leone there was 'Rawhide' he returned back the favor after the disastrous failure of Heaven's Gate seemed to have sealed the genre's fate. It's like Eastwood and Westerns form a natural cycle they both define one another as if there was a true predestination in his name being an anagram of Old West Action. Though Pale Rider isn't much about the Old West as it is about action the film retells the story of George Stevens' Shane with miners replacing homesteaders and standing in the way of a powerful and influential industrialist named Coy LaHood Richard Dysart who believes he and progress make one. His attempt to buy 'tin pans' out and to threaten them through acts of intimidations almost destroy their spirit until a mysterious rider comes into the picture and proves that before being about action Westerns are about 'states of mind'.I mentioned Eastwood's natural aura because it's integral to the story's believability. Alan Ladd was good at Shane but he wasn't exactly threatening he had to prove his worth at gun at fistfight and through a few oneliners such as I like it to be my idea. Eastwood doesn't even need 'himself' only a silhouette appearing and then vanishing before you notice it a weak lighting that can only reveal his piercing eyes or just being mentioned in a conversation. When young Megan Perry Sidney buries her dog killed by LaHood's men she has a prayer where she begs the Lord for help her please has that childish resonance that indicates how hopeless they are. Eastwood intercut it with his arrival it's not played for subtlety but to establish his mystical charisma.The man like Eastwood's seminal antihero has no name he is called the Preacher. He doesn't quote the Bible much but he saves the day in more than one occasion without leaving mortal casualties... not yet anyway. He accepts to help the miners but they didn't ask for help just for him to stay as if his presence was healing their spirit already. But Eastwood counterbalances the sanctification with the idea of a pending doom. His entrance coincides with a 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' recitation and he obviously fits the description of Death. But as he said it himself God works in a mysterious way you can't explain providence but you just can tell that there's something providential about the man even if he means Death.And in the same vein of intelligence it also means that there's something 'evil' about LaHood even if he means Progress. He knows blood is a big expense and tries to get the Preacher out through bargains and only resorts to violence in extreme cases but for all his malevolence he's got a business to run and his interactions with this son a youngish and thin Chris Penn and his men aren't those of an evil mastermind briefing his troops. There even comes a point where the Preacher starts to negotiate with LaHood and submit his offer to the miners. Intelligently enough the Western is able to deconstruct a few tropes for the sake of threedimensional characterization.On a similar level it also depicts Hull Barrett Michael Moriarty not as a Beta Male but as a decent human being brave enough to defy LaHood's thugs to support his family and to take care of Sarah Megan's mother Carrie Snodgress even waiting that she makes up her mind to get married but as the Preacher said it might be along wait. It might take longer as both daughter and mother are infatuated with the Preacher can we blame them? but while it's a sort of teen crush for Megan for Sarah it's like a nasty teasing from fate. She's been abandoned by a man she truly loved as she tells Megan she's a child of love and her feelings toward the Preacher are worryingly the same.Maybe there's the idea that some things or some people are too grand to stay their appeal is eternal but they're not meant for the common people though there is nobility in being a simple decent and a hardworking human being. The Preacher incarnates an idea of the Old West a few words but action spirit courage and determination... and a few resurgences of the past here and there. The past is a lone rider throughout the story it's the dog's death that trigger's Penny's desire for revenge it's Sarah's past with men that forged her suspicion and made Hull her whipping boy and there's something about the Preacher's past hinted through some wounds and lines of dialogues that take their full meaning when his nemesis is brought up in town Marshal Stockburn played by an equally intimidating John Russell.The hints about the past mystify the film and let it venture in the realms of fantasy but without getting too far from the Western narrative. Eastwood's directing is confident enough and allows him to get away with contrivances... what can't be explained isn't forced fantasy but meaningful mystery. Still the greatest mystery of all is that it seems to have escaped everyone's attention that the film is a remake of Shane as there's no mention of Shane in Ebert's review not even on Wikipedia!".

	schema:reviewBody "Pale Rider 1985 Dir Clint Eastwood  Cast Clint Eastwood Michael Moriarty Carrie Snodgress Sydney Penny Richard Dysart Western filled with disgusting images of excessive violence. I am not sure what the title is implying. Perhaps the rider lacks colour. Perhaps a trip to the spa will fix that problem. Clint Eastwood directs and portrays a character he has played countless times in a film recycled from other westerns. He is a mysterious man called Preacher who arrives in a California gold rush where a mining syndicate feuds against independent prospectors. He encourages these idiots to grow a pair and fight back with his help. Eastwood eventually shoots up the entire town. Flawed with its view of violence as a problem solver. Familiar plot with bang bang throughout. Eastwood is a skilled director but this character is hardly new to him. Flat supporting stereotypes played by Michael Moriarty Carrie Snodgress and Sydney Penny. They all sit there with their hands together hoping Eastwood will solve their problem. There is a big difference between how Gary Cooper deals with a similar issue in High Noon and how Eastwood tackles the problem here. Richard Dysart plays the idiot villain threat whose personality is no different than any other Western town villain. There is nothing featured here that hasn't been done before. The result is a pointless graphic mess that should be used for target practice. Score 2  10".

I am not sure what the title is implying. Perhaps the rider lacks colour. Perhaps a trip to the spa will fix that problem. Clint Eastwood directs and portrays a character he has played countless times in a film recycled from other westerns. He is a mysterious man called Preacher who arrives in a California gold rush where a mining syndicate feuds against independent prospectors. He encourages these idiots to grow a pair and fight back with his help. Eastwood eventually shoots up the entire town. Flawed with its view of violence as a problem solver. Familiar plot with bang bang throughout. Eastwood is a skilled director but this character is hardly new to him. Flat supporting stereotypes played by Michael Moriarty Carrie Snodgress and Sydney Penny. They all sit there with their hands together hoping Eastwood will solve their problem. There is a big difference between how Gary Cooper deals with a similar issue in High Noon and how Eastwood tackles the problem here. Richard Dysart plays the idiot villain threat whose personality is no different than any other Western town villain. There is nothing featured here that hasn't been done before. The result is a pointless graphic mess that should be used for target practice. Score 2  10";

The writers I would assume at Eastwood's suggestion took a powerful straight forward tale of good versus evil and poured a heaping helping of metaphysical nonsense over it. Eastwood's Preacher is just one more tired turn as The Man With No Name from his Italian period  but lacking even a faint hint of originality or creativity.  The supporting players were as pale as the rider.  Nowhere did we see the power of Van Heflin's performance as Joe in Shane.  Heflin was Everyman.  Jean Arthur Jack Palance Brandon DeWilde all were perfectly cast.  Palance was particularly effective in evoking quiet menace.  Eastwood needed to add a backup group and collectively they couldn't summon up the smallest chill.  And Alan Ladd of course.  Stoic without being dull. Projecting a man of flesh and blood instead of some mythic gunslinger.  If you want to see Eastwood at his best rent The Unforgiven and steer clear of this pitiful mishmash.".

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 7222010  4 out of 10 DirClint Eastwood Fair return to the western for Clint Eastwood but the movie followed a lot of formulas that have been seen too much in this genre. The story is about a lonerplayed by Eastwood...isn't that original!! coming into a mining town that has both individual family's trying to survive and a big company trying to run them out and take over. Eastwood portrays kind of a gunfighting preacher who's not quite as hard as his other famous gunfighter of the spaghetti western's of the 60's but carries some similarities. The family's are struggling just to stay in town when he arrives and he gives them a fighting spirit that helps them hang on and also does a little actual fighting as well. The movie is very similar to the legendary movie Shane with a couple scenes that seem to be a homage to the film except that there a few silly turns that didn't make sense. Both women of the primary mining family fall for Eastwood's character at different points in the movie with the younger one only being 15 years old! Michael Moriarty portrays the befriended male father figure character but he's neither a father or husband to the women he's in care ofhe's just taking care of them after the death of a spouse. The acting outside of the male characters is somewhat unbelievable which doesn't make you really care for them and this hurts the film. The ending of the movie seems to take forever and most of the time I could tell what was going to happen next. These things didn't make for a very positive experience. I think Eastwood just felt the need to return to this genre but did better later with The Unforgiven  this one just didn't quite cut it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Westworld was the blueprint for what was later Jurassic Park.  Here Michael Crichton first envisoned Disneyland if the Hall of presidents ran amuck. It provided many of the inspirations for later scifi films like Terminator.  It was a great blend of action horror and comedy.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are the heroes of the film but Yul Brynner is the star.  He portrays a robot based on his character from The Magnificent Seven.  Brynner is the relentless killing machine who fights until the end.  With almost no dialogue he conveys fear with little more than expression and body language.The film explores old themes the dark side of technology but it was ahead of its time in depicting the dangers of computers and automated systems. The effects are dated but the story holds up well.  The sequel Futureworld tried to add political intrigue with less success.  Definitely one for the scifi fan or collector or cult movie lover.".

	schema:headline " Succeeds in its aims despite the plot holes";
	schema:reviewBody "Set during an unspecified future era on Earth Westworld features Peter Martin Richard Benjamin and John Blane James Brolin on their way to a new kind of amusement park Delos located way out in the middle of a desert. Delos is divided into three virtual reality areas Roman World Medieval World and West World or Westworld. These are not mere computer simulations however. Guests are immersed in a complete recreation of the relevant erasthey wear the clothing sleep in the accommodations eat the food and so on relevant to the era. They also interact with robots that are nearly indistinguishable from humans and can talk to have sex with and even kill some robots. It's an escapist's dream at least until something goes wrong.Westworld isn't the easiest film to rate. It has its share of faults and the more one analyzes the plot the more problems one can find. However the premise is so fantastic the atmosphere is so good even though it's very spartan for a scifi film and the performances from the principle actors are so entertaining that it is very easy to excuse any flaws and just go with the film. The bottom line is how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding a film is not how logically taut the plot is. On those grounds Westworld certainly deserves a 9 out of 10.A lot of the attraction is the voyeuristic escapism experienced by the viewer. Who wouldn't want to be able to go to an amusement park like Delos? It's a fabulous idea and a nottoothinlyveiled satireextrapolation of Disney World which had just opened two years before this film was released remember that Disney World is the Florida location Disneyland is the California location. Walt Disney had already been talking about his original conception of EPCOT which was quite different than the Epcot that was eventually opened in 1982 by 1967. Writerdirector Michael Crichton's Delos is a rough combination of Disney World's theme parks with an EPCOTlike residency if only a temporary one. At the same time computer and robot technology was finally starting to be strongly integrated into industry on an everyday level it was just a bit more than 5 years until the beginning of the home computer revolution. Disney World's operational infrastructure is an extensive behindthescenes computer network which Crichton parallels with his white lab coatwearing scientists working amidst monitors and banks of flashing lights and this is even better satirized in the sequel to Westworld 1976's Futureworld.The premise provides an easy launching pad for a number of ethical philosophical and scientific dilemmas What are the implications for killing someone when they seem almost identical to humans? What if they're artificially intelligent? Is it infidelity for married persons to have sex with robots almost identical to humans or artificially intelligent? If machines become sufficiently complex won't they be prone to the same flaws as humans such as viruses or something analogous and if artificially intelligent disobedience? All of these questions and more are explored in Westworld albeit most are not explicitly broachedprobably in an attempt to avoid sounding preachy or overintellectual.Because at the heart of Westworld at least on a surface level is a fantastic thrillersuspense story. Once things begin to go wrong the play turns deadly and the end of the film is a very long deliberately paced chase sequence. Yul Brynner is a menacing Robot Gunslinger in a character that Brynner thought of as an ominous satire on his Chris Adams from The Magnificent Seven 1960 and which eventually seems somewhat prescient of The Terminator 1984. The suspensehorror is based on a classic gambit of machines forcefully taking control of their creators. It may be more modern but basically the threat is that of the wronged Frankenstein Monster with all the attendant subtexts including humans playing God as they create other beings in their own image and dehumanization of the Other.It's best while watching to not dwell on the quagmire of plot problems that aren't dealt with. If the guns in Westworld can't harm humans because of heat sensors what's to stop you from being shot if someone aimed at something inanimate that you happened to be standing behind? How do the swords in Medieval World not harm that land's guests? If guests can't be hurt why are they thrown into tables the bar etc. during a brawl? We could argue that the robots were already going haywire at that point but the technicians aren't shown being alarmed by this behavior. How do they fix all of the architectural damage done every day? Where are all the other guests? Wouldn't it cost a lot more than 1000 per day per guest to make all of those repairs and perform routine maintenance on the robots?That's just a small sampling of the questions you could worry about while watching the film but that would be missing the point. Westworld isn't intended as a blueprint for actually constructing a Deloslike amusement park. The idea is to get the viewer to fantasize about the scenario enjoy the more visceral literal suspense story and at the same time ponder some of the more philosophical questions and subtexts. On those accounts Westworld greatly succeeds.".

Our protagonists John Blaine and Peter Martin played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin respectively choose Westworld. John is a Westworld veteran having visited many times. Peter is his friend and firsttimer at the resort uttering childlike statements such as Do we get a real gun? Wow! In the various worlds the guests interact with each other and with anatomicallycorrect extremely realistic robots. They are able to ahem interact very closely with the female robots and also shoot the mean robots for fun the guns they are supplied with will not work on real people as they wish. A real cowboys and indians scenario for the child in us all. Roman World is promoted as a big sex resort and Medieval World is geared towards the romantic it seems.The film starts out with quite a lot of intentional comedy and satire and frankly starts out very much like it could have been a 1970's TV Movie of the Week but once the robots start to go bad...what we have for the rest of the film is a truly creepy westernscifi film. It's a gunfight! Albeit a SciFi one. The last halfhour of the film is essentially a silent movie as Crichton said he wanted save for the great soundtrack which sounds something like a bow being drawn against piano strings or a cello anyway it has the same unsettling effect as the outoftune piano in another classic Wait Until Dark 1967.Movies with robotsandroids...there have been many I have seen and loved. But for this review I will cite examples of what I consider to be scary robots in film besides Westworld The Stepford Wives 1974 Alien 1979 Blade Runner 1982 The Terminator 1984 Aliens The Companion 1995. But Westworld was the first scary robot film I ever saw. And even after the others that followed nothing quite equals Yul Brynner in his role as the gunslinger robot gone bad in Westworld. His performance is what really makes the movie. Brynner was a good actor and even aybe especially playing a machine his skill is used to great effect. His performance was anything but wooden unlike the always wooden Ahnold in The Terminator for instance. When Brynner's robot gunslinger commands Draw with the slightest twist at the corner of his mouth he is completely creepy and scary. Even the way he walks when hunting down Richard Benjamin's character has an element to it that I have never seen again. What's also great about this film is the development of Benjamin's character of Peter Martin. He starts out as the inexperienced nerdy sidekick to Brolin's John Blaine and ends up showing his true mettle as the going gets rough. The nerdy naive Martin quickly learns how to survive. This was SciFi writerdirector Michael Crichton's first foray into bigscreen filmmaking. Crichton has said he made the film in thirty days. I would expect that finding premade sets were easy at least there was bound to be at least a western set sitting around the studio lots. And of course back then there were fewer and less complicated special effects.If you find a DVD of this to rent and you've never seen the film before I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first! It's a real spoiler.Note Look for Majel Barrett of Star TrekGenerations and she is also Gene Roddenberrys' widow as the whorehouse madam. Brynner's part was a play on his role in the classic western film The Magnificent Seven.".

Here customers can indulge their fantasies of conquest violent or sexual among a host of ultrarealistic robots who are programmed to promote the experience while not allowing the participants to become hurt. Benjamin stars as a newcomer to the place with his buddy Brolin along for his second visit. Brolin shows Benjamin the ropes at Western World how to shoot villains seduce dance hall girls etc... One of the bad guys they encounter is icy Brynner who they dispose of more than once. Eventually things start to come unglued as the men note that things aren't working as properly as expected and promised. The controllers of the park are unable to prevent the robots from hurting or even killing the guests! The film begins with that oncecuttingedge but now amusing sense of hightech awe as the guys enter the park. Benjamin is an acquired taste and borders on annoying for much of the film. More at ease is Brolin who doesn't have a great deal to do. The most striking performance is that of Brynner. He has almost nothing to say but he doesn't need to talk. His steely stare and mechanical gait wind up being quite relentless and terrifying. The highlight of the film is his nonstop pursuit of Benjamin. The Terminator owes a lot to this section of the film. There are several other supporting roles but aside from Van Patten the actors create little interest in their exploits. Star Trek fans will note the presence of Barrett as a robot madame. There were rumors of a remake with Arnold Schwarzegger but Arnie's already done the indestructible robot thing and no one's going to outglare Brynner.

Unfortunately the robots are starting to malfunction and our human guests may be in for more excitement than they bargained for.Michael Crichton delivers a clever and engaging story with this film. It packs plenty of intense action and increasing suspense that firmly keeps the viewer on edge! Crichton's direction is also solidly welldone creating a believable feel with the help of some good special FX especially with the droids.Castwise the film is great as well. Yul Brynner does a wonderfully creepy performance as the robotic gunslinger that just won't stop coming! Richard Benjamin does a nice turn as the timid visitor who must fight to survive as does his friend played by James Brolin.Westworld is truly enjoyable scifithriller excitement and stands as one of the best genre films of the '70s. 12 out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "Classic scifi thriller of the 70's Westworld is a film that never fails to be fun and riveting in its own campy way.Two pals go on vacation to a hitech resort where they can live out a wild west adventure among humanlike robots. Unfortunately the robots are starting to malfunction and our human guests may be in for more excitement than they bargained for.Michael Crichton delivers a clever and engaging story with this film. It packs plenty of intense action and increasing suspense that firmly keeps the viewer on edge! Crichton's direction is also solidly welldone creating a believable feel with the help of some good special FX especially with the droids.Castwise the film is great as well. Yul Brynner does a wonderfully creepy performance as the robotic gunslinger that just won't stop coming! Richard Benjamin does a nice turn as the timid visitor who must fight to survive as does his friend played by James Brolin.Westworld is truly enjoyable scifithriller excitement and stands as one of the best genre films of the '70s. 12 out of ";

Great chase scene at the end because if the Gunslinger was coming after me I'd be scared. And as far as I know the first movie to mention a 'virus' in the machines.You might as well complain about the bombs in Dark Star having intelligence. Why would a bomb need AI? But if it didn't the ending wouldn't have been as interesting.It's like complaining about movies from the 50s like 'War of the Worlds' or 'Forbidden Planet'. They worked with what they had and had no ideal about what would or could be done in the future. OMG 1984 didn't happen like Orwell said. Guess we should toss his book in the trash. Too many people nitpicking silly things. Ever heard of entertainment?If your a REAL scifi fan watch it. You won't be disappointed!".

Included are gunfights and bar brawls such as you see in any good Hollywood western. This is what Richard Benjamin and James Brolin have chosen for themselves.For reasons unexplained in the story the whole thing breaks down in all three theme worlds and in the case of Westworld a very nasty gunslinger robot has shaken loose from his programming and is on the hunt for human targets. Will man with all of his weaknesses defeat an apparently indestructible machine?You can also see some of the themes in the later Terminator films that Arnold Schwarzneggar popularized. Here the relentless hunter is played by Yul Brynner in the familiar black western garb that he made popular in The Magnificent Seven.

I fell in love with it when I first saw it in the theatre at age 12 and I've never gotten over it. Even though I'm much older today I maintain beyond personal nostalgic bias that WESTWORLD is a tight brisk intense thrilling totally satisfying 88 minutes of good fun.Somewhere in the near future an enterprise called Delos has developed the ultimate vacation resort. For the cost of a mere 1000 a day adult guests may choose to live their fantasies out in one of three different environments Romanworld Medievalworld or Westworld. These resorts are each populated by very humanlike robots who are programmed to serve every whim of the customer. State of the art computer technology ensures that everything's safe and that nothing can possibly go wrong.Richard Benjamin and James Brolin are two cowboywannabe friends who choose the 1880's Westworld for their unusual getaway. They make love to robot saloon women participate in wild bar room brawls and frequently get bullied around by a tough humanoid gunslinger dressed all in black Yul Brynner spoofing his look from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN who is automatically obliged to get riddled up with bullets repaired by technicians overnight as the guests sleep and then shot up all over again for the next day.All is pure fun and games until something unidentifiable in the computer system begins to malfunction and suddenly the world of Disney devolves into a place of horror. No longer taking orders to play dead the robots are out to kill the guests and the ominous gunslinger develops a frightening taste for the kill as he becomes an unstoppable walking menace 10 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator ever hit the screens.Author Michael Crichton THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN wrote the screenplay and directed his first film with WESTWORLD and it's an impressive debut in that he's able to keep the action moving along at a comfortable pace using a small budget to its full advantage and fashioning a real goodtime movie experience that is at the same time both fun and foreboding. James Brolin and Richard Benjamin are completely likable in their parts but it is Yul Brynner's multilayered conception of the gunslinging robot who changes from willing court jester to deadly assassin that's the main draw.Also a major asset is Fred Karlin's versatile music score. Changing from standard period western piano to a violins and whistles shindig and finally to a weird technowestern mechanical hybrid when moods start to change for the worst this is a very engaging soundtrack.So why don't you make arrangements to take the Delos hovercraft to Medievalworld Romanworld or Westworld? Contact them today or see your travel agent. Boy have they got a vacation for you...!".

His most successful achievement Jurassic Park revolves on this ingenious premise but so does this Westworld which predates Spielberg's boxoffice hit by 20 years! And maybe I don't know anything about cinema but I sure think this film is at least ten times better and more unsettling than Jurassic Park. Despite some flaws and scripterrors Crichton's film is a tense milestone that is ultimately compelling and far ahead of its time. In a near future a couple of slick marketeers have developed a holiday resort where rich tourists are offered imaginative vacations in perfect copies of the ancient Rome a medieval countryside or the Wild West. The story mainly focuses on Westworld where robot gunslingers like Yul Brunner even more brilliant than usual are programmed to die bloodily whenever a jolly tourist challenges them to a duel. That is until suddenly the central computer begins the malfunction and the robots stand up for themselves. The last half hour is amazingly suspenseful and contains some grueling images that'll definitely excite horror fans. The set pieces and costumes are excellent and with a great eye for detail. For the legendary actor Yul Brunner this was an ideal movie to conclude his brilliant career and simultaneously a great opportunity to bring homage his entire repertoire. Slightly negative elements about Westworld include the rather goofy choice of music and the abrupt ending. Although this last remark may be a purely personal point of criticism since I really wanted the film to go on for another hour or so. Great movie...terrific entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "What happens when robots are integrated into our society and they malfunction turning against humans? Westworld is an early attempt at this genre of science fiction being released in 1973. The subject matter is tackled in a creative way. This film takes place at America's newest and most popular amusement park. Guests are able to choose from a variety of three realistically simulated situations all referred to as worlds Romanworld Medievalworld and of course Westworld. Romanworld is barely in the film at all only showing very brief glimpses. There is actually a decent amount of Medievalworld shown throughout the film. Unfortunately there was never a big joust sequence even though it was hinted at. Main focus as if you didn't know from the title is Westworld. The movie starts off at a slow pace introducing the concept and effectively giving us a cinematic representation of what it would be like for a first timer at the park. Once the newcomer gets comfortable in his setting with the help of his friend who has lived the experience all ready the movie picks up the pace and remains rather action oriented throughout the duration. All of the typical things you would expect tourists to do in an old west setting where there are no consequences start occurring including shootouts bar fights jailbreaks friendly saloon visits etc A little over halfway through a serious problem happens the scientists are no longer in control of their robots. I will not get into details as I would hate to ruin the film. The acting all around is decent but in particular Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot shines in what might be the best portrayal of a robot I have ever seen in film. A true classic and one of my favorite movies.".

Hmmm. Okay and I'll buy the pistols have sensors in them so the guests won't get killed thing but there are swords and maces in Medieval World. What when a violent enemy swings a mace at your head it has a sensor to stop it in midair just short of splattering your head? And the robotgunslinger can hear Benjamin's breathing 100 yards away in the desert to locate him but somehow can't locate his breathing four feet away in the castlebecause the fire is distracting him? Come on. Do I have to go on? One more. If the robots don't have a normal body temperature how good can sex be with them? Cold! Oh yeah. Watch the Black Knight's hand in the castle near the end. He is supposed to be off yet when we first see him his thumb is turned up. The next time his hand is hanging down.Great story concept but good science fiction demands more plausibility. And what was supposed to be authentic is just every Hollywood clich about the West. I guess you could make some argument that this is some sort of metathematic cultural commentary about the authentic West visavis our conception of it as transmitted to us by Hollywood. But honestly the film just isn't that smart. And I'm not going to let it off the hook even if I agreed since it ignores basic nuts and bolts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Classic scifi thriller written and directed by Michael Crichton about a futuristic amusement park called Delos where people can role play in fantasy worlds based on the Old West the Roman Empire and Medieval Europe. Each of these worlds is inhabited by androids who look talk and act like real people. You want to have a sword fight with a knight you can. You want to shoot it out with a gunslinger you can. You want to bang an attractive prostitute or wench have right at it. But this fantasy world turns into a nightmare when the robots malfunction and start killing the tourists! Richard Benjamin does a great job as the unlikely hero a newlydivorced and somewhat nerdy man brought to the park by his macho friend James Brolin. Dick Van Patten and Alan Oppenehimer are good in supporting roles. But it's Yul Brynner as the blackclad gunfighter out to kill Benjamin that steals the show with his commanding screen presence. The movie takes its time setting things up and building the suspense showing one small malfunction at a time. It's an hour in before the killing starts. From that point on the pace never slows down and it becomes an exciting catandmouse chase with Brynner hunting Benjamin. The sets and special effects are terrific particularly when you consider this was made for 1.25 million with half of that going to pay the cast and crew. I can't say enough good things about Fred Karlin's effective score. This was Crichton's first theatrical directorial effort he directed a TV movie prior to this. I think it's his best work as a director although I hold a special place in my heart for Runaway. His script is smart with nice bits of humor throughout. It's a great film that should appeal to a wide variety of people so long as they are able to enjoy movies made before CGI. Sadly there are many who can't.".

The big selling points are that anything goes and nobody gets hurt but when a parkwide malfunction grants free will to the robots those guarantees are immediately called into question. It's a fun premise on par with some of the era's better scifi concepts but spends too much time dillydallying and vainly soaking up the atmosphere when it should be advancing the plot. That gives the impression that like so many Philip Dick properties it doesn't really know what to do with itself after the ground rules are established. Crichton's work in the director's chair leaves a lot to be desired but he doesn't get much help from the film's hammy madeforTV quality special effects. Most of that can be attributed to the age of the picture but it's tough to take the drama seriously when folks bleed neon red.

And I have to tell you something about that just tickles me. That some guy's walking around the Happiest Place on Earth and gins up a story about theme park automatons rising up against their patrons. That's hilarious.And really who better than to tackle such an idea than Crichton himself master of man's hubris and technological terror? Westworld is just that very inspiration a theme park for adults and their mature desires drawing on every boy's dream of shooting it out in the Old West. And everything goes beautifully until Yul Brynner schizes out and starts killing people. The guy just marches along laserfocused on his human prey. With this movie you can see the groundwork being laid for both The Terminator and Jurassic Park.And it's not just a trailblazer. It's also a lot of fun. It's packed with imagination and invention and works especially well as a lean thriller.Very entertaining.810".

That's hilarious.And really who better than to tackle such an idea than Crichton himself master of man's hubris and technological terror? Westworld is just that very inspiration a theme park for adults and their mature desires drawing on every boy's dream of shooting it out in the Old West. And everything goes beautifully until Yul Brynner schizes out and starts killing people. The guy just marches along laserfocused on his human prey. With this movie you can see the groundwork being laid for both The Terminator and Jurassic Park.And it's not just a trailblazer. It's also a lot of fun. It's packed with imagination and invention and works especially well as a lean thriller.Very entertaining.810";

Westworld is one of the few movies written and directed by Michael Crichton of whom I've been a big fan even before I knew who he was. Westworld being one of his more popcorny movies lacking the sophistication of The Andromeda Strain but containing the seeds of Jurassic Park.James Brolin is magnificent as expected. It always strikes me how much Christian Bale resembles him right down to the smile and mannerisms. If Bale isn't the illegitimate son of Brolin then their family trees must share branches somewhere.

	schema:reviewBody "Wyatt was a character that you could connect with because he wanted to find something better than what life offered so far. The image that struck out the most to me was this idea of the cities versus the open road and expansive valleys. I noticed that when they were on the open road they were meeting interesting down to earth people that shared similar ideas with them. They come across the farming family that sit down for family meals and live off of the land. Wyatt seemed to admire this idea of living off the land and the willingness to offer them food and a place to sit while most people would turn strangers away. The family did not stereotype them or disrespect them because of the way they looked.At the point in the movie when they picked up the hitchhiker you could tell the distrust that people had towards each other. Billy did not trust the man even though the man was simply trying to do them a favor. Trust in fellow human beings was something rare during the time and it seemed like kind acts were suspicious acts. Billy was not a trusting person but he was also a little bit paranoid while Wyatt was willing to believe in the goodness of people and give them a chance before judging them. Wyatt figured that the trust had to start somewhere.We can tell when the close minded communities are coming in to play because we are leaving the open road and coming to the small enclosed streets. When they run into George he is their saving grace from this small town. George offers a new perspective for Billy and Wyatt because he is a suit that does not judge them but he acknowledges the prejudices against them. He gives them the first straight answer they will receive on the way the world works. George's character was really refreshing and it was interesting that he is the one that gets killed by people that he 'represents.' I thought that the scene when they finally get to New Orleans and are tripping the cemetery is really telling of how religion was viewed by Wyatt and Billy. They are tripping and sitting on statues and graves and the girls start to take their clothes off while they run around and curse their parents and the world in the middle of funeral services. At one point Wyatt looks up at a statue and sees a great ball of fire crashing to the earth. This is an omen of how is life will end and it almost seemed like god was scorning them or something with that flash of fire kind of like the apocalypse.An aspect of the filming that I found interesting was the transitions that they used to go from scene to scene. The characters would be sitting by the camp fire and then to go to then next scene of them riding off was the three paniclike shots of the incoming scene. I thought that this method went well with the film and the characters because they were always changing scenery in search for something more. They were restless souls with no limits but they do not find clarity in the end. Wyatt felt that their experience in Orleans was not what they had expected and that they had failed but the question of what they had failed at was something that could be many different things. Easy Rider was a shocking film in a good way a film that many youths relate to because of the sense of restlessness and the need to live and be real.".

I would have thought there was much to commend it to the Christian Union moralisers yet as ever they couldn't see past the surface  drug abuse loose women. Yet it has its high moments in more ways than one and is always a treat for the eyes.My decision to defy the Christian Union by seeing the film was an early step out of my fundamentalist prison and I haven't stopped walking yet. Noone's ever going to tell me what I can and can't watch again nor will I censor anyone else's viewing. I'm still a believer but not of the kind that the Christian Union would have thought will ever go to heaven. Guess I'll have to live with that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider is often cited as being an all time classic and while I don't think this is a great film in terms of technical brilliance it sums up the era it was made and the tongue in cheek cynical take on the 'American dream' is both potent and well done. This film is very much a product of the sixties and like many things from the decade will always be fondly remembered. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda men of substance and substance abuse wrote the film together and Hopper directed it. These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time. The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else. It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including most notably George Hanson an offbeat lawyer played by the great Jack Nicholson.The American Dream has always been about freedom. But like George Hanson says it's one thing to talk about being free but something else entirely to actually be it. That's the theme of the entire movie and the way that it plays out and the ending especially aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it. The acting performances are a big part of the movie and the two leads Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper stick out the most. The two actors brilliantly get into their characters and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters. Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show. It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time. Even here he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career. Last but not least another great thing about Easy Rider is the music. Music was of course a big thing in the sixties and it's a big thing about this movie. Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes and it's very cool indeed. On the whole this film is an out and out classic.".

	schema:headline " This used to be a helluva good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our nowinfamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly this did occur but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying 'Guns don't kill people people kill people' well after watching this film it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites androids and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a freespirited mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now we are more concerned about money and the familyplan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake eat and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time  why? It is called 'bills' and 'responsibilities'. These are the choices that we chose to make and for anyone to say that they cannot do it I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film I felt that Hopper who also directed knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short the music loud and symbolic and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda who also helped write the film with Hopper did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.Nicholson represented us the American public and our love of liquor football and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much was the product of a wealthy upbringing but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him never left the state line and never lived life. He constantly used the expression 'I have always wanted to '. How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a coworker? If you always wanted to do it why haven't you? So here we have Hanson dreaming a dream but never following through who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking driving most of the time representations of the word 'freedom'.

	onyx:emotionText "I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our nowinfamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly this did occur but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying 'Guns don't kill people people kill people' well after watching this film it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites androids and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a freespirited mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now we are more concerned about money and the familyplan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake eat and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time  why? It is called 'bills' and 'responsibilities'. These are the choices that we chose to make and for anyone to say that they cannot do it I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film I felt that Hopper who also directed knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short the music loud and symbolic and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda who also helped write the film with Hopper did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.Nicholson represented us the American public and our love of liquor football and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much was the product of a wealthy upbringing but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him never left the state line and never lived life. He constantly used the expression 'I have always wanted to '. How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a coworker? If you always wanted to do it why haven't you? So here we have Hanson dreaming a dream but never following through who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking driving most of the time representations of the word 'freedom'. It is tragic what happens to Harmon because he unfortunately experienced the negative side of freedom  hatred and fear of the unknown.There was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate.

I remember thinking what a great actor Jack Nicholson was...and how terribly lowbudget the rest of the film appeared.                          And now over 30 years later....it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Peter Fonda tries to be Everyman....but he's really the most insecure individual of the group.  His cathartic trip at the cemetary in New Orleans is embarrassingly honest to watch.  His search is not for individual freedom...his search is for a family.  And yet he is always the outsider the observer.               Dennis Hopper is the sidekick the fool.  And like a fool he cannot hide his thoughts behind a socially acceptable demeanor.  He constantly says exactly what he thinks.  He has little patience for flower children pretentious intellectuals coy women law officers drunks in jail or rednecks passing him on the road.  Like a fool he is doomed.    Jack Nicholson is the core of the film.  He does not appear until halfway through the bikers' odyssey but the trip will not make sense until his face rises up from the jailhouse cot to peer blearyeyed at his surroundings.  He is the innocent man of this group....he is the AMERICAN.     This movie is just another road picture the way ON THE ROAD by Kerouac was just another travel book.  This little counterculture movie is an American Classic.".

	schema:headline " A Far Out Document of the late 60's Encapsulates CounterCulture America.";
	schema:reviewBody "Not many films have documented an era of American culture the way it must have really been. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES captured the reality of the postwar 1940's. TAXI DRIVER is a masterpiece of social distortion and paranoia exemplary of the 1970's. No film other than EASY RIDER captures the late 1960's as seen by the American counterculture. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's story of two men who go in search of America and 'freedom' is a bona fide sign of the times. I may not have been around at the time but it is great to see a film portraying the longhaired hippie attitude towards an America in turmoil in the form of a biker flick circa 1969.EASY RIDER is an exploration of vast and desolate parts of the country. Of course the stop at Mardi Gras is a necessity but what Fonda and director Hopper are trying to tell us is that there was no 'freedom' as they saw it. The sprawling journey shows filmgoers the multiple frictions and shattered idealism of a generation in the midst of cultural change. Sex drugs and music were exploding socially and 1960's ideology may have come to an end in 1969 literally and figuratively speaking  much like it shockingly does in this film.Peter Fonda plays cool Captain America otherwise known as Wyatt while Hopper is a paranoid prophet of the hippies as Billy the Kid. The stunning DVD version of the film notes the importance of Laszlo Kovacs the director of photography. Much of the film consists of Kovacs' simple shooting of the riders as they travel spiraling highways and bigoted backroads. It is some beautiful footage and essential to the trip. A major deal is made much grass is smoked and the film takes off from there. Their ultimate goal is never clearly defined but Fonda's final comment to Hopper may sum it up for viewers. Did they find what America was supposed to be about? I guess not according to Fonda.There is a surreal experience at a commune the Kid and Wyatt stop at. These scenes are out of a Fellini film. One significant shot paints the commune with a 360 degree pan across the faces of the livein hippies. The expressions on the faces all seem different some grinning others just zoned out. Kovac's amazing camera work especially on the road with the bikes along with a virtual who's who in rock music of the late 60's makes for a sometimes visceral filmgoing experience. The immortal 'Born to be Wild' blares over the opening title sequence and everyone from Hendrix to The Byrds are heard throughout. EASY RIDER also contains one of Jack Nicholson's 2 or 3 most memorable performances even to this day. As drunken lawyer George Hanson he creates an amazingly funny and perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda. He realizes what the general public can think of the longhairs and puts himself in danger just by traveling with them. A bizarre notion of alien presence in the U.S. government is part of a hilarious conversation Nicholson and Hopper have over Whiskey and smoke. His scenes on Fonda's chopper with the golden football helmet are absolute cinematic classics. Credit must be given to Fonda Hopper Nicholson Kovacs and Terry Southern for giving a new face to moviemaking. They captured the era in a raw jump cutting fashion. Maybe the hippies were not entirely right by trying to live off the land or smoking dope all the time but they may have been onto something.RATING 12".

Also in the beginning there is a pretty annoying editing technique which they luckily soon abandon.The film really gets astounding in the second half. The whole film is shot very well by DP Laszlo Kovacs and the music might be one of the best soundtracks ever in film. I might even buy it. The film is filled with genuinely poetic ideas. Jack Nicholson gives a star making performance and Dennis Hopper is once again and forever THE MAN. This film is filled with many biblical metaphors which never came off as pretentious but very powerful. The film is filled with very strong visuals. No wonder Dennis Hopper once wanted to work with Alejandro Jodorwsky. The ending is might be the best part of the movie. It is almost the ultimate what the fck?' moment in history but for such a chaotic film it fits perfectly. The ending is also powerful. It represented to me the end of a generation.Well okay.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I just watched this movie for the first time in 30 years.  The first time I saw it I thought it was just a jumble of druginduced fantasies made by some spoiled rich kids.  Now that I've seen it again after all those years of historical perspective I now see that it was truly a work of genius.Possible Spoiler!It isn't just a social commentary on the bigotry and hypocricy of the 1960's toward the long hairs.  Underneath all the groovy man hippie dialog and constant drug use you can see the real purpose of the film  It is a simple but powerful statement of the futility of going down the wrong path in search of the American dream.It starts out with our two righteous heroes scoring some big cash by smuggling drugs out of Mexico.  Their dream is to go to Mardi Gras for a big party and then retire in Florida with their illgotten money.   In spite of their crime they are portrayed as innocent and gentle young men in search of personal freedom.  In the course of their journey they experience several different lifestyles none of which truly satisfies them.  They spend time at a hippie commune which they find to be full of weird people who instead of being truly free are struggling for their very survival. They go on an lsdenhanced romp with some prostitutes in a New Orleans cemetery which turns out to be a real downer for them.  They get exposed to verbal abuse and even violence by the rednecks in several towns along the way.  They connect with a drunk but very insightful lawyer who is unsure of his own place in the world. When it seems that he will start making a difference in the lives of our heroes he is brutally beaten to death by some rednecks from the town they had all stopped in earlier that day.The only positive experience they have is when they stop to fix a flat tire at the farm of a Godfearing man and his family in the rural southwest. While sharing a meal with them Peter Fonda's character compliments the man about how he has his life all together even though they are generations apart in lifestyle.So why are our heroes going through all of this?  They are searching for their own version of the American Dream.  Although they may be motorcycle riding hippies of the counterculture of the 1960's their goal was to make some quick money so that they could retire from the worries of life.  It is very symbolic that they kept their drugearned money hidded in one bike's gasoline tank that is painted with an American flag.  Rather than conforming to the world of the time by getting haircuts and finding jobs they pursue their dream by getting some quick money and seeking the freedom to enjoy themselves for the rest of their lives.  The dream is the same the motives are the same but the methods are different. At the end they realize that they are really no different from the culture they sought to escape from.  Peter Fonda's character sums it all up with the simple line We blew it toward the end of the movie.   Shortly after that is the famous scene of them getting blown away with a shotgun by some ignorant rednecks in a pickup truck on some southern backcountry road.  They start their noble quest in secret with a drug deal and their quest and very lives are ended in secret on an obscure country road.  But their terrible end doesn't happen they find out that the freedom they sought wasn't at all what they expected it would be.I think this film still has a strong message even today.  Many of the social ills of our culture have their roots in the misguided ideals of the 1960's counterculture.  Those who think they can become truly free by rejecting the hardlearned principles that served previous generations tend to find that life has a way of enslaving them in other ways.As to the film the acting is simple straightforward and powerful.  The dialog is very understated and leaves a lot to the imagination.  The scenery is fantastic and the music fits the story perfectly.   Those who weren't alive during the 1960's may not understand it but it is still worth watching.  Highly recommended!".

A movie with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson in it is hard to disappoint. That scene with Nicholson talking UFO's at the camp fire represents the great actor at his pinnacle. Anyone who has seen that scene surely wouldn't be able to resist inhaling!The movie started out in an optimistic mood with Fonda and Hopper setting out to discover America. The audience is naturally drawn into all the excitement. After all everything that the duo was going through seemed so cool and so within reach too. I try to watch every road scene carefully everytime I play this movie back on my VCR to try to remember a few spots to see if I could find them in person next time I'm out there in the Southwest. The soundtrack is of course fantastic. What makes it even greater is how well the songs fit the film. After seeing this movie it's somehow hard to picture Monument Valley without hearing the song The Weight in my head.The Nicholson take on aliens at the camp fire was the high point of the trip. Then things began to turn sour. Very sour. May be that's why I've watched the first half of the movie so much more often than the second half. And I bet I'm not alone. May be that sums up the whole movie pretty well. People are attracted to it because it represents their dream and we can't bear to watch our dream die.".

It seems to be an extremely cliched view of hippies.  All Peter Fonda does is gaze prettily into the distance.  Dennis Hopper isn't much better.  From the point when Nicholson comes into it the action is much better paced.  When he dies there is a mild panic that things will go to how they were before.  For a time it looks like it will.  But the terrific acid trip scene pulls things back from the brink and then we're full set for the finale...The ending is a classic along the same line as the original Planet of the Apes.  It's chilling horrifying and perfectly executed.  To see the whole redneck mentality towards hippies is as insightful as it is tragic.  It just seems such a shame that the rest of the film couldn't live up to the values preached at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Easy Rider which was made in 1969 and directed by Dennis Hopper who was not only the director but also one of the two main characters. The other main character is played by Peter Fonda who along with Hopper wrote the script to the movie Easy Rider. Peter Fonda plays a Captain America type of guy his bike along with his helmet are painted the colors of the American flag and his leather jacket he wears has a flag sewn into the back of it. Dennis Hopper on the other hand plays more of a hippy role with his long flowing hair and by the way he dresses we can see a total difference between the two characters. Though these two characters are different they are both on a journey together to travel over the country to experience what real freedom was. The only thing they had with them were there hot rod bikes and all there money which was hidden in Wyatt's gas tank. One of the strangers that these two encountered along the way was famous actor Jack Nicholson. Jack played a man by the name of George Hansen who is a lawyer who seems to have a very clear drinking problem. They meet up with him when they get thrown in jail for riding their motorcycles through a parade in the streets of the town they were riding through. From there they go through a series of events which ends up leading to the death of George Hansen Nicholson. Once Hansen was beaten to death by the town locals who had been hassling them earlier was almost the start of the beginning of the end for the two travelers. The end of the movie comes when the two of them are riding their bikes along the back roads when a couple of hicks decided to try and scare them by pointing their shotgun at them. Hopper doesn't even budge but instead gives them the finger which then leads to him being shot while still riding his bike. Wyatt who was played by Peter Fonda then goes to get help for his dieing buddy. Though he never makes it because the hicks so to speak doubled back and as he was going one way they were going the other and shot and killed him as well. Throughout the whole movie I kept pondering in my head what is freedom? And what is freedom in America and will they find it. In the end I don't they did find freedom even though they went all over the country they still were put down or oppressed. They were ridiculed and made fun of at the diner beaten while they were sleeping because they were different from the locals. Though maybe the freedom they were looking to find was the open road the way you feel when it's just you and your bike cutting through the air like a knife through warm butter. Maybe freedom for them was the ability to go and do whatever they wanted when they wanted to.".

These young actors were cementing themselves without possibly wanting or knowing it as career legends of the big screen.Easy Rider is not a movie I can watch too many times. It moves along at a fairly slow pace allowing the characters and journey to dictate the mood. However it is definitely a movie that all with an appreciation of cinema should see. Dennis Hopper steps into the directors role with what appears to be amazing ease although behind the scenes may not have always been so relaxed.I would love to ride across the States but I fear I might share the same destiny as the lads in this mellow flick.7 out of 10.".

These young actors were cementing themselves without possibly wanting or knowing it as career legends of the big screen.Easy Rider is not a movie I can watch too many times. It moves along at a fairly slow pace allowing the characters and journey to dictate the mood. However it is definitely a movie that all with an appreciation of cinema should see. Dennis Hopper steps into the directors role with what appears to be amazing ease although behind the scenes may not have always been so relaxed.I would love to ride across the States but I fear I might share the same destiny as the lads in this mellow flick.7 out of 10.";

The acting aside from the breakout performance of Jack Nicholson is horrendous... everyone is portrayed as a clich OK so Phil Spector might be dead on but he's likely playing himself.

Unfortunately these bright spots are wrapped up in a production that looks like a freshman film school final. A better use of your time is to dump the soundtrack into your iPod or if you see the movie watch the first 5 minutes skip to Jack Nicholson's alltoobrief appearance then skip to the final 30 seconds... you'll think it's great.

Was he saying Yeah this doesn't work. Communes are amazing places where everyone works together for the common good and share their love. or Here's a commune I don't get it either but make up your own mind. ?Yes there were drug scenes but frankly they made no impact on me a child born a year before the film was released. Not a positive not a negative. Their choice of locale for an acid trip seemed ... uhhh ... well dumb. The formula for a bad trip includes Go to a depressing sad frightening place then hit.I've read reviews lauding this film for being outstanding but so many seem to either launch into political diatribes or interpret the film to directly relate to their own social views that the reviews seemed just disconnected from the film. A good hint is to notice that nearly everyone who loves the film describes it as clearly representing something  yet 'something' is different in each review. You don't need to be a gambler to recognize that the true answer is that 'it probably doesn't mean any of those things'.Want a true classic from the same era?

Now for the negative criticism.Poorly directed. Those flickering shots from scene to scene almost had me shaking my head and I was thankful that it only happened a few times. Poorly acted. Jack Nicholson even was only passable as turning in a good performance and it seemed like Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were just...talking. And on top of all of that it was horrendously written. Characters come and go like nobody's business and when the main characters get killed off at the end which was pointless and you could kind of see it coming after that awful scene depicting their LSD induced state you don't care. You feel no emotion.And just to make things worse it was boring. The plot went along at a snails pace  I watched it a few weeks ago and from what I remember most of the film is just our guys on their bikes. Then at a hippie camp. Then on their bikes. Then in jail. Then on their bikes. Then sleeping. Then on their bikes. Then at a whorehouse. Then at a graveyard wow a slip in the pattern!. Then on their bikes. Then they just get shot by some rednecks in a van and the plot ends. Joy! The film is a sign of the changing times yes.

He looks like he could have done with a lot more practice riding it. Hopper looks the more natural biker of the two.I didn't fancy staying up to watch this so I taped it. And as is always the way the damn thing started early so I missed a little of the start Fonda  Hopper were already in the junkyard doing their drug deal so I don't exactly know about the what's and why's of the start.The film is a very psychedelic look at late 60's America It's almost like someone read some Jack Kerouac and decided to make it into a film. The film makes a very definite statement from the moment Fonda drops his watch before they set out on the road. They have no need to measure time or to know anything exact.They trip happily along having small things happen A flat tire picking up a hikehiker I almost thought he'd stolen their money when he said the gasoline had been taken care of Taking him to the commune that is one weird series of scenes and then being arrested by the police for crashing a parade.Finally here they meet Jack Nicolson as a strange southern lawyer who has been arrested and gets them free. They finally wear helmets on their bikes I assume they are riding through states and counties that have helmet laws and Nicolson is wearing a Football helmet of all things. Though I guess it would protect him as well in a crash.During the camp fire discussion about Venusians I totally got where Robin Williams' Mork got his ideas for The Friends Of Venus because he totally sounds like Nicolson. I also noticed later he was doing the whole braces over a tshirt thing like Mork too.The scene in the caf was heavily laced with bigotry I'm amazed to think people could have ever been so narrow minded. Even towards people of their own color and very much so to how they spoke about the US flag. It makes me wonder how many people in America still don't seem to realize how long the civil war has been over.I assume the southern rednecks attacked the riders during the night even though it seemed like a dream sequence and they killed Nicolson even though he was most southern and respectable looking of the 3 men.The visit to the brothel is very quiet subdued. The scenes play out very quietly like they are hard to perform until they go out onto the streets into the Mardi Gras. For those scenes the film takes on a very amateur film look not well focused and color looking washed out.In the graveyard you get another one of the many Cuttogether shots and very rapidly cut to and from various points of view which is difficult to watch and even harder to pay attention to.The characters are tripping some on very bad trips but this quickly cuts to Fonda  Hopper having another fireside scene which seems to make no sense at all and then are back on the road again to somewhere else.The man who shoots Hopper has no reason likewise when Fonda is killed. They are just 2 men on motorcycle's who the 2 rednecks take a dislike to and decide to scare them and end up killing them both. The film seems to simply have run out of ideas so they kill the remaining 2 main characters. The whole idea that they were going somewhere with their money to do something is suddenly lost.I totally didn't notice Toni Basil yes the same one of 80's fame who sang Mickey! as the dark haired hooker Mary. Mind you I did notice Dan Haggerty AKA Grizzly Adams who it turns out built the bikes featured in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Motor Psycho is pretty much your typical Russ Meyer film and features all of his trademarks. We've got busty women unlikely characters and over the top violence and it's all filmed in stylish black and white. The film is a lot like the slightly earlier masterpiece 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' in style and execution although Motor Psycho doesn't feel as extravagant as that film. The running time is only just over seventy minutes so the film also feels a little underdeveloped. The plot is rather simple and focuses on a gang of motorcyclists who see fit to rape and torture various women. However they bite off more than they can chew when they rape a veterinarian's wife and he decides to pursue them along with a woman whose husband was also killed by the gang. Naturally this film is extremely entertaining although it doesn't have a great deal of credibility. There are some really good scenes in the film but unfortunately there are also some 'not so good' ones which bring the whole piece down. Still this is a more than decent way to spend your time and if you like Russ Meyer I'm sure you won't have a problem with this.".

MOTORPSYCHO was made first and it's basically the male version of FASTER PUSSYCAT three bad guys roaming the desert and looking for kicks. There are several plot points that are even identical between the two movies. But today MOTORPSYCHO has been totally eclipsed by FASTER PUSSYCAT or BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. It's ironic because  MOTORPSYCHO was a bigger hit than FASTER PUSSYCAT the latter having flopped on its initial release. FASTER PUSSYCAT is now a bona fine cult hit while MOTORPSYCHO toils in near obscurity. And it's unfortunate because it's one of the grittiest Film Noir I've ever seen. It's a true pulp novel come to life. It's a combo of Orson Welles' A TOUCH OF EVIL and a countless Film Noir from the 1940s. But unlike TOUCH OF EVIL or the older Film Noir films MOTORPSYCHO doesn't shy away from the violence or the thrilling aspects of the story.Some might say the subject matter of rape is too serious to be used in a socalled exploitation film but Meyer handles it pretty well. It's still unpleasant at times when the guys forces the wife to dance with them butthe film never crosses the line. In fact MOTORPSYCHO is a rare breed of movie it depicts the actual disturbing subject and even exploits it closeup of women's bodies but doesn't go overboard with it as it never stray away from its story. The film keeps interest with its characters and situations until the very end. It's never overshadowed by its sensationalistic aspects. This is because some of the acting is pretty good and the stunning use of BW photography excellent composition from Russ Meyer himself and the overall grittiness of the story. It's a pretty darn good feat for an exploitation film.The acting from everyone is surprisingly good. Alex Rocco is excellent and believable. The bad guys are never overthetop. The woman who played Rocco' wife the beautiful Holle K Winters is also excellent and believable. Her scenes when she's harassed by the three men feel authentic and are difficult to watch. Strangely enough this was Holle's only movie. And then there's Haji. Haji is THE ultimate Femme Fatale ever put on screen. You can't help being attracted to her and know she's nothing but trouble. She's like a babe on the cover of a pulp novel come to life.I prefer MOTORPSYCHO over FASTER PUSSYCAT which is also a remarkably well made actioner but it's more campy and at times too overthetop to be taken seriously or BTVOTD which is just plain stupid. MOTORPSYCHO has just the right amount of violence grittiness and believability to make it feel like a great if overlooked Film Noir.".

Motor Psycho is a raw drama about delicate topics such as rape murder and revenge. The plot involves a battle between vets! A veterinarian's wife is raped by 3 relentless bikers one of them being a Vietnamveteran and he goes after them accompanied by a busty lady who has been widowed by the same gang. Normally Meyer's films are a feast for all sensesthere's always something extravagant to discover or admire. Compared to that Motor Psycho is pretty lame and it merely depends on two ultrastrong sequences and a delightful breastparade even though all female flesh remains covered.  The sequence in which protagonist Alex Rocco forces his female companion to suck a snake's poison out of his leg is brilliant and so is the grotesque finale in which the main villain Stephen Olivier revives his Vietnam trauma's. I'd recommend the film for those parts alone! If you're a fan of the director's personal style I advise you to check this film outIt won't take much of your time anyway since the film only last a good 70 minutes.".

There is the wonderful Haji and a few buxom women on screen but no outrageous sexual humour or camp touches. 'Motor Psycho' plays it fairly straight. The budget is nonexistent but the acting is pretty good and despite Brahmin and pals not strictly being bikers you can see 'The Wild Angels' on the horizon and maybe even 'The Last House On The Left'. Stephen Oliver plays disturbed Vietnam vet Brahmin who terrorizes several women in a desert community. Alex Rocco 'The Godfather' 'The Stunt Man' plays the local vet Cory Maddox and after his wife Gail Holle K. Winters is raped and beaten by Brahmin and his sidekicks he vows revenge. While tracking the thugs down he meets Ruby Bonner Haji whose husband was recently murdered by them and they help each other when they get stranded in the desert. 'Motor Psycho' is a very gritty movie for the time and surprisingly effective. A very good bgrade movie that deserves some more attention. Check it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Motor Psycho is probably the closest Russ Meyer ever got to making a straight thriller. While earlier RM roughies like Lorna and Mudhoney featured disturbing rape scenes Motor Psycho features two implied gang rapes. The second of which is a house invasion scene that wouldn't look out of place in a 70's exploitation movie. Censorship laws of the time meant that these scenes were never overly graphic however they are definitely pushing the boundaries for the time and are undoubtedly nasty. Similar to Lorna this film also has a distinct lack of humour with the odd exception such as the moment where Haji sucks the poison out of Alex Rocco's leg in a clearly sexual way. But generally speaking the sexual side of proceedings are more alluded to and there's really next to no nudity on offer here perhaps understandable given the often nihilistic tone.Motor Psycho is perhaps most notable in Russ Meyer's canon for two things. Firstly for introducing Haji who as ever puts in another feisty performance as a Cajun woman married to a slob played by Coleman Francis director of the anticlassic Beast of Yucca Flats. Secondly the movie is a clear precursor to the superior Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! RM conceived that latter movie as a version of Motor Psycho but with three female criminals. Ironically given Pussycat's status nowadays as RM's most famous film Motor Psycho was much more successful commercially on release. But the test of time has been kinder to Pussycat. Although a good film what holds Motor Psycho back is that with the exception of Haji the ladies do not have significant roles. RM needs his women to take centre stage and this is as maledominated as an RM production gets. Acting is generally good with Stephen Oliver convincing as an unhinged Vietnam vet Meyer himself appearing as a hilariously unPC law enforcement officer Alex Rocco is decent as the hero and Haji is ace just love that accent. So in summary not a classic Meyer but without doubt a superior 60's exploitation effort.".

Alex Rocco makes his film debut as veterinarian whose wife falls victim of the gang's vicious atrocities. A badass animal doctor engages the pursuit to chase down the gang. Driving through desert he meets a wounded woman Ruby Haji whose husband has been murdered by the same thugs. Together they start the road to justice or is it just blind vengeance.'Motorpsycho' is probably me second favorite film of Russ Meyer after 'Pussycat'. Although his first real narrative film was 'Lorna' 1964 followed by 'Mudhoney' it was 'Motorpsycho' with Russ Meyer proved he can direct more straightforward film with more serious in tone and without unnecessary nudity and stereotypes. The film is also important as it was one of the first that depicted Vietnam War veteran suffering PTSD.".

	schema:headline " Competent Bmovie revenge thriller from Russ Meyer";
	schema:reviewBody "The last of three movies directed by exploitation legend and pioneer of the 'nudie cutie' Russ Meyer in 1965 Motor Psycho is one the filmmaker's few 'normal' movies that is one not filled to the brim with impressivelybreasted babes and scrawny sexmad males. It instead falls into the biker gang category one of the many branches of the 'juvenile delinquent' subgenre which emerged as parents and the media alike voiced their concerns about the increasingly rebellious youth culture of the time. Similar in many ways to one of Meyer's other 1965 movies and undoubtedly his most popular film Faster Pussycat... Kill! Kill! Mudhoney was also released that year Motor Psycho substitutes the strong revengefuelled gang of women led by the unforgettable Tura Satana for a trio of tortured men and the result is actually pretty good.The gang led by demented Vietnam veteran Brahmin Steve Oliver have taken a liking to antagonising the locals of a small town firstly terrorising a young beautiful women trying to relax with her passive henpecked husband before their intentions turns even nastier. They torment veterinarian Cory Maddox Alex Rocco who played Moe Green in The Godfather before raping his wife while he is away from home flirting with a voluptuous horsebreeder. He returns to find his wife battered and abused but it is nothing a woman isn't built for according to the local sheriff played by Meyer himself. Maddox decides to take matters into his own hands gradually tracking Brahmin and his cronies as he follows their path of destruction. He comes across Ruby Bonner Faster Pussycat's Haji the wife of a man the gang have just murdered in cold blood and the two partner up to end the gang's reign of terror once and for all.Any fans of the director going into Motor Psycho hoping to see a collection of naughty vignettes featuring some of his familiar roster of beauties will likely be disappointed although the film is another fine example of Meyer's skill with editing cinematography and use of music. A minimal budget rarely hampered Meyer and Motor Psycho is fastpaced and jazzy and surprisingly features a handful of decent performances. This was one of the first times a damaged Vietnam veteran had been portrayed on screen and Oliver has fun going way over the top as the sadistic angry young leader. For a film dealing with rape and Meyer takes the subject matter seriously it is also very funny in places. Most memorable is a scene in which Maddox is bitten by a snake and demands Ruby to suck out the venom. Suck it! Suck it! he screams as he forces her head onto the wound. It would seem that Meyer couldn't resist a little playful innuendo. This is a competent little western revenge Bmovie often released under the more eyecatching title of Motorpsycho!.".

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good film all things considered. I especially liked the performance of Haji aka Barbarella Catton as Ruby Bonner who seemed to dominate every scene she was in.

It was a 'curiosity pick' I liked the title I didn't have anything else in mind and my thought was of course Bill Murray!?It turned out to be one of my alltime favorite movies in the 'charactertransformation' genre.It's a compelling story of choices in life and how those choices affect or disaffect perceptions of that life.  Murray is perfection in this role because we seem him change from something we recognize to something quite different.  It is a palpable and comprehensible transformation  the movie draws us in it allows us to change with him.The rest of the characters are well cast and provide definitive counterpoint to the protagonist  the bonvivant aristocratic uncle Elliot who simply lives his life appreciatively the unthinking and manipulative Isabel concerned only with her own comforts and social standing the uncertain Sophie that allows her uncertainty to trap and destroy her the practical yet contemplative Raaz who challenges Darrell's notion of things constructively and leads him to further his quest.  Good character development all around.Finally I was impressed with the faithfulness to the book.  It's difficult for a movie to be that and still be an watchable movie.".

I read Maugham's book in the late 40s and saw the Tyrone Power Gene Tierney Clifton Webb film.  So what?  This film was neither one but that's beauty of art dudes.  It doesn't have to.  The Razor's Edge is an odyssey of a man in search of himself.  The transit nature of life and the brutality of war turn him into a superfluous man who goes off on a quest to find himself.  We can inundate this issue with metaphors until the cows come home but that's Maugham's story.  Old Somerset a closet homosexual who was a volunteer in the horrorific WW1 went through a similar transformation and in a way this novel which he began back in the 20s reflects that journey.  Murray takes the character of Larry Darrell into a new domain.  Why shouldn't he?  He's not Tyrone Power.  He's a comedian who plays a tragic role straight.  There is much in this film that makes it superior to the 40s version.  A stronger statement of the tragedy of the entanglement of the two women and a more intense presentation of the character of Larry. I saw this film when it first aired and recalled a young high school kid remarking to a friend upon exiting Man this is a totally awesome movie.  I agree.  Alas the critics and comedyaddicted Murray fa ns didn't and it flopped.  Pity.  It is a totally awesome movie.".

Murrary had read the book and the script by Byrum who also directed. Murrary approached the studio and told them he wanted to make this movie. The story goes that they respond with Sure Bill we'll make The Razor's Edge for you if you will make this little movie called Ghostbusters for us.

It has remained one of my favorite films for fifteen years and I have owned it and replayed it many times. If you look at the viewer feedback for this film you will find that the vast majority of people rate is as Excellent' movie 29 of IMDB viewers give it a perfect 1010' rating.   Those who fail to see it's qualities can be divided fairly equally into the don't get it' camp Unlike the typical Hollywood lowest denominator flicks the minimum IQ for viewing is Razor's Edge is probably at least 100 and that leaves  the population out and the disappointed' crowd who have so typecast the star Bill Murray that they wanted Caddyshack' and just can't allow him to be a serious actor. You must set aside your prejudices and give the man a chanceBill Murray is a Harvard grad who cowrote the screenplaythis was a labor of love for him. Just because he has a sense of humor does NOT make him a lightweight as this film demonstrates for anyone with the eyes to see it.Based upon the 1942 W. Somerset Maugham novel it follows the evolution of a spoiled upper class boy from Illinois Larry Bill Murray who volunteers to be an ambulance driver in WW I for a little fun and adventure' and instead gets a dose of PTSD post traumatic stress disorder.  His world was forever changed by the events he experienced.  He literally could not go home again after the war.  He tried and found the lives of those around him to be shallow and meaningless and their pursuits and interests just trivial.  There had to be a reason why he was here and this sets the stage for the real point of the movie which is an exploration of the meaning of life. I told you it wasn't Caddyshack!Obsessed with these existential issues and finding that alcohol did not make the need go away Larry travels to Paris and starts to read serious books on philosophy and religion supporting himself as a laborer.   He does not care much for his surroundingshis lack of materialism is in marked contrast to his peers and friends from before whose dreams are to grow wealthy in the stock market.  As such Larry was an early Bohemian.  I found this particularly poignant realizing as I watched this movie that it foreshadowed yet another stock market boom and bust a whole new generation of crass materialists have had their world was just as rocked by a stock market crash in 1999 as in 1929.  History does repeat and these themes are timeless. His fiancee could not deal with his common' friends and lack of modern plumbing and left him to marry someone she did not love but who had money. Another contrast to the shallow and materialistic which is a recurring theme throughout the filmwhat brings happiness to a man?Larry's journey took him to India and Hindu religion and then on to Tibet to discover Buddhathe scenes filmed there are absolutely breathtaking so I hope you can find a letterbox laserdisc or they finally bring this out on DVDit is worth it to see the whole screen. There is romance and love and loss.   I won't reveal the ending which is truly bittersweet and a bit nihilistic.  This is truly the best thing this fine actor ever accomplished and I rate it a strong 10'.   This should have won many awards and should also be considered a true classic I am disappointed in my fellow man that they so typecast the star that they could not see what a great contribution he made with this effort here.  Not light fare and a long film but one worth seeing.".

James Keach evaporates from the screen in a rather thankless role that John Payne managed to make an impression in with a show of quiet strength. Surprisingly the weakest of the star spots is Catherine Hicks usually a very fine actress adrift in her part.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is at least structurally similar to the recent film 'Eat Pray Love' with Julia Roberts. They both focus on an individual who sort of runs away from their life travels and attempts to find more meaning in their lives.Personally the source material gives A Razor's Edge an unfair advantage. But listening to my own criticisms of Eat Pray love I had to think back to one of my own personal favorite films the Bill Murray version of The Razor's Edge. Some have argued that the Maugham novel was far better than the film but I disagree. I've read the Maugham novel. I saw the movie. I prefer the film though I liked them both a great deal.The themes of the novel are there in the film but the movie chooses to focus on the themes through Larry's story rather than through Uncle Elliot's. The novel focuses most of the time telling Elliot Templeton's life with this strange bird Larry floating in and out of the scene from time to time. They are both characters on journeys seeking meaning. They both find what they need to find at the end and it isn't what they set out to find in the beginning.The reason I love this story no matter which way it's told is that it fundamentally understands reality in a way that the current rendition 'Eat Pray Love' does not. Life is not always going to be pretty and certainly not just because you have some sort of higher 'mission' to find true meaning in your life. The bad people in A Razor's Edge end up being so much more reprehensible than those in Eat Pray Love and yet you end up hating the lead character in the latter film oh so much more for being so banal. Isabel is one of the truly evil creatures in literature. Liz is just a thinly veiled version of the author who naturally can't see that she's vile. The themes of the two stories? The Razor's Edge both versions is truly a student of existential philosophy The only meaning the only reward in life is the experience you have in living it. Eat Pray Love on the other hand is a child of excess whose only message seems to be It doesn't matter who you hurt along the way as long as you feel good in the end. There is a certain selfindulgence required in this sort of 'journey of selfdiscovery' tale. But no one can really say that Larry didn't pay for going on his journey. Maybe it's just as selfindulgent that he did so but I ended up truly liking and admiring Larry at the end of his journey. Liz and I cannot really waffle on this primordial instinct most totally deserves the destined place she has reserved in the 3rd circle of Hell Gluttony with an occasional weekend spent in the 7.3.3 circle of Hell Violence against Art.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Razor's Edge is Bill Murray's first serious movie. Until this one he was best remembered as a goofball in movies like Caddyshack and Stripes or a comedian in Ghostbusters. Edge was made a full nine years before his best dramatic role as Phil in the superb 1993 film Groundhog Day. I like Edge very much because it takes the time to develop the characters and examines Larry's quest to find the meaning of life after his WWI experiences.some SPOILERS follow you may not want to read any further if you have not yet seen The Razor's Edge.The film begins outdoors at the Lake Forest Il college graduating class party everyone is joyful nicely dressed there are rides and a kissing booth. Larry Murray and his best friend Gray have volunteered to be ambulance drivers for the war. Larry is a shallow charming guy but comes home from the war changed after seeing the realities of friends getting killed right next to him. He postpones his marriage and leaves his fiancee at home as he travels to France and eventually to Tibet for his own search for the meaning of life.His awareness is heightened while working in a mine he pushes his boozing supervisor to safety as a rail car is about to kill him. He does end up in Tibet has an experience on the top of a mountain and finds the internal peace that he was looking for.Meanwhile his fiancee looking for a family and stability marries his best friend Gray.  His one true love Sophie had married Bob but Bob and their son were killed in a wreck by a drunken driver. Sophie eventually ends up in a Paris brothel never recovering from her tragedy. The economic depression of the 1920s hit making those formerly wealthy people distraught. Larry helps his old friend relax coin in hand and the headaches disappear.When Larry meets up with Sophie again he rescues her from the brothel sobers her up they plan to marry. Until she has a relapse there is a fight in the brothel Larry gets beat up the next day Sophie's body is found in the river her throat had been slashed. But Larry is somber he knows each of us is really alone in the world anyway. Disappointed he finally heads back home America. In the last symbolic scene he is walking up a very long flight of concrete stairs outside and as he gets nearer the top starts to run up them. The DVD is just OK. There are many artifacts on the image either by a dirty camera gate or more likely a poor transfer from film to digital. There are no extras of interest and the sound is just OK. Still a very good film for anyone who likes good character studies. Murry demonstrates his acting chops early even though he was 34 here.".

Larry Murray and his best friend Gray have volunteered to be ambulance drivers for the war. Larry is a shallow charming guy but comes home from the war changed after seeing the realities of friends getting killed right next to him. He postpones his marriage and leaves his fiancee at home as he travels to France and eventually to Tibet for his own search for the meaning of life.His awareness is heightened while working in a mine he pushes his boozing supervisor to safety as a rail car is about to kill him. He does end up in Tibet has an experience on the top of a mountain and finds the internal peace that he was looking for.Meanwhile his fiancee looking for a family and stability marries his best friend Gray.  His one true love Sophie had married Bob but Bob and their son were killed in a wreck by a drunken driver. Sophie eventually ends up in a Paris brothel never recovering from her tragedy. The economic depression of the 1920s hit making those formerly wealthy people distraught. Larry helps his old friend relax coin in hand and the headaches disappear.When Larry meets up with Sophie again he rescues her from the brothel sobers her up they plan to marry. Until she has a relapse there is a fight in the brothel Larry gets beat up the next day Sophie's body is found in the river her throat had been slashed. But Larry is somber he knows each of us is really alone in the world anyway. Disappointed he finally heads back home America. In the last symbolic scene he is walking up a very long flight of concrete stairs outside and as he gets nearer the top starts to run up them. The DVD is just OK. There are many artifacts on the image either by a dirty camera gate or more likely a poor transfer from film to digital. There are no extras of interest and the sound is just OK. Still a very good film for anyone who likes good character studies. Murry demonstrates his acting chops early even though he was 34 here.";

Although I can partially see why this film was slated in the press I still loved it enough to give it the maximum ten out of ten.  However I was bedazzled as soon as my eyes hit the screen.  Although Bill Murray might have spoiled it for others I thought him inspiring and with the support of the rest of the cast surely this should have done much better.  Other acting performances notably from the troubled Theresa Russell.  Stunning backdrops and thought provoking moments not a film to enjoy with a pint though sadly perhaps peanuts and leg irons might be more suitable?".

Bill Murray is terrific in this movie adding his humor along with his dramatic character. Along side of him is Therese sorry if I spelled her wrong Russell and Catherine Hicks. Of course everyone has seen Catherine in 7th Heaven but she was an absolute beauty in this movie full of the emotion and passion that Annie her character on the show rarely sports. I'm surprised she hasn't been in a million movies and didn't win an academy for this one. Therese Russell has those eyes that cuts right through you. Yes this movie is definitely a gem. Best of all there are plenty of twists and turns throughout the movie to make it interesting. It's not just a story of a man trying to find himself it's also the story of the people in his life and the sacrifices people make for each other. I suggest that you see it in DVD format even if you hate widescreen as much as I do. They did a great job reformatting it and recoloring it. Wonderful movie a 1010 most definitely! YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!!!!!".

Murphy was at the top of his game back then and Aykroyd is the perfect snobclass elitist. Some of these jokes are so timeless that I still refer to them from timetotime and they STILL get laughs both from people who have and haven't seen this film.Yes the jokes are a bit dated and somewhat slapstick but this was a sign of the times. Most 80s comedies were full of slapstick moments. Jamie Lee Curtis was at the height of her sexy image and I'd forgotten how well she'd played her role. The late Don Ameche is so animated that it played perfectly into the mood of the film.You can find this film in the bargain bin of most stores these days. I saw it for sale for only 5.50. It's worth owning.".

Murphy was at the top of his game back then and Aykroyd is the perfect snobclass elitist. Some of these jokes are so timeless that I still refer to them from timetotime and they STILL get laughs both from people who have and haven't seen this film.Yes the jokes are a bit dated and somewhat slapstick but this was a sign of the times. Most 80s comedies were full of slapstick moments. Jamie Lee Curtis was at the height of her sexy image and I'd forgotten how well she'd played her role. The late Don Ameche is so animated that it played perfectly into the mood of the film.You can find this film in the bargain bin of most stores these days. I saw it for sale for only 5.50. It's worth owning.";

Both actors started on SNL and were ready to make their career in films. Trading Places is an example of a perfect comedy. It is funny yes but there is so much more. With its story the acting and the political racial and economical plots in the film add to its greatness. One of the best comedies to come out of the 1980's it stands as one of Eddie Murphy's best earlier films as well as Aykroyd's performances as a character actor.

It just doesn't seem to be considered by the mainstream to be in the same league as say Beverly Hills Cop or Coming to America when talking about Eddie Murphy's movies but the fact is that this is hands down his funniest part ever. And Dan Ackroyd is equally hilarious as the at first repulsively elitist Louis Winthorpe III. Add the stellar supporting cast particularly Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the Dukes Paul Gleason as the slimy Clarence Beeks Jamie Lee Curtis as Ophelia your standard hooker with a heart of gold rarely done as well as here and Denholm Elliott as Coleman the butler and you hit a rich vein of comedy gold.The plot is a classic farce situation. The Duke brothers who clearly feel they are above everybody else make a bet for one dollar over whether anybody regardless of breeding can in the right environment become an uppercrust gentleman. So as an experiment to see which one is right they work circumstances so that the rich Louis Winthorpe III is turned into a miserly bum while they have Billy Ray Valentine Murphy take his place. He takes over Louis's job his house and his standing in the community. Realistic? Well no not really but this is a farce so it doesn't really have to be. It is however hilarious which is exactly what a farce should be.If there's a running theme in this movie it is duplicity and mistaken identity. People are constantly being mistaken for something they are not or forced into a situation where they become something they are not. We see this happen not only with the two main characters in the basic plot but also with Billy Ray pretending to be a Vietnam veteran then a karate master Louis who despite all appearances as a wimp claims to have stood up to Billy Ray during their earliest encounter in the movie when he actually hands Billy Ray his suitcase setting him up for an arrest when he was not actually trying to steal anything Ophelia who for a price pretends to know Louis outside the police station further besmirching his name all three plus Coleman who each dresses up as a different hilarious ethnic character to trick Clarence Beeks and Beeks who in a subsequent scene is mistaken for an actual gorilla because he's wearing a costume Al Franken and Tom Davis as the baggage handlers marveling over how human the gorilla appears are priceless.Eventually Billy Ray finds out what is going on and gets together with Louis to turn the tables on the Dukes. Ophelia who has fallen for Louis and Coleman who feels guilty and used over his part in the whole ruse help them out. Do they get their revenge? Watch the movie and find out. It will be well worth your while. This is easily the funniest movie either Ackroyd or Murphy have ever done its only real competition in this regard is The Blues Brothers and to think this was originally meant as a vehicle for Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor is odd because it's hard to imagine either of them in the parts done so well by Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy. John Landis keeps the pace going at a nice fast speed and being a native Philadelphian the locales and opening montage including a scene of the Rocky statue are a kick. But of course you'll love this movie even if you're not from Philly.".

I can't have been very old when I first saw this because there were not much more than one scene that I recognized. Even the title seemed new to me. Furthermore I don't recall thinking about the film... about what it meant. This contains a lot of sad truth. The scenes of Aykroyd's character going from the peak of America's business life to rock bottom in a disturbingly short amount of time provide food for thought. Landis presents these events without pretense or heavyhandedness... he gives us the facts as they are. No bias. This direct almost indifferent tone makes it all the more scary... this is the way it is and that's accepted. The movie also has some insight to prove on racism and greed. Paul Gleason whom I have only seen in The Breakfast Cluband Not Another Teen Movie spoofing his character in aforementioned movie plays a radically different role yet still shows some of the authority he's famous for as the principal in The Breakfast Club. That was amusing to watch for someone who enjoyed said film so much. Jamie Lee Curtis bares a lot of skin for those in the audience looking for that. Aykroyd and Murphy are both extraordinary. They get to play with their characters a lot to great effect. They create so many funny moments there are simply too many to list or for mere words to do justice you'll just have to watch the film for itself. If you are a fan of either actor you won't be disappointed. The language surprised me with how uncensored it was compared to today's standards. The plot is interesting and based on an intelligent idea. The pacing is dynamic. The acting is all topnotch. The humor is mostly good and tasteful with few but glaringly obvious exceptionsthe fate of Beeks being an almost offensive one. The film has more heart than most of its kind... if you watch only one movie of this type let this be it. I recommend this to fans of the actors andor director and people intrigued by the general idea. If you are even considering watching this... take my advice and do so. It is intelligent without being preachy and funny without trying too hard. John Landis has yet again created something big. 810".

I have always considered that some of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies came out during the 1980s and Trading Places' definitely falls within this category.Everything is a success with this movie the high quality of acting from both the main actors and the supporting cast the wonderful humour and engaging dialogue contained within the script the development of the plot the music selection provided for the various scenes and even the atmosphere and scenery contained in the movie. Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd are particularly outstanding in their various roles and keep the excellent performances up in their reversal of roles. Ralph Bellamy Don Ameche and Denham Elliot also provide their characters with a great amount of depth and dimension and make what would have already been a wonderful comedy success even more entertaining. The only very minor criticism is that Jamie Lee Curtis is meant to portray a prostitute in this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is much too high quality of an actress for the role of a prostitute and I think if the emphasis had been on her character's profession it would have weakened her contribution to the movie. But thankfully the writers and producers recognized that she shouldn't be portrayed in a onedimensional role and her truly wonderful and highly excellent acting abilities shone through during the whole movie.The script flowed naturally and had an edge to it that made it both entertaining and intriguing. Even though the storyline and outcome was slightly predictable the scriptwriters succeeded in keeping you interested and keeping you entertained as the sequence of events unfolded. The humour contained in the movie is genuinely entertaining and doesn't sound forced or strained in the same way that it does in some other movies. Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy make a thoroughly wonderful team and I hope they someday consider doing another movie together. I think the 1980s marked the high point of Eddie Murphy's career and this was one of the movies that cemented his reputation as a great comedian. I couldn't recommend this movie highly enough. A truly great comedy masterpiece and classic.".

I've been watching this movie since I was a kid know that sounds weird as this is an adult comedy but I actually loved it growing up. As an adult it just gets better and better each time I watch it. It's one of the most intelligent comedies mixed with some great slap stick and take on our society. What a great idea take an educated man take away everything he knows and owns and see if he could survive. Then take a man with no education given the right encouragement if he would rise to the occasion. Trading Places isn't just one of the best comedies to come out of the 80's but one of the best comedies of all time.Duke brothers Randolph and Mortimer own Duke  Duke a successful commodities brokerage in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Holding opposing views on the issue of nature versus nurture they make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two people at opposite sides of the social hierarchy and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director educated Louis Winthorpe III and a poor street hustler Billy Ray Valentine Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence because of a misunderstanding robbery attempt.

Their comedic timing is always on key. A mix with Jamie Lee Curtis and Denholm Elliott added much more to the story and jokes with their reactions and presence. My favorite scene with Dan was definitely seeing him exit the prison with his fianc and Jamie Lee Curtis has been paid to make it look like he's her loverdrug dealer and her all over him in front of his fianc while he's just shocked as Jamie goes down on him and to add it all he gets a hard slap to the face! Ouch! But you'll have to pause the scene because you'll die of laughter. Eddie's best scene is also when he gets excited that he could go to his low life acquaintances and show off he throws a party and they trash his house and he kicks them all out was so funny the way he did it. What a classic movie one that I will watch again and again. I proudly show this movie to my friends when they need a good laugh. This movie is a treasure to comedies it's well paced and one of the best movies of all time. The only change I would have made is that at the end when they are on their own private island they toast each other on a job well done and since ironically they ruined the Dukes with orange juice it would have been more hilarious if that's what they were toasting with instead of champagne. But it's still a perfect movie highly recommended.1010".

I've been watching this movie since I was a kid know that sounds weird as this is an adult comedy but I actually loved it growing up. As an adult it just gets better and better each time I watch it. It's one of the most intelligent comedies mixed with some great slap stick and take on our society. What a great idea take an educated man take away everything he knows and owns and see if he could survive. Then take a man with no education given the right encouragement if he would rise to the occasion. Trading Places isn't just one of the best comedies to come out of the 80's but one of the best comedies of all time.Duke brothers Randolph and Mortimer own Duke  Duke a successful commodities brokerage in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Holding opposing views on the issue of nature versus nurture they make a wager and agree to conduct an experiment switching the lives of two people at opposite sides of the social hierarchy and observing the results. They witness an encounter between their managing director educated Louis Winthorpe III and a poor street hustler Billy Ray Valentine Valentine is arrested at Winthorpe's insistence because of a misunderstanding robbery attempt.

Murphy is matched all the way by Dan Akroyd Denholm Elliott Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche in this lighthearted financial caper all of them breathing life and wit into a plot that has been done many times before. In fact apart from the periodic nudity and foul language Trading Places comes over as a very oldfashioned comedy story.Ultrarich businessmen Randolph and Mortimer Duke Ralph Bellamy Don Ameche run a successful firm in Philadelphia buying and selling their way to everincreasing wealth. One of their best employees is business executive Louis Winthorp III Dan Akroyd a pampered brat who lives in a huge house and has his every need tended to by his faithful butler Coleman Denholm Elliott. The Duke brothers disagree that Winthorp's success is the result of good breeding and education. Randolph believes that Winthorp was born into an easy life and that anyone  even a lowlife from the streets  could do his job if given the chance. Mortimer is adamant that a lowlife would fail in the world of big business and etiquette and that Winthorp would still find a way to succeed in life if he were cast out on the streets. The brothers place a onedollar wager against each other to determine who is right. Via a series of engineered lies Winthorp loses his job his house his fiance his butler and his reputation. Then foulmouthed street hustler Billy Ray Valentine Eddie Murphy is plucked from the gutter and put in Winthorp's place. Winthorp struggles to adapt to his newfound poverty while Valentine proves a surprisingly perceptive and effective financier. But when Valentine discovers that the whole thing is just a wager  and that the Dukes eventually plan to fire him from their firm  he tracks down Winthorp and together they plan an audacious sting on the scheming brothers aided by Coleman the butler and Winthorp's new girlfriend streetwise hookerwithaheartofgold Ophelia Jamie Lee Curtis.Trading Places is in many ways a 20th Century variation of the story of The Prince And The Pauper. The comic dialogue is expertly handled and the casting is just genius. Who would have thought that old veterans like Bellamy Ameche and Elliott would be able to bounce off a volatile foulmouthed fasttalker like Murphy to such brilliant effect? That's not to say the film is perfect. Others have pointed out correctly that the wit runs dry about twothirds of the way in and the film becomes more caperish. The final third deals with the revenge plotted by Murphy and Akroyd against the Duke brothers  while it has some passable silliness check out those stupid disguises they wear during the train journey to New York it is all rather plotheavy and seems disappointingly similar to those caper movies that were all the rage in the '70s eg The Sting Bank Shot The Hot Rock Silver Bears etc.. Still on the whole Trading Places is a lot of fun and at least for twothirds of the way it is a comedy of real quality!".

Teaming up with comedian Eddie Murphy Ackroyd was brilliant as the stock trader who's life is ruined by two arrogant businessmen's bets.Louis Winthorpe III Ackroyd works for the major Duke Corporation. Earning money for arrogant brothers Randolph and Mortimer Duke Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche Winthorpe is thrown on the street when his bosses conduct a social experiment. Replaced by Billy Ray Valentine Murphy Winthorpe's life slowly collapses in on itself. Eventually with the help of Valentine and prostitute Ophelia a young occasionally topless Jamie Lee Curtis Winthorpe goes out on revenge.With a film style which is typically 80's Trading Places could so easily be cast aside like the majority of comedy from the decade. As an exception however the story is a fun lighthearted escapade with a stunning cast.As the downward spiralling Winthorpe Ackroyd gives perhaps his finest comedy performance most notably shoving a huge cooked fish inside his Santa Claus outfit.Eddie Murphy as Ackroyd's contrasting number is great as a former bum who develops an obsession with keeping his house clean and who finds it hard to cope with his new found wealth.In terms of supporting cast Jamie Lee Curtis produces a decent performance as Ackroyd's love interest although she never outperforms her role as Wanda in A Fish Called Wanda 1988. In contrast deceased actors Denholm Elliot Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy are great in their respective roles whether loyal butler or cruel millionaire.All in all with a superb cast and the typical 80's comedy element Trading Places is a great film. What makes it different from other 80's comedies Weekend At Bernies for example is that whilst others grow tiresome and old this film is always a pleasure to watch. Whether for the first time or for the hundredth time Trading Places is always a guaranteed laugh and a true feel good movie.".

As an exception however the story is a fun lighthearted escapade with a stunning cast.As the downward spiralling Winthorpe Ackroyd gives perhaps his finest comedy performance most notably shoving a huge cooked fish inside his Santa Claus outfit.Eddie Murphy as Ackroyd's contrasting number is great as a former bum who develops an obsession with keeping his house clean and who finds it hard to cope with his new found wealth.In terms of supporting cast Jamie Lee Curtis produces a decent performance as Ackroyd's love interest although she never outperforms her role as Wanda in A Fish Called Wanda 1988. In contrast deceased actors Denholm Elliot Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy are great in their respective roles whether loyal butler or cruel millionaire.All in all with a superb cast and the typical 80's comedy element Trading Places is a great film. What makes it different from other 80's comedies Weekend At Bernies for example is that whilst others grow tiresome and old this film is always a pleasure to watch. Whether for the first time or for the hundredth time Trading Places is always a guaranteed laugh and a true feel good movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Think about it. Many other biblical stories involve the punishment of 'wicked' people but the Book of Job is God being a jerk to a good person just to prove a point with Satan which God doesn't actually win because Job eventually becomes angry with God. So here the Duke brothers are actually being a jerk to two people. Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche play the old money Duke brothers Randolph and Mortimer. In the classic movie era Ralph Bellamy could play the clueless good guy and he could also play very bad characters. Don Ameche tended towards the good guys in most of his films or at least the well meaning. Well here these two are rotten to the core. They are not malicious they just have no respect or regard for their fellow human beings whatsoever. Dan Akroyd plays Louis Winthorpe III an employee of the Dukes who is their fair haired up and coming employee. He also comes from a wealthy background with a former debutante for a fiance. Eddie Murphy plays Billy Ray Valentine a poor conman pretending to be a legless Vietnam vet to be a more successful panhandler. As a result of a mixup Billy Ray is accused of trying to rob Winthorpe and Winthorpe chases Billy around his exclusive club and holds him until the police get there.Now the brothers who have observed this commotion have been having an argument about whether environment or breeding makes a man and they bet one dollar against one another in an experiment in which they will disgrace Winthorpe cause him to lose his money and his standing in the community and make him poor. The other half of the experiment is to build up Valentine into someone that they can pass off as one of their employees and they give him Winthorpe's old house to live in. The experiment will tell whether a change in environment will make a gentleman out of Billy Ray and cause Winthorpe to turn to crime.How are the Dukes being a jerk to Billy Ray? Once the experiment is over they plan to throw him back out into the street. Well the brothers successfully pull off both switches. As a result both Winthorpe and Billy Ray learn the people they thought were friends really aren't. Winthorpe's friends and fiance abandon him. Billy Ray discovers his friends are hanging around his house just for freebies. Meanwhile a beautiful hooker Jamie Lee Curtis takes in Winthorpe who has no idea how to fend for himself without money or at least plastic. She is doing this for a price however once Winthorpe can reclaim his fortune he promises to pay her well. Funny thing Curtis' hooker has a plan that would never work today. She is saving her money and putting them in TBills at 10 and plans to retire in a few years and live off the interest. Good luck with that plan today since you cant even get banks to pay you .01. She'd be on her back until she was old and flabby and nobody wanted the ride. How does this all work out? I'll just say justly. That's all. Try to dig up this oldie from the 80's when greed was good and watch for yourselves. Personally the Dukes are so bad they are terrific. My favorite exchange between them Duke brother 1  Mother always said you were the greedy one. Duke brother 2  She meant it as a compliment.".

Her Alex is a maniacal nutcase who isn't above anything to keep Dan for herself including terrorizing his family and kidnapping his daughter.  Anne Archer plays Dan's wife it's a role that many actresses can play in their sleep. She does a fine job but it's similar to her roles in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.There is a larger issue here though and one that was discussed when the film was released Aside from the moral problems of adultery doesn't Alex have a point ?  Isn't she entitled to something besides simply being used for a night or two ? The tension in this film is constant although a lot of it seems too easily foreshadowed.  Overall though a terrific thriller and a justifiably huge hit.".

It was a 'favorite topic of conversation about the office water cooler' for a number of weeks. At the time it was a shocker. Nowaways.....who knows? As we become more and more desensitized to violence sex and profanity it takes a lot more to shock us.Still this movie had memorable moments that have stayed with us who first saw it at the theater 20 years ago. Most of those memorable scenes if not all of them involve Glenn Close's character Alex Forrest. Man this is a woman who would not be denied what she wanted in this case married man Michael Douglas.No sense going into all the details. Everyone knows them by now anyway. Looking back I think the film was a good lesson for men or women thinking about cheating on their spouses and assuming nothing bad will happen as a result. Men may commit more crimes but that old adage about a woman scorned certainly is demonstrated here in spades! Douglas' character Dan Gallagher certainly can attest to that but he is anything but a sympathetic character. Both actors do a superb job in here but kudos also to the rest of the Gallagher family played by Anne Archer wife Beth and Ellen Hamilton Latzen daughter Ellen.Also the cinematography shouldn't be overlooked. The widescreen DVD certainly brought out how nicely this film was shot and directed. This twohour film keeps your attention all the way. The only thing I would change is the language toning it down a bit. Otherwise it's a classic thriller and one of the most famous films in the '80s.".

It was a 'favorite topic of conversation about the office water cooler' for a number of weeks. At the time it was a shocker. Nowaways.....who knows? As we become more and more desensitized to violence sex and profanity it takes a lot more to shock us.Still this movie had memorable moments that have stayed with us who first saw it at the theater 20 years ago.

Douglas is equally effective beautifully conveying increasing angst and guilt later he looks sick when he finds his wife chatting with Close.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most talked about films of all time Fatal Attraction where married men learned a very valuable lesson keep the pants zipped. I don't think there was a more talked about film in the 80's than Fatal Attraction it made so many people think. It was a very intelligent thriller with great characters and a terrifying story. How many women get rejected by a man and haven't fantasized about just ruining their lives as revenge? Alex Forrest was the woman who didn't just fantasize but lived it. How many men have a woman who won't let go of them no matter what they do? Even vice versa but this was the movie that scared men right back into their wife's arms.Dan Gallagher is a successful happilymarried attorney living in Manhattan when he meets Alex Forrest. While his wife Beth and daughter are out of town for the weekend he has a passionate affair with Alex. Though he thought it was understood to be a simple fling she begins clinging to him. Dan explains that he must go home and Alex cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He thinks the affair is forgotten but she shows up at various places to see him. She continues to call until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours and then confronts him saying that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her she argues that he must take responsibility. She will do anything at this point to make him be with her even if it means destroying his family.Glenn Close who had only played the nice girl roles blew everyone's mind when she played Alex Forrest. What passion she put into the role and part of you couldn't really hate her. She brings up a great point to Dan Because I won't allow you to treat me like some slut you can just bang a couple of times and throw in the garbage?. Your heart does break for her but at the same time you want to scream at her to let go of Dan and not hurt his family. Michael Douglas as Dan plays the role extremely well. He gives Dan a sense of realism he's not a major jerk who just looks for random women he makes a mistake and owns up to it. He's still very smart but very frightened and rightfully so when he learns what Alex can do to him. You believe that he loves his family he made a bad choice and don't we all? The consequences were a bit extreme this time. Ann Archer as Beth was not only beautiful classy but incredibly intelligent. She makes Beth so real and I loved her line that I found out was improvised when Dan tells her that he cheated What is the matter with you?! how many women or men have screamed that when getting hurt? Ellen Hamilton Latzen as Ellen their daughter is one of the best child actors you could imagine. She doesn't make her character annoying and when she sees her parents crying she breaks down and you just want to hold her so badly. What talent at such a young age. Fatal Attraction was made so well and the reason why I think it holds up is because it is a very intelligent movie with great characters. You could relate in one way or another. Just a side note I do wish they stuck with the original ending since it would have made more sense with Alex's character I won't give it away but it also would have been ironic with her and Dan's love for Madame Butterfly. But people wanted to see Alex get what she had coming after her being named a bunny boiler. But trust me when I say this is one of the best movies to come out of the 80's and I still love watching it.910".

	schema:headline " good acting ok movie";
	schema:reviewBody "When watching this movie my biggest problem was that I couldn't really sympathize with either one of the main characters Michael Douglas' Dan or Glenn Close's Alex.  Douglas played a married man who had a weekendlong affair with a business associate played by Glenn Close.  Dan didn't know he was getting involved with a psychopath but he shouldn't have cheated on his wife in the first place.  It's never really clear why he cheats on his wife other than a selfish attack of lust.   Alex was trying to make a point that he couldn't just use her and then go back to his family but she knew he was married so she should have known what she was getting into.  She seemed so mature and sophisticated in the beginning and then we never find out why she is so crazy.  I lost any bit of sympathy I might have felt for her during the rabbit scene.  It's one thing to harass a grown man whom you feel has wronged you but it's entirely different to take it out on his innocent 6year old child.  The final showdown with Dan's wife in the bathroom is very predictable right down to the screaming teakettle in the kitchen that masks the screams from upstairs. I do think the ending was a little more than Douglas' character deserved. He didn't really seem sorry for what he did it took terrible things happening to his family to make him confess to his wife.  His family was so lovable and nice and they definitely didn't deserve to be so poorly treated.  Dan was very lucky to have home and family restored to him at the end he didn't really deserve it. All in all though this film wasn't a bad thriller.  I must admit I was a little tense trying to guess what Alex would do next.  I wasn't entirely sure what she was capable of so it added to the suspense of the film. Close's acting was good she was a very believable psycho.  There was a lot of talent in this film and everyone turned in good performances.  Although it was relatively predictable if you allow yourself to get swept up by it it is made exciting by Close's performance.  Not a bad film but not the best thriller ever made.".

I do think the ending was a little more than Douglas' character deserved. He didn't really seem sorry for what he did it took terrible things happening to his family to make him confess to his wife.  His family was so lovable and nice and they definitely didn't deserve to be so poorly treated.  Dan was very lucky to have home and family restored to him at the end he didn't really deserve it. All in all though this film wasn't a bad thriller.  I must admit I was a little tense trying to guess what Alex would do next.  I wasn't entirely sure what she was capable of so it added to the suspense of the film. Close's acting was good she was a very believable psycho.  There was a lot of talent in this film and everyone turned in good performances.  Although it was relatively predictable if you allow yourself to get swept up by it it is made exciting by Close's performance.  Not a bad film but not the best thriller ever made.";

Glenn Close is chilling as the predatory female who stalks her erstwhile lover harassing him at every turn destroying his property and engaging in emotional blackmail of the basest kind. Michael Douglas as the spurned woman's target and victim is desperate to keep his indiscretion hidden from his attractive wife the classy Anne Archer. The cinematography is rich with excellent color and texture especially the twilight scenes and the music is spare with subtle shadings. The entire cast is topnotch especially Close who eyes Douglas the way a python looks at a mouse.".

That is a guilty pleasure and i'm not even guilty about it. That movie is the king daddy of sexual thrillers. But in second place a movie that is probably better is Adrian Lynne's intoxicating 1987 Best Picture nominee Fatal Attraction. Sure the movie is insane and overthetop. But that's just what makes it so good.The film revolves around a hard working family man named Dan Michael Douglas who won an Oscar the same year for Wall Street. One weekend while his wife Anne Archer in an Oscar nominated role and kids are out of town he has sex with a mysterious temp named Alex Forest Glenn Close in an Oscar nominated role. As he tries to move on with his life she desperately tries to get him back. And she will really stop at nothing to see him again.If you haven't seen this movie and it sounds familiar that is probably because you saw 2009's Obsessed. But this movie is a lot better than that one. This one is a lot sexier crazier and more dangerous. Also the acting isn't as irritating. Now don't get me wrong you certainly want to murder Alex. But that's what makes Close's performance work so well.Close is amazing. Here she gives one of her best performances. Now I have never exactly found Glenn Close sexy but it is obvious just why she was chosen. It's because she's amazing in this movie. She is mysterious she is bonkers and you really can't take your eyes off of her. I loved Cher's performance in Moonstruck but I still have to say that the Oscar should have gone to Close.Fatal Attraction isn't a great movie. I think that whoever wrote it and basically any other movie where an obsessive woman goes insane is slightly sexist. But it doesn't matter. Fatal Attraction is extremely entertaining. It is definitely a wild ride and it may not have worked without Close. She beat out plenty of incredibly sexy actresses for the role. Just watch it and you'll see why.A".

It's definitely a movie of its time which connected strongly with audiences when it was first released and also seemed to tap into certain attitudes that were starting to become more prevalent in society at that time. The values associated with the permissiveness of earlier years were gradually being left behind and this movie's depiction of the dangerous consequences of indulging in casual affairs seemed to be a strong endorsement of this change.The impact and influence of this great box office success has continued to be significantly stronger than would normally be expected as it has successfully maintained its popularity over the years and even been responsible for the term bunny boiler becoming a universally recognised part of the language. Amusingly 25 years after the movie's release when Aerosmith's Steven Tyler announced his decision to leave American Idol to return to his band which was his first love he added I've decided it's time to for me to let go of my mistress before she boils my rabbit.Dan Gallagher Michael Douglas is a successful happily married Manhattan lawyer who meets book editor Alex Forrest Glenn Close when he does some work for her employers. One weekend when his wife Beth Anne Archer and daughter Ellen Ellen Hamilton Latzen are out of town visiting his inlaws he and Alex have a short but very passionate affair which he quickly decides to end but Alex is in no mood to agree.Alex initially reacts by slitting her wrists and later goes on to harass Dan by calling in at his office and later continuing to make telephone calls to him on his work number. When he tells his secretary that he's not prepared to take any more of these calls Alex reacts by telephoning his home at all hours of the day and night and then even poses as a prospective buyer of his apartment to show her determination to make him take responsibility for his actions.Alex continues to terrorise Dan and his family by pouring acid on his car kidnapping his daughter boiling Ellen's pet rabbit and physically threatening Beth before the story eventually reaches its violent climax.Michael Douglas is very convincing as Dan who seems to have achieved his success so easily that he takes his comfortable lifestyle and happy marriage for granted. He's a man who in a moment of weakness makes a bad decision and very soon after regrets what he's done. His betrayal of his loyal wife and his inability to confess until he's forced to are reprehensible and indirectly put his family in great danger.Glenn Close is genuinely scary in a very accomplished performance in which she shows the various facets of Alex's personality with such skill that she really makes her character's changeable and unhinged behaviour seem understandable. Anne Archer is also perfect in her part and the scene in which she learns of her husband's infidelity is extremely touching as she retains her dignity magnificently despite her obvious pain.Fatal Attraction is an attention grabbing title which is reminiscent of the classic film noir titles which also frequently alluded to death danger fear or entrapment and just like those films this movie features flawed characters aberrant behaviour and plenty of suspense.".

I think that makes this hold up is the acting pure and simple. Douglas and Close and also Anne Archer as the wife really make this material work as strong as it can  they sell every minute they can and they have to. This is even in knowing that the movie doesn't really have a very firm moral leg to stand on we should be on Michael Douglas' side but he's the one that screwed up.Sure Glenn Close is crazy or a victim of abuse as well if one wants to dig a little deeper who knows what happened with dear old dad before he died of that heart attack but and this is important she's right certainly initially or at least has a point that should matter about how he's just tossing her to the wayside after a night or two of fun. I like that Lyne and the writer have underlying implications that make it more harrowing and that it paints the two sides as neither right or wrong though of course one is more wrong than the other the wrongs don't make anything right up to varying degrees. What makes it not stand up over time is the ending or even the last act.From a writing perspective it should have ended how it was originally supposed to with Alex killing herself and framing Dan as if it was murder. It calls back to the mention of Madame Butterfly which is the set up and payoff. But because the producers acquiesced it turns into the template for countless sy movies where the character has one last hurrah to mess with the supposed heroes and blood is spilled and one more life is lost. In a sense my criticism is the same as Ebert's that it kind of turns into a Friday the 13th movie. But at least for 85 of the running time maybe 90 it is a provocative terrifying drama that has a simple moral message don't cheat.".

	schema:headline " Excellent Performance by Glenn Close In A Rather Ordinary Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Had it not been for the performance of Glenn Close this movie wouldn't really be worth the effort of watching. She shines in an excellent performance as Alex Forest the spurned lover of Dan Gallagher Michael Douglas whose obsession with their relationship becomes progressively more violent. Close manages to play Forest as the successful business type the emotionally wounded woman and the deranged psychopath and she makes every aspect of Alex believable. Michael Douglas is always competent and is no less here than anywhere else but his portrayal of Gallagher to me seemed a bit shallow and unconvincing.The story itself of the spurned woman seeking revenge is hardly original and even the twists and turns seem typical and predictable and more than a few things in the story made little sense. First given that Gallagher seemed to have a good relationship with his wife Beth Ann Archer and a happy family life as the father of Ellen Ellen Hamilton Latzen it seemed to me that he fell too quickly and too easily under the spell of Alex. Their relationship didn't come across as believable to me. Then setting up the last confrontation of the movie Gallagher is shown locking the doors to his house with his body language suggesting that he had forgotten to lock them before. What? After everything he and his family have been through at Alex's hands he didn't think to keep the doors locked at all times?! How did this guy get through law school? Finally the ending was predictable and for about the 914th time in the movies we see a villain who seems to be dead come back to life. There's no shock to this anymore although I suppose when Fatal Attraction was actually released in 1987 it was actually only the 674th time this had happened. In short there really wasn't much imagination at the end.This movie is all right as a way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon but except for a few scenes the thought of the boiling pot in the kitchen  and its contents  will remain in your mind after the movie's over this is hardly edge of your seat stuff. Watch it for the excellent performance by Close though.610".

As the tension ratchets up there are more and more shocking and memorable scenes with perhaps that involving the daughter's pet rabbit as the most disturbing. Given the time of its release many viewers saw this as a moral tale against sexual infidelity with the Alex character as the personification of AIDS.Viewing it again almost three decades later it still has the power to shock and awe but we now know that the ending  so satisfying to audiences and conducive to box office records  was changed as a result of test screenings. So the frequent references to the opera Madam Butterfly and Dan's handling of a knife hint at the finale intended by screenwriter James Deardon and indeed a recent stage version of the film presents a more nuanced treatment of Alex and offers a different resolution.".

	schema:headline " The Original Romantic Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Prior to viewing Fatal Attraction I was familiar with the film. I saw clips of it here and there on YouTube TV specials I saw the semiremakeripoff starring Beyonce Obsessed and I am aware of the huge reputation surrounding the film. There were no surprises.I can imagine being in the '80s sitting in the theaters expecting a sweeping love story and being overcome with surprise and adrenaline rush when I realized its true nature. In a perfect world that may be possible but in reality I am forced to be friendly from a distance.Don't get me wrong it's a great movie probably the best thriller from the '80s but being so immersed in the hype did took away the fun that everyone gossiped about opening weekend in 1987. In fact Fatal Attraction was the first of its kind that spawned countless romantic thrillers since. It's mystifying to think of the ways the world of thrillers has changed since the origin of the genre but in other way stayed exactly the same. Same plot formula same twists different style different noise levels. The bottom line is most haven't gotten much better than this.Glenn Close has said that she doesn't view her character Alex as the villain in the story. That's typical of an actor playing the antagonist in a film because actors have to justify their characters as human beings to be able to portray them successfully. But I am actually taking the actor's side this time. I felt an enormous amount of empathy towards Alex. She's a lonely woman she's really lonely and that's the cause of all her malicious actions that follow. In ways she was the victim. Close embodies Alex making the loneliness enough for the viewer to link themselves to but not too much to overwhelm the viewer. When the script calls for Close to be overt man does she bring it though.My favorite performance maybe even over Close's was Anne Archer. Knowing she got an Academy Award nomination prior to watching the film I assumed she'd get a scene to cry and throw a fit and that's what scored the nomination. She does well in that scene I anticipated but I think she's exceptional from start to finish. Warm when need be. Sorrowful when need be. Douglas is the triomember who doesn't stick out as often but when his moment finally comes for the character to shine you realize he was shining the entire time we just didn't notice.The killer aspect of Fatal Attraction is the directing from Adrian Lyne. Lyne layers fear on top of characters not the plot necessarily but the fictitious characters themselves. A particularly wicked moment of direction involves a telephone ringing. The telephone is what we're focusing on but Lyne keeps the audience's engagement with the telephone on whether Archer's character will answer it and what Close's might say to her. Lyne takes his time and builds real suspense that often results in a misleading outburst of intensity. Lyne also makes the intelligent decision to let the sex scenes happen but not to let them define the film. He puts the characters the story and most importantly the suspense ahead of the raunchy sex scenes.The film editing is crisp pinpointed directly at Lyne's vision of the suspense. It keeps the film tantalizingly alive. The film is aided by a piercing score the scorches the suspense volumes louder than it had a right to be. Although moving the story along at a nicepace is the ultimate intention of the thriller symbolism can be found such as the shot of Douglas leaving Close's apartment the morning after the affair adding to the basic almostgeneric message of the film don't cheat. The ending isn't the original ending though it's one heck of a conclusion and a heartpounding thrill fest that shouldn't be controversial. The original ending is a sterling twisted scene as well but it's one that's not nearly as exciting as the final ending.Originality is lacks in Hollywood today but Fatal Attraction remains as an original roller coaster jolt which other films have adapted and cheapened to make a few bucks. They know it works with the audience so why not? That being said the script is really good. The dialogue is coated with richness while still being realistic they speak the way people actually speak in the real world. There are tons of twists packed into the screenplay many of which pay off. The ones that don't work as well feel awkward and downgrade the flick a tad but nothing that can stop the reputation of the thriller.Being the first of its kind cannot be easy but Fatal Attraction maintains the respect and class of it's massive reputation. It's filled with startling twists great acting and a director reaching shocking heights of the suspense genre. It's worth seeing for the terrifying finale which has stood the test of time extremely well. As much as I appreciated the technical elements I wish I wasn't so familiar with it before actually seeing it which would've allowed myself to be swept up in its madness. Maybe this is a flashing light that we shouldn't familiarize ourselves with something so much that it becomes too late to fathom the art in its purest state.Rating 8.510Grade A".

But paradoxically her inability to deal with her dysfunction drives her to lash out at the men who try to love her or care for her.The premise of this film is of an all American family man living the dream who goes astray falling victim to his lust for another woman and incidentally falling victim to her wrath when he leaves.That's why I consider this both a horror film and a tragedy because of the ending. Alex didn't deserve the fate she got. She was mentally ill and therefore not responsible for her actions.

Later viewing the original finale I was astonished here was a human more real approach to the movie.  More strings are tied together when Alex commits suicide to Madame Butterfly as foreshadowed earlier.  I think the first cut is better although it appealed to fewer people.  It made Alex less of a monster and more of a person thinking not just about her life but the life growing in her.  I will admit that Beth finding the evidence to prove her husband innocent was a bit quick but it still felt good to know that Beth and Dan would be able to lead a healthy life postAlex.  Another reason I liked the original ending was because it did not leave Dan guiltfree the self defense ending did this and it made Alex's life trivial in a way. Killing herself in my opinion made Dan realize his responsibility there was a part of him inside her.  Although the film does not really pay much attention to it I think in the first ending Dan finally awakens to his situation he is going to be a father again.  It is too bad that popular opinion cause the original ending to get scrapped it was better and fit the characters more appropriately.".

	schema:headline " Very little substance and ostensibly obstreperous.";
	schema:reviewBody "This was an obstreperous film it took almost no responsibility for itself and was extremely predictable and transparent. The plot is formulaic Douglas and Archer his wife are at a party he accidentally meets an attractive and icy young professional Close and there is instant chemistry. Why is there this chemistry? Quite simply the two find something about one another physically irresistible. Douglas simply thinks with his organ nothing else appears to enter his mind. He appears to love his wife very much and one would think they have been enjoying a good marriage. He has a daughter a good career he appears to enjoy he is attractive and healthy. So what went wrong? Apparently nothing other than an arrogant chauvinism on his part. He made a mistake a simple mistake in his mind then things get ugly.Close is a loose canon and deeply disturbed. Why? Well in a rather flaky moment this film attempts to address this question by showing Douglas breaking into her apartment and discovering the death of her father in a newspaper clipping. He died fairly young of a heart ailment a fact alluded to if allusion is even proper considering how obvious it was as a technique earlier in the film when Douglas and Close are in Central Park with his dog. She is carrying some type of emotional baggage. OK. But to become a murderous unscrupulous kidnapper stalker hellbent obsessive suicidal manipulator? Did I miss something? And furthermore what happened to that flourishing career of hers we briefly ever so briefly get a glimpse of at the beginning of the film? Does she simply forsake her entire successful career a career that must have taken years to build and mould in order to flourish as it apparently has been doing in order to stalk Douglas? That is almost nonsensical. Why would a woman whose apartment they meticulously filled with books and manuscripts become so vapid and wounded and prepared to ignore all of her intelligence and spiritualemotional reserves which ostensibly enabled her to rise to success in order to do such damage? How could she have come so far with this type of vapidity and singular weakness? And one should also ask why does she find Douglas so important? Has she never experienced rejection before? If so then why is she single and wary of men at 36? Obviously she has some experience with loss mistakes and disappointment. If not then she is a spoiled executive and success who always succeeds.

How much more obstreperous and fantastic can we get? This script is unintelligent and cliche. Every action taken is predictable but what is worse is that it is predictably illogical. There is no character development in this film. None whatsoever. In fact these characters are about as unidimensional as one could imagine. I don't understand all of the hype the film did not even offer any surprises. It not only doesn't work as a story but as a suspense film it lacks any suspense. We know immediately that Close is psychotic. We don't know why the nuances of her personage don't exist but that doesn't matter. She is simply psychotic and somehow that is all the explanation we need.Don't waste your time. The best film Adriane Lyne ever made was Jacob's Ladder. Don't miss it! Forget this film it is not worth consideration.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was an obstreperous film it took almost no responsibility for itself and was extremely predictable and transparent. The plot is formulaic Douglas and Archer his wife are at a party he accidentally meets an attractive and icy young professional Close and there is instant chemistry. Why is there this chemistry? Quite simply the two find something about one another physically irresistible. Douglas simply thinks with his organ nothing else appears to enter his mind. He appears to love his wife very much and one would think they have been enjoying a good marriage. He has a daughter a good career he appears to enjoy he is attractive and healthy. So what went wrong? Apparently nothing other than an arrogant chauvinism on his part. He made a mistake a simple mistake in his mind then things get ugly.Close is a loose canon and deeply disturbed. Why? Well in a rather flaky moment this film attempts to address this question by showing Douglas breaking into her apartment and discovering the death of her father in a newspaper clipping. He died fairly young of a heart ailment a fact alluded to if allusion is even proper considering how obvious it was as a technique earlier in the film when Douglas and Close are in Central Park with his dog. She is carrying some type of emotional baggage. OK. But to become a murderous unscrupulous kidnapper stalker hellbent obsessive suicidal manipulator? Did I miss something? And furthermore what happened to that flourishing career of hers we briefly ever so briefly get a glimpse of at the beginning of the film? Does she simply forsake her entire successful career a career that must have taken years to build and mould in order to flourish as it apparently has been doing in order to stalk Douglas? That is almost nonsensical. Why would a woman whose apartment they meticulously filled with books and manuscripts become so vapid and wounded and prepared to ignore all of her intelligence and spiritualemotional reserves which ostensibly enabled her to rise to success in order to do such damage? How could she have come so far with this type of vapidity and singular weakness? And one should also ask why does she find Douglas so important? Has she never experienced rejection before? If so then why is she single and wary of men at 36? Obviously she has some experience with loss mistakes and disappointment. If not then she is a spoiled executive and success who always succeeds. But then why would she forsake her career so easily?
