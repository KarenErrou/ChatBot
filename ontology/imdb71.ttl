With Eunhyo unable to see past her new lover's infidelite ways Eunshik must try to mature his image to save his dream girl from making a terrible choice.Sex Is Zero starts off in hilarious fashion with Eunshik and his similarly sexobsessed friends trying to score with as many college girls as is humanly possible.

Unfortunately as I've noticed with a few Korean films of late the director chooses to veer off into other more serious genres in the final reel and this really puts the dampeners on the humour. There's one particularly shocking revelation around the hour mark which is so serious for a comedy that the film barely recovers  but of course I won't spoil it here. Put it this way you know in a Hollywood production of this ilke that the good natured guy is always going to get his girl at the end... Korean productions are far more unpredictable!Acting is excellent from all the main cast and the director brings a funky lively and very energetic approach to his duties resulting in a highly entertaining mix of comedy drama and weepie rolled into one.

	schema:reviewBody "Eunshik seems like a decent if a bit odd sort of guy. A 28yearold freshman Eunshik had to delay his entrance into college because of the obligatory military service that all Korean males have to serve and other difficulties. However with his younger roommates Eunshik is able to enjoy the pleasures of college which in this film seem to be limited to smacking the head of the martial arts club with various implements gawking at pretty girls and masturbating to his and his roommates large stash of pornography.Similar to Jason Biggs character in American Pie Eunshik is a bit hapless when it comes to striking up conversations with members of the opposite sex. Yet it must be said that he does not aid his cause very well because he tends to find himself in some awkward situations such as standing on a windowsill in his tighty whities after drinking a medicine that will supposedly give one an erection for three days with a couple of perverts who seem to enjoy molesting girls on subways and jerking off at any given opportunity while hiding in closets watching people have sex and at gymnastic events.The main object of Eunshik's affection or lust is the gorgeous Lee Eunhyo played by Ha Jiwon who seems to acquire a bit of affection for Eunshik after she kicks him in the balls and sends him to the hospital. This incident also leads to Eunshik's martial arts club being able to share a room with the gymnastics club where the sultry Kim Jiwon rules the roost. Eventually Eunshik and three of his friends take out Eunhyo and three of her friends but while his three friends make progress with their dates Eunshik seems to be losing Eunhyo to SungOK the university's big man on campus and Jiwon's boyfriend. However for Eunhyo even though Eunshik leaves a lot to be desired maybe in the long run he would have been the better choice.Similar to Jung Chosin's Wet Dreams 1 and 2 Sex is Zero is filled with some very low brow humor such as the consumption of semen in soup and fried form and a very sloppy kiss that starts before a drunk girl has finished emptying the contents of her stomach but unlike the two films above there is quite a bit more skin. With the exception of Ha Jiwon each supporting actress bares her breasts with the actress showing a bit more. While some of these bits can be quite humorous such as when one girl gets stuck in the wrong hole there is one scene in which the guy unbuttons the top of a passed out drunk girl feels her up amongst other things. While meant to be humorous this scene was a bit uncomfortable especially after the girl wakes up and the guy blames her for coming on to him. They stopped at a hotel because she had a bad headache from drinking too much.In addition to the scatological humor which is so gross at points that it is not amusing Sex is Zero falls into the trap of many other comedies and tries to take itself too seriously in the last third of the film. If it had been left as a sex comedy the film might have been more tolerable but the last third of the film divulges too much from its beginning to be taken seriously.If one is looking for eye candy one will find it in abundance in this film but if one is looking solely for a light if a bit raunchy comedy then there are better ones to be found.".

	schema:reviewBody "I get Asian humor but this didn't really do it for me. With characters just acting over the top during certain situations in order to try to be funny. It's basically a Korean version of American Pie or that is what it tries to be. But the humor in this is a bit more messed up sometimes. The movie doesn't have much of a plot just bunch of horny and overly perverted college students doing perverted things on campus. While one of the guy in the bunch that is a complete dork but has somewhat of a good heart falls for a popular girl in school played by Ha JiWon when her stardom basically began. And the girl falls for a popular tool and a prick. The problem with this movie is that it seemed more serious at times because of the direction and subject matter. Also adding to what few of the characters go through makes it a bit nerve wracking. Also the build up of the relationship between the two protagonists seem way to far from being believable and seemed a bit forced at times. If this movie went in a very abnormal direction intentionally the premise and characters might have worked probably but that isn't really the case. Sometimes few comedic moments and serious tone goes well but the direction that isn't the case except maybe the last 10 minutes. Also besides few crude humor when it comes to the main plot it's very predictable. If your expecting a very comedic teen comedy you might be disappointed. I give this movie a 4.310 overall with few points added because of Jin JaeYoung is in this and she is hot and her scenes stand out for a reason. Although her character doesn't add to the plot much. But she is hot in this and I should probably slap myself for that reason. Well movies like this is about sex appeal.4.310".

	schema:reviewBody "Having watched a number of Korean films over the years I got hold of this film assuming that in spite of its raunchy title and subject matter there would be little sex nudity and grossness. Boy was I wrong! This makes American Pie look like children's TV. Sperm sandwiches masturbating burglars and anal intercourse slapstick mean that the first half of the film is actually very funny. But like other Asian comedies a lighthearted beginning leads to a serious second half designed to make the conclusion cathartic.The film begins with Lim ChangJung as a student returning to university after completing his military service. Upon his return he falls in love with one of the cute girls in the university but she only has eyes for the rich boy who oozes superficiality. Nevertheless Lim ChangJung befriends her and tries to help her deal with the difficulties of having a superficial snobbish boyfriend. It is those scenes where he tries to be there for her that totally change the tone of the film. The serious issue of an unwanted pregnancy is dealt with in a way which is very touching and believable even if there are certain scenes which are over exaggerated Lim ChangJung getting hit over the head with a hammer in the aerobics competition is ridiculous.There is an element of fantasy in this film but perhaps it is more from the female perspective. The man who dedicates his life to make a woman happy and is willing to make extreme sacrifices for her sake seems like the type of ideal man in Sex and the City.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Asian comedies and in this particular case a Korean comedy I was more than ready to witness the mixture of absurd comedy over the top action and drama. I even started to like the unusual trio that so commonly propels from Asia these days. But what I don't like is the evident line in films where one genre takes an indefinite bow to let the other genres get to its audience by the way of deep sorrow. The flow of the film suffered a great deal towards the middle where we were subjected to believing that Eunshik was a romantic at heart even though he seems like an out of town village idiot stuck in college too tough to be hurt and too stupid to know how to treat one of the most popular girls in school. Somewhat reminiscent of the main male character from One Nite In Mongkok minus the porn addiction and absence of judgement when it comes to eating nasty food.Even by disregarding the obvious jests the comedic moments are nothing to write home about sorry Mom. I laughed a few times but the lack of established wacky characters didn't keep me interested mainly because when the dramatic part kicked in the sexed up eye candy was replaced by unbelievable romance and drama.I could go on about the many things that don't fit together in this film but not without saying that this movie holds some very nice looking Korean girls who bare more than most would expect from a Korean comedy. If you are tired of seeing the usual mold of American chicks being sleazy in teenage comedies like Road Trip Tomcats and Scary Movie and have an interest in seeing raunchy Korean girls then this shows fistful of that. I give this movie a 5 out of 10 for being an alternative copycat of American grossout comedy genre with some unnecessary drama mixed in. It's something worth viewing once but don't go out of your way to see it.".

I remember the first thing I heard from this movie was that it was the Korea's American Pie but for my taste Sex is Zero is much better. You get all gags a sex comedy should have plus more. If you are a fan of Asian Cinema you know they like to throw dramatic twists even in comedies and Sex is Zero is not the exception. For example let's say the do an Action comedy in Hong Kong like Rush Hour near the end one of the 2 main characters is going to die that throws a punch to the viewer out of nowhere some people hate that and others like me love it enough of Hollywood endings. Not that I'm saying anybody dies in this movie this one is a Sex Comedy not and Action movie. Ha Ji Won plays the lead female character she is a sweetheart before watching this I saw her in a Horror movie called Nightmare she is my favorite Korean actress last movie I saw her in is Duelist you should look for that movie too is one of the best pieces of cinematography I've ever seen. I'm Chang Jung plays the lead male character and he does a great job the guy is really funny and also shows he can act when he has to. I got both the Korean DVD and the US DVD both are great but I got the US DVD because the extra material comes also with subtitles one thing that the Korean release doesn't have plus it also has a very entertaining commentary track by mrskin he had a lot to comment since they didn't went shy on the nudity factor. Hope they keep releasing Korean movies with this quality in the US. So don't wait until Sex is Zero is remake by some money hungry studio do yourself a favor and watch it now you wont be disappointed.".

The women are hardly being degraded in this movie as the male characters are all pathetic in their own ways as well. Sure there is some skin being shown...but whats a sex comedy going to do without any sex?The whole abortion part of the movie is very trademark of Korean cinema and is done quite tastefully.  Here the actors are given an entirely different mood to portray and they all pull it off wonderfully.  Unexpecting viewers may take it too seriously and wont see the comedic aspect of some of the situations like when the mom is beating up the daughter.All in all if you wish to watch a movie that could quite possibly change your life then dont pass this one up.

I can endure that have seen worse. There's no respect on women. The director tried too hard to show only actresses' nude breasts.

	schema:reviewBody "Saekjeuk shigong aka Sex is Zero is the South Korean equivalent of American Pie in my ways for better or worse. I must admit that I found Saekjeuk shigong to be far more enjoyable than the aforementioned American movie.I watched Saekjeuk shigong for the first time during the mid2000's and I remember enjoying it back then. So when I got a chance to return to it in 2017 I did not hesitate.Saekjeuk shigong is very much still an enjoyable movie one that still has good appeal and still proves to be funny in many aspects.The scene where the law student spontaneously break out in song still cracks me up to the brink of tears. It is just so oddly out of place and hilarious and the actor looks so amazingly funny while doing that scene. And the scene with the vomiting and kissing is a timeless classic it is one of those scenes that makes you go aawwww no that just didn't happen!There is an abundance of funny situations hilarious characters and awkward dialogue in the movie which all works out well together for a great movie. Some of the scenes and situations will have you curling your toes in disbelief while others will have you laying flat down from laughing hard.The cast ensemble is good and they managed to get a group of greatly talented actors and actresses on board for this project. I initially got around to find the movie because I like the talent of Jiwon Ha. And if you are familiar with South Korean movies then you will see a handful of familiar faces in the movie in bigger or smaller roles.Saekjeuk shigong and its sequel stands out in the South Korean comedy scene because of the sexual tones and concept of the story. And it was refreshing to see a South Korean director branch out to embrace this. And I must say that director and writer JK Youn accomplished this task with perfection.If you enjoy a good comedy that thrives on belowthebelt comedy and delivers hilarious situations with sexual tones then you definitely have to watch Saekjeuk shigong. This is a very entertaining comedy that can be watched multiple times.".

It's just a breath of fresh air and it was great. At times it may be a little exaggerated but I don't remember a single moment where it passed the border of reality and plausibility. Plus there are many small moments that you might miss on a first seeing that you will only pick up the second time round and that alone warrants more than one viewing.The story isn't very complicated although it's not blend either. It's just right with the theme of the movie and that is about the mistakes one can make at youth but it goes beyond that it also shows the strength of fixing the mess you made and the importance of giving a damn about someone.Putting it all together I think it was very enjoyable and I strongly recommend it to anyone just don't think you're going to watch a comedy think you're going to watch a movie.

	schema:reviewBody "This film was reccomended to me by some Belgian people I talk to on the net they said it was one of the best to come out of their country so I decided to check it out.  All in all I have to say that I really enjoyed it.  It's not entirely original but what it lacks in originality it makes up for with it's ability to charm and entertain.  I don't want to give away too much of it but the story mainly revolves around fame and the desire to achieve it.  Of course it's always much harder for some more so than others mainly those who aren't blessed with the looks or all of the talent.  Everybody's Famous is one of those rare truly feel good films that don't come around too often.  Hollywood often tries to make films like this but often fall flat by making it too cutesy.  One thing I don't understand about this movie is how it ever got rated R... were the ratings board members drunk or asleep the day they rated this movie?  There's no bad language in it and only a brief amount of nonexplicit nudity.  So if you're wondering if it's appropriate for the younger crowd I would definately reccomend it for them it should've been rated PG13.  The bottom line is if you appreciate charming feelgood flicks about the various struggles in life then you'll love this.  It was also nice to see that this film was nominated for an Academy Award in 2001 Best Foreign Language Film.".

Plot and characters seemed familiar at first but the film almost immediately distinguished itself with wellobserved small details of character and setting unexpected and delightfully absurd plot twists and the excellent natural performances by all.  All the characters had charm and a subtle fulldimensionality that's particularly refreshing these days in comedies... from the central family members Father Marva Mother down to even the smallest roles that function like seasoning like the bartender and the stonefaced assistant to debbie's manager. Characters that might have been left as stereotypes in other films like Willy Debbie and her manager surprised me with more complex  but still believable  behavior later in the story. Unobtrusive editing and appropriately brightnaturalistic visual aesthetic and cinematography make for an easy pleasurable viewing experience that has left me with plenty to replay in my mind.

Usually I'm not really into this sort of films because the dialogue is mostly silly the pronunciation poorly done and because these films have always got the same idiotic story. But as I said this film succeeds in being ahead of the others in the feelgood department. Actually the story is pretty weird yet it looks like we've seen a lot of this before. It's also sad in a certain way while it's actually more of a comedy with a feelgood factor of 9. Th story centers around Jean a middleaged factory worker. He wants the best for his family and especially for his daughter Marva.named after a famous Flemish singer from years ago Jean is working hard to promote his daughter's singing career. A bit of a problem on the way is that although she has a great voice she's also a bit overweight to say the least. After some pretty hilarious failures at singing contests Jean also loses his job. Thinking of what to tell his wife and daughter his car breaks down... Then it seems like things could take a turn for Jean when Debbie a famous singer in the Lowlands comes to help him with his car. He sees this as a great opportunity to finally change things around and kidnaps her with some unwillinghelp of a coworker his best friend Willy a sweet yet naive young man. Eventually it gets too much to handle for the two of them and it turns into a mediacircus.The film certainly has a flow some good laughs and some very good actors which is rare in Flanders. Josse De Pauw is excellent as the goodnatured father who gets in over his head. Werner De Smedt is surprisingly good as well as a simple goodnatured guy who's drawn into this affair by Jean against his will. They have some great scenes. The rest of the cast is also pretty good especially the daughter Marva who has a great voice. The major criticism however is that we've seen this all before maybe slightly different. The ending too can be easily predicted and there are some dull moments in the story.But this certainly is a nice film not a masterpiece but certainly worth a look. It's nice to see that there can also be Flemish movies of this kind. This film is certainly no less than an American or British movie of the same type. But IEDEREEN BEROEMD!Everyone Famous!has got a heart. It's an honest film about simple people who try to make the best of their lives and sometimes do extraordinary things in order to achieve this. The film got excellent reviews in a sneak previewwhere I saw itand in a press screening which is not very common for a Flemish movie. The reactions may be a bit too enthusiastic but show that people had fun watching this film and are proud of it too. In my opinion it ought to be given a chance you won't regret it. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Everybody's Famous is such a frustrating movie to review because parts of it are very charming but on the whole it is very average with an unoriginal plot and good but not great acting.The plot concerning the kidnapping of a pop singer by a distraught father in the hope of getting a famous record producer to make his daughter a celebrity isn't exactly original in nature nor how its carried out in this picture.  Even the plan going awry and the eventual hilarity surrounding the resolution can all be easily predicted from the film's onset.To go with the plot being rather humdrum the performances are nothing to write home about either.  Granted I'm not the greatest judge since it's a foreign film and I don't speak the language but through presentation of gestures tone and style the actors have their moments and are cast well but most of the time don't stand out.  It's great however to see that the daughter is played by a heavyset actress not some supermodel and that her weight is not a subject of fat jokes in the film which it may have been were this an American release.  It still plays into the film to small degrees but its not the focus.  There are also moments where the father shines though these are brief for most of the film he is someone who really means well but is simply too unlikable to root for.Perhaps part of why the film is so blatantly average is that there really wasn't any time to take risks or do anything special like many 90minute films the story is so compacted that as soon as it gets interesting its over.  With a story like this that isn't very inspired however this is a good thing as it prevents it from getting stale which it starts to become during the last 10 minutes and the ending.  The short length also benefits the film because it must have lost something in the translation for something that's billed as a comedy its not really that funny.Although the film has so much going against it it has a few moments that though there is absolutely nothing new being presented at all have a certain indescribable charm.  It also features a great original pop tune that is quite catchy even if only the chorus is in English.  Everybody's Famous isn't a great film but as long as you're not expecting anything new it's worth a rental.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marva is an overweight teenager who regularly participates in karaoke competitions. Her father really believes in her and is always pining for her to win. Unfortunately she doesn't seem that good and gets low scores from the judges. This angers her father as he knows she is capable of winning.Early on it seems as if he is just a loyal father and would support his daughter no matter how bad a singer she was. But during a puppetshow for children Marva hidden behind the puppetshow stand starts singing. Her voice is incredibly beautiful and passionate.It seems that her confidence is severely under pressure in front of adults who judge her for what she looks like. But children don't care what she looks like so she is free to sing like an angel I know its a clich but her voice is so sweet. Her father Jean has dreams of success for his daughter but is there a way to showoff her real talent to people at the record company?Jean works a gruelling night shift in a bottle factory. When he loses his job the family finances are put further into jeopardy. Producing a CD now looks impossible. But a chance encounter may provide Jean with the perfect opportunity for Marva to achieve a singing career.While out driving Jean's car brakes down. A female cyclist turns up to help fix the car. The woman just happens to be Debbi the biggest singing sensation in this part of the world. So Jean kidnaps Debbi thinking he can bribe the record company into giving Marva a chance.Okay so the plot might sound rather ridiculous. But if you go into this film wanting it to be 100 realistic you'll probably hate it. While many scenarios are very realistic this is more of a dreamer movie. Something not to be taken 100 seriously.Everybody Famous! has some very funny scenes the Michael Jackson mask and some very sad moments. The scene where Jean desperately wants to win some money with scratch tickets is heartbreaking.The acting is superb. Eva van der Gucht is simply wonderful as Marva. It is hard to believe that this was her first movie role! Josse De Pauw as the father is excellent. His desperation and love of his daughter is extremely moving. And I particularly liked Werner De Smedt as Jean's friend Willy. Willy is a very nice character and is someone who has a good heart. And plus he is very goodlooking. The supporting characters are all handled splendidly. I just wish Marva's best friend were featured more. It's like she's in it for two seconds!The film also focuses on how the media twists things and presents things in a different manner. It a way it's almost 'Natural Born Killers 2.0' without the violence.I loved the locations especially near the beginning. The photography is well handled and rarely does the music become irritating. As a nice extra well at least for Aussies Melbourne is mentioned! And the very last scene is charming.This is an incredibly engrossing intelligent beautiful funny sad and all around wonderful film.910".

It's cinematographic virtues are elusive. It presents social commentary with a smile. Commentary on the working classes for the working classes. Much of it is just silly fun in the vein of the European romp films of the sixties and seventies. There is less action and snappy dialogue however and it does sometimes seem to plod. I was fascinated by the sexy side of the film which dealt with really heavy sexual issues in an innocent and unpretentious way. It also has something valuable to say about physical beauty and pop culture but it does not really invite you to delve there. It seemed like the writerdirector was shy about being too heavy handed. I think it could have used more salt or vinegar but that's me. Marva is really well played by Eva van der Gucht. Josse De Pauw as her father carries center stage quite well but I felt that he was less well integrated with the rest of the cast. There were no magical moments of coacting for me. If you would like to see what a Belgian John Waters would be like you must catch this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The buzz on this film is ringing out loud. A remake of the original film by Kim Kiyoung widely considered one of the top Korean films of all time this updated version by Im Sang soo is a lot more revealing and explicit in nature for the modern audience probably sensitized to it being one of the films selected for competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival and its two limited screenings during our Korean Film Festival were one of the earliest to have sold out. Needless to say it makes good sense for a commercial release here.The premise is simple where Eunyi Jeon Doyeon got invited by Byungsik Yun YeoJong to serve in an uberrich household made up of three members  the master of the house Hoon Lee Jungjae his very pregnant wife Haera Seo Woo expecting a pair of twins due anytime soon and hence the need for an extra help around the house and their daughter Nami Ahn Seohyeon with whom Eunyi forms a strong friendship with since a child is nonjudgemental on someone's background and social standing.As much as most would like Eunyi a divorce to enter the household and see an opportunity to seduce Hoon this is not that movie and neither was that the motivation at all. We see the fairly impoverished background that Eunyi came from and living amongst the rich and powerful provided a chance to live the high life since the family is extremely wasteful. With Byungsik showing her the ropes necessary to do her job from the bowing to the serving the cleaning and being at the beck and call of the household members the hardship probably is well worth it for the perks that come with the job ones that are beyond the reach of ordinary folks.So when things turn you'll find yourself wondering the exact motivation she allowed herself to open up pardon the pun to the come hither of the master of the house who has a penchant for alcohol and being brought up with a silver spoon there's no such thing as a No to any of his request although on the outside he may be that rich gentleman it's not far fetched to think that these folks would consider money as the basis for all things going their way and money being the basis to bail themselves out of trouble and to keep the mouth of others shut. Money as the root of all evil probably couldn't be more true here if those with the means decide to abuse it given the mindset of theirs that they can always get away from the blame game.But what's more engaging in the film is the power play amongst the characters who are well mostly female fawning over the attention the riches and the ability of what the man in their life can offer. There's Byungsik being extremely envious with her protg she introduced to the household being the unjaded hard and younger worker who earns the trust of the family and probably she had wanted to show the young upstart her place in the hierarchy established. And of course the main cusp of the problems Eunyi will face stem from the child in her threatening the balance of power especially that of mistresses and maid with stuff that's what television melodramas get made of. To the audience we don't feel that Eun yi is of the scheming type but to the other women here's a chance of their objectives being detailed by something most unfortunate a major threat that can come sooner or later in their lives that they have to act and stop now.Jeon Doyeon deserves all the acting accolades she has received thus far for her role and we feel the pain she has to go through in having traumatic experiences forced upon her just because she's in no position to bargain until the defining moment in the finale where she gains the upper hand but at what a price at scarring the family for life. I haven't seen Lee Jungjae in action since Il Mare and here he does an about turn in a negative role that portrays the caddish behaviour of someone who has it all while the young Seo Woo portrays the wife that's quite reasonable to begin with that typical taitai but with innocence until hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.It is the power struggles and the changing of the household dynamics that makes The Housemaid an engaging watch as we witness an internal rot that was waiting to happen. While it may not reach the heights of Kim Kiyoung's original Im Sangsoo's version still keeps things tight and is a wonderful exploration of how perceived threats redefines relationships especially that amongst those with material benefits. Recommended!".

While it may not reach the heights of Kim Kiyoung's original Im Sangsoo's version still keeps things tight and is a wonderful exploration of how perceived threats redefines relationships especially that amongst those with material benefits.

	schema:headline " A misunderstood artistic drama with a couple of flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a remake from a film of the same name released back in 1960 but both movies are quite different and don't have the same story line. In the original feature the housemaid seduces a composer and menaces his family until a bloody ending. In the new version the sexually predatory femme fatale has become a poor and naive girl that gets seduced by an arrogant cold and pitiless rich man. When she gets pregnant the host family wants to get rid of her. But neither several attempts on her life nor money can't convince the young woman that wants to keep her child. She even ignores good advices from several friends and colleagues and decides not to quit the powerful family. When abuse hatred and pressure reach their highest point the young woman seeks for justice and has to fight not only a very influent and wealthy family but also her inner demons.The strong points of the movie are definitely the portrait of the clash between rich and poor in modern South Korea and the quite credible acting. I also liked the movie for its artistic approaches. The opening scene shows a scene in the middle of a big city and portrays the everyday life in South Korea before a young and unknown woman commits suicide. Her story remains untold but the idea of showing a lost soul within a big and vivid crowd is an interesting symbol for the main story of this feature. It's the same thing with the final scene of the movie that works like a picture. It portrays a very superficial family portrait where frustration resignation and sadness is covered by tasty champaign luxurious decorations and expensive gifts. This last image resumes the entire movie in a short and visual way. It was a good idea to keep those scenes as they add something special to the feature.Even though the acting in this movie is done rather well I couldn't get any connection to any of the portrayed characters. While this kept me away from entirely enjoying the feature I now think that this was the intention of the movie maker. Everybody does some big mistakes in this movie and shows his or her negative sides. Of course some characters are worse than others but in the end they all ran blindly into tragedy.The problem I have with the movie is that there are many lengths. It is all quite slow paced and also very predictable. The movie has some dramatic and melodramatic scenes but it lacks of true suspense. Some critics called this movie a flamingly sexy soap opera but I definitely can't agree on that. I actually think that this film is misunderstood by many Western critics. The sex scenes are cold and at some points even disgusting. I think that the director wanted to show us that even in normally exciting and positive moments the characters are brutal and emotionless. This fits well to the rest of this coherent and quite detailed movie but none of the characters has any kind of sex appeal.Another point I have mixed feelings about is the main character of the housemaid. Even the actress said in an interview that she still doesn't quite now who she portrayed. This mysterious image is intriguing first but gets quite frustrating in the end. Some actions of the housemaid are not only naive but are simply not logical at all. Especially the final scenes felt like a letdown in my humble opinion. The ending is definitely the only truly surprising element of the movie and gets therefor some credit from me but it somehow feels hardly credible. I would even call the ending unreal and didn't quite enjoy it.In the ending this movie is hard to sit through. It has many lengths lacks of true emotions and has a weird disappointing ending. On the other side it's an interesting portray of modern society in South Korea and convinces with many artistic elements. The movie feels like its characters as it is sophisticated but somewhat lacks of depth. Anybody who's looking for a sexy thriller or a twisted crime flick will be quickly disappointed. This movie is for those who look for an artistic drama only. I recognize the good intentions and efforts made by the makers of this movie but I didn't like it enough to truly recommend it or watch it again in the end.".

	schema:headline " Movie Review 'The Housemaid'";
	schema:reviewBody "In this remake of a popular 1960 Korean film of the same name Jeon DoYeon plays the titular character Eunyi who is hired as an upper class family housemaid tasked to take care of the family's small daughter and her pregnant mother Haera Seo Woo. Overseeing her efforts is Byungsik Yun Yeojung an older housemaid who has been with the family for a long time and holds many secrets. Hoon Lee Jung Jae the master of the house takes advantage of his social position and begins a secret affair with Eunyi. Once it is discovered Eunyi may be pregnant Mihee Haera's mother plots a way to get rid of Eunyi's unborn baby despite Eunyi's wish to keep it and leave the house.While the original film was a suspense thriller this one isn't quite as easy to pinpoint. While there are aspects of an erotic thriller this film is partly a character study and a satire about class struggle. The film starts off with a random suicide as a girl jumps off a roof onto the busy street. This event isn't really related to the main plot unfortunately which I admit would have been more interesting to follow up on. The scene portrays a cold apathetic society as kids pull out their cellphones to take a picture. Thus the film starts off with a bit of a dark offkilter cynical feel.One of director Im Sangsoo's previous films The President's Last Bang was a satire focusing on the assassination of the dictatorial Korean president Park Chung Hee. While this film isn't particularly comedic as that film it has elements which seem heavyhanded and too outrageous to take seriously. As a thriller it isn't very convincing. One of the obvious problems is the portrayal of Eunyi who is shown here as sympathetic nave and more of a victim the opposite of the original. Unlike the rich folks who eventually take advantage of her she is likable and kind.Jeon DoYeon does well with the role that is written for her. As good and fine as she is in almost every role she plays it truly would have been something special to see her play a really mean nasty characterthere is no doubt it would have been a wonderful departure and a suitable challenge for this talented actress. Then again I suppose it's like asking Natalie Portman to play Annie Wilkes from Misery. It's just unimaginable. Would it have been cool to see? Of course. The real villain role is given to Haera's mother Mihee. She plays the alltoofamiliar evil stepmother role that appears to frequent Korean TV dramas as of late. Yun Yeojung is memorable as the older housemaid Byungsik who remains constantly interesting and complex. Lee Jung Jae plays the rich master role with aplomb and brings subtlety to what is relatively a simplified and underused character. AdvertisementThe film has some great visuals particularly the interiors of the mansion full of deep reds and whites. The camera work is handheld and rougher near the beginning particularly in the street scenes and becomes more static and calculated as the film focuses more on the rich family. The film is sexuallycharged and the seedy nature of the relationship between Eunyi and Hoon along with their motives is never quite explained.The story is overly simple I felt and I expected more twists more believable characterization more thrills or something. The problem with satire is that it often pulls the audience away from fully engaging with the story or the characters an issue that doesn't particularly work in a thriller. Perhaps it might have been better if this had not been a remake. I would guess that the fear of comparison with the original could bring a director to go the complete opposite direction in the newer film or try to turn what may be a simple story into high art and appear intelligent. I just wish they'd just make it better by changing the name the plot andwell simply being a whole new film. I suppose on the positive side a remake does introduce a new generation of audiences to check out the original. In this particular case I'd love to see the original just to see how much better it is than this film.".

The simple plot remains the same a housemaid cum nanny hired into a rich family in anticipation of a second childbirth becomes sexually involved with the master and gets herself pregnant. The protagonist's character however has been completely reversed. In the original the protagonist Eunyi was a scheming villain that purportedly caused the audience to scream Kill the bitch. In this updated cell phone included version she is somewhat of an enigma but with one distinct clear attribute  complete incapability of any malice.The slowburn drama happens almost entirely in the plush mansion  a jawdropping set design in its own right. The simple ensemble of support characters comprises the superficially charming and talented master his young pretty and pregnant with twins wife their innocent preteen daughter the typical sultry matrontype housekeeper and later his younglooking motherinlaw who arrives on the scene to protect her pregnant daughter. The story unfolds slowly minimalistic and almost uneventful master's taking of Eunyi discovery of the pregnancy the three women ganging up on her master's unconcerned callous reaction and the dramatic climatic finale that is stunning more in the sense of being farcical than being nerveshattering. So what is the point? The fascination of this movie rests with Cannes Best Actress Jeon Doyeon's portrayal of the protagonist that takes the word enigmatic beyond its usual definition. As I mentioned this character seems almost entirely incapable of malice. While there are examples aplenty throughout the movie one of the best is when she is repeatedly slapped with the three women surrounding her. She seems devoid of the normal reaction of anger a natural reflex even if one acknowledges being in the wrong but simply enquires why. Although she is not exactly carnal Snow White being a divorce the sexual liaison is initiated entirely by the master. Most intriguing is her facial expression during the first of such encountera when master starts to fondle her body. At times Eunyi displayed such a childlike simplicity that she almost looks like a simpleton and then there seems to be a part of her mental working that one cannot fathom. I have posted over 800 IMDb user reviews and watched a lot more but I have never come across a character quite like this one.Other things critics have pointed out is the antirich subtext quite a savage attack on the contemptible rich or an exercise in Hitchcock style. But by far the focus is on Jeon Doyeon.".

	schema:headline " My advice is to skip this and watch the original. You will be greatly rewarded for doing so.";
	schema:reviewBody "Beware. Spoilers ahead.Kim Kiyoung's The Housemaid 1960 shocked audiences half a century ago for its bold disturbing look at lust greed and revenge. It centered on a family whose husband was seduced by a maid he had hired to help with housework. The devious maid wielded sexual control over the husband illtreated his materialistic pregnant wife and their two children  a crippled daughter and a mischievous boy causing despair and anguish to everyone. The film then spiraled into unimaginable depths that explored the worst of human nature climaxing with an ending that was as shocking as it could get.Im Sangsoo the director of the remake takes Kim's material and gives it a modern reworking. The result is very disappointing considering that it is based on a source material. The story and characters are generally quite poorly developed. This is because the characters now take on reverse personalities The husband now seduces the maid who reciprocates the action by complying with his sexual needs. Furthermore the maid is portrayed as innocent while the wife's malleable character is easily taken advantage of by others. The couple also has a daughter without any kind of disability.All these changes point to some very serious flaws in the film  the near absence of sexual tension shallow character development and the surprisingly lackluster storytelling that grinds along laboriously. Worse every scenario seems to occur conveniently so as to push the narrative along rather than as a result of genuine expression of character motivation. In the original the piano took on an added significance that of a tool for seduction but in Im's film it is merely a prop.The filmmakers have also taken the misstep of shooting the film in a setting of luxury.

	onyx:emotionText "Beware. Spoilers ahead.Kim Kiyoung's The Housemaid 1960 shocked audiences half a century ago for its bold disturbing look at lust greed and revenge. It centered on a family whose husband was seduced by a maid he had hired to help with housework. The devious maid wielded sexual control over the husband illtreated his materialistic pregnant wife and their two children  a crippled daughter and a mischievous boy causing despair and anguish to everyone. The film then spiraled into unimaginable depths that explored the worst of human nature climaxing with an ending that was as shocking as it could get.Im Sangsoo the director of the remake takes Kim's material and gives it a modern reworking. The result is very disappointing considering that it is based on a source material. The story and characters are generally quite poorly developed. This is because the characters now take on reverse personalities The husband now seduces the maid who reciprocates the action by complying with his sexual needs. Furthermore the maid is portrayed as innocent while the wife's malleable character is easily taken advantage of by others. The couple also has a daughter without any kind of disability.All these changes point to some very serious flaws in the film  the near absence of sexual tension shallow character development and the surprisingly lackluster storytelling that grinds along laboriously. Worse every scenario seems to occur conveniently so as to push the narrative along rather than as a result of genuine expression of character motivation. In the original the piano took on an added significance that of a tool for seduction but in Im's film it is merely a prop.The filmmakers have also taken the misstep of shooting the film in a setting of luxury. The characters are very rich snobbish and lead extravagant lives. They can force people to do what they want and solve problems with money. Therefore there is no real danger that their lives would turn for the worse. This is in direct contrast with Kim's film whose work had a deep consistent feeling of dread which is translated visually by depictions of the maid's diabolical intentions.The stinging social commentary about men's infidelity does not surface here.

Lim Sang Soo masterfully retells Kim Ki's original tale 1960 with imaginative alterations capturing a striking balance between eastern and western cultures. It is the sort of film a thriller that excites the audience to no end. Lim Sangsoo has already acquired significant commercial and artistic notoriety for his movies Girls' Night Out Tears A Good Lawyers Wife The Presidents Last Ban that expertly critique Korean society. He uses his movies to explore the political and sexual tensions and repressions built into Korean Society. He is renowned for his remarkable ability to bring a richly textured and multilayered story to the screen.Lim Sangsoo's film is indulgent in a plethora of tastes that can be summarized by two scenes. The older housemaid Haera Seo Woo swirling sniffing and drinking her wine roughly professionally and for the purpose of being drunk. In perfect contrast is Hoon Lee Jungjae the young renaissance man head of his household artfully ceremoniously twirling his wine glass. Not a drop is spilled between the two. Hoon is a wealthy accomplished and powerful man with tremendous confidence and precision in everything he does. He is used to getting his way. Eunyi Jeon Doyoun Cannes winner Secret Sunshine is a somewhat pure yet damaged working class maid from a much lower social status than Hoon who initially seems to be an easy conquest.

While his wife is up the duff. WITH TWINS. Yes you read that right... these rich folks can get away with anything. Of course it helps if you're a walking doormat who apologises for every little thing and only sees the best in people. How tragically naive these days.And when you fall pregnant yourself decide to keep the baby... turning down some very handsome bribes in the process what do you think happens? Why the wife's bitchy mother will poison your drink so you'll have a miscarriage. Nice. Obviously EVERYONE has a breaking point even someone as meek and mild as you. So what do you do for revenge? Shoot them all dead? Electrocute them in their sleep? Nope. You HANG yourself in front of them and just to make sure they get the point... you selfimmolate too. I don't really see how this constitutes as 'getting even'... particularly as the only one affected by seeing this suicide up close would probably be their small child who doted on you. Expensive therapy bills here we come...It's a creepy film filled with people without a moral compass and more money than conscience. It is incredibly frustrating to watch the heroine get walked on by all and sundry only to emerge with a smile and a Sorry in every situation. There arrives a time to put your foot down and say enough is enough but when things do get that far... she takes completely the wrong option. Oh well... Still I'm not really here to report on her mistakes But I did anyway. Suck it up.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Housemaid' is based on a Korean classic movie from the 60s which I have not seen but which is referred to by many critics and viewers knowledgeable in Korean cinema. With no term of comparison I have the maybe advantage of judging the film by itself. As with many other Korean films it takes a wellknown genre the rich home family drama and the relation to the servants in the house into directions unexpected for viewers accustomed to the European or American cinema styles.Eunyi is a young woman from a poor background who takes a job into a house of people so rich that no pleasure seems to be refused to them from birth. Besides housemaid she is the caretaker for the only child of the rich couple for the time being  as the lady of the house is expecting to give birth to twins sometimes soon. She soon will find herself as the alternate object of desire for the master of the house and when she becomes pregnant she starts being perceived as a threat to the luxurious routine of the family life of the rich. The older servant in the house the motherinlaw and the cheated wife will thread a plot to eliminate the danger. Her chances of successfully fighting back are minimal.Director Sangsoo Im had the privilege of building a full house of his dreams to describe the environment the rich live which contrasts sharply with the few realistic shots in the modern city environment. The visuals he created sets and colors are excellent and are part of the quality of the film. I personally also enjoyed the acting with Doyeon Jeon in the lead role the only character with human feelings and uncertainty I could relate to contrasted to the fantasies of the spoiled and the cool interest manner the other characters around behave. The psychological pressure amplified by the surrounding is well built and provides the justification for this story which starts with a suicide and ends with another one. The film has also an epilogue which is left open for commentary  I read it as a supplementary touch of emphasis of the social commentary in the story. The director seems to have learned and integrated some of the lessons taken from great world cinema masters as Kubrick or Bunuel but his voice is clear and original enough in this film to expect more in the future.".

As with many other Korean films it takes a wellknown genre the rich home family drama and the relation to the servants in the house into directions unexpected for viewers accustomed to the European or American cinema styles.Eunyi is a young woman from a poor background who takes a job into a house of people so rich that no pleasure seems to be refused to them from birth. Besides housemaid she is the caretaker for the only child of the rich couple for the time being  as the lady of the house is expecting to give birth to twins sometimes soon. She soon will find herself as the alternate object of desire for the master of the house and when she becomes pregnant she starts being perceived as a threat to the luxurious routine of the family life of the rich. The older servant in the house the motherinlaw and the cheated wife will thread a plot to eliminate the danger. Her chances of successfully fighting back are minimal.Director Sangsoo Im had the privilege of building a full house of his dreams to describe the environment the rich live which contrasts sharply with the few realistic shots in the modern city environment. The visuals he created sets and colors are excellent and are part of the quality of the film. I personally also enjoyed the acting with Doyeon Jeon in the lead role the only character with human feelings and uncertainty I could relate to contrasted to the fantasies of the spoiled and the cool interest manner the other characters around behave. The psychological pressure amplified by the surrounding is well built and provides the justification for this story which starts with a suicide and ends with another one. The film has also an epilogue which is left open for commentary  I read it as a supplementary touch of emphasis of the social commentary in the story. The director seems to have learned and integrated some of the lessons taken from great world cinema masters as Kubrick or Bunuel but his voice is clear and original enough in this film to expect more in the future.";

Being a fan of Asian cinema it is always nice to stumble upon something new and hopefully interesting.Such was hardly the case for The Housemaid.The story was below average although it held no major surprises. And what carried the movie was the acting performances as the storyline itself was just barely scraping to get by. And without giving away anything here but the ending to that movie was just ludicrous. I hadn't seen that coming I will give the director that much but come on that was just ridiculous.The DVD cover even has a sexy thriller branded on it. Hmmm let's think about that for a second. Sexy? Well perhaps by Korean standard but hardly by Western. Thriller? Ehm that would be a big blunt no!I was less than impressed with the movie and it wasn't really all that entertaining. It was easy to have one's attention drifting elsewhere. The better parts of the movie was the acting as the people cast for the roles were doing good jobs plus the characters themselves were interesting  but they just weren't given the time or space to fully develop on the screen.In overall then The Housemaid seems like a movie that wanted to tell a deeper story but had to suffer from limited time or lack of creative ideas. Regardless then there are far better Korean movies available.".

But the comprehensive tone is much or less conflicts with this setting with would cause some ambiguous reading of the abruptly dark ending the final birthday scenery has a moderately sidestepping deviation which cannot gratify an sublimating closing.The film strives to distill the trite storyline with some patent slips e.g. the medicine swapping is cursorily done at least taking away some original potions to keep the amount even and saves more spatial elasticity to its actors and the most profitable beneficiaries are Doyeon and Yeo jeong both shoulder the film's strength against banality elsewhere. Doyeon also outshines in the graphically daring sex scenes with the overbeefy JungJae Lee while Yeojeong is the thunderstealer here endowing a supporting role with a showstopper weightiness.

	schema:reviewBody "The audience at this afternoon's preview screening of The Lion The Witch  The Wardrobe at New York's AMC 25 theater in Times Square broke out in spontaneous applause at least three or four times. It seems that director Andrew Adamson has brought a thaw to normallyjaded New Yorkers as well as to the 100year winter of Narnia. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of warravaged England where siblings Lucy Susan Peter and Edmund wonderful performances by all are sent from their homes to the relative safety of 'the professor's' country estate where during a game of hideandgoseek young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. From this point the multilayered story of betrayal courage sacrifice redemption and hope unfolds into a briskly paced 2 hour and ten minute adventure that leaves the viewer emotionally charged and thoroughly entertained. The musical score is appropriately stirring and moody. The computer generated creatures are sophisticated to the point where the technology disappears and you begin to accept the performance and not the special effect! This brings us to Aslan  if the talking lion didn't work the movie would fold in on itself and go away. Aslan workshowever and works very well. Voiced by Liam Neeson Alsan is both believable as a 'literal' lion and as Aslan talking lion King of Narnia. Aslan's face is expressive and noble and Neeson's voice acting has strength and dignity. This film succeeds on so many levels it would be possible to discuss it in many different veins the direction the story's surfacelevel themes the theological possibilities the drama the fantasy the adventure.... Yes  it's an action film a dramatic film a fantasy a somewhatdark yet hopeful fairytale. It has humorous moments and frightening moments like most truly great 'family' films always seem to have. The bottom line is this is a film that will leave you the better for having seen it. There's much to reflect on and much to simply enjoy  there's certainly enough to keep you thinking for a while and that's always a good thing. Aslan indeed is on the move!".

I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done the casting the scenery the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.Though the voice of Liam Neeson is not as I would have imagined a lion's at first it is smooth confident and effective. Aslan is given the presence so essential to the heart of the story. I must comment on the performance of James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus which I believe was the best in the film. Lucy was adorable and surprisingly convincing and Peter was given a very firm performance. I was a little nervous about how Edmund would turn out but I needn't have worried those large startlingly dark eyes are perfect for the change from traitor to hero. I commend the directors of the movie on their strict adherence to the book. Narnia isn't just based on the book. It IS the book. The scope depth and wonder of Lewis's world have been captured in a timeless manner that should be cherished for all ages. This is a movie for everyone at a level for children to understand yet with a fast plot and exciting battle sequences that will keep anyone interested. The last battle scene especially is as touching as any I have ever seen including those in LOTR putting tears in my eyes even while my heart soared. Go see Narnia for an exciting welldone film and a timeless message that our world so desperately needs.Ten stars!!".

	schema:reviewBody "After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it. Early screenings gave it great reviews and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.Four children are sent away from their London home to a professor's estate in the countryside in order to escape the bombings from the Nazi invaders. What they find there aside from a severe place not unlike what V. C. Andrews would depict in FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC is a wardrobe that opens the doors to another world  a parallel one if you may  in which winter is ever present but Christmas never takes place. This is Narnia and it is under control of the White Witch Jadis who is aware of a prophecy that four humans will put an end to her wintry empire and sets out her minions against the children who have entered her world while bribing one of them  the rebellious Edmund  to join her as she holds him prisoner much like the witch in Hansel and Gretel did. Her plans are to overthrow the Lion King Aslan and rule forever. Parallels to her world and the world as threatened by the Nazis are striking and Tilda Swinton's transformation into the very Aryan looking Jadis is chilling more so in her seductiveness. At times I was reminded of Cate Blanchett they have very similar features but I think Blanchett is to Galadriel as Swinton is to Jadis. Marvelous actresses both but Swinton can claim her breakthrough with her role here.With much less gravitas than the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA arrives much faster to its goal than the former does and the reason is that the books C. S. Lewis wrote are fairly slim volumes while J. R. R. Tolkien's book is a massive tome. Also there is always the sense that the NARNIA books are more geared towards children and for much of the movie's duration there is little doubt that this is what it is its four leads are children many of the talking animals they meet are drawn in a way to appeal to children and even the White Witch's castle has a storybook quality to it. Only in the appearance of Aslan does the story take a much more adult form and its Messianic theme will not be lost on the older audience. Even so the implications surrounding Aslan's self immolation can be interpreted in nonreligious forms if anything it's also very similar to Gandalf's fall into the pit with the Balrog in tow in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children one by one are entering its world through the wardrobe. I was reminded of Stephen King's DARK TOWER series unless the characters believed in the world behind the wardrobe it didn't exist and this is true here. Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it and time of course stops... or let's say it marches at a totally different beat also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.Performances are quite remarkable especially for a fantasy film. All of the actors doing the voice overs bring their characters to bubbling life and Liam Neeson as Aslan is wise and allknowing. The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel they are real people The younger ones fare better than the older ones but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.All in all a great film equally meant to be enjoyed by children and adults alike and one which should spawn a very interesting following.".

Both character's 'death' symbolize their own necessary transmogrification only to arise more powerful than before and take their troops to victory.NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children one by one are entering its world through the wardrobe. I was reminded of Stephen King's DARK TOWER series unless the characters believed in the world behind the wardrobe it didn't exist and this is true here. Narnia only exists if you believe hard enough in it and time of course stops... or let's say it marches at a totally different beat also visible in Stephen King's DARK TOWER series.Performances are quite remarkable especially for a fantasy film. All of the actors doing the voice overs bring their characters to bubbling life and Liam Neeson as Aslan is wise and allknowing. The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel they are real people The younger ones fare better than the older ones but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.All in all a great film equally meant to be enjoyed by children and adults alike and one which should spawn a very interesting following.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on November 30th in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.Four young children enter the timeless world of Narnia through the door of a wardrobe piece of furniture while playing hideandseek. And what a world it is. There are talking animals dwarfs giants beasts centaurs and indescribable halfhuman combinations. And in this world of Narnia there is a titanic struggle between the White Witch and her evil army and the good lion Aslan and his noble army. Although it doesn't seem possible you can suspend disbelief and become engaged in the story because the artistry and technology are so outstanding. The art direction special effects cinematography editing and sound will most likely and should be nominated for Academy Awards. The lion Aslan dominates your attention in every scene he appears in and as the story unfolds he becomes as humanlike as any of the four children. The four children seem normal enough with their constant teasing and fighting among themselves but when events truly matter they come together and exemplify the highest standards of sacrifice courage fidelity and heroism. Both children and adults will find inspiration and role models in these four children. The lion Aslan is a mystical and almost biblical hero. There are many parallels between Aslan and Christianity and you can watch this film anywhere in the religioussecular spectrum you care to. I suspect that over many years the other six books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia will be made into movies and they will have the same type of financial and artistic success as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy had. That is high praise indeed.FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

	schema:headline " Breathtaking after a weak first act";
	schema:reviewBody "There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and the continued franchise of sequels would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S. Lewis and his magical world would have been completely destroyed.But I digress! Walking into Narnia is an interesting experience for me. In all honesty I find C.S. Lewis to be a great writer that I can hardly read. His books are hailed left and right and I just can't read them. It's not Lewis's fault. I realize it's my own media saturated thick head that blocks me up. So a few weeks ago after a screening of a 10 minute super trailer for NARNIA I decided to dust off my old copy of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and decided to give it a chance. I read the first two books in about a week and I wondered to myself. What was my problem? What took me so long to become enchanted by this mystical world? I've come to realize I cannot appreciate the classics. I really think that's my loss and something I intend to work on in the new year.So anyway sitting down in the movie theater I psyched myself up I intended to be wowed. I wanted Narnia to come alive on screen like it did in my mind and I think it fell a little short of my expectations but in the end made me smile.NARNIA tells the story of four children. When the youngest named Lucy Georgie Henley finds a magic wardrobe that transports her into the magical land of Narnia. Narnia is a land of talking animals magical fauns and the evil White Witch Tilda Swinton whose enslaved the land causing it to be forever winter and never Christmas. Her sister Susan Anna Popplewell and brothers Peter William Moseley and Edmund Skandar Keynes don't believe her story. Until the day all the children enter the Land of Narnia. A land and get caught up in a war that may fulfill a prophecy that will bring peace to Narnia.NARNIA is a fascinating example of a film that doesn't exactly add up but in the end is satisfying. The screenplay is riddled with the problems from the very beginning. It tries so hard to stick to the book that the early moments of the film feel flat. Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way. Narnia feels just like the British Country side the children have come from. Narnia should feel different and it doesn't. Why is their a light post growing in the middle of the forest? Why are the animals talking? Why is it always winter and yet never Christmas? These questions should inspire awe. NARNIA should glow and jump off the screen but the first act is to busy getting from point a to point b than to allow us to immerse ourselves in the NARNIAN landscape. If your like me you'll find yourself thinking why does this feel like a third rate LORD OF THE RINGS? I think what's missing is the thing that made the novel so enchanting. It's Lewis's self aware narration. Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation. Admittedly that would be difficult in a film but It would have been nice if they'd tried. Instead they stuck humor in places that seemed out of place.But fear not all is not lost. Because if you can get through the first hour which really isn't that bad. You'll come out on the other side and into a much better and powerful movie. Once Aslan voiced by Liam Neeson the Mighty Lion comes on the screen you're in for the ride of your life.I mentioned earlier there is one scene that needed to be perfect or the film would be destroyed. That scene involves Aslan and the stone table. They got it right and oh boy was I impressed. If Aslan is not strong if Aslan is not seen as a threat even as he is being tormented this scene falls apart. But Adamson and his team make Aslan a character to be reckoned with. If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over I would doubt your humanity  just a little. After that the film only gets better there is an awesome battle sequence and even Narnia begins to take a life of its own. It gives each character their moment to shine and it wraps itself up neatly enough. After the film was over I can't wait for PRINCE CASPIAN or THE HORSE AND HIS BOY to hit the big screen.I would also like to single out little Georgie Henley watch out Dakota Fanning the little girl who plays Lucy. She gives the early part of the film a lot more life and fills the screen like very few child actors can. This little girl in her debut role has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age. This little girl gives a performance that should really net her an Oscar nod. It probably won't but if I didn't bring it up who would? While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA THE LION THE WITCH and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission. Seek it out.".

Lewis' classic is reborn in 'The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' when four children from wartorn England find themselves transported to a land of myth and fantasy. It has been foretold that they will bring peace to Narnia. But can they survive the evil treachery of the mysterious White Witch who claims to be Queen? In this rendition C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with amazing special effects. Centaurs Fauns and Gryphons all come to life in this great body of work. The whole family will enjoy this film. Liam Neeson is wonderful as Aslan the Lion.I can not say that was all that impressed with Tilda Swinton as the White Witch.

	onyx:emotionText "C.S. Lewis' classic is reborn in 'The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' when four children from wartorn England find themselves transported to a land of myth and fantasy. It has been foretold that they will bring peace to Narnia. But can they survive the evil treachery of the mysterious White Witch who claims to be Queen? In this rendition C.S. Lewis' imagination is brought to life with amazing special effects. Centaurs Fauns and Gryphons all come to life in this great body of work. The whole family will enjoy this film. Liam Neeson is wonderful as Aslan the Lion.I can not say that was all that impressed with Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. She looked the part but did not seem as treacherous as I had hoped.Overall this is a really good film. If you are familiar with the story then there are no real surprises but makes up for it with incredible CGI animation.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start by saying this I am in no way attacking the story itself. I love these books and I think C.S. Lewis was an amazing writer. I hate to say this because I really wanted to like this movie but I was somewhat disappointed. I have to very much agree with zach74's review of the movie. I don't expect books to translate directly into movies. They are different mediums. But I thought this was a mediocre attempt. Without rehashing zach74's review which I think is right on there were a couple missing elements that I wished they had put in. Where is the playfulness of Aslan? His playing with the children and also with the animals that he brings back to life gives him a wonderful quality that we don't get in the movie. Another element was the suffering that takes place on the walk to the Stone Table when Aslan is to be killed. Maybe this was getting to close to the underlying Christian element in the book It is NOT an allegory those who say it is need to look up the definition of allegory. It has strong Christian overtones but Aslan is not an allegory for Christ...Christ practiced nonviolence something Aslan does not. At the end I didn't feel that Aslan was really the amazing wise compassionate character that he is in the book. I also missed the humorous asides and narration that are present in the book. I don't know how that could be accomplished in a movie but I think it could have been attempted. There are other movies that have narrators.As for the characters I though the children were reasonably good but I was most disappointed in Liam Neeson as Aslan and Tilda Swinton as Jadis. I tried to be impressed by their performances but I was left lukewarm. Neeson didn't have quite the inflection that I would imagine for Aslan. I wanted to feel that I was hearing Aslan and instead I just felt like I was hearing Liam Neeson. Swinton looked good in the previews but in the movie she seemed...small...that's the best word I can think of. Jadis is supposed to be this extraordinarily tall originally dark haired magnetic figure. Instead she is just creepy and cruel...there's nothing that makes me understand why Edmund is so entranced with her. Those who have read the Magician's nephew know that there is a fascination with her...she exudes some quality that leads you to be enchanted with her until you discover the cruelty and hardness underneath the surface. One more thing...for those who have not read the book that whole bit at the end with them grown up is probably a bit confusing. I feel like movies should be able to stand alone...meaning a person doesn't have to read the book to understand what's going on in the movie. Unfortunately as much as I wanted to say this movie was perfect I found myself often having to turn to my memories of the book to fill in the blanks in the movie that didn't quite fulfill it's potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this with 6 eight year old boys which may have influenced my opinions somewhat but they were not gripped by this. Firstly though there is a lot right with this movie. The special effects are stunning. How they got Susan and Lucy to walk through the forest with Aslan I will never know  the problem was I found myself trying to work that out rather than gripped by the narrative. The kids are great. Georgie as Lucy is particularly good I think  very Lucyish and Skander manages to make Edmund less of a prig and more angry and at odds with the world. THere are epic scenes the boys all said they liked the battle scene yet and acted some of it out in the pizza restaurant afterwards and swooping vistas and vast tracking shots and rousing music. Its just that I had never really thought of Narnia like that. In becoming epic they have lost two things  the magic and the playfulness. Lets take the magic first. A tiny point but the snow didn't sparkle. You know how snow glistens and glints ? Well not in this Narnia it didn't. It wasn't a magical place to wander into  it was all too big for a start  massive walls of rock and huge mountains. Not strange enough a landscape and it looked VERY like some of the landscapes in Lord of the Rings  not intimate enough. And the playfulness ? This Narnia isn't a fun place to be. We lose some of the fun of the Beavers and their house. THey cut some of the scenes which would have lightened up the narrative like when Aslan comes to life in the book he runs around and plays tag and they all end up in a heap laughing and excited and HAVING FUN. In the film he gives a roar and they are off to the next scene. In the book when they rescue Mr Tumnus they dance around for joy  in the film there are tears and hugs. Now I can see how a country under the spell of a white witch for 100 years may not be a lot of fun but its a long movie to sit through without some lightness. Even the crowning scene at the end is too uninvolved and not fun enough  where was the personal the relationships ? It looked like a really dull party to me. There is also a very curious new scene which doesn't seem to add much  involving them getting stuck on an ice floe as the snow melts. This takes up quite a bit of time for no apparent reason  I couldn't see how it added to the narrative and again  the ice in the waterfall is grey not sparkly and glittering. SO to sum up  good acting interesting story  which took itself all a bit too seriously and missed the point. Its a kids movie which has forgotten what its like to be a kid.".

Narnia is so fantastic it will make you want to see it again and again. I thought that the movie was marvelous. There were a few surprising moments in the movie. For some people the movie was sad for some it was happy. For me it was inbetween. I thought that when Lucy first found the wardrobe and they didn't believe her it was sad. But when Aslan came and made Peter a knight of Narnia it was very happy moment. It's joyful heart warming and completely brilliant. The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion The witch and The Wardrobe was a hit. The movie everyone wants to see and I am sure you do too. Why? Because this movie is worth it. It was unbelievable to watch. I even read the book and you can find out that the book was just as good as watching the movie because they are both great. However the book may be more educational. So the movie and the book were a success and we are lucky to have C.S.Lewis that wrote the book. In the movie there were many fantasy and reality things. There ere fauns and beavers that could speak but I am not going to tell you everything so now it is up to you to read the book and watch the movie to see and imagine the Chronicles of Narnia. Have you been looking for a phenomenal movie to watch lately? Well you're just going to have to watch the chronicles of Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe. This is an eye catching movie with varieties of different outstanding events. If you're a person that likes fantasy this is your type of movie. Don t hesitate just go and have a merriment time. Enjoy!!! 140 minutes of passion excitement and sadness. It made me grieve in some parts of the movie. It also thrilled me in parts my heart pumped with light making me want to weep of happiness. It was just like a machine the machine's purpose was to emotion change. Tears of sorrow swept down my face while watching the death of a whole slew! A ferocious lion goes at it with a witch. No ordinary spell casting witch a fierce selfish hideous wicked and a hex witch. So you can sit back watch the movie and try not to soak your face with tears. Also you might be surprised where the tricky cliff can take you.The door was opened through the two worlds Narnia and our world but at what consequence to the pevency family. Four children enter Narnia while hiding in the wardrobe from the house keeper that gives tours of the Professor's house. They enter Narnia as a family and leave as legendary HEROES! While in Narnia they defeat the evil witch that rules Narnia and get dubbed King and Queens! This adventure has so many thrilling parts it be impossible to put them all on one page. Out of ten I give this movie nine! NO movie will top this one for months and months.On Friday December9 2005 Kameyosek school grade 56 class went to go see the movie The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe at Cineplex Odeon theatres in South Edmonton Common. My grade 56 class went to see the movie because we read the book and studied a lot about The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. I thought the movie and the book were both excellent. The movie really pulled me in and wanted me to watch more and more. My favorite part of the movie was the big battle when everybody fought and the scariest part was when Edmund found the Witch and he stepped over Maugrim. I stood up and made a loud noise and every body in the theatres screamed. The saddest part was probably when Aslan died. I did not know what was going to happen. I was felling very depressed when Aslan was killed. I was thrilled at the end of the movie. When Edmund did not go with the witch. Instead Edmund stayed with his family. When Edmund snapped the witches wand that was probably the most heroic thing Edmund ever did in the movie and the novel. The lion the witch and the wardrobe movie and novel were very entertaining. I would give it a 9 out of 10 rating. And I would recommend it to everybody who likes action and adventurous movies. The lion the witch and the wardrobe was very exciting so go see it or go read it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A strangely disappointing experience given the quality credentials of just about all involved.The relative inexperience of the writers is clearly evident. Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God hell or the Nazi regime the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored we are not told who she is where she came from how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive. Similarly the children seem happy to throw themselves into a war without a second thought of home. Nothing in this story is ever explained we are simply expected to accept it without question which is a far more dictatorial representation of Christianity than Lewis ever intended. The plotting lacks energy and momentum with no real sense of suspense. The characterization is weak and onedimensional. But even more surprisingly from the creators of Shrek is the complete lack of humor.The acting is sound from all but the leads. The two older children struggle to bring the necessary range of emotion to their roles with Moseley in particular presenting a decidedly weak interpretation of heroic kingliness. The two younger children luckily make up for their on screen siblings' shortcomings with Henley bringing the wideeyed innocence to Lucy that the role requires and Keynes displaying a surprising amount of subtlety as the eternally wronged and resentful Edmund. McAvoy and Swinton are both excellent and at times are required to carry the movie alone.The CGI is competent but little more. It's always good to see Fauns and Centaurs running around but it doesn't break any boundaries in terms of design or execution. There's none of the thrill of the vast armies of Middle Earth or the attention to the minutiae of Narnia that is really necessary in realizing a new world from scratch.Disney clearly hopes that this will bring them the rewards that 'Lord of the Rings' brought New Line Cinema and 'Harry Potter' is bringing to Warner Brothers. But 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe' lacks the emotional depth epic range creative inventiveness and dramatic urgency of the 'Rings' trilogy. Similarly it has none of the humor camaraderie charisma or charm of 'Harry Potter'. Judging from the audience that I saw it with it will be very popular and a sequel is very probable but unless Narnia finds some heart and soul the complete cycle seems unlikely.".

Whether seen as a metaphor for a world without God hell or the Nazi regime the cultural and social landscape of Narnia is ripe with potential none of which is realized here. The White Witch's regime is not explored we are not told who she is where she came from how or why she took over the world. She lacks any motivation or real emotional drive.

	schema:headline " Narnia Fails To Uphold Responsibility To Book Fans";
	schema:reviewBody "Adapting a book that so many audience members have read and cherish is surely a daunting task but I believe it is also a great responsibility. Recently Peter Jackson set the bar pretty high in this regard with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Unfortunately Adamson's Narnia wasn't quite up to snuff.I count myself among those who cherish The Chronicles of Narnia having read them as a child and having reread The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in eager anticipation of the film. In my opinion this film adaptation not only falls short but does a disservice to the audience by cheating us of much of the impact and wonder of the original books.Here are the general categories including some specific examples where I felt the film didn't deliverScreen Adaptation  Some important scenes that illustrated character dynamic were cut short making later behavior and motivation seem exaggerated or clich. Example The scene where Edmund meets Jadis was rushed and awkward. It wasn't even demonstrated that the Turkish Delight was enchanted in order to manipulate Edmund  we were left to assume that his allegiance to Jadis was due solely to avarice! Also in the book the mere mention of the name Aslan for the first time was an event that had an important impact on the children. In the movie this impact was all but lost as these subtler points were sacrificed to save screen time for the type of gruesome battle scenes that you would expect from a fantasy movie but in this case didn't serve to advance the story. Another pulled punch in the book the scene with Father Christmas was a brilliant omen of the turning of the tides but here the scene seemed out of place and just downright weird. They might as well have run into the Easter Bunny.A couple of outright inventions served only to distract us from the magic and mystery of the real story The waterfall scene  who came up with that idea? The cricket ball through the window  not as effective as the original story.Casting  The elder siblings were mediocre and I can't tell if Tilda Swinton was just awfully directed or totally miscast. In the book Jadis was a noble and grand enchantress albeit with dastardly aims in the movie she was shallow petty and despicable. Oh and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan the Lion was not nearly powerful enoughthis is one of the most important roles in the film. Was James Earl Jones not available?Direction of Actors' Performances  This ties in with my comments about casting above. Performances in individual scenes seemed disjointed from overall character motivations and some character interpretations such as Jadis and Edmund were shallow and unsympathetic. Where was the charisma that would have made Jadis's character believable let alone have enabled her to amass an army of supporters? HairMakeup  Jadis sports blonde distractingly annoying dreadlocks despite her otherwise unIrie nature. The professor's hair and beard looked about as realistic as a department store Santa and the main Centaur's makeup also stood out as distractingly awful.Wardrobe  Jadis has one outfit in particular that looks like it came right off the runway of a bad 80's fashion show. Another includes an atrocious hat shaped like a giant icicleMr. Freeze from Batman  Robin would have had hearts in his eyes.Special Effects  Overall special effects were not nearly as cleanly integrated as WETA's work on LOTR and cohesion was lacking. For example the cuts between live action and CGI wolves were painful at best. Also the teeming masses of badguys all looked as though they could have been extras in the Orc armies of LOTR. Mr. Tumnus was an example of the fact that Jadis's supporters were comprised of otherwise beneficent creatures that she'd charmed threatened and bullied into joining her. Here they were unimaginatively portrayed as onedimensional twisted evil fiends.Cinematography  Boring All the visual texture and lighting of a madeforTV movie. Due to my disappointment in Adamson's interpretation of this work and in the execution of the movie that resulted I rate this film a 5 out of 10. It is not completely devoid of entertainment value but fails to uphold the responsibility that a filmmaker shoulders when adapting so wellknown and wellloved a story.".

I have just spent the last 2 hours sitting in the cinema with a massive smile in my face with occasional grimaces as the idiot sitting next to me insisted on talking to his girlfriend.

Having spent the last 2 months trying to get a job it was the most amazing experience to rewind the clock by 15 years and feel the rush of wonder and awe as the magical world of Narnia sprung to life on the big screen. The casting crew did a fantastic job with practically every character looking and acting exactly as I had imagined them since I was a child. Once again New Zealand came up trumps and the splendour of the scenery perfectly complimented the fantasy of the story.I've never felt compelled to write a commentary on this site before but I was so relieved and enchanted by this film that I couldn't help but try to spread the word.Sit back relax and let yourself be taken back to the magic and and excitement of your childhood.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sean Connery Sir Ralph Richardson and Gina Lollabrigida star in Woman of Straw a 1964 film.Connery plays Tony Richmond who hires Maria Lollabrigida as a nurse for his impossible wheelchairbound uncle Richardson. His Uncle Charles is cruel and rude and Maria doesn't want to put up with him. Shortly after she arrives she quits. Tony explains to her that his uncle doesn't have long to live which she knows and he's only been left 20 grand in his uncle's will. If Uncle Charles marries Maria she'll inherit everything and she can give him a million pounds. It's all perfect.Maria and Tony are attracted to one another though at first she resists. She also doesn't think she can bring herself to get Uncle Charles sufficiently interested in her to marry him  the idea repulses her. In truth she winds up growing quite fond of him and is strict in the way she cares for him. However his JekyllHyde behavior becomes too much and she quits again. This time Charles goes to see her himself and proposes. She accepts.While on a yacht trip Charles changes his will to benefit her and doubles his nephew's inheritance to 40000. Tony tells her that he will have to register the will in London when they get back in order for it to be legal. And that's where the trouble begins.Terrific film well directed by Basil Dearden produced in color with glorious scenery. Everyone does a great job particularly Richardson such a magnificent actor who is hateful one minute and likable the next. Connery and Lollabrigida are gorgeous. It's a good script that will keep you involved right to the very end. Highly recommended. This doesn't seem to be out on DVD. I saw it on Netflix streaming and now it's gone. Don't know what the problem is but this deserves to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Sean Connery's career in movies is really remarkable. Beginning in a Disney film DARBY GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE he lucked out early and got the signature role of James Bond in FROM Russia WITH LOVE DR. NO GOLDFINGER and the others. But he managed to break out of the typecase and pop up in nonBond roles like Amundsen in THE RED TENT Edward Pearce in THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY Daniel Dravot in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING and Eliot Ness's illfated mentor in THE UNTOUCHABLES which finally netted him an Oscar. But you notice quickly in going through his credits that he rarely plays a villain. Only twice that I am aware of did he play a villain  in the forgettable THE AVENGERS made too late in the late 1990s and without the inimitable Patrick Macnee and Dame Diana Rigg as Steed and Emma Peel and this forgotten gem of a murder plot. It was early Connery made the year that his James Bond series was well under way and the public did not really notice it because it did not show M Miss Moneypenny Spectre with Blofeld or Goldfinger or Dr. No or all those crazy gadgets. Instead it dealt with deception family hatred and a pathological villain who was supposed to be a popular hero in his normal films.It is funny that the plot line of a rich person being murdered for his or her fortune is such a popular line in detective fiction. In reality while there have been rich murder victims Sir Harry Oakes William Rice  of Rice Institute fame Jim Fisk Stanford White few were killed for their fortunes. Fisk and White were victims in love triangles that got out of hand. Oakes was probably murdered either for opposing the entrance of the Mafia into his beloved Bahamas or his opposition to a band of neoNazis trying to center Fascist activities in the Western Hemisphere in that island the neoNazis possibly having the blessings of it's then governor the Duke of Windsor. Rice a millionaire speculator was poisoned in 1900 by his secretary and a crooked lawyer who planned to plunder his estate  their legal defeat enabled the victim's estate to go ahead with his hopes for the Texas college he planned.Yet story after story is about the murder of a wealthy individual for inheritance purposes. Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers frequently use it for a motive. I won't say that greed does not play a part in crime but most crime is due to anger or hate.The murder of Charles Richmond Sir Ralph Richardson in this film is actually more than sheer greed. Connery's nephew plans to inherit the multimillion pound estate but he also hates how Richardson humiliated his brother Connery's father by luring Connery's mother into a sexual relationship. In fact Connery's use of Lollabrigida as a lure to snare Richardson is more than just clever plotting which it is. Connery's frightening confrontation with the convicted Gina in her death cell shows that he equated Lollabrigida with all women who always were charmed by Richardson and with his mother  whom he refers to as a spaniel bitch quite vehemently. Connery may want the fortune but he also wants to humiliate women for what his father went through.My favorite moment in the film was in the conclusion when Alexander Knox as the detective and Johnny Sekka confront Connery with new evidence that Richardson was murdered on the yacht not at his country estate the key for Connery's plot to frame Lollabrigida he cynically and mockingly says You mean that when I lit the cigarette for Uncle Charles in the limousine the old boy was really dead? Unperturbed Knox says Yes I was meaning to ask you why you did that! Connery suddenly realizes that Knox is not dismissing the new evidence and that a sudden idea that Connery put into use in the car ride from the yacht is actually going to help hang him. He never fully recovers his ease and control after that moment.This is a good murder film and well worth watching when it appears on cable or DVD or video. Catch it if you can.".

This movie was filmed around the time Connery made From Russia with Love. I had no idea what to expect but was pleasantly surprised that it's a pretty good thriller and a great Bond bonus for Connery fans. The character of Tony Richmond has a lot of overlap with James Bond  his wardrobe looks association with fancy locales and sports cars and treatment of women. As you watch Connery in this role you will not be able to avoid thinking of him as Bond. That's not a bad thing and doesn't detract from the movie itself. But rather I look at it as a bonus Bond movie. Connery was at his physical peak during the filming of this movie. His appearance vocal delivery and acting are also some of his best work in a film. I think Connery's physical appearance changed so rapidly between 1962 and say 1980 that every year he looked markedly different than the year before. Fans of Dr. No From Russia with Love and Goldfinger will appreciate seeing Connery in this movie when all his looks and skills were at their finest. If you have a couple hours to spend watching an older style film or are a big Sean Connery fan this is a recommended movie.".

Lovely to look at as well are the two stars a suave well tailored Sean Connery in his prime and the incomparable Gina Lollobrigida decked out in a Dior wardrobe and looking as uptodate today as she did half a century ago. It's not like watching an old movie at all. In addition to her appearance she gives a compelling performance. How could anyone not enjoy two hours of this? Woman of Straw came toward the end of Basil Dearden's career and his direction is experienced and surehanded. The intelligent script contains some thoughtful statements on racism and class structure. This profound bit of dialog is uttered by the tyrannical millionaire played by Ralph Richardson when reminiscing about his late wife She never raised her voice to me never tried to wheedle anything out of me. She was exceptional. She died in great pain. A kind nature is no defense against sickness and death so what's the point of it? Gems like this have me hanging on every word. The cat and mouse game goes on a little too long and taxes suspension of disbelief but it's a funfilled journey all the way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wheelchair in opening and lingering credits. We see wheelchair as vehicle by which aged zillionaire is moved around. At end of movie Sean Connery's cowardly fleeing character is hit by wheelchair and he tumbles down many stairs until he hits his head on steps and dies. A fitting ending to a nasty villain. I was hoping the uncle was really alive playing a dastardly trick on nephew and widow. Great performances by all actors. I was even hoping the whodunit was done by Thomas andor his brother as they had been so humiliated by the old buzzard or even the yacht captain who had also been personally embarrassed. I felt that the way that old Richmond treated the servants was extremely racist and uncalledfor I hope that this movie could not have been made today with its decimatingly cruel treatment of persons who are not of the socalled white elite. The fitting ending however was that said wheelchair was sent rolling aimed? by one of the aforementioned servants I am not sure which one hitting Sean Connery as if it had been Oddjob's murderous hat from Goldfinger.I studied Italian in the last three years. I enjoyed listening to Gina Lollobrigida's accent and her speaking some Italian to people on the island. She had top billing in this movie. It was about HER. She looked stunning and ravishing. I was hoping that her character would tell old Richmond daily to go to hell and to stop being such a spoiled brat as her price for marrying him. At any rate she ended up taming him and he ended up softening up from being a previously very evil man.I enjoyed this movie. I realize Sean Connery wanted to play the villain this time and he did so very well even to the point of becoming sadistic and schizolunaticpsycho you get the picture.".

I felt that the way that old Richmond treated the servants was extremely racist and uncalledfor I hope that this movie could not have been made today with its decimatingly cruel treatment of persons who are not of the socalled white elite. The fitting ending however was that said wheelchair was sent rolling aimed? by one of the aforementioned servants I am not sure which one hitting Sean Connery as if it had been Oddjob's murderous hat from Goldfinger.I studied Italian in the last three years. I enjoyed listening to Gina Lollobrigida's accent and her speaking some Italian to people on the island. She had top billing in this movie. It was about HER. She looked stunning and ravishing. I was hoping that her character would tell old Richmond daily to go to hell and to stop being such a spoiled brat as her price for marrying him. At any rate she ended up taming him and he ended up softening up from being a previously very evil man.I enjoyed this movie. I realize Sean Connery wanted to play the villain this time and he did so very well even to the point of becoming sadistic and schizolunaticpsycho you get the picture.";

Tyrannical but ailing tycoon Ralph Richardson becomes very fond of his attractive nurse Gina Lollobrigida. Gina however falls in love with Ralph's nephew Sean Connery who plots ways to gain control of his uncle's fortune.My thoughts on this one? Although the pace of this movie is deadly slow...I really enjoyed this movie. The performances by the three leads are outstanding! Ralph Richardson somehow gets us to really really dislike him at the beginning of the movie....but by the end of the movie he might be the most likable character in the movie. Lollobrigida has many fine moments in the movie as well. Sean Connery's performance is the reason to check out this movie. It is a Connery that I have never seen in a movie before and is fascinating to watch. Add the performances to an interesting plot with some twists and turns and you have a movie that is recommended.Ranked 38th of 54 movies on my Sean Connery Movie Ranking Page. www.ultimatemovierankings.comseanconnerymovies".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on TV nearly 45 years ago in black and white. I remembered at the time that it had received a lot of negative criticism.However I saw it recently and loved it. Black and white was never the way to see it this is a stylish mystery that looks fabulous in colour. And the Beethoven soundtrack beat out Kubrick's use of the old Ludwig Van in A Clockwork Orange by 7 years.Sean Connery plays Anthony Richmond who schemes to get his hands on the fortune of his tyrannical wheelchairbound Uncle Charles. Ralph Richardson's Uncle Charles displays his meanness credentials early when he humiliates two of his black servants in a scene that would probably have patrons walking out of the theatre these days.Anthony persuades Maria Marcello an Italian nurse played by Gina Lollobrigida to ingratiate herself with Uncle Charles in order to get him to marry her. After the fragile old chap's inevitable demise she would inherit his fortune which she and Anthony would share. That's the plan but it all comes spectacularly unstuck especially after Maria becomes fond of Uncle Charles.There are revelations before it ends and plenty of tears.Although there are a few peripheral characters servants policemen and lawyers this is essentially a threehander between Sean Connery Ralph Richardson and 'La Lollo'.Gina Lollobrigida was an inspired choice for the film. The warm sensuous quality she exudes as Maria contrasts with the cold monumental architecture of the Richmond estate and the upper class formality of Anthony and Uncle Charles.Apparently 'La Lollo' was difficult and temperamental and didn't get on with the director Basil Dearden or with Sean Connery. Interesting then that years later in an interview she once described Cary Grant as all right but in my opinion no comparison to Sean Connery.Unfortunately Woman of Straw couldn't maintain the pace the ending is just a little too pat. However I feel the film is at least as good as Hitchcock's Marnie which was made around the same time also starring Sean Connery and considering the flaws in that film it may even be better.".

Well right church wrong pew when one notes how a tape later unnerved Sean.The Beethoven was invoked effectively and the shipboardstorm was realistically filmed the Majorca scenery was lush.Other reviewers have suggested this was too slow initially but it was both necessary to establish plot AND to contrast with the fastpaced events that subsequently transpired.More important however was the need to characterize Gina's having become enticed to collaborate with Sean for her reluctance was enticing to the viewer. SPECIFICALLY she projects the feeling that she will not do anything ultimately against which she would harbor ethical compunctions. As long as she can watch Ralph evolve towards being a loving individual which was a successful process she can increase her sense of involvement in the relationship. At no time does she wish him to die indeed she notes he is clinically stable which he was and had the capacity for some longevity which seemed to be an accurate observation.The racism component was indeed filmed at a time when it would BOTH be perceived as reprehensible AND contribute immeasurably to the plot it is noted that the Africanborn brothers are from a plantation which Ralph owns and thus are resigned simply to following his orders. Gina reacts viscerally to his misconduct unmasking her morals.Another reviewer raised the issue as to why Gina was entitled a Woman of Straw and thus it is necessary to proffer a viewpoint other than to draw from the original work adapted for the screen which has not been scrutinized. She is initially somewhat inert...just doing her job...as one might imagine to serve as the basis for a metaphor involving a dead blade of grass wafting in the wind. This is the state which renders her susceptible to Sean's scheming. But just as straw can survive under harsh conditions such as a false conviction for murder despite having done Sean's limited bidding she becomes a straw woman for the true protagonist Sean against the best interests of Ralph.The last few seconds of the ending are somewhat facile but one can imagine that the estate will become calmer following Gina's release. The irony of the story of course is that murder wasn't needed. They could simply have waitedout Ralph's lifespan and then Gina and Sean could have become linked officially in the interim Sean's needs were welltended by Ralph's household...but this would have not led to an engaging movie.Seen on TCM it was fun...particularly when one recognizes the way Sean had just begun to arrive via Bond. Robert Osborne stated at the end that Gina was granted the power to choose her costar for she had received topbilling and she hadn't yet seen Sean in any Bond movies. Dr. No had been released and From Russia with Love was in the pipeline. She was sold because He's a MAN! and was ultimately pleased.This was a middleofthenight pleasant discovery...and rewarding. I can't give it a 10 because it's not an epic and I can't give it a 9 because it's not worth repeatviewings. Hitchcock would have appreciated its subtleties.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woman of Straw was a change of pace for Sean Connery as his star was on the ascendency when this film was filmed in 1963 courtesy of James Bond.  Connery hasn't often played true villains during his career but he is about as evil as it gets in this film. He plays a ruthless and conniving nephew who wants to lay claim to his wealthy uncle's estate. Impeccably played by Ralph Richardson as the said uncle this character isn't exactly worthy of much sympathy either. He is a tyrant in the way he treats his staff and is a bigot in addition. Upon having a new nurse employed to look after the ailing uncle at his mansion Sean Connery persuades her to marry Richardson so as to gain control of his wealth. However things don't go according to plan and nothing is quite what it seems.......... In my opinion Connery should have been given top billing. His acting is convincing and I can believe that he is playing an evil character. His Italian leading lady is poor on the other hand. If she isn't being hysterical she is being totally wooden. The plot is pretty good but the running time is a bit long. I don't understand why the film moves to a foreign location at one stage it makes no sense and dilutes any kind of mystery. Luckily the action returns to England and builds to an effective climax.  The sets for the mansion in question are very good. The whole house has a cold and rather austere atmosphere to it and it works. A more obscure film in Sean Connery's career but a good one.".

Having been mistreated by him for years Connery claims that all he wants is a million pounds of the estate but the reluctant Lollobrigida becomes wary of the scheme having seen various bits of vulnerability in the outrageously cruel Richardson. A bizarre twist of fate leads Lollobrigida to go on trial for murder but there's hidden truth inside the Downton Abbey like mansion that Richardson owned and the lavishly yacht he sailed on.For the hour and fifteen minutes that Richardson is on screen this is his film completely. He's malicious beyond words making his black servants act like circus dogs and jump over each other strictly for amusement and delays the rescue of one of them when they fall off his yacht during a huge storm at sea. There's the most vile of insults towards everybody who works for him is related to him or does business with him. Then how does he get the sympathy? The character Richardson plays is unrelentingly demanding but the performance is absolutely commanding. Coming off of several Bond films Connery is elegant romantic but brutal towards Lollobrigida striking her viciously when he thinks she's not going through their plans. Part of the plot line is oh so predictable but there are moments when you are not sure that the script is going to go there. It reminds me of a modern set version of a 1955 Gothic thriller Footsteps in the Fog where Stewart Granger found himself blackmailed by servant girl Jean Simmons. Lollobrigida seems too good to be true but it's nice to see a female character in a scheme like this not being a deadly femme fatale. Beautiful art direction and location photography add to the film's strengths. Alexander Knox adds a brief commanding presence as the detective who uncovers everything.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woman Of Straw was one of the early attempts to break out of the James Bond character for Sean Connery. After his success in Dr. No and Thunderball he wanted to avoid typecasting make sure the movie going public saw him in a variety of roles. In Woman Of Straw he's got the Bondian charm but in this case it's one of the few out and out villains he ever played on screen.Connery is the wastrel nephew of Ralph Richardson and in the Citadel Film Series book on the films of Sean Connery Connery remarked he was most anxious to do this film because he admired Ralph Richardson above all other actors. Of course having Gina Lollobrigida as a leading lady I'm sure was an inducement as well. Gina is Richardson's nurse and while he's in a wheelchair not able to function in the romantic department she'd make a good trophy wife for Richardson who is a widower. With no children Connery is his closest heir and he starts moving in on Gina to make sure he's well taken care of.When Richardson dies that's when Connery reveals himself to be a true snake in the grass. It's a well done drama and Connery and Lollobrigida and Richardson got excellent notices. I would also kudos for Alexander Knox as the Scotland Yard detective. The public wouldn't buy him though.That was their loss and seen now it's a plus credit for Sean Connery.".

In Woman Of Straw he's got the Bondian charm but in this case it's one of the few out and out villains he ever played on screen.Connery is the wastrel nephew of Ralph Richardson and in the Citadel Film Series book on the films of Sean Connery Connery remarked he was most anxious to do this film because he admired Ralph Richardson above all other actors. Of course having Gina Lollobrigida as a leading lady I'm sure was an inducement as well. Gina is Richardson's nurse and while he's in a wheelchair not able to function in the romantic department she'd make a good trophy wife for Richardson who is a widower. With no children Connery is his closest heir and he starts moving in on Gina to make sure he's well taken care of.When Richardson dies that's when Connery reveals himself to be a true snake in the grass. It's a well done drama and Connery and Lollobrigida and Richardson got excellent notices. I would also kudos for Alexander Knox as the Scotland Yard detective. The public wouldn't buy him though.That was their loss and seen now it's a plus credit for Sean Connery.";

It takes a whole hour to set up the character relationships in a story that could have been told more effectively in a brisk hourandahalf.That aside the film is meticulously photographed on grand location sites in Majorca Connery is smoothly sophisticated in a role that shows why he made the perfect James Bond and it does have a satisfying comeuppance for the villain of the piece. RALPH RICHARSON is so relentlessly cruel that he seems to be enjoying his villainous behavior in the style of Claude Rains at his nastiest.The sad thing is the film never reaches its true potential as a taut tale of suspense.

	schema:reviewBody "The South Korean film Shiri marks the very first time I've seen a South Korean film and was the last one which I saw Song Kangho play a role of an intelligence agent and a supporting one at that. Fast forward till today he is already an established actor who has taken on various roles in different genres some times heroic other times confused some buffoony even. But one thing's for sure is the actor's charisma which defies any typecasting.Here he plays Agent Lee Hankyu of the National Intelligence Service a bumbling one who's stagnated in his career which has them on the constant move and pitting their skills against the more cunning North Korean counterparts who have infiltrated the South in order to carry out assassination orders by the North Korean leader on the many defectors from the communist state. Opening the film is a tense action sequence complete with high speed pursuits and spy versus spy stuff with a group of sleeper cell assassins being activated through coded websites to take out Kim JungIl's second cousin whose book published in the South is deemed as blasphemous.Kang Dongwon plays Jiwon a relatively new North Korean spy member who goes on that fateful mission under the watchful eyes of veteran assassin nicknamed Shadow Jeon Gookhwan and because of his softhearted nature he gets branded a traitor of the state for not willing to deliver killing blows to the enemies and hence becomes a wanted man in his own country. And the mission proves to be a turning point for Agent Lee as well with him being made the scapegoat of the botched operation and having to leave the agency in disgrace.This pivotal event brings us forward 6 years later where Lee is now a private investigator who specializes in finding runaway foreign brides and the other being a foreman in a construction site. Soon the two onceadversaries meet and strangely enough the film then converts into a light comedy since the both decide to lead a symbiotic relationship together each wanting to be able to dish out some dirt on the other so that they can redeem themselves and go back to the life they once knew. For Lee it's the prospect of wanting to smash the sleeper cell that Jiwon belongs to in order to claim substantial reward money and Jiwon to become the mole for the North Koreans since he's living in Lee's house and working as his PI agency employee and to utilize Lee's experience to find his comradeinarms who disappeared since the botched mission but little does both man know they no longer have active ties to their past.Much of the mirth comers from each trying to second guess the other and both actors put on fine performances as adversaries who will eventually find that inevitable path to friendship and trust. While Song Kangho is effervescent in his role of Lee in being bumbling but without being stupid Kang Dongwon holds his own against his rival as the man whose good looks betrays the deadly skills he possesses in dispatching opponents and fleshes out the more emotional of the two characters with aplomb. Their shared chemistry is what makes it believable that they have the potential to buddy up although of course writerdirector Jang Hun has other plans in order to spice up the plot in the final act to leave you guessing just who will be pushed over the edge based on their friendship keeping in mind both potentially face treason for putting up the other silently.All in The Secret Reunion contains solid action sequences with themes on uneasy friendship and brotherhood boosted by fine performances from the cast. The narrative may feel a little bit of sag in the middle act though but ultimately it gets the job done and its themes through.".

It's gritty and bloody and because it seems to follow Song wherever he goes it's sprinkled with bits of humor throughout.So what went wrong? Nothing really until the deus ex machina at the end. It's probably never been more true than it is with Secret Reunion that a bad ending can ruin a film for some people. It seems to have bothered critics more than audiences as Secret Reunion is South Korea's highest grossing film of the year so far. But it also seems to have disappointed one of its actors. As Song put it in an interview If I were the director I would have chosen an ending for Secret Reunion in which the pain lasts longer. In other words no living happily ever after. South Korea has a tradition of ending films a little differently than most Hollywood films. People usually die instead of flying off into the sunset. I say it's no big deal and there is a lot f fun to be had with Secret Reunion. Just close your eyes stop the DVD Player or walk out a few minutes early f you don't want any cheese in your omelet.".

The great Song Kangho plays the lead here the head of an intelligence agency who finds himself up against a top North Korean assassin in the film's breathless and gruesomely violent opening 20 minutes. After this point the film slows down to become an engrossing character study with Gang Dongwon effective as the agent who finds his loyalties tested by his own humanity. The film has touches of BOURNEstyle action which the Koreans do so well and the plot twists keep on coming building to a satisfying climax.

One could even get away with calling this spythrillerbuddy with a dash of comedy formulaic. Maybe it is. I might just be fooled by the foreign language but Secret Reunion Is not just familiar but fresh. The film hinges on the relationship between two opposing intelligence agents. Both have been abandoned by country and separated from family. Kangho Song plays the damaged bumbling South Korean field agent. I enjoyed his performance more than anything in this film. I cannot logically justify this but this is the third film were he felt like a Korean Humphrey Boggart. Yes this is crazy but how could I better articulate this man's natural charisma? Dongwon Kang has a tougher roll as the desperate emotional despondent North Korean operative. His character was just written uninteresting but he holds his own while interacting Song. Perhaps a weakness of the film is that I enjoy it when these two simply coexisting more than when they are chasing each other. I guess something has to justify the action sequences. Nothing surprising here except possibly the institution of foreign brides to western audiences. A sociologist might find its portrayal interesting I just enjoyed how it forced Song to reach for moral justifications. Otherwise the story is cookie cutter and wraps up so unrealistically clean you would think Reunion briefly teleported to Hollywood. But hey Casablanca was made by recipe so I can give this movie half a pass. It is hard to completely recommend a benign spy film. I think those who have previously other Korean smash hits will dig Secret Reunion. Song's performance provides just enough to outshine the truly mediocre. Just please don't ignore this endorsement because of the insane Boggart comparison.".

This particular film didn't have much of the fastmoving action typical of Asian movies dealing with this kind of material which didn't bother me at all since the plot had a lot of depth and twists to maintain interest however there was not much of the wit and humor I have also come to expect from Korean movies which was a big disappointment for me and the primary reason I'm dropping it's rating a little bit. It was very interesting to see a film dealing with the NorthSouth Korean split from the point of view of Koreans and not our straightforward American perspective although North Korea still hardly comes off well. I guess there's only so much you can do with pure evil. The situations and emotions just feel so much more morally complex and real than those found in pretty much any American movie nowadays.

The Isle not only shows some of the most disturbing images on film but it also makes the viewer work hard to try and figure out what it all means. Especially the very last scene which I think was put there for each viewer to make they're own interpretation as Kubrick did for the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Suh Jung plays HeeJin who rents out floating fish cabins and supplies bait food and prostitutes. She also is a prostitute and she never utters a single word in the film. Some have called her character a mute but towards the end of the film she screams so I am thinking her silence might be of her own doing! She is attracted to one of the renters who is suicidal and is hiding out. Suh Jungs performance is very strong and its difficult to carry a film without speaking a word and the actor has to rely to a great length on how well and interesting the story is. Her performance reminds me of Isabelle Huppert in The Piano Teacher. The amount of pain between the two characters is what they have in common. This is a film about relationships in a very strange setting with two strange people. Each character has a scene involving fish hooks and when they take place its up to the other character to try and ease the pain. Good cinematography with shots of the lake at dawn or sunset with mist and fog on the water. Very tough film to view with all the self mutilation and animal cruelty. For those of you who have viewed Asian films before then you should check out this very well made film.".

	schema:headline " Fishermen's worst beautiful nightmare  and everyone else's too";
	schema:reviewBody "Seom aka The Isle is written and directed by Korean film maker Kiduk Kim. This bizarre film tells about happenings in strange fishing resort in which fishermen live and fish in floating cabins at daytime and have fun and sex with local prostitutes at night time. The film's protagonist is an attractive but very mysterious female Suh Jung who never talks and works as some kind of boat girl who gets the food and prostitutes for the fishermen and other similar activities with her little boat. There is minimal amount of dialogue in The Isle and it is hard to describe this ultra bizarre film after just one viewing.The visuals are very astonishing and stunning as the settings are so atmospheric and natural. The calm mist and smoke above the water is very moody and even surreal and this all is intensified even further by great use of camera occasionally very weird angles and total feel of peace and magic. Blue is the main color in the film and it is equally brilliantlooking as in many Hong Kong thrillers like Dr. Lamb by Danny Lee and Red to Kill by Billy Tang. The colors are always fantastic in Asian films and The Isle once again proves and shows this. This film is a delight to the eye..at least before the infamous scenes involving fishing hooks.The director has said that he wanted to depict relationships between men and women with this film and that the film tells something about how dependent were are on each other and especially on another sex. Once the first horrific hook scene comes the only cure for his pain is the main female who by giving him carnal pleasure takes away or diminishes his pain  and vice versa later in the film. I think that this film is more feminist since the very surreal closing scene is so underlining as the man finally finds the truth and source of all life. Another reviewer thought that the end scene is gratuitous and only there to confuse things even further and that may be the case but still I want to interpret it as above and it is very personal scene in depicting that eternal truth. Seeing is believing...I think there's lot more than just this in the core of The Isle. The film really tells something about the relationship between humans and nature and nature's sources. There are many scenes depicting man exploiting nature and its inhabitants and I think that the forthcoming scenes of mutilation are also symbolic as things turn upside down humans become the victims of what they have practised and see the results. At this point it is necessary to stress that there are many scenes of actual killing and off putting abuse of animals mainly fish which I also think are gratuitous since the message of the film is pretty hard to take since the film does the same exploitations it depicts committed by its characters. Then again the killings show the real face of our world since in order to stay alive we have to use nature's resources and there's nothing wrong in that. So what's wrong in my opinion is that the animals in The Isle are not killed without pain and suffering and that is not right nor human since I think that no living creature should die painfully or tortured. I wanted to think that the animals were not mutilated and killed in the film for real but it all looks sadly too real. Still I have to find the film's merits even though it becomes far more difficult when I remember these animal snuff scenes that are unnecessarily explicit albeit meant to be symbolic which they of course are if one can still accept this after the horrific imagery.This film reminded me pretty much of Japanese film Naked Blood which also is very beautiful and surreal film but soon the horrific scenes of self mutilation and ultra splatter are on screen before the viewer's eyes. The self mutilations committed by fish hooks in The Isle are very gruelling to say the least so this film will make the weakest viewers faint as many festival screenings have proven. They are so sickeningly effective I wanted to stop thinking about what it would feel like to actually do something like that. Fish hooks are very small but like Stuart Gordon has said about the finger biting moment in ReAnimator the smallest things may be the most horrific in many cases. These fish hooks really are symbolic as the humans are turned to fishes and get to see what they've done and created.The Isle is very weird bizarre calm and also disturbing piece of cinema and only minority of cinema lovers will stomach and appreciate films like The Isle. As I stressed earlier I am sorry about the fact of animal mutilation presented in the film and without those scenes I would probably give more stars in the rating. Now it gets little less even if I wanted to give it more as a piece of art. 810 and to understand more about this film it has to be seen many times since it unfolds pretty slowly.".

Another reviewer thought that the end scene is gratuitous and only there to confuse things even further and that may be the case but still I want to interpret it as above and it is very personal scene in depicting that eternal truth. Seeing is believing...I think there's lot more than just this in the core of The Isle. The film really tells something about the relationship between humans and nature and nature's sources. There are many scenes depicting man exploiting nature and its inhabitants and I think that the forthcoming scenes of mutilation are also symbolic as things turn upside down humans become the victims of what they have practised and see the results. At this point it is necessary to stress that there are many scenes of actual killing and off putting abuse of animals mainly fish which I also think are gratuitous since the message of the film is pretty hard to take since the film does the same exploitations it depicts committed by its characters. Then again the killings show the real face of our world since in order to stay alive we have to use nature's resources and there's nothing wrong in that. So what's wrong in my opinion is that the animals in The Isle are not killed without pain and suffering and that is not right nor human since I think that no living creature should die painfully or tortured. I wanted to think that the animals were not mutilated and killed in the film for real but it all looks sadly too real. Still I have to find the film's merits even though it becomes far more difficult when I remember these animal snuff scenes that are unnecessarily explicit albeit meant to be symbolic which they of course are if one can still accept this after the horrific imagery.This film reminded me pretty much of Japanese film Naked Blood which also is very beautiful and surreal film but soon the horrific scenes of self mutilation and ultra splatter are on screen before the viewer's eyes. The self mutilations committed by fish hooks in The Isle are very gruelling to say the least so this film will make the weakest viewers faint as many festival screenings have proven. They are so sickeningly effective I wanted to stop thinking about what it would feel like to actually do something like that. Fish hooks are very small but like Stuart Gordon has said about the finger biting moment in ReAnimator the smallest things may be the most horrific in many cases. These fish hooks really are symbolic as the humans are turned to fishes and get to see what they've done and created.The Isle is very weird bizarre calm and also disturbing piece of cinema and only minority of cinema lovers will stomach and appreciate films like The Isle. As I stressed earlier I am sorry about the fact of animal mutilation presented in the film and without those scenes I would probably give more stars in the rating. Now it gets little less even if I wanted to give it more as a piece of art. 810 and to understand more about this film it has to be seen many times since it unfolds pretty slowly.";

	schema:reviewBody "Another movie that has attained a little notoriety from the number of walkouts at festival screenings and even a couple of audience members passing out. Whilst it is not hard to see why it is a shame that is what the film is known for as there is much more to it than those scenes. A mute girl makes a living running a kind of retreat where men can rent a floating cabin on a lake in the mountains and spend their days fishing and their nights sleeping with prostitutes. The mute girl makes ends meet by taking on this role as well. A young man arrives and rents a cabin clearly not their for the fish. We see that he is tortured and suicidal  you wouldn't guess why from the 5 second flashback that is meant to explain it but the 'filmography' section of the DVD explains it in more detail. The mute girl is drawn to the man's desperation perhaps feeling sympathyprotectiveness or perhaps simply relating to another deeply unhappy soul. The relationship between these two characters and several other characters that come to the lake for one reason or another is the main focus of the film. The difficulty some people have with relationships is the topic being studied particularly when they are not happy in their relationship with themselves. The inner feelings of the characters receive expression in scenes whose 'shock factor' has drawn inevitable comparisons with Takashi Miike especially AUDITION. Director Kim Ki Duk doesn't seem to mind these comparisons KK I saw Audition at Toronto and that movie made me realize that there is someone else out there like me. We are two of a kind If you couldn't sit through the last half hour of AUDITION you'll probably want to give THE ISLE a miss too. It's also definitely not a film for animal lovers... there is absolutely zero chance of the film being released intact in the UK or the US as the treatment of the animals in the film mainly fish is far outside what is permissible in either country's regulations.But there is much more to THE ISLE than the scenes that make keeping your eyes on screen a challenge. In between the film is absolutely ravishing and will keep your eyes glued there. The setting of the lake mostly bathed in deep fog and the fantastic wordless performance from actress Jung Suh and the rest of the cast are beautiful and powerful. The loneliness and sadness of the characters is reflected brilliantly in the total isolation of the floating cabins. There is a deep message in the film and it is presented to us beautifully. Like Miike Kim KiDuk makes us work for our reward when we watch THE ISLE... if you want to take away the beauty of his film you have to be willing to pay the price of the horror. Thoroughly recommended!One note the film is another one of those great films that just doesn't know how to end itself. Actually we get the perfect ending... a nice long shot and a fade to white and it should have been over butapparently Kim Ki Duk wasn't quite satisfied to leave it at that and tacks on two extra scenes about a minute of footage that are simply inexplicable and serve only to confuse and spoil the mood. My recommendation... when it fades to white simply stop the DVD".

It's set on this remote mountain lake with only a few floating fishinghuts plus a shack for HeeJin the caretaker of this primitive resort. This young lady the only permanent resident is mute she can make noises so her muteness is probably caused by some psychological trauma cf. The Painted Bird something suggested by her personality. Although she appears to be a menial she has the leaky boat which is the only access to and from the cabins also she turns out to have unsuspected powers of underwater diving. Combined with her great beauty and fierce intensity this gives her the aspect of a naturespirit.The visiting fishermen who rent these little holiday huts are coarse brutes who treat her like a slave early on they buy her services in bed then throw the money into the water so she has to dive for it and then dry it out. Needless to say strange and unpleasant things soon happen to these visitors due to some mysterious underwater force.Enter another visitor a decent and sensitive guy who amuses himself making wire sculptures when not fishing. Through seeing his nightmares we know he is a fugitive on the run after killing his unfaithful girlfriend and her companion in a fit of jealousy. HeeJin is almost beside herself with loneliness and frustration however remote she may first appear and she soon takes a fancy to the newcomer. He tormented by memories is about to shoot himself when a spike appears out of the lake and stabs him in the thigh causing him to drop the gun. Later on he attempts to forestall police capture by committing suicide with fishhooks in the most gruesome way possible she hides him then carefully removes the hooks from his throat then gives him artificial respiration then makes love to him. He later repays her for her kindness by hitting her  he's terrified by the thought of a new relationship  but they go on to develop a deep attachment.There is so little dialogue that this is almost like a silent movie and that is what gives it its immense power. Suh Jung HeeJin displays the most astonishing acting ability in an extremely difficult role. It's necessary to her character that she not speak or smile so she has to use great skill to communicate her feelings in other ways. As remote as she is one's heart immediately goes out to her and her austere demeanour makes a pleasant contrast to the airheaded callgirls who sometimes get summoned to the lake by fishermen. The silence is punctuated by the sound of waves and oars and occasionally by creepy electronic music making the atmosphere reminiscent of Aguirre the Wrath of God. Suh Jung is obviously someone to watch for in future.The Isle reminds me of The Blue Light 1932 in which the power of nature is symbolized by an outcast woman unable to communicate but who masters the rocky precipices that send experienced mountaineers to their doom. Leni Riefenstahl is as enigmatic as Suh Jung so I recommend it to people who understand The Isle.One flaw is the epilogue  two metaphorical scenes not part of the narrative which confuse the viewer. Although the scenes aren't bad they should have been incorporated within the narrative e.g. by being shown on a TV being watched by fishermen.I dare say that this will be remembered as one of the great movies of the 21st century and this from Korea  a country not previously known for cinematography. Director Kiduk Kim is obviously a talent to be reckoned with.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm fast becoming a fan of Korean director Kim Kiduk this is the second film of his I've watched after SPRING SUMMER AUTUMN WINTER...AND SPRING. The two films have much in common in terms of style and setting but THE ISLE is something else entirely. While SPRING was a heartwarming story that championed the Buddhist lifestyle THE ISLE is an extraordinarily dark tale of obsession and broken psychology.One again Kim Kiduk has crafted an expertly visual film THE ISLE looks fantastic and the setting of those floating holiday lettings is an exceptional one. The characters are painted in broad strokes but this makes them thoroughly interesting and it goes without saying that the subdued acting is fantastic. This is a slow burner of a film yes but a thoroughly satisfying one all the same in which the atmosphere is interspersed with some eyepopping setpieces if this doesn't put you off fishing then I don't know what will.Although the infliction of pain is upsetting in the extreme there are always good reasons for what occurs here making this as far from torture porn as you'll get. The only issue I have with it really is the reallife animal cruelty something I'm dead set against but the UK DVD thankfully excises much of this material. In any case I can't wait to check out more from the director.".

The two films have much in common in terms of style and setting but THE ISLE is something else entirely. While SPRING was a heartwarming story that championed the Buddhist lifestyle THE ISLE is an extraordinarily dark tale of obsession and broken psychology.One again Kim Kiduk has crafted an expertly visual film THE ISLE looks fantastic and the setting of those floating holiday lettings is an exceptional one. The characters are painted in broad strokes but this makes them thoroughly interesting and it goes without saying that the subdued acting is fantastic.

And now after 3iron Samaria Address Unknown and finally The Isle I can safely say that the man is a genius.The Isle is essentially a story about two people. People that eventually fall in love and people that are both semi disturbed. The male protagonist is clearly hunted by the police and the female the caretaker of 'islands' is pretending that is mute when many scenes in the movie indicate that she really is not. Now what makes The Isle special. It's the gritting harsh undertones that mellow down to nice loving drama. The contrast between extreme torture and love and empathy is just too great. Anyone that watched Kiduk's movies before knows that all share a common theme. Motto 'If you do something it will come back after you' is ever present in his movies. You cannot run away from any act you do. As in most of his movies dialogs play a REALLY small part in this one. The whole movie contains maybe 40 sentences all in all. And the female protagonist never speaks.Now all the warnings about extreme torture and 'it's too much for all to handle' are all just. The Isle sometimes just SCREAMS as a piece itself. You feel the pain the sadness the longing in each and every character and sometimes the punishment they receive is just too much. But. The Isle is a movie that will not leave you untouched.The Isle is a jewel of modern Asian cinema for me almost the best. Maybe just a tad behind Kikujiro and The Dolls of Kitano and before many others.".

I may not be exposed to enough new and original creations since Panama is not the best city to go to the cinema monopolized by American mainstream productions. Through a fan of Asian cinema I have lately watched a few films from Japan China and South Korea that have really impressed me. On top of the list I place South Korean Kiduk Kim's beautiful tale Seom a metaphor of an erotic obsession and gender submission which in a way reminded me of Nagisa Oshima's A no corrida. But while Oshima opted for a naturalistic representation of sex to narrate a true story Kim's parable is frequently approached from a distance with his characters' physicality and motivations subtly emerging from their actions and their placing in the beautiful fishing resort where all the story takes place. When Kim does get closer... well you better be on guard although the sadistic elements of the story make it more fascinating. The Isle's last images are among the most striking and unexpected I've seen in decades. Highly recommended.".

What kind of ''human'' would torture them like that for no reason or just for money? I tell you that director is either mentally retarded or he's just a monster with a ''heart'' of stone. Or both. He truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive.It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the water...This movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called ''Cannibal Holocaust'' or something like that. I'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of TRULY great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged.Fortunately only a few people liked this  which is natural since it's the worst film ever  so it wasn't successful. I hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films.

The same Kim Ki Duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of The Coast Guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in Samaritan Girl? I just cannot seem to find him in this film.Oh sure Kim's nature motif is still present. The film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters. Yes it's Kim Ki Duk all right. Kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the DVD's special features. But I'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation.What is beautiful about angry pottymouthed prostitutes lustful violent and pottymouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of selfmutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality? These are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film. If it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material. It has been favorably compared to Audition by Japanese director Takashi Miike much to Kim's satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk I find little reason to recommend this film. I have not seen Audition but I doubt it would alter in any way my view of The Isle. Its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic. Its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic. Characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot. Its point is either nonexistent or I will admit lost amidst Korean cultural quirks that I fail to understand.The only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic Kim fogshrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color. At times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big Kim Ki Duk romper room. Some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by Jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing. But as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities. One hopes that Kim will leave this kind of filmmaking in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more.".

Some lake has these little floating huts that people inexplicably live in and fish on. A mute girl who sells bait arranges hookers to visit these weird floating fisherman when she can't be bothered spreading her own legs. Every night she swims around in the darkness and sometimes spies on them through the toilet. What? One guy in particular really fancies her. But he's on the lam from the law because of some crime that is hinted at in a dream but never defined. One day the cops turn up and ask questions so he decides now is the best time to swallow a bunch of fishing hooks. What? The mute girl kills a hooker. She chucks her body and scooter out into the middle of the lake. The cops turn up and start asking questions so she attaches fishing hooks to her vagina with the rod in a boat that is sailing away. Obviously when the line tightens somethings gonna give...I am assuming this film is mostly metaphor. But it's a pretentious bore of a metaphor that is painful to sit through. And what's the deal with showing so many people crimping a length off? Do I need to see that? Don't waste your time with this film.".

Every night she swims around in the darkness and sometimes spies on them through the toilet. What? One guy in particular really fancies her. But he's on the lam from the law because of some crime that is hinted at in a dream but never defined. One day the cops turn up and ask questions so he decides now is the best time to swallow a bunch of fishing hooks. What? The mute girl kills a hooker. She chucks her body and scooter out into the middle of the lake. The cops turn up and start asking questions so she attaches fishing hooks to her vagina with the rod in a boat that is sailing away. Obviously when the line tightens somethings gonna give...I am assuming this film is mostly metaphor. But it's a pretentious bore of a metaphor that is painful to sit through. And what's the deal with showing so many people crimping a length off? Do I need to see that? Don't waste your time with this film.";

A good example for the latter is Pasolini's Sal o le 120 giornate di Sodoma one of the most disturbing and violent films ever made. But it all makes sense in this case since Pasolini created an intellectual statement against fascism etc. that intentionally generates here and there a certain impact on the viewer. The sometimes extreme and almost unwatchable sequences suit the equally extreme subject and are therefore justified It's all completely different with Seom which fails in adding any intellectual value to the gross images. The movie is either tedious or disgusting with some rare sequences of good acting and a generally welldone photography. The story A young woman lives nearby a lake and manages some raftlike constructions with little cabins on them mainly used by anglers. She provides food and other stuff and offers love services from time to time. Suddenly the male lead arrives fatally attracts her and things go their way fishhooks within people and plenty scenes of real animals being tortured or killed included.The movie is completely imagedriven and tries to come across as artyfarty and philosophical but it didn't work for me.

I've been disappointed so many times at so many socalled 'exceptional' films that I barely got my rearend to the screening. After an excruciating wait of a few minutes through an idiotic trailer I was riveted to the screen blew me away from first shot to the last! This isn't a mere 'horror' film it's an almost mythical psychological investigation into the dark side of things and 'amorality' which is what is ignored or repressed in everyday life and quite frankly needs to be dealt with in an 'elegant' if fashion.  That's the essence of most things artistically valuable that 'elegant' implied indirect way of showing people how to 'sin correctly' how to deal with the 'amoral' without being engulfed by it. That's what The Isle achieves and that's extremely rare!First of all the location that the film was shot in is simultaneously mysterious beautiful and absurd. A beautiful misty lake with little brightly colored boathouses on it barely big enough to sleep in where people go to fish. The cinematography is flawless the entire film full of beautiful shots that never seem forced or done just to show off. The music is never intrusive and when used never forces an interpretation on the viewer. The beautiful lead actress Suh Jung playing the mute girl who lives at the resort and occasionally prostitutes herself for money is beyond charismatic a 'natural feminist' caught in 'man's world' situations beyond her control a tough hardened wild child yet thoroughly feminine.  She falls in love with a crazy suicidal mysterious guy in one of the boat houses who seems to have a heart of gold. Many crazy and some very graphic and disgusting scenes later a few of them involving drowning people on fishhooks quite absurd though strangely enough the cumulative force of the images is such that it matters very little I was flabbergasted to learn that the film was shorter than 90 minutes! It seemed I had spent an eternity knowing this locale and hanging out with the characters! All I can say is I think this film is a masterpiece and I'm giving it The HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! KiDuk Kim is a director to watch and to judge by this film Edward Yang and Wong KarWai don't a have thing on him in fact what he's done here in the 'horror' genre is arguably a rarer feat. See The Isle the first chance you get it is THE Korean film to see you will be truly shocked touched on a deep level and intellectually stimulated at the same time.".

Headed by Sidney Fox in one of her final screen roles and last for Universal she plays Stella the daughter of Edward Weldon a jury foreman O.P. Heggie the actor most famous today for his role as the blind hermit in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN 1935 at a trial where a woman Ethel Saxon Helen Flint is accused of murdering a man who betrayed her. Because Weldon is solely responsible for the verdict that convicts Saxon to be later executed at midnight in the electric chair his personal life changes dramatically. Weldon is not only hounded by reporters after the trial particularly one named Nolan Henry Hull the future WEREWOLF OF London also in 1935 who manages to be a guest at his home on the night of Saxon's execution but he must stand firm with his decision regardless. Stella who had become acquainted with a man at the trial named Garboni Humphrey Bogart becomes interested in him unaware that he is a gangster but learns about him later on in the story when she notices that he carries a gun. When Garboni finds himself having to be forced to leave town Stella wants to go away with him but he refuses to let her do so but agrees on meeting her one last time before he goes. On the very night of Ethel Saxon's execution Stella and Garboni have a farewell meeting in his car. As the switch is being pulled on Saxon a gun shoots off on Garboni. Returning home to her father with the gun in her hand Stella admits to shooting Garboni which puts the old man into a real predicament as to what to do. Should he stand by his own merits and have his own daughter arrested for the crime or find a way to violate the law and shield her?Although the story premise is very interesting especially the subject about a man who feels a murderer must pay the price only to have his own daughter commit the same kind of crime of passion MIDNIGHT fails to deliver mainly because of stiff stagy production with not so convincing dialog. Under capable hands of a more suitable director for instance William Wyler for example MIDNIGHT might have worked as a tense and moving drama. Sidney Fox who usually gives a satisfactory performance seems to be the weakest link here talking somewhat shaky at times for no reason. She's not very convincing especially during her emotional scenes. Occasionally the camera shots moving at different angles keeps the pace moving but not enough to hold one's interest at 73 minutes.Other capable members of the cast include Margaret Wycherly as Mrs. Weldon future director Richard Wholf as Stella's brother Arthur Lynne Overman and Katherine Wilson as Joe and Ada Biggers tenants of the Weldon household Granville Bates Cora Witherspoon Henry O'Neill and Moffatt Johnston as a district attorney who is called to the Weldon home to solve the mystery to Garboni's murder.To capitalize on the success of future film star Humphrey Bogart MIDNIGHT was later reissued in 1946 as CALL IT MURDER with Bogey being given star billing the very print available to video cassette and DVD. It's the former Blackhawk Video Company of Davenport Iowa that distributed the movie on videotape with it's original Midnight title opening credits headed by SIdney Fox O.P. Heggie and Henry Hill with Bogart's name listed eighth in the cast as initially presented in theaters in 1934.MIDNIGHT will never be listed in Hollywood's Top Ten Best list but it's worth viewing for being an early screen appearance of future superstar Humphrey Bogart or a rediscovery of Sidney Fox whose movie career mostly at Universal lasted only three years. Fox and Bogart had worked together earlier in THE BAD SISTER 1931 which not only became Fox's movie debut but the future twotime Academy Award winning actress Bette Davis. ".

He is adequate in a small part but the film is a slowmoving filming of a 1930 play that is interesting enough as a moral melodrama but also mercifully short. The interest lies in the sequences in the courtroom and death chamber which eschew the stagebound grouping and ponderous delivery of the body of the film and uses the camera in an imaginative and cinematic way.

Heggie on screen which had condemned a woman for the murder of a man who was leaving her  only to find two acts later his daughter Fox in a similar situation.Director Chester Erskine at the start of a career which would see well remembered work on such A releases as THE EGG AND I ALL MY SONS and ANDROCLES AND THE LION working as director writer and producer for another 40 years while unable to produce the figurative silk purse out of a possible sow's ear of a melodrama opened up the play originally set only in the Weldon living room with excellent  and given the period surprisingly sophisticated  crosscutting between the condemned woman the daughter's developing affair and the moral quandary around the Weldon himself.If the 30's structure of the argument may strike many as dated today and the deus ex machina solution to one of Weldon's problems too pat to be genuinely satisfying they probably are  but the elder Weldon's overly strict unbending interpretation of his moral and civic obligations is hardly unknown today as an excuse for lack of thought or bigotry. A remake with more modern technique might indeed be well received but the implicit melodrama would be just as blatant.While Humphrey Bogart's role is a relatively small one although it is woven through most of the film it makes for legitimately fascinating viewing as a transitional role for the handsome actor who had been playing stage juveniles. He had had 15 Broadway roles in the 12 years  and 9 films in the three years  before making this film but would only have two more Broadway credits afterward but 66 films. His Gar Boni in MIDNIGHT is very well done in a more modern style than many around him see the similar effect the young Helen Hayes achieved with the same then fresh realistic style in 1932's FAREWELL TO ARMS before finding the world weary persona that won careermaking acclaim for his Duke Mantee opposite Leslie Howard on Broadway and screen just two years later.It may be of some interest that on stage the supporting role of Arthur Weldon played in the film by future director Richard Whorf was created by actorplaywright Clifford Odets. Finding a good print of MIDNIGHT or even CALL IT MURDER may not be easy but the search may be worth it. Don't expect a polished modern film and shallow film buffs who don't appreciate history or context will probably hate it but true film connoisseurs shouldn't miss this one for what IS there.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was somewhat comical to see the full screen opening credit given Humphrey Bogart in this rerelease version from Guaranteed Pictures. One of the mainstays of the public domain bargain bin Call It Murder provides an early look at the future star in a limited role which in retrospect could have been played by virtually anyone.Bogey's character is a minor hood named Gar Boni caught in a predicament that requires him to leave town after getting involved with the daughter of a jury foreman. We don't find out much about his circumstances but they must be grim an accomplice responds to Gar's penchant for baseball by asking  Hey kid they got any bulletproof grandstands out there? Throughout the trial Stella Weldon Sidney Fox finds herself at odds with her father's role he was able to steer the jury to find Ethel Saxon Helen Flint guilty of murder by virtue of premeditation. The entire film is used to explore Weldon's O.P. Heggie resolve with the verdict in the face of public disapproval and mounting controversy over Saxon's execution. It provides the set up for his own daughter's circumstances when she pulls the trigger on Gar a case of the jilted lover lashing out. Did she have time to think about what she would do or was it an instinctive crime of passion?Overall the film could have used better pacing there were moments that seemed to drag incessantly. I was intrigued though by an interesting use of camera angles in a scene where Gar's departure from Stella is reflected in a mirror at the bottom of the staircase in the Weldon home. The picture might also have gotten more mileage out of the device of cutting between scenes of Weldon's conscience bound pacing with that of the doomed Saxon in her prison cell. The idea was a good one but was buried too quickly to make the point it could have.In it's way the movie is a viable precursor to the noir films of the following decade it's dark and brooding with the female lead encountering desperation as her payoff whether or not D.A. Plunkett Moffat Johnston succeeds in digging her out of a mess. Her father meanwhile is left to wrestle his own conscience over the quandary of whether justice for one ought to be the basis of justice for all. An interesting moral dilemma as well as a legal one the story works to confound us all if faced with the same situation.".

The entire film is used to explore Weldon's O.P. Heggie resolve with the verdict in the face of public disapproval and mounting controversy over Saxon's execution. It provides the set up for his own daughter's circumstances when she pulls the trigger on Gar a case of the jilted lover lashing out. Did she have time to think about what she would do or was it an instinctive crime of passion?Overall the film could have used better pacing there were moments that seemed to drag incessantly. I was intrigued though by an interesting use of camera angles in a scene where Gar's departure from Stella is reflected in a mirror at the bottom of the staircase in the Weldon home. The picture might also have gotten more mileage out of the device of cutting between scenes of Weldon's conscience bound pacing with that of the doomed Saxon in her prison cell. The idea was a good one but was buried too quickly to make the point it could have.In it's way the movie is a viable precursor to the noir films of the following decade it's dark and brooding with the female lead encountering desperation as her payoff whether or not D.A. Plunkett Moffat Johnston succeeds in digging her out of a mess. Her father meanwhile is left to wrestle his own conscience over the quandary of whether justice for one ought to be the basis of justice for all. An interesting moral dilemma as well as a legal one the story works to confound us all if faced with the same situation.";

This movie makes a very strong statement about capital punishment. Equally as strong is its statement on who you know if you want to beat a rap. The whole movie takes place during a few hours before the scheduled execution of a woman who killed her lover who was going to leave her. Except for the beginning court scenes and prison scenes and a couple of scenes where Bogart is in a room somewhere and when he and Sidney Fox are in his car the movie takes place at the home of the jury foreman who found the woman guilty. A news reporter gets into the house with a radio and a surprise at the end so that the public can witness what it's like for that foreman as the scheduled execution time approaches. What you may think is a surprise ending really isn't the end at all. Keep watching for the twist involving the district attorney who has his eye on the governorship.  This film like Bogart and Huston's Beat The Devil is in the public domain.".

Originally he was listed as 8th in the cast as he really doesn't have that much to do. It's of interest because of his presence  he plays a criminal but he's a young leading man here  but otherwise there isn't much to recommend it.Why this is in a film noir set is beyond me. It's a melodrama based on a play that moves like an iceberg. The acting is stilted as is the dialogue. The plot centers around a jury foreman O.P. Heggie whose jury has sent a young woman to the electric chair and she is due to die that evening. People are begging him to stop the execution. This is my first problem. What can he do other than say there was a miscount? Anyway he stands by his decision. When his own daughter Sidney Fox lands in the same predicament claiming she killed her lover Gar Boni Bogart one wonders how resolute he will be then. Pretty resolute. Ready to send her up the river which I think is totally unrealistic behavior.All this doesn't add up to much but it's always a treat to see Bogart and especially interesting at such an early point in his magnificent career. He's quite good. In fact he's the only one who doesn't have huge pauses between his sentences and speaks in a decent rhythm. The director really didn't pace this movie too well. It's early days for talkies and many actors were still adjusting their technique from stage to film.An oldie but unfortunately not a goodie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Obviously any Broadway play was good enough to turn into a movie in the early thirties  even a flop!!! It was also obvious that when the film was first released Henry Hull O.P. Heggie and Sidney Fox were the stars. In my copy Humphrey Bogart is given star status even though his role is just a supporting one. Who was Sidney Fox?? Sidney Fox was a petite brunette who in her first film Bad Sister 1931 was predicted to be the sister who was going places  Bette Davis played the good sister. Humphrey Bogart also had a role in that movie as well. Unfortunately she didn't and only made 14 films. She had just married Charles Beahan and Midnight was supposed to be her comeback film but she only made two more and her last Down to Their Last Yacht 1934 was supposed to be one of the worst musicals ever made.Midnight is the story of a righteous juror whose moral high ground comes back to haunt him. Edward Weldon O.P. Heggie is the head juror at the trial of Ethel Saxon Helen Flint and a question he asks  did you take the money before or after you killed him  seals her fate.On the night of her execution Weldon who has been pilloried in the press for his unbending attitude is determined to stay home  so he doesn't have to face the waiting newspapermen at his door. His soninlaw Joe Lynne Overman has made a bargain with a reporter who wants to take a photo of Weldon's face at midnight  the time Saxon is to be executed. Meanwhile Stella Sidney Fox has met Gar Boni Humphrey Bogart at the trial and has been having an affair with him. Gar means the world to Stella but to Gar Stella is just a pleasant diversion  he is about to leave town and he doesn't intend to take her with him. Stella who has seemed jumpy all through the movie comes home confessing she has killed Gar. The reporter Nolan Henry Hull is the voice of conscience and reason throughout the film. The movie seems to sit on the fence as far as opinions about capital punishment go. I like one reviewer's opinion that it moves like an iceberg  I completely agree. The film ends quite tidily with no question mark against anyone's values.Margaret Wycherley one of Hollywood's greatest character actresses she played James Cagney's mother in White Heat 1949 didn't have much to do as Weldon's wife.".

On the night the woman is due to be executed the family gathers with friends who all try to convince Weldon the father that he should intervene to prevent the execution. How a jury foreman would intervene at this late date is never answered. He refuses only to have his daughter stumble into the house announcing that she's killed Gar. Weldon then has to decide whether to protect her or turn her over to the law.All things considered this movie hasn't aged particularly well. The acting is mediocre and the story of Weldon's daughter killing Gar on the same night the woman Weldon's jury convicted is to be executed is just too neat and tidy and contrived. No doubt this deserves some credit for tackling a controversial subject and the movie seems to be an early example of advocating leniency for women who kill men who are unkind to them. Still simply tackling a difficult subject isn't enough to make a bad movie into a good one. Fans of Bogart will be both interested and disappointed in this one interested because it represents a look at one of his very early roles and disappointed because it's such a limited one. The other disappointment of course will be that this is really such a poor movie. 310".

It's a movie that obviously has points to make about capital punishment and the legal system not being fair for all. But it's a bit creaky and drags and kind of falls on its face in the final act.

	schema:reviewBody "Capital punishment is questioned indirectly by Midnight as is whether the law is or even can be applied equally. Or should be.Midnight is a stage play and director tricks tried to make it into a motion picture not entirely successfully.Director Chester Erskine billed here as Erskin used a lot of gimmicky camera angles including mirror shots and fast cuts and actually intruded on the drama of the situations.This is not a Humphrey Bogart movie. Bogey plays a pivotal but lesser character  and in my opinion gives one of his best performances. He was not stiff or stilted and his speech was clear. All in all an excellent performance.Who really is the star? Lovely Sidney Fox becomes the center of attention late in the film but O.P. Heggie is the focus earlier.He plays the father of her character and fatherinlaw of the character played by that excellent Lynne Overman here Lynn. His character brings into the bosom of the family a character a breed of person in 2016 and 2017 generally reviled and deservedly a reporter.Startling to me was Henry Hull who plays that reporter and who apparently did not age well because here he is young and good looking and I didn't even recognize him at first. Henry Hull became simply better and better as his career ran on and he was usually just outstanding.In Midnight most of the characters are fairly equal. Each has important lines and actions.But even more important than the people is what they say and what they are dealing with Heggie's character was foreman of a jury that found the defendant guilty and she is sentenced to death.Whether she does die whether she should have been found guilty whether she should have even been sentenced to the chair are all considered. And thus the movie despite its datedness is still timely.There are several versions at YouTube. I have watched only one so don't know if one is better than another but I do recommend you try to watch Midnight. Remember it's a set piece. There are no car chases no beheadings no explosions just a serious drama beautifully performed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was in a Bogart mood last night so I put in a film I've not watched in twentyfive years at least. I recently bought Midnight 1934 and the original title! from Grapevine because it's the original release print and not the rerelease under the title Call It Murder 1947 a print that has been circulating forever in the market. I'd never seen an original print. Trust me original or rerelease this All Star Pictures producedUniversal Pictures release needs mouth to mouth resuscitation to be watched today. It's got a really superb cast but they had to have made this one for the money alone. Why else would any of them  INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR!!!!!!  have allowed the credits to misspell their names?? The director Chester Erskine shows up nearly immediately as Chester Erskin then the cast begins and Lynne Overman has his first name spelled without the final e too next is Moffat Johnston as Moffat Johnson and lastly the wellknown character actor Henry O'Neill shows up missing the final l in his last name. I guess 'eetl' cost a tad too much to add... Anyway the premise for this film is decent but very very depressing. In some ways that's the point. A jury for a crime of passion gives the woman who committed the crime the death sentence instead of letting her off. We watch the clock and all the events that happen with several characters tick away until the midnight when the execution happens. The foreman of the jury played by O. P. Heggie claimed that it was murder because of a technicality based in a question he himself is allowed to ask the guilty woman played by Helen Flint. A lot of people outside of the court don't agree after the verdict is read in court. We see all of this played out against the time to the execution. O. P. Heggie's daughter and the first name in the cast is played by Sidney Fox an actress who is allowed to be called one because she was allowed to be called one  period. She falls  in the meantime  for small time hoodlum Gar Boni played by Humphrey Bogart. Others in this cast include Henry Hull who plays a really sneaky newspaperman Margaret Wycherly she was Cagney's Ma in White Heat  and here she's actually a nicelooking older woman instead of the crone she so often played Granville Bates Cora Witherspoon Katherine Wilson and actor and future director Richard Whorf. The biggest problem with this film besides direction was a lack of creativity in producing it on film. It's definitely the kind of thing that belongs almost exclusively on stage  or a halfhour TV show during the 1950's done live. The editing is nonexistent. Time back and forth could have been done rather than the stagnant linear movement forward which drags on and on and on. Thankfully after a full 76 minutes the program ends. By the way Bogie himself has some razzmatazz in his voice but even he's boring... Molasses that isn't sweet isn't sweet people. Best thing in the picture is Lynne Overman. That's not surprising. He's always rich in character. Here he's a shiftless nogood husband of Katherine Wilson who'd rather be rolling dice or the like. I know who's Katherine Wilson? I don't know either so quit asking!".

For those who are not familiar with the NorthSouth issues this movie may be confusing to categorize just as an action movie or one with more indepth interpretation of the political issues.What viewers should notice though is that these days the South Korean filmmakers enjoy making controversial movies such as those mentioned above which reflects their cultural artistic and political maturity South Koreans or Americans are very often bad guys and North Koreans are often good guys or poor victims left with no better choices. In other words less and less stereotyping.In the scene where Sin Jang DongKun meets his elder sister for the first time in 20 years... I'm telling you their performance was simply amazing especially Lee MiYeon's. I even felt sorry for those who don't understand Korean perfectly having only to depend upon the English subtitles which in no way convey the full meaning and nuance of the totally different Asian language. Obviously they speak in the movie with a very strong but of course perfect NorthKorean accent this is very impressive too that particular scene was too outstanding to categorize the entire movie into any single genre.Depending on the DVD editions in the last fighting scene between Sin and Kang where Sin says ...the fed up thing is that we understand each other.English subtitle What it really means is their ironical situation that they speak the same language Korean even though they are enemies.With better and more consistent background music and some other improvements not really worth mentioning I would've given it a 9. This does not mean that the entire background music sucked. I'm only pointing out those in the car chase and fightingshooting scenes".

The economical political and social component of a divided Korean peninsula is an issue in this movie and one should at least have a basic knowledge about this conflict to understand this movie. But this delicate topic doesn't dominate the movie and makes the whole thing too melodramatic. It's rather a positive elements as it adds some spicy ingredients to a promising melting pot and it adds some depth and development to many characters in this movie as you will see.The movie still stays a tension filled action movie about a lonesome pirate that wants to attack the Korean peninsula with nuclear garbage. The acting of both the main villain and the main hero is authentic and unique to both of them. The supporting actors such as the main villain's sister also do a great job. The amazing thing about this movie is that the bad guy is more than just your average terrorist. There are many reasons why he has become the one he is and sometimes good and evil are not clearly distinguished. When it comes to the confrontation between the good and the bad guy one realizes that they have a lot in common and could have been big friends in another situation. This is what makes this movie emotional tragic and not too expectable at some points. Towards the end the flick becomes a true tearjerker but I mean this in a positive way. The movie truly touched me because the stories behind the characters are really well thought out. They are dramatic emotional and tragic.The story is not complicated but still detailed enough to remain interesting and demand a certain kind of attention. The movie just has the right mixture of dialogues narrative flashbacks and explosive action scenes. The settings are also amazing. The movie plays in several countries from Laos to Russia and exposes many beautiful landscapes and different cultures without being too educational.The only two small flaws during this joy ride are a little bit confusing beginning as too many different characters are introduced at the same time and you need a lot of concentration to get out who's doing what. The second point is a too predictable ending that reminds a little bit too much of many Hollywood movies. I really felt that I have already seen similar stuff a couple of times before at that point. A final showdown on a ship during a storm including terroristic pirates and a courageous military special unit that refuses to obey any orders to save the world on their own is a thing that uses too many stereotypes. Nevertheless this movie still remains quite underrated should get more praise and I would definitely watch this again.".

The music sounded like something from an expensive video game and many scenes dragged on far too long. After witnessing the most uninspired car chase I've seen in a while I was ready to give up on this movie. However Lee MiYeon managed to save the film single handedly with an incredible performance. It's a shame she's on screen for such a short time but with her introduction the film suddenly finds energy and was entertaining from then on. The film could have used some better characterization and more interaction between the two protagonists. It is mostly the flawed screenplay that is the blame here concerning our lack of emotional attachment to the main characters not the actors themselves they both do a suitable job. More of Lee MiYeon could have always helped as well. As it is this movie delivers somewhat as entertainment but it could have been much better.One scene that will remain in my mind from this film is when the two protagonists meet at the train station. This is one of the few times when the music complemented the scene and the result is truly cinematic.

The venues are exotic from Russia to Thailand. In the action department the movie makers make sure that the audience get what they expect in explosion car case awesome firepower horrendous storms and a finale knife duel that is absolutely unnecessary but fully expected. The entire movie bursts with macho tension except for the scenes of the reuniting brother and sister after 20 years and the sister with only a few months to live. This turn out to be the most memorable scene in the entire move well acted and genuinely touching.".

It was really nicely acted and came off as believable and emotional.There was a great deal of good action in the movie and also some exciting enough thrills throughout the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "A secret cargo of nuclear detonators is pilfered in a daring bloody attack by ruthless nationless pirate Sin. Naturally this potentially damaging and frightening attack is covered up by the American 'Defence Intelligence Agency' but not before the South Koreans set their own man on trying to uncover the identity of the thieves and their intentions. South Korea is wary in the politically fractious 21stcentury AsiaPacific region of being caught in nuclear crossfire especially when Japan China America Russia are all vying for supremacy Thus begins an international game of catandmouse as the volatile Sin heartthrob and superstar DongKun Jang is tracked by crack noble Navy officer Kang Sejong JungJae Lee over hill and dale and Kang discovers Sin's plot to unleash a nuclear Armageddon on South Korea using a supertyphoon to transport his payload. Why is Sin set on this terrifying course? As two heartbreaking flashbacks show he and his North Korean family attempted to flee to the South in the 1980s but were turned away and thrown to the unforgiving Chinese and North Koreans victims in the capricious unsympathetic diplomacygame. Sin pledges revenge but not before he's grown into a wiry hugely capable soldier with a stern group of paramilitary types around him. Kang is at first glance the polar opposite to the tattooed and stragglyhaired Sin cleancut calm and proud of his homeland.As we watch these two alphamale Nimrods strafe and finally lay into each other their battle might be understood as an unintentionally funny homoerotic courtship. When they can no longer contain their raging lust and rip into each in selfconsciously spectacular finale their knifefight will either be very moving or provoke laughter since their knives almost become phallic in their symbolism and the final act of seppuku is almost masturbatory.Some might find that viewpoint unnecessarily crude and meanspirited but the film relies too much on hardware to either engage or entertain its audience. The most expensive South Korean movie ever made 15 million or something this purports to be a serious if populist attempt to reveal the unknown victims of the NorthSouth divide. However it's another example of the admittedly very shrewd and successful Korean film industry engaging in commercial oneupmanship with each new blockbuster being more expensive more impressive more accomplished than the first. Typhoon obviously has an eye on the international market given that a good deal of the dialogue is spoken stiltedly in English and that the productionvalues recall a Jerry Bruckheimer or Tony Scott venture. The plot save the historical context is also a facsimile of innumerable raceagainsttime action films which you've seen a hundred of times before.This would be just another dumb lumbering spectacle were it not for the commitment to the material that cast and crew show. This style of filmmaking is now utterly familiar from South Korea and Typhoon owes an enormous debt of gratitude to Shiri and Taegukgi with the threat of devastation and recall of the terrible violence between the North and South Korea. I'm getting a little bored of DongKun Jang's acting style which basically requires him to act bugeyed and hysterical but I suppose this won't change anytime soon since he's making a mint out of it. JungJae Lee is more subdued but equally disappointing his facial expressions are quite limited. Credit to them however the poor script hardly offers them much acting range. Director KyungTaek Kwak has this type of malemelodrama down pat having honed it in the terrific Friend and clichd but moving Champion. Kwak tries to broaden his malecentric universe by introducing Sin's long suffering sister who has only ever know suffering. Indeed her history of sex slavery and drug addiction are likely to get one righteously angry but not for long because Kwak's unending emphasis on the brotherandsister's misery verges on selfparody. Likewise the burgeoning 'understanding' between Sin and Kang but their resolve to complete their separate missions makes for a lack of real frisson real hate.Typhoon from an unsympathetic Western perspective is just a faceless expensive behemoth that begs for big office and got it. I found its greatest failing not the constant dramatic overkill and overemphasis which at least kept me watching but rather it's pedestrian direction. Kwak overrelies on his sets special effects and production team all of whom obviously put in the hours but his action scenes are quite unexciting especially when compared to the Bourne films which beg comparison given the globetrotting and the murky past the characters must dredge up. One knife fight is much like another as is an explosion a car chase. Even the final desperate assault on the hurricanelashed ship is tinged with tedium since its such a familiar scenario. Typhoon skirts boredom on too many occasions.The film is not helped by poor editing and pacing which contrives to leave us with a monthlong gap in the story at one point and a bathetic score which drowns out all the action. The film's only real interest is its staunch standpoint that South and North Korea should be left to resolve their problems unmolested by China Japan or America and it also provides a slightly compelling international backdrop. The film's use of real locations and constant hopping across Asia help ground it in a relatively realistic context South Korea surrounded by real countries. Thankfully the filmmakers don't resort to using especially recognisable landmarks so the film doesn't feel too much like a travelogue.Basically the budget stars and political standpoint make this something like essential viewing for fans of Korean cinema but they should take warning this is hardly the industry at its best. Viewers in search of both fun and gritty politics should 'scuse the stupid metaphor avoid it like a raging hurricane.".

As two heartbreaking flashbacks show he and his North Korean family attempted to flee to the South in the 1980s but were turned away and thrown to the unforgiving Chinese and North Koreans victims in the capricious unsympathetic diplomacygame. Sin pledges revenge but not before he's grown into a wiry hugely capable soldier with a stern group of paramilitary types around him. Kang is at first glance the polar opposite to the tattooed and stragglyhaired Sin cleancut calm and proud of his homeland.As we watch these two alphamale Nimrods strafe and finally lay into each other their battle might be understood as an unintentionally funny homoerotic courtship. When they can no longer contain their raging lust and rip into each in selfconsciously spectacular finale their knifefight will either be very moving or provoke laughter since their knives almost become phallic in their symbolism and the final act of seppuku is almost masturbatory.Some might find that viewpoint unnecessarily crude and meanspirited but the film relies too much on hardware to either engage or entertain its audience. The most expensive South Korean movie ever made 15 million or something this purports to be a serious if populist attempt to reveal the unknown victims of the NorthSouth divide. However it's another example of the admittedly very shrewd and successful Korean film industry engaging in commercial oneupmanship with each new blockbuster being more expensive more impressive more accomplished than the first. Typhoon obviously has an eye on the international market given that a good deal of the dialogue is spoken stiltedly in English and that the productionvalues recall a Jerry Bruckheimer or Tony Scott venture. The plot save the historical context is also a facsimile of innumerable raceagainsttime action films which you've seen a hundred of times before.This would be just another dumb lumbering spectacle were it not for the commitment to the material that cast and crew show. This style of filmmaking is now utterly familiar from South Korea and Typhoon owes an enormous debt of gratitude to Shiri and Taegukgi with the threat of devastation and recall of the terrible violence between the North and South Korea. I'm getting a little bored of DongKun Jang's acting style which basically requires him to act bugeyed and hysterical but I suppose this won't change anytime soon since he's making a mint out of it. JungJae Lee is more subdued but equally disappointing his facial expressions are quite limited. Credit to them however the poor script hardly offers them much acting range. Director KyungTaek Kwak has this type of malemelodrama down pat having honed it in the terrific Friend and clichd but moving Champion. Kwak tries to broaden his malecentric universe by introducing Sin's long suffering sister who has only ever know suffering. Indeed her history of sex slavery and drug addiction are likely to get one righteously angry but not for long because Kwak's unending emphasis on the brotherandsister's misery verges on selfparody. Likewise the burgeoning 'understanding' between Sin and Kang but their resolve to complete their separate missions makes for a lack of real frisson real hate.Typhoon from an unsympathetic Western perspective is just a faceless expensive behemoth that begs for big office and got it. I found its greatest failing not the constant dramatic overkill and overemphasis which at least kept me watching but rather it's pedestrian direction. Kwak overrelies on his sets special effects and production team all of whom obviously put in the hours but his action scenes are quite unexciting especially when compared to the Bourne films which beg comparison given the globetrotting and the murky past the characters must dredge up. One knife fight is much like another as is an explosion a car chase. Even the final desperate assault on the hurricanelashed ship is tinged with tedium since its such a familiar scenario. Typhoon skirts boredom on too many occasions.The film is not helped by poor editing and pacing which contrives to leave us with a monthlong gap in the story at one point and a bathetic score which drowns out all the action. The film's only real interest is its staunch standpoint that South and North Korea should be left to resolve their problems unmolested by China Japan or America and it also provides a slightly compelling international backdrop. The film's use of real locations and constant hopping across Asia help ground it in a relatively realistic context South Korea surrounded by real countries. Thankfully the filmmakers don't resort to using especially recognisable landmarks so the film doesn't feel too much like a travelogue.Basically the budget stars and political standpoint make this something like essential viewing for fans of Korean cinema but they should take warning this is hardly the industry at its best. Viewers in search of both fun and gritty politics should 'scuse the stupid metaphor avoid it like a raging hurricane.";

	schema:reviewBody "Death Bell is a South Korean high school horror movie released in 2008. It includes lots of slasher elements a few minor mystery passages that can be seen as a nod to many popular Asian ghost movies but also several twisted enigmas that the surviving pupils and teachers have to resolve to save those who are kidnapped one by one by a vengeful mind. Imagine a mixture of the Yeogo Goedam series and Saw.The problem I have with this movie is not that it doesn't introduce anything new to the genre. A solid high school slasher flick like 4th Period Mystery can be quite entertaining without being innovative. This movie takes too much time to kick the story off. The first twenty minutes don't even introduce you adequately to the story. The real reasons behind what happens in this movie are shown later in a few rushed flashbacks. The opening minutes introduce you to many unimportant secondary characters.In fact there are so many pupils running around that it's a little bit hard to realize who is who. After twenty lame minutes pupils are suddenly kidnapped and murdered at such a high speed that you might soon feel confused about who is still alive who has been kidnapped and who is about to be murdered.Then we have the enigmas. Each time a pupil is about to be tortured to death a madman presents the surviving crowd an enigma they have to solve at time to save their kidnapped colleagues. Sometimes the survivors even solve the enigmas but that doesn't keep the killer from continuing his slaughter which is pretty lame as the challenges feel somewhat useless. No matter if you solve the enigmas or not the killer continues to spread death and terror until the very end of the movie.The enigmas are also rather hard to follow. The first enigma has something to do with mathematics but the solution is never shown to the viewers. For the second enigma the survivors have to create a sentence which is very hard to understand. I neither understand the sense behind the sentence nor the way the survivors manage to compose it in the end. The other enigmas are a little bit easier to understand but not very interesting as well. The movie should have spent some more time on explaining the enigmas and their more or less associated traps as it is the case in movies like Mindhunters.The ending of the movie is rather intriguing and includes a minor twist. Some people felt disappointed by it others thought it was great and to me it was just okay. At least it ended this short movie on a rather high note.Fans of high school horror movies or slasher films can try this movie out. It's nothing groundbreaking but surely entertaining enough if you don't want to watch your Scream movies over and over again. It's decently entertaining but only an average horror movie especially if we compare this to other unique and stunning South Korean horror movies like A Tale Of Two Sisters Bedevilled or I Saw The Devil for example. But for what it is it's an acceptable fast food horror flicks with a few Korean pop stars acting in here.".

The main actress is a singer turned actor this is usually a disastrous move for western entertainment world but it does happen very often in Asian and she actually did a good job. Asian horror movies very frequently use young innocent girl as main actress and she is perfect for that role. I must say it works better than Western sexual appealing actresses. Most white girls are pretty tall and strong but with good body I really think sometimes if they serious want to fight back the bullies will get pounded.Anyway those young school girls and boys were as helpless as always but the only thing will work in this movie was their brain. Now another eastern culture people need to understand is that grades are everything getting into good university is everything. There is something implied in the movie is about how those students were best students of the school and they have a bright future because they study hard and smart. Quite a few movies implies how stressful of the eastern education is and some writer thinks it is scary if he adds horror element on top of that stress will attract Audience. Based on the experience of the school in the UK I really don't think English students will ever get it. Well if you can think of it this way you are fighting into the night after 1am in the morning trying to compete with one hundred thousands other students in the exam and there is a ghost start bothering you and try to rip your gut out I think people will get disturbed by it.By the way I have seen way much more disturbing movies than it so I am kinda numb. However I thought among all the Korean horror movies they do have some new ideas involving some psychological traps and supernatural activities. I liked the singeractor small girl it is refreshing to see a pure school girl for a change than teenmodel wannabes getting slashed. Worth a watch if you want to see something different. The movie is not that smart direction was OK story is fine if you are patient please don't expect too much acting in a horror movie in which I mean it is good enough.

	schema:reviewBody "Meanwhile it's been more than three months since I watched Death Bell at the Belgian Festival of Fantastic Films but for some reason it must have escaped everyone's attention here at IMDb because the film didn't receive its very own page until now. Since it's been quite long and since I watched a whole lot of other crap in the meantime I'm glad I took some notes and wrote down impressions after seeing the film otherwise I'm afraid I wouldn't have remembered that much. By that I certainly don't mean that Death Bell is a bad film. Quite the contrary it's a very amusing horror flick with exhilarating gore and a dazzling fast pace. Originality however isn't the film's biggest trump as it borrows plot ideas and stylistic elements from various other and more famous horror movies. Death Bell somewhat describes itself as Saw meets Battle Royale with a bunch of high school students and their teachers desperately trying to escape the imaginative death traps of a maniacal killer. Twenty of the most intelligent but also sickly competitive and pompous students of a prominent Seoul high school attend a special exam held on a Saturday. Suddenly classical music plays through the speakers and the television monitor displays images of one missing student trapped in an aquarium slowly filling up with water. The exits are sealed the contact with the outside world is cut off and the group finds themselves subjected to the lethal and perverted games of a deranged killer. But who is he and what are his motives? Cowriter and director Chang who was a guest at the festival and appears to be incredibly young has obviously watched and studied a whole lot of contemporary popular horror movies and knows exactly what it takes to please a large crowd of fans. The death traps are complex and implausible  like the ones in all the Saw movies  but they definitely guarantee extended moments of suspense and a lot of gruesome bloodshed. The makeup and sound effects are fantastic so if you have the opportunity to see this film in a theater or with luxurious home cinema equipment you definitely will be overwhelmed. The characters are typical Asian high school students like they appear in numerous movies but the film does it best to provide as many backgrounds and little personality details that are also relevant. Considering the subject matter and exactly like Saw the script is often incoherent and extremely implausible example how could one individual plan such a hi tech and accurate largescaled massacre but you easily are willing to overlook that thanks to the entertainment value. The identity of the killer and his reasons are quite predictable as well but then again this is a film that primarily relies on inventive shocks and outrageous gore.".

Cowriter and director Chang who was a guest at the festival and appears to be incredibly young has obviously watched and studied a whole lot of contemporary popular horror movies and knows exactly what it takes to please a large crowd of fans. The death traps are complex and implausible  like the ones in all the Saw movies  but they definitely guarantee extended moments of suspense and a lot of gruesome bloodshed. The makeup and sound effects are fantastic so if you have the opportunity to see this film in a theater or with luxurious home cinema equipment you definitely will be overwhelmed. The characters are typical Asian high school students like they appear in numerous movies but the film does it best to provide as many backgrounds and little personality details that are also relevant. Considering the subject matter and exactly like Saw the script is often incoherent and extremely implausible example how could one individual plan such a hi tech and accurate largescaled massacre but you easily are willing to overlook that thanks to the entertainment value. The identity of the killer and his reasons are quite predictable as well but then again this is a film that primarily relies on inventive shocks and outrageous gore.";

It's not really a horror flick but sort of works like the Saw movies except not the victims but the students that still hasn't been kidnapped yet has to solve the puzzles in order to save there classmate. My guess is that there wasn't many Korean horror movies released during that year and since Asians tends to crave horror flicks it did so well. Although the premise is pretty well done none of the characters seem to stand out much and you just don't care who lives and who dies. None of them were believable and the character decisions don't make sense sometimes there just isn't any logic. Plus everything about this movie seems to be rushed especially the ending the twist also wasn't that shocking or original. But what annoyed me the most was the clich it's safe to be in one area but a person can take it anymore or goes off to investigate when the person they leave behind is the one that really needs help which tends to get annoying since it gets used way too much in this. Although I ain't really looking forward to the sequel to this I hope it's better than this although sequels tend to suck.5.310".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who like Korean horror and who doesn't these days there is certainly no real shortage. And Korean horror seems to have perfected the balance between the supernatural and the psychological. And the two often go hand in hand. Death Bell is a slightly more genre take on this sort of horror. It also borrows heavily from western horror films most notably the SAW series. I would imagine this torture porn is something Koreans don't get a lot of while in the US we're plenty used to it. So it's hard to look at this film through the eyes of its intended audience. Even so Death Bell is entertaining enough but descends into territory that is both too familiar and too clich even by Asian horror standards.For the uninitiated Death Bell tells the story of a group of topnotch students who have been chosen to study over their vacation in order to take a test and impress a sister school. The best students in the school are chosen but it is to their unfortunate fate. Soon a sadistic killer traps them in the school and starts kidnapping them one by one. Each kidnapped student is then threatened with a torturous death unless the rest of the students can solve the questions being given to them by the killer.Once the film starts going it does very much resemble the formula of SAW. Person is taken and put in some kind of trap other person has to solve some kind of problem to free trapped person if not person is brutally killed. And Death Bell certainly does this end well enough. The traps aren't as creative as we have come to expect from SAW but they are creative enough ranging from a clothes dryer to a candle wax trap. They provide a good amount of tension and there is a pretty decent mix of Korean horror elements mixed in most notably the presence of a supernatural force.The acting is very good with Beomsu Lee of City of Violence fame doing a particularly good job. The directing is also quite good. First time director Yoon HongSeung does a good job at building tension and mystery and it is an impressive debut that successfully melds traditional western slasher conventions with Korean horror elements. Production is of the highest quality here. However despite these elements it still remains a mostly passable effort.The thing that really brings this down is the script. It's clich ridden both for western horror and eastern. There's scary ghost girls obvious twists and the attempts at pulling at heart strings even though you can't help but feel emotionally detached from these characters. It might simply be a cultural barrier something we can't really understand in what is a truly horrible academia nightmare. Still halfway through the film you simply stop caring. It just isn't that interesting anymore. By the time you learn the truth it's not surprising nor that interesting. Part of that problem comes from an overcomplication of the films story. Elements used are unnecessary. If the film had been kept to a simple entertaining horror piece it might have worked all the way through.I rated it the way I did because of this. Everything else was top notch and there was even quite a bit of tension mostly during the torture scenes. But once it starts getting complicated then it fizzles. It could have been better and Yoon shows great potential for a sophomore effort. I'll even say that this film was very impressive as a first. But on it's own it's merely a onenight piece of entertainment.".

An anonymous person has told them they must answer all the questions he gives them or student by student will be killed.Of course with Asian horror films there is usually the usual clich's  not to say that they won't work  because they usually do. This is no exception  you have your flashbacks a tormented past and the reflections of adolescent school kids who often make the stupid choices while in stages of panic in their predicament  I guess that is universal.The choice of music in this film is a bit questioanble as it felt more like a high beat sort of atmosphere that doesn't work at times. The concept is interesting but at the same time the film feels more like a detective game rather than anything really scary  there are only a few moments which made me shudder  and it is mainly shock tactics that don't last for more than a few moments.Still it is an entertaining ride. The final payoff at the end  I admit I didn't see it coming and it wasn't too bad. Think of this film like Battle Royale meets Saw.".

It's a great setup that flows nicely between each act with some great practical effects and some disturbing and downright horrifying scenes involving the teens. The acting was great all around save for a few of the students that seemed to not have much experience or didn't take their roles too seriously. And while the movie seemed to get a bit confusing towards the final act it all came together nicely in a twist that was not only unexpected but very well executed. My only gripe with this film was that it could have been a bit more graphic with its depiction of death. I wanted to see each person as they were being killed if only to increase the tension and disturbing element of an already pretty effective setup.

The coach that is hired by the local committee who was actually nothing at teaching kids and who does not even how to spell ski jump he writes sky instead of skihas to find four youngsters because nobody wants to do it. The first candidate he picks is Bob Jamesan American citizen adopted to America with his sister when he was little. Bob apparently has some junior experience as he was once selected as the MVP at all America's Alpine Ski Competition.Though Bob isn't so eager to join the team because he feels chagrined at the fact that he feels he was dumped by Korea when he was just a little kidhe merely hopes to find his biological mother along the way.The second fellowHeungcHeol is a junkie who frequently buys Luminal by feigning illness. The third guy has to look after his retarded brother and his grandmother so he thinks the cash reward will do him good. The fourth fellow is a subservient fellow who always obeys his father's will. He has a Chinese girlfriend who is an illegal alien. He hopes he will be exempted from the military service if he becomes a national athlete. While a large scale construction is going on for the Olympics in Muju City the national ski jump team doesn't even have a jump tower and they have to do physical training in primitive ways. They try to keep their bodily balance on a vehicle that is doing 90 kilometers per hour on the motorwaythey try to take skiing position up there on the trees by using ropes and they jump from the 30 meter makeshift ramp track. They finally get to Berlin for the world cup but when Bob and his friends are engaged in a donnybrook with the US team both teams get disqualified. His junkie friend tells him there You're neither Korean nor American.What are you?An invisible man? This clearly adds insult to injury. Just when their hopes are downthe committee cancels the remaining events which allows all the teams to complete in the Olympics.Unfortunatelywhen the team is back in Koreathey realize they were just a show to host the Olympics. When Muju's application is turned down by reason of the insufficiency of the winter sports popularity and the absence of the official sport the committee drops the whole case but the boys and the coach don't give up and they accept to go to the 1998 Winter Olympics Nagano Japan at their own expense. Even if Korea gets the 13th Place at the Olympics the doggedsingleminded determination of these youngsters fill the whole country with genuine admiration. As a success story from scratch the movie is truly inspirationaldramaticentertaining and optimistic albeit a bit overlong and sometimes predictable. The acting is superb though someone who was adopted to America when he was just a little kid should have a far better accent than that. This movie is a mustsee for anyone in any country where people are bound to have a sneaking admiration for medallion winners of other countries because their country doesn't invest enough money and trust in the potential of its own people.".

The plot has to be coherent and there can't be anything ridiculous like a monster. Saw evokes strong emotions of terror and fear all the while remaining plausible. Well the story is actually unlikely but everything in the film is physically possible.The scenes that are meant to be frightening don't require things that jump out at you every two seconds or cheesy orchestral flailings. The situation is what frightens you not the presentation. Saw does have some secondrate acting but then again it is a lowbudget film and I suppose they couldn't exactly afford Robert De Niro. The script is not fantastic but one true redeeming quality of the whole film is the story. It is dense complex but so captivating. I can only think of a few mystery plot lines that can even compare to this one. The Usual Suspects is probably up there but Saw stands alone.I strongly recommend this film who appreciate good stories and aren't easily scared by the garbage you see in theaters like House Of Wax. For people who get squeamish steer clear of this film. It is very nice graphic and very sadistic at times. A brilliant debut and a terrifying ride. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since Nattevagten I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as Saw. Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With Saw James Wan and Leigh Whannell the creative heads behind this project set new standards. Think you're hardboiled? Think again and watch Saw a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.Saw has been advertised as the new Se7en and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition Saw does a much better job at actually being creepy. Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being Saw does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans but hey Se7en and Silence Of The Lambs didn't care too much about realism either did they?Saw does have some flaws. Those spedup tracking shots have just been used too many times by now the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another some characters' lines are a bit clichd. However considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.I can't remember the last time I've been surprised by a movie's final twist but Saw has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent filmmaking since Cube. I'm really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell's career develops after this fine sleeper.".

Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being Saw does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans but hey Se7en and Silence Of The Lambs didn't care too much about realism either did they?Saw does have some flaws. Those spedup tracking shots have just been used too many times by now the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another some characters' lines are a bit clichd. However considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all it's really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.I can't remember the last time I've been surprised by a movie's final twist but Saw has an ending that I didn't see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent filmmaking since Cube. I'm really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell's career develops after this fine sleeper.";

From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly. Just like 'Se7en' the allround Grittiness that director James Wan creates disgusts and enthralls. Just like 'Se7en' there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle. A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won't be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry! I still can't sleep. It is well scripted well acted and for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. It is better than Seven for shock value. It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat. Very highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone more on that later. Sure in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise starter something the writer and director never planned but viewed on its own astonishing merits it's a good nasty thriller filled with solid scares and especially compared to the followups quite well written.According to the film's notorious backstory it took only 28 days to shoot it. Not that strange given most of the action takes place in just two locations one is a bathroom where Adam Leigh Whannell and Dr. Lawrence Gordon Cary Elwes fins themselves with their feet chained to the wall with no recollection whatsoever of how the hell they got there the other is the lair of the mysterious Jigsaw a serial killer whom Detectives Sing Ken Leung and Trapp Danny Glover have been tracking down for weeks.The two facts are linked in a most ingenious way Jigsaw doesn't really kill anyone but plays a game with his victims. In the case of Adam and Dr. Gordon as the tape recorder found in a dead man's hand tells them each of them has two hours to free himself and kill the other or they will both die. Problem is the only way to get rid of the chains is to saw your foot off. And so while the two unfortunate cellmates have to choose who gets to live that's Jigsaw's perverse logic he offers you a choice the police close in on the elusive psycho whose previous deeds and MO are shown in flashbacks.Whereas the subsequent Saw films use the messy chronology just for the hell of it though they do get away with some neat narrative tweaks thanks to it the first installment takes advantage of its nonlinear storytelling to increase the suspense and provide some valuable clues to how everything fits together. It is to James Wan and cowriter Whannell's eternal credit that they like Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker went beyond slasher clichs and came up with something more. Okay so Saw's philosophical undertones aren't entirely original but what the heck they do manage to keep the audience interested in what's going on. In addition adding a little more depth to the killer ensures that the movie's more gruesome parts and there are a lot of them don't come off as gratuitous bloodletting for an example of the latter look no further than the countless sequels to A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday 13th.Furthermore the intelligence behind the film's structure might also have had a positive effect on the performances given the acting is more convincing here than in most post2000 shockers Elwes and Whannell's desperation is conveyed with an intensity that's almost too painful to behold Glover plays the aging cop role resisting the temptation to do a Lethal Weapon injoke you know the too old for this sht gag and when Jigsaw himself appears... well it's the horror equivalent of Keyser Soze  chilling and impossible to forget and for once not played by Kevin Spacey. Just like the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw a film that was originally planned for a straighttovideo release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings was finally given the green light in October 2004  just in time for Halloween. Saw contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve then doublesback on itself threefourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new.It's not hard to see why this almost hit the straighttovideo fodder list. I mean people will closely observe that it obviously contains the traits of its successors namely Seven 1995 and that may be all the ammunition the haters will need to trash it. Already I see that the IMDb voters have averaged Saw a 7.5 with those people who have rated it with an 8 or a 10 being neckandneck at the polls.But I begin with reassurances that Saw is a genius thriller if not entirely original or daring. The film does its best to exploit the claustrophobia and mounting tension that collects as it progresses. Saw will also make you think twice about bladed objects as well.Ironically the title has very little to do with plot as there is no chainsawwielding maniac on the loose as the ghastly cover art of a severed foot would imply. The only saws here are the ones the two main characters Lawrence Cary Elwes and Adam Leigh Whannell also the film' screenwriter have been given.The two men awaken to find themselves chained to lead pipes in a decrepit public bathroom. In the middle of the floor is a dead body that's surrounded in a pool of its own blood with a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. As it would turn out they're the latest victims of a serial killer known as the Jigsaw Killer.Jigsaw has a nasty little way of torturing his victims by trapping them in a situation where they have to kill if they want to survive. As Lawrence explains technically Jigsaw is not a killer simply because he hasn't killed anyone the victims do that for him. As one fortunate victim observes who survived her ordeal she is bound to a chair with a reversed bear traplike device strapped to her head with pliers wired into her upper and lower jaws. A timer is on the device and if she does not locate a key before it runs out her mouth will be ripped open and no more pretty face. In order to get out she must open up the stomach of a dead man lying on the floor next her to get the key.As Jigsaw ever so carefully points out to his victims he doesn't just choose them at random. To him they're all perfectly immoral individuals and he uses their immorality to set up horrific situations where the victim rarely survives the trap in essence life is its own reward because Jigsaw's victims don't value it as he explains to the one young woman lucky enough to fight through his plan. Also on the case of Jigsaw are two detectives Tapp Danny Glover and Sing Ken Leung who bring forth the news of Jigsaw's previous victims in one particularly gruesome flashback sequence.Lawrence is pretty well aware of the case of Jigsaw as even once he was considered a suspect by the police. As you would have it Adam is not especially trustful of Lawrence being that he seems to know a lot and is not reporting many details to him. They realize however that if they are going to survive this nightmare they're going to have to play into Jigsaw's game observe the clues he's willing to give them and ultimately make it out alive.Saw was directed admirably by James Wan and written by Whannell who also makes an effective victim alongside Elwes. Elwes a highly underrated actor is given a chance to shine here even though this really isn't an actor's movie as it is more in the hands of the director. However we do get a sense of the desperation of the two leads who soon realize that they're not the only ones trapped in this madman's game.Saw does benefit from its moody atmosphere which may cover up any of the film's shortcomings. Towards the end it does lose pace a little bit as things seem to be spiraling down the haunted house route but quickly regains momentum as it draws to a close. I know that despite its flaws I was glued to the seat and really in the film's tight tension which thankfully doesn't let up.Is Saw a genre classic? Certainly. Is it a classic like Seven? I don't know. There's a lot to consider when pondering a question with so much baggage like that one. I liked it but I'm not so sure about the news that a sequel is in the works. This seems a lot like a standalonetype movie that of which doesn't need to get bogged down by the weight of unnecessary sequels.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw is one of the better horror films in recent memory. I suppose it's more of a thriller than horror although it still is gory and serves well on a horrific level. It's sort of a cross between Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs I'd say and the film is pretty damn good. Saw opens with two men who wake up in a dilapidated public restroom with no memory of how or why they are where they are. Chained to the floor they are both utterly confused and terrified. Together they begin to piece together the memory of what happened to them as the serial killer nicknamed Jigsaw threatens them and plays numerous mind games that lead up to their demise. Meanwhile detectives and officials are on the trail of the brutal serial murderer trying to save the men the entire time.This is definitely a smart thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the bloody limbsevering conclusion. The characters are extremely believable and the acting was great including performances by Carey Elwes Monica Potter and Danny Glover. Everyone performed perfectly and were very believable to watch. The entire movie has a dark damp setting and is overloaded with intense scenes and lots of gore that are sure to please any horror fan. On top of that the cleverlywoven story is unique and underived. James Wan does an excellent job especially considering this to be his first feature film. I can't wait to see some his future stuff.Bottom line  Saw is a smart grisly unforgiving allaround brutal horror movie that is unique and original. If you are looking for a horror movie a notch above your average slasher flick I advise you see Saw. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "So I just watched this movie I won't even make the effort to use the obvious pun here and I am scared. Scared of bad acting bad editing poor plot. Two guys wake up in a shitty bathroom tied to opposite corners by chains nothing on them but their clothes and some tools they might need to survive but haven't figured out how to use yet. In the beginning I instantly thought of a CUBElike setup and was really looking forward to seeing it. But as the story evolved more and more I realised there was not much to it. A big chunk of this movie is told in flashbacks to somehow justify why the two guys ended up there how they are connected and why the killer is acting the way he is although in the long run I still can't quite explain why you have to kill people to show them how cool life is. Or why it makes you that insane and brilliant at the same time so that you have nothing better to do than set up strange traps that make people kill themselves or why you start to enjoy watching your masterpiece of psychological torturecabinet lying on the bathroom floor with your eyes closed pretending to be dead. Ah right for the surprise ending. I forgot. Everything is thoughtout halfway but that's where it ends. I mean the story has potential it could've made a really great movie but they just ruined it to give them a platform to show off. Huh yeah see what I can do. I can use speedup pictures and ultrashaky camera. I bet you never saw this before right? Right right. Never. So the standard tools to make a movie look young and fresh again. What else do we need for a nice horrorslasher movie? Right clich! Lots of it. And the main thing that really makes me mad is this Stupid Victim Syndrome. Hmmm. This guy just wanted to kill me but now I have the gun...what should I do? Yeah talk to my husband on the phone instead of shooting him at least in the legs. Seriously this scares the hell out of me. Can't ANYBODY please write a script that has normalacting victims in it? Like shooting the guy? Sorry but this was a quite boring movie with bad acting and a poor script though the idea was great. Yeah poor. That sums it up quite well.".

It's just a pedestrian thriller all jazzed up with tricky editing jump cuts some gore and loud music to appeal to the teenagers and intellectually stunted adults in the audience.

So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous unlikelihood can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room? It has not sense at all except to be the final deffect of the movie. The killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible. Finally it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow the male nurse but not the floor of the white room. The director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden. Then the film would be a quite good thriller. However 'Saw' is just a fiasco.

	schema:reviewBody "Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel suckerpunched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film most notably SE7EN with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic depressing bleak and filled with a growing sense of stomachturning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus be set free.The problem with SAW its in the script itself with plot holes galore and character motivationsreactions completely unclear. The two main characters undergo the suffering victims are meant to and do so down to the end but the supporting characters fair poorly. Danny Glover's character goes through being a broken man through the death of his partner to being badly obsessed with the Jigsaw Killer and not once could I believe he would do most of the things he does throughout the film like not requesting backup as he enters a deserted warehouse in a flashback sequence or allowing a clearly wimpy killer to get the best of him later on. Monica Potter plays Cary Elwes' wife who witnesses the killer point a gun to her daughter's temple while listening to her frantic heartbeats but when she gets the chance to give him his just desserts she fails to do so because she was on the phone with her imprisoned husband. It was a Huh? moment where motherhood somehow didn't enter into the plot logic but then again not many did.Another thing which works against it is the fact that that for a genuinely interesting and even innovative premise like this one SAW would be best as a film 20  30 minutes shorter with an equally shorter time span the plot extends for an approximate five hours from start to climax and then would the shocking twist at the end make some sense. As it is it has the look and feel of a video game in which the menacing growl of a voice orders the victims through audiovideotape to commit a horrible and nearly impossible act in order to survive with some rapidfire MTV editing to add to the viewer's disorientation and Giallo overtones which do work here if you think of Dario Argento's PROFONDO ROSSO or Mario Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE. Here's hoping James Wan will make a much better film as he does have an overall good technique with his visuals.".

	onyx:emotionText "Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel suckerpunched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film most notably SE7EN with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic depressing bleak and filled with a growing sense of stomachturning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus be set free.The problem with SAW its in the script itself with plot holes galore and character motivationsreactions completely unclear. The two main characters undergo the suffering victims are meant to and do so down to the end but the supporting characters fair poorly.

Paul Bettany Denzel Washington There are others who are irredeemably awful in absolutely anything Ryan O'Neal comes to mind. And then there are guys like Cary Elwes. He was dynamite in The Princess Bride every bit as swashbuckling and fun to watch as Errol Flynn. He shines in ensemble pieces equally convincing as the desperately manipulative Thomas H. Ince in Peter Bogdanovich's pathetically underseen The Cat's Meow and as a fat balding prissy theater producer in Cradle Will Rock. Of course it helps that all these are good movies which the generic horror flick Saw is not.Not that it doesn't try. It's got that grinding industrialmetal soundtrack to get us all edgy when the film itself cannot. It's got those hypermotion quickcuts the same kind used in the remake of Thirteen Ghosts which at least knew how lame it was and was thus easier to take with tongue firmly in cheek. Perhaps using the gore factor which there isn't much of Shaun of the Dead was gorier than this to patch up some gaping 747size holes in the plot Saw cheerfully telegraphs the shock moments using some halfwayclever plot twists that almost make sense at the time but on second thoughtwhat a mess.Anyway here's the setup A kid named Adam Leigh Whannell who wrote the script wakes up in a nasty old bathroom chained to a huge pipe in the wall. Opposite him is Dr. Lawrence Gordon Elwes similarly chained and even more confused. Between them lay a dead man his head apparently halfblown away holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other. It's all revealed to be the work of the Jigsaw Killer who devises unique lifeordeath scenarios for unsuspecting flawed folk to work their way out of or die. Set this in a giant threedimensional Rubik's Cube and you have the much more intriguing Cube set it in another unnamed city with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman hunting a deranged Biblenut you get Se7enWhannell has obviously seen and studied them both.So Adam and Dr. Gordon are trapped together for reasons that are calmly explained away in a series of flashbacks. The goal Gordon must kill Adam with whatever implements are at hand or else his wife and daughter will buy the farm. And yes in a toilet stall they find a couple of hacksaws.Nothing is what it seems of course and I have to report that I saw the final denouement coming from the first twenty minutes. The enigmatic Jigsaw Killer is a lot like the alien race out to destroy humanity in Independence Day faceless and just plain bad bad bad! Kevin Spacey's genuinely chilling John Doe from Se7en may have been a fairly onenote character but at least we were given reasons for his psychosisand what's more we believed them. Saw's killer is given a perfunctory motivation but it all rings as offkey as the acting.Firsttime director James Wan wastes Danny Glover as a cop obsessed with the case and his demise is a complete letdown. He delivers some nice gruesome moments but since I saw pun not really intended them coming they're not much more than Pavlovian audience buzzers. Judging by the general crowd reaction Saw will get plenty of word of mouth help from the high school set make a nice tidy little profit and since a sequel has already been announced old Jigsaw will likely be around torturing people for no apparent reason for some time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw is a film I was rooting for. It had the potential to be a grubby nasty eyesore of a film. But while it had gore and sadism in spades it also had horrible acting a terrible script and forgettable characters. Not even a man hacking off his own foot could make me overlook the tripe.Well having said that Cary Elwes hacking off his own foot did help somewhat but the scene rather than being traumatic was a laugh riot. You have hysterical direction you quickly cut from screaming man to screaming man  closeups of screaming men especially when you quickly go from one to another for some reason always cracks me up camp acting from Elwes throughout the film he chews the scenery but here he chews on his shirt and cut around the scene is a hilarious car chase between Danny Glover and the red herring bloke. The cumulative effect is mucho laughter.The car chase though I think of all of the funny things in the film was the funniest. It was possibly the most lowrent thing I've seen in recent cinema. And although I acknowledge the fact that the filmmakers were working on a paltry budget it still doesn't make it any less funny when you film grownmen pretending to drive stationary cars that are not so carefully given life by a bit of smoke and jittery camerawork and editing. Rearprojection would have looked a million times more convincing.Another budgetary giveaway was the car park that looked like it was filmed in a barn and which contained about five cars. I know you're meant to suspend your disbelief and if the film were good I'd be able to do that but when your film is ridiculous it's just another nail in the coffin.But sniping aside I do appreciate what the filmmakers have done with so little money. Although visually a ripoff of Seven it does look good and most of the effects are pretty decent. However I just wish they would have spent a bit more money on the script and cast someone anyone else in Elwes' role.Elwes is an actor who can get by just as long as he's not required to emote  he can just about have a normal conversation. But once he's got to express anger or sadness or love he's out of his depth. And so it is in Saw sometimes with spectacular results.My favourite Elwes moment is when he recognises Zep the red herring in a photo and starts shouting like the man is alive inside it. Yes if you shout loud enough the person in the photo WILL hear. That's true. But there's also the bit where the phone rings. He thinks it's Zep so he shouts at the phone with camp venom. But it's his wife so on a sixpence he changes into a doeeyed husband quivering with love and affection. Neither extreme is expressed in a believable way. But it doesn't help that Elwes has a weird thing he does with his voice. When he shouts he tries to boom like Brian Blessed but when he expresses sadness or regret he talks in a childlike voice almost like Joe Pasquale. It's a tad odd. And it makes his shooting of Adam bloody hysterical. You have to die. I'm sowwy. My family. But Danny Glover is almost as bad. He goes metal when his partner gets killed by the fiendish Jigsaw Killer and tries to apprehend him on his own. But Danny Glover's portrayal of madness only extends to lots of incomprehensible shouting  there's a brilliant bit where he runs out of bullets and charges the armed Zep while shouting Aaaaaaarrrggghhh!! But he does it again after the fight and as he runs out of the apartment to continue his pursuit. Aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!! And of course you then cut to the car chase and the foot cutting which makes the film so overripe in tone that the only result can be hilarity.But that's kind of a shame as the first half is pretty promising. I especially love the ingenious traps. My favourite is the razor wire. Suicidal man rips himself to shreds? Magnificent! And the scene where the woman had to stab the man and root through his guts had me cackling with delight. But I do have to admit that neither sequence disturbed me as it should. Indeed they both made me laugh. And this is purely because of how they were filmed. Large parts were speeded up to capture the frenzied emotions of the characters but it's a technique that always gives me the giggles. It's just so over the top and hysterical that rather than unsettle me it distances me from the grisly proceedings and makes me enjoy them in a way I'm sure the filmmakers didn't intend.And that goes for the whole film. I enjoyed it but not in the intended way. I was laughing at the camp acting jumping up and down with glee as men got torn to shreds in wire and rolling about when things went crazy at the end  Adam has a lot of fire in his belly for someone who just got shot.And the villain also garnered laughs. He dressed like a goth dig that robe and those gloves moaned like a goth and hated the world like a goth. In fact he probably was one. Wahwah I have cancer. Wahwah people don't appreciate their lives. Wahwah woe is me. I know most serial killers in films have BS reasons to justify their rampages but this man made a fine art of it. And he sure was nimble for a cancer patientand could keep still for long periods of timeand was remarkably indestructible. Ah but why apply logic to a film this silly? Just open your arms and let the shower of crap wash over you.".

If you are electrocuted your muscles should also contract  making you squeeze your finger.3. It's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people  one of them a doctor  not noticing that you aren't dead. Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier.4. Technically the killer did kill one of his victims  the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. If you poison someone that is murder.5. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes the doctor needed to be there but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something.Other than those things I would have given this movie a higher grade. The plot was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part  the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and soundtrack were very good but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund.".

Carey Elwes was extremely disappointing for such a seasoned actor. I mean this was suppose to be a scary movie and I couldn't help but laugh at the over dramatized way Elwes told Wannell he would send help to get him. Wannell's work wasn't nearly as bad and he's a newcomer. Overall this could have been a great movie given some better actors major script adjustment and WAY more than 18 days to shoot. I mean give me a break!!! You've got two guys chained at the ankle on either side of what appears to be a bathroom and a supposedly dead guy in the middle of the floor and you're telling me that neither of them one being a doctor notice that he's breathing?!?!?!? What did he do hold his breath for 8 hours?!?!?!?Comparing this movie to Se7en and Silence of the Lambs is just plain ridiculous. Sam Raimi did a better job with The Evil Dead his first time around.The only thing scary about this movie was the acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience. Ever rented a scary movie expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was cut poorly and jumped around too much making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly tiring to watch.Almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it scary and the situations hardly made it scary therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile. Even those were predictable.Not even the gore could've saved the plot and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller Se7en.Speaking of Se7en I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller believe me it is far from that.Oh did I mention poor acting? At first Cary Elwes seems makes a convincing performance however this completely deteriorates at the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter at this performance which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and too playedout although not as bad as the performance by Elwes and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the movie.The end of Saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it and that is what makes it a huge failure. It was an opportunity wasted and I have no clue as to why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to take roles in this movie.I am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it. It was definitely not worth the 4 and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with Elwes Whannell or James Wan. The big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I'll avoid the poor puns involving the title and just conclude with this don't watch this movie.".

	schema:headline " A dark fairytale";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I've been ignoring Korean films for too long because I've seen some good things coming from those regions lately. From the first time I laid eyes on the promotional artwork this films sparked some interest but I never bothered to pursue that interest. Luckily I finally did get around to seeing the film as this is right up my alley.Hansel and Gretel is many things and is being marketed as many more. Sadly some people try to tag this film to the Asian horror wave yet the film is pretty different in tone and execution. Some similar elements to KoreanAsian horror films are definitely present but in the end the film presents itself more like a darker fantasy.Comparing this film to others is not an easy thing. It reminded me of quite a few other films but never as a whole. The setup is somewhat similar to Calvaire the styling of the film has more than a little of Survive Style 5 and the atmosphere could've been borrowed from a Korean Burton. But none of those references seem sufficient to describe Hansel and Gretel. In the end it draws its unique flavor from mixing all these influences and making them its own.The film starts off like many Western films do. A guy in a car in a forest on a mountain road. Car crash anyone? But when EunSoo wakes up he sees a girl dressed up like Little Red Ridinghood. When he reaches her house he is confronted by a family of fairytale people but looking and acting a little off. From those first scenes there's already a pretty weird atmosphere present.The styling of the house and its inhabitants its absolutely lush with plenty of attention to detail. Colors are flying off the screen and even though the frame is filled with toys and other colorful objects the house is meticulously clean. It's these kind of things that help to establish the uneasy atmosphere from the start of the film.As the story progresses the tone becomes gradually darker as does the styling. The candycolors never really fade but are often overshadowed by darker tones. It takes a while to get a good grip on the story as more and more elements are introduced to the film and certainly not all of them fit well together from the start but about halfway through you should have a good idea of what the hell is going on.Visually this is a very consistent film with pretty awesome camera work and a great sense of color. Not unusual for Korean films but surprisingly the editing is not so intervening as to kill the atmosphere. There is plenty of time to admire all the visual sweetness which has been known to be otherwise in Korean cinema.The soundtrack too is effective and to the point. No high drama bombast to kill the atmosphere but good film music that aids the feel of the film. It's good to see that for a change the atmosphere of the film is kept consistent and is given room to develop itself. Something the film gratefully makes use of to crawl under your skin.While the revealing of the mystery is nothing too special and the film knows its share of typical Korean taboobreaking weirdness it's that very mysterious dark and fantasylike atmosphere that gives the film enough momentum to easily swing past these little imperfections. In the end Hansel and Gretel is a rather special experience that leaves a solid mark in the world of film.Rather than call it a horror film it's a dark fantasy mixed with drama and a touch of horror elements. The film is well acted looks extremely lush and flies by in no time. And while many parts seem influenced by other films the mix is completely unique and fresh. A very nice film and interesting take on fairy tale antics. 4.05.0".

	schema:reviewBody "Take one dark little fairytale and blend it in with some Asian horror sensibilities and you get this loosely based modern take on Hansel  Gretel. Truth is that the Hansel  Gretel theme is actually just a background for the film and not the whole story.The basic storyline centres around a man who following a car crash finds himself lost in the forest. Taken by a friendly young girl to her family's home he finds the family is living in a fantasy like house full of toys and nursery school imagery replacing the gingerbread makeup from the original tale. Obviously all isn't as it seems and escape is futile as the leading man finds that all roads out of the house through the forest seem to lead right back to it. The protagonists are the three children controlling the house and toying with those who enter it becoming the bane for our lead man as he tries his best to escape their ideal world.What is it all about? Well it's no fairy tale and is more a psychological horror tale. However it's very dark and even most adults will feel uncomfortable throughout much of it. That isn't to take away from the film as its meant to play with our preconceptions of the fairytale world. The story develops from fairytale to horror and then mixes in some serious social commentary. The story is captured with some incredible set pieces and settings whilst the actors all seem to fully suit their roles in this twisted little tale. Original and intriguing no matter how uncomfortable you may feel at points watching this early in the film it is worth watching to the end.Not all will love the ride on this merry go round but those who give it a chance to the denouement will find it intriguing and satisfying.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Hansel and Gretel story is a pretty dark fairy tale. This is basically a darker version with a similar concept but mainly different story overall. It's a dark horror movie with vivid and bright colors. The plot is about some guy who gets into a car accident and finds a young mysterious girl when he wakes up she soon takes him to her family home. Which is a very fairy tale like home even the inside of the home as well with bunch of sweets. Soon things start to get really creepy especially the 3 children one of them being especially annoying. The characters in this is pretty awkward at times but it doesn't take away from the movie but adds more mystery around it. The film is pretty clich at first and predictable but as the film goes on and on it gets pretty good and entertaining to some degree. And at least the mystery of what is going on kept me interested since I wanted to find out what is exactly going on. So the script is passable and is pretty decent but could have been stronger especially in the beginning where it started to become a bit dull and dragged out a bit as well. Despite some flaws there are still some good aspect in this movie as well. The set up is done pretty well and the cinematography is beautiful to look at at times.710".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hansel  Gretel";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought I'd foam in the mouth with yet another demonic kid horror movie given the countless of such genre movies out there which set out to make innocent looking kids harbour plenty of ill intention behind them. But I thought the original Hansel and Gretel fairy tale was quite dark too especially with the ending. You know the kids who come to know of this gingerbread house where everything and anything can be eaten to fill their empty stomachs only to culminate in their stuffing of the owner into a large stove so that they can take possession of the property to live and eat happily ever after.OK so if you believe my synopsis of the fairy tale then you like me probably saw what many others don't. Anyway this Korean movie doesn't come close only remotely in a certain scene and the borrowing of the English title. The gingerbread house got replaced with a nice looking and inedible cottage in the middle of lush forest though the amount of artificially coloured food still remains the same. Instead of two kids we get three who seem happy on the outside but inside harbours some deep dark and unseen secrets.

Heck even the television's unplugged yet the only programme available is some really sadistic cartoon involving a rabbit and a bear.The story might at first seem very ordinary though bleak but grew from strength to strength as it went on nevermind weak attempts at trying to elicit some cheap scares. I thought its basis of a story was strong even though it did have a very screwed up version of the fairy tale most of us probably already know about. The set designs and art direction were all beautiful to look at and most times you'll shift your focus to admiring the sets when events start to get repetitive with EunSoo's attempts to get out of the house and the enchanted forest in more than 4 attempts of course thwarted each time. Supporting characters like the adults who come and go at first might make you scratch your head but let that be the least of your worries because once Santa Claus came visiting you'll have to suspend your disbelief otherwise this movie wouldn't work.Hansel and Gretel's a pretty decent thriller a mix of groundhogdayness with the usual trappings of cheap horror movies boosted though by its rich production values. Themes of wanting to belong and nonreciprocated friendship together with major trust issues lift its plain storyline and all round fine acting by the kids who will at first scare you and then lead you to want to give them all a hug.".

	onyx:emotionText "I thought I'd foam in the mouth with yet another demonic kid horror movie given the countless of such genre movies out there which set out to make innocent looking kids harbour plenty of ill intention behind them. But I thought the original Hansel and Gretel fairy tale was quite dark too especially with the ending. You know the kids who come to know of this gingerbread house where everything and anything can be eaten to fill their empty stomachs only to culminate in their stuffing of the owner into a large stove so that they can take possession of the property to live and eat happily ever after.OK so if you believe my synopsis of the fairy tale then you like me probably saw what many others don't. Anyway this Korean movie doesn't come close only remotely in a certain scene and the borrowing of the English title. The gingerbread house got replaced with a nice looking and inedible cottage in the middle of lush forest though the amount of artificially coloured food still remains the same. Instead of two kids we get three who seem happy on the outside but inside harbours some deep dark and unseen secrets.

It is therefore no surprise that Hansel and Gretel continues the tradition of outstanding Asian Horror film with its aim to entertain the audience with a good story as well as shocks. There have been many similarities with this film to some of Guillermo Del Toro's work such as Pan's Labyrinth or The Orphanage. Initially these comparisons seem to be wide of the mark but as the last third of the film unravels the similarities become clearer. In fact it is in this final third that the film is at its strongest as things start to come together and the final twists are revealed. All of the actors are brilliant particularly the three youngsters at the heart of the story. They are very convincing in their roles and add some emotional weight to the film.Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to see an original story that is full of imagination.

Its been compared to Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage and while I haven't seen the Orphanage yet I would say that this would make a hell of a double feature with Pan and perhaps even People Under the Stairs. It is ultimately a fairy tale and not a horror movie its very creepy and doesn't have really big scares and on that level it scores big points.You can pretty much click off the typical fairy tale elements and see that they are all working here and no you won't do it while you're watchingthough you will be aware that this is not a typical horror film To be certain it did remind me of other films but at the same time it bends them to its own end. The film also has several really good characters that lift the film to a higher level. The performances are across the board excellent with any flaws the result of the writing.I liked the film a great deal and I am both happy and unhappy that I was interrupted in my viewing by a friend because the end left me rocked in both a good way and a bad way. I can't imagine how I would have reacted had the call not come since as is I'm a tad unsettled which should not imply anything either way since the impact was emotional I'm not sure which way it left me.Worth a look if you get the chance and like dark fairy tale type stories.Not sure of the rating I have to sit on this one a while.Its at least a 7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Hansel  Gretel took me by surprise in a good way. I was expecting a sick film about a man who gets taken hostage by a murdering cannibalistic family and he had to escape. I should've known more being that the film is Korean and the way in which they make films is often character driven complex and with heart. Hansel  Gretel provides all three. The title is a mere intelligent reference to the Grimm's story it's not simply a retelling but a fairytale of its own although I wouldn't go telling this story to any kids!The film is beautifully shot. In the beginning the colours are extremely bright and vivid giving the film an unnatural quality so that you know that there's something wrong. However the colours and props gradually decrease as we find out the many secrets as it leads up to a big twist at the end that I'm sure you will never see coming. What makes the film so gripping and worthy of its two hour running time is that it's highly unpredictable. When you think the films going one way it completely changes direction in a similar way to Martyrs although not that harrowing! Hansel  Gretel is jampacked Nathan's jam in my own fairytale with twists and turns so there's hardly ever a dull moment.Although things start to become repetitious when our hero keeps going into the woods and getting lost so going back to the house it's there for a reason so that we start to feel as fed up and trapped as he does There's a great atmosphere of isolation and the film is incredibly eerie at times with the creepy children. Hollywood could never make a film like this because they lack the imagination and creativity that makes Hansel  Gretel so great. Many people may not totally get the fantasy element but I see it important as it makes the film become its own fairytale and also leaves a lot of things up to interpretation and I like that sense of ambiguity.The protagonist is also a very likable characterbeing that he's the only normal one in the whole film. We uncover the mysteries with him putting the audience in his shoes makes the film even more compelling. The screenplay is very clever and explores extremely dark and brave areas towards the end. It makes you sympathise for the characters and almost changes into a completely different genre which is very original.Hansel  Gretel can sit up there with all the other great Korean films I have yet to see a bad one! It also makes a nice change to do something different rather than the usual but brilliant bloody revenge horrorthrillers. It's highly original and compelling with a big heart. It's scary and heartfelt exactly when it needs to be with a lot of questions that can be answered in very different ways. It's eerily directed and never boring. You'll care as much as our hero about uncovering the secrets in the strange house! I think that it deserves to be seen by much more people. Luckily I caught it on Film4 having never even heard of it before!".

	schema:reviewBody "A disappointingly mundane dark fairytale that takes the original storyline and transforms it into a modernday offering about child abuse the nuclear family dependence and obsession. In truth HANSEL  GRETEL bears little resemblance to the story we know of old acknowledging it stylistically rather than via the narrative.The film is billed as a horror movie but in truth it isn't. There are very few moments of violence or tension and these are glossed over rather quickly. Instead the film prefers to depict 'happy family' scenes and hint at darkness behind the light rather than focusing on anything specific. Yes there are a series of supernatural events within the movie that could also help define it as fantasy but again these are dealt with in hurried glimpses rather than focused upon.Sadly what we're left with is a series of repetitive events that go on and on for far too long. From the outset it's apparent that EunSoo can't leave the idyllic woodland location he's trapped in and yet a good half of the running time is about his endless attempts to escape. Then there are intriguing subplots that are never fully developed such as the one featuring a wouldbe serial killer. The film ends up relying on huge chunks of exposition plonked in towards the end in an effort to explain things and undigested back story never makes for a dramatically satisfying movie.Indeed you can't fault the calibre of acting on offer  especially from those great child actors  or indeed the technical perfection behind the scenes. But HANSEL  GRETEL's story feels bloated and unfocused and needed the hand of seasoned professional to turn it into something better than it is.".

In truth HANSEL  GRETEL bears little resemblance to the story we know of old acknowledging it stylistically rather than via the narrative.The film is billed as a horror movie but in truth it isn't. There are very few moments of violence or tension and these are glossed over rather quickly. Instead the film prefers to depict 'happy family' scenes and hint at darkness behind the light rather than focusing on anything specific. Yes there are a series of supernatural events within the movie that could also help define it as fantasy but again these are dealt with in hurried glimpses rather than focused upon.Sadly what we're left with is a series of repetitive events that go on and on for far too long. From the outset it's apparent that EunSoo can't leave the idyllic woodland location he's trapped in and yet a good half of the running time is about his endless attempts to escape. Then there are intriguing subplots that are never fully developed such as the one featuring a wouldbe serial killer. The film ends up relying on huge chunks of exposition plonked in towards the end in an effort to explain things and undigested back story never makes for a dramatically satisfying movie.Indeed you can't fault the calibre of acting on offer  especially from those great child actors  or indeed the technical perfection behind the scenes. But HANSEL  GRETEL's story feels bloated and unfocused and needed the hand of seasoned professional to turn it into something better than it is.";

No this isn't really a story about two children being taken in by a witch. Quite the opposite in fact and despite being led to believe by the title that you've heard this story before and are now only going to experience a slight variation you're in for something very different from the typical Asian horror horror film. None of that Ringu longhaired ghost nonsense here. Where the Koreans have recently excelled its in their need to produce something new and not fall back into recent genre trends. This film is no different. You're not entirely certain who to root for until the second major plot point you're not sure of the victims nor the victimizers. More so you're not sure how you might arrive at a happy ending or a simple solution. There is none in sight.When all is said and done the story of a man surviving a car accident and happening upon a house and an eccentric family in the deep woods don't worry they're not gonna pull a Sixth Sense on you you realize you experienced the Korean equivalent of Pan's Labyrinth a story about children and their strange capacity to realize real evil through the filter of their imaginations don't worry they're not gonna pull a Bridge to Terabithia on you either.".

The plot is good even for a movie junkie like me it is hard to tell the ending which will keep you going to the end.The Bad I said some of the casts are good unfortunately some are not especially the main cast whose expression at many scenes are blank. Some of the thrill parts are not thrilling enough and it can get a bit slow but overall still watchable. Also this movie can be much better and dramatic if the siblings are only the sisters.Conclusion I have to say this movie is really the Asian version of Pan's Labyrinth. Of course like almost all Asian movies the visual effect cannot match those of Hollywood. If you like Pan's Labyrinth the you should watch this. Hope this info is not spoiler to you.

It feels like there's some kind of a film school there which still allows their filmmakers to work freely on the ideas side. The technical and imagery side of this cinema is great some of the best photography i've seen recently comes from korean films.This one could actually have been something powerful it was ambitious but it fails to me.Basically it tries to be a mix of three elements suspensehorror mapped into children's drama mapped into Grimm's brothers tale..it is horror because we have a designated viewer someone who represents us is the story. His fears are passed onto us because what happens to him we feel it ourselves or are supposed to. We have a house not specially interesting on the spatial side except for the attic. That house is explored by the main character and we explore it with him and we fear all the way. Yet none of the common things of true horror films occur and we feel heavy all the way suspenseful without being 'scared'. So it's half the way between horror and suspense. This proximity to a genre is a vessel in which the other elements are inserted. It's interesting the safety that the 'genre' gives filmmakers. They know they can rely on certain elements that will give audiences several references that won't make them feel lost. It may be a trick for lesser filmmakers to secure they make an understandable film or it may be a safety net that allows them to do something bigger on the eye or narrative. This one i think was supposed to be on the second case..there is a past to those children. Later in the film we come to understand that's what the thing is all about. They're family past the whole thing about them not growing up because of the mistreatments adults gave them is the stuff that feels and gives sense to the narrative. So we are intended to be given a twist as we fall for the children's motivations and start facing them as victims instead of devils..Hansel  Gretel the tale structures loosely the narrative. The horror elements give the mood establish a genre the Grimm's story supports the visual elements and some plot elements. More important it is a story the key to the film. Notice that the main character our designated protagonist gets free when he burns the story.So this is all about narrative over layering and mixing narrative threads. We have three lines explore and three children puppeteers. Get it? The thing is i didn't connect to the thing the film is intellectually ambitious but failed to reach me. I suppose it had a lot to do with pacing and narrative balance. The bits are disconnected i thing some serious revision and editing and general rhythm would have made miracles here.The photography is intense and highly competent though not much in the mood of what we see. Still it's a high mark for korean cinema. Lucky those directors for having such artistic values at their services.My opinion 25 httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com FantasPorto 2009".

Brilliant.When he wakes up again it is night and Young Hee has found him. She has a lantern seems kindly disposed toward him and leads him to a place to stay the 'House of Happy Children.' It is lovely inside and looks like everyday is Christmas. They patch up his more major wounds from the accident.EunSoo meets Young Hee's mother father younger sister and older brother Manbok. He wakes up in a room full of toys and Christmas gadgets. The family treats him to a breakfast of sweets claiming that they had already eaten. A bit suspicious perhaps?EunSoo looks for a way out on the first day. He does not find it and the day seems woefully short. The family of five and EunSoo have some strange discussions.On the second day EunSoo awakes to find the parents gone. They left him a note asking him to take care of the children. He does for a bit but then tries to make it to town. He fails again. He thought he saw someone in the woods the children deny this as a possibility. The phone is still out how would they call to ask for it to be fixed? EunSoo continues hearing unexplained bumps and the like. Then there seems to be something in the attic. When examined with a torch though the attic only contains more children's toys. After expressing his dismay Manbok gives him a map.On the third day he goes exploring using the map. He meets another couple from the road they insist on going to the house despite his advice against. He eventually returns rather than die in the snow and cold. The new couple turn out to be Christians which adds a different layer.The snow continues on the fourth day and EunSoo's desperation rises. He finds a television that still runs with the power cord not plugged in. This does not help.EunSoo finds a fairy tale book and the boy gets cross with him for touching it. Three of the book's characters had their faces cut out and replaced with cut out photo pieces of the three children. He discovers the 'mother' from the initial meeting in the attic. She shows him that the attic can be a limitless maze rather like the surrounding forest.He has a long metaphorical talk with the three children. He tells an engaging fairly tale then weaves himself into it as the prince who must return to his pregnant princess. Manbok however concludes the tale by telling EunSoo they will cut off his arms and legs so that he is unable to leave. Great stuff.The 'Christian' woman turns out to be a thief and the man someone who wants to rule the roost with an iron biblethumping fist. EunSoo warns him against this but he physically attacks in return. Yet another monster great.EunSoo gears up to try to escape again this time leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. Then he discovers that the meat in the refrigerator is from the first 'father' that he met. So the kids are carnivorous fairies or demons or whatever.The layering keeps getting deeper for EunSoo as he makes his way through more documents in the attic. He finds orphanage birth records for the three children from 1959 1960 1965. Apparently they were frozen in time somehow except perhaps for Young Hee who looks 47 in one of the rooms. He makes another attempt to escape and fails again stopping just short of a cliff edge overlooking and ocean.The Christian man has a confrontation with the children. He has a certain box and has gagged the younger girl. He and Manbok share the act of patricide. Manbok knocks the man out using magic. The youngest whines about all parents being the same that is rotten.So that's it. Manbok killed his father and decided that all bad adults need to be punished like the punishment in Hansel and Gretel. He shows EunSoo the small book of line drawings of Hansel and Gretel. The children recount more of the past regarding the depths of the 'bad adults' problem. It is a nasty story but the ultimate culprit in the piece is an amusing choice.Can EunSoo help break the obsession the lock on this delusion? The children want him to stay forever but he feels obligated to be with his own child yet to be born and Hae Young his child's mother.ScoresCinematography 510 For the introduction and credits jerky camera movement keyhole sized vignette filters with poor focus on multiple badly done overlaid images. Even after this terrible beginning the jerky camera movements continue accompanied by soft focus and 'who cares?' framing. The over saturated colors are pleasantly chosen at least.Sound 1010 As good as the visuals are bad.Acting 1010 Rather good. I liked the child actors better than I thought I would.Screenplay 910 A bit long but a good story told through the movie.".

Manbok however concludes the tale by telling EunSoo they will cut off his arms and legs so that he is unable to leave. Great stuff.The 'Christian' woman turns out to be a thief and the man someone who wants to rule the roost with an iron biblethumping fist. EunSoo warns him against this but he physically attacks in return. Yet another monster great.EunSoo gears up to try to escape again this time leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. Then he discovers that the meat in the refrigerator is from the first 'father' that he met. So the kids are carnivorous fairies or demons or whatever.The layering keeps getting deeper for EunSoo as he makes his way through more documents in the attic. He finds orphanage birth records for the three children from 1959 1960 1965. Apparently they were frozen in time somehow except perhaps for Young Hee who looks 47 in one of the rooms. He makes another attempt to escape and fails again stopping just short of a cliff edge overlooking and ocean.The Christian man has a confrontation with the children. He has a certain box and has gagged the younger girl. He and Manbok share the act of patricide. Manbok knocks the man out using magic. The youngest whines about all parents being the same that is rotten.So that's it. Manbok killed his father and decided that all bad adults need to be punished like the punishment in Hansel and Gretel. He shows EunSoo the small book of line drawings of Hansel and Gretel. The children recount more of the past regarding the depths of the 'bad adults' problem. It is a nasty story but the ultimate culprit in the piece is an amusing choice.Can EunSoo help break the obsession the lock on this delusion? The children want him to stay forever but he feels obligated to be with his own child yet to be born and Hae Young his child's mother.ScoresCinematography 510 For the introduction and credits jerky camera movement keyhole sized vignette filters with poor focus on multiple badly done overlaid images. Even after this terrible beginning the jerky camera movements continue accompanied by soft focus and 'who cares?' framing. The over saturated colors are pleasantly chosen at least.Sound 1010 As good as the visuals are bad.Acting 1010 Rather good. I liked the child actors better than I thought I would.Screenplay 910 A bit long but a good story told through the movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "This contemporary movie is another little imaginative masterpiece coming from South Korea that doesn't stop to bring fresh ideas to the film industry. This particular film is a modern adaption slightly inspired by the world famous German fairytale Hnsel und Gretel.The mysterious story kicks off surprisingly quickly. Young salesman EunSoo is on the road to visit his sick mother and has an argument with his pregnant girlfriend on his cell phone when he suddenly has an accident and temporarily loses conscience. As he awakens he meets a young and warm hearted girl that leads him through a deep forest and to an old house where she lives with her dynamic younger sister and a wary young boy. They do live in isolation with two adults and seem to have everything they need to be happy they have a big selection of toys a wonderful garden and many candies for breakfast. EunSoo soon realizes that the adults are not the kid's parents as they quickly go away and leave him alone with the three kids. EunSoo establishes a confident relationship with the three children but he soon realizes that they are not like other kids. They do everything to keep him in the house and there seems to be no way out to civilization through the strange woods. When another strange couple gets lost and comes to the house the tension slowly rises between all residents. EunSoo finds also out that the two adults from the beginning didn't make it through the woods and encountered a series of fateful events. But as EunSoo realizes that the three seemingly innocent children have been through unspeakable events in their early childhood he realizes that he needs to find out their most disturbing secrets and to face his own tragic fate to get out of the forest.Despite a more or less predictable story line the film convinces on many other levels. First of all it features many stunning images sometimes colourful and enchanting but dark and frightening at other moments. The costumes decorations and special effects relate this film to the fantasy genre first but the movie also includes some important portions of the drama genre and some minor horror elements. The creative artwork is definitely worthy to borrow the name of a fascinating old fairytale.Another strong point is without the glimpse of a doubt the solid acting. Especially the three children play their roles close to perfection. They act like real children but at the same time they have some strangely mature behaviours and one is never all to sure if these three mysterious kids are angels demons or both of it until the end.The tension in this atmospheric movie rises more and more and features many diversified cinematic elements such as flashbacks or moments when scenes of past and presence happen on a parallel level until a certain climax. The movie gets more emotional but also tension filled towards the end while the ending is as enchanting and well catalysed as the opening scene.In the end any fan of imaginative fantasy movies fairy tales in general and contemporary South Korean cinema shouldn't miss this movie. It has this certain magic mood features numerous solid ideas and has no notable lengths. It's clearly not the best movie coming from this fascinating country but still easily in the top ten of the best South Korean movies of the last decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "This chiller opens with salesman EunSoo driving through a forest while talking to his pregnant girlfriend on the phone he is telling her how he must visit his sick mother when he crashes. When he regains consciousness he is deep in the forest being helped by a girl wearing a white dress and a bright red shawl she takes him to her home. It is deep in the forest there is something strange about it though everything is brightly coloured and it looks just a little too perfect. We learn that the girl is called Younghee and she has two siblings older brother Manbok and younger sister Jung Soon. He also meets there parents who invite him to stay the night. The next day he leaves but finds it quickly gets dark and he finds himself back at the house. That night he hears the parents arguing and in the morning there is no sign of them just a note saying that they have done away for a while asking him to look after the children. The longer he stays there the more he realises there is something very strange about the house and the children and that anybody who tries to leave or upsets them is in grave danger.This film is a delightfully chilling reversal of the famous fairytale as he it is the children who present the danger to an adult lost in the woods. At first it is impossible to tell whether they are genuinely malevolent or just want to find an adult they can trust who won't abandon them. Many horror films rely on the dark and lots of jumps to keep the viewer on edge but here it is the excessively bright palette that makes everything seem slightly wrong and there is very little actual violence. What violence there is is somewhat disturbing though as the victims are helpless children. The acting is pretty solid although I had to rely on the subtitles to understand what the characters were saying. If you want to be scared this probably isn't the film for you but if you want something that might give you goosebumps then give it a go!".

As the story slowly unfoldsand the truth reveals itself it becomes so shockingand incredulousthat shocks the faint of heart. My deeper thoughts on this movie was how the innocence of childrenand their belief in anything. The well being of children when the most basic needs such as lovekindnessand respect is given to themhow healthy they become. And when those simple things are denied the outcome becomes sad. I am a motherand perhaps that was why I was so affectedbut I can't help but think how anyone would be affected. the story was told so beautifully that I was haunted long after it was over.

I shed a few tears by the films end and was thinking about it for days afterward.It's a heck of a debut from Yang Ik Joon who wrote directed produced and takes the lead role as well.Joon plays a small time hooddebt collector who doesn't mess about with customers who owe money. No one is safe it seems from his fists or his foul mouth not even his nephew. A chance meeting with a high school student results in an unlikely friendship. We learn more about both characters as the film builds momentum. Suffice to say that their main link is both being exposed to domestic violence.Joon fleshes out the story and gives all characters a chance to shine. The acting is first rate as is the screenplay which apparently is autobiographical.Anyone easily upset by violence or profanity would be well advised to give this one a miss.I hope it finds an audience and gets a wide release. I certainly look forward to more films in the future from this exciting young directorwriteractor.".

	onyx:emotionText "Out of the ten or so films I have seen so far at this years Sydney Film Festival this one effected me the most. I shed a few tears by the films end and was thinking about it for days afterward.It's a heck of a debut from Yang Ik Joon who wrote directed produced and takes the lead role as well.Joon plays a small time hooddebt collector who doesn't mess about with customers who owe money. No one is safe it seems from his fists or his foul mouth not even his nephew. A chance meeting with a high school student results in an unlikely friendship. We learn more about both characters as the film builds momentum. Suffice to say that their main link is both being exposed to domestic violence.Joon fleshes out the story and gives all characters a chance to shine. The acting is first rate as is the screenplay which apparently is autobiographical.Anyone easily upset by violence or profanity would be well advised to give this one a miss.I hope it finds an audience and gets a wide release. I certainly look forward to more films in the future from this exciting young directorwriteractor.";

I found the movie and it's engaging storyline to be very powerful. The audience and I laughed at the dark humour contained within then cried as the eventuality of the plot is brought to bear.For those that can stomach the violence I highly recommend finding this film to view. The movie takes place in a world that most of us are simply not willing to face however the issues presented therein relating to abuse are very important and very relevant.Every action has consequence and truly each of our lives glow so bright before we fade.I hope that one day Breathless Ddongpari can be given a Region 1 DVD release so that I may purchase and watch again.".

The worldwide success and broad critical acclaim of Park Chanwook revenge flicks filled with gore and stylised perversity overshadowed the diversity of one of the most productive and inventive national film industries to create a stereotypical subgenre the extreme Korean thriller. Thematically Breathless does not seem to disappoint the viewer's expectation from the opening frame to the last scene the film is relentlessly violent  but its depiction and meaning could not be more remote to Park Chanwook's universe. YangIk Jook the director who also displays an impressive intensity in the leading role of his first feature opts for a naturalistic approach to filming  all closeups simple shots and handheld camera  light years from the complicated westernised postFight Club aesthetic of Park's vengeance trilogy. The epitome of Park ChanWook's visual style when dealing with violence can be found in Old Boy with the infamous brawl in the jail corridor where the lone hero overcomes one by one all his attackers in a virtuoso trackingshot directly inspired by the beat'emup video games. Violence here is unreal just fun  like in a Tarantino movie. In contrast Sang hoon the main protagonist of Breathless a debt collector spending his days beating to a pulp every single human being in sight doesn't even know what a Playstation is which he actually calls a Playshit until he agrees to buy one to his nephew in a rare display of kindness. In a film saturated with symbols and totemic items western child toys knifes phones hammers the introduction of the Playstation can be read as a departure from this insensitive immature and virtual approach to the issue that is violence and more specifically in Breatless' case domestic violence. A moral tale about domestic violence and its consequences the film reproduces the cyclical nature of child abuse. The bullied child becomes the bully the victimised mother produces a traumatised daughter a beating follows another beating and so on. This makes the film structurally repetitive and quite predictable but remarkably it also gives a forceful depth to the directors' hardhitting argument about the responsibility that victims have in perpetuating the cycle originated by their tormentors. After an uncompromising first hour letting the viewer astonished and weary of YangIk Jook shock and awe approach the director suddenly introduces a sentimental edge to Breathless with an unexpected touching montage of the two main characters the thug and the high school girl taking the gangster's nephew to the fair where he can at last be a child again. This passage with its cheesy oriental music is very reminiscent of Takeshi's Kitano similarly tender moments in his romantic gangster chronicles. This is also the only time along with another pivotal twist taking place later on in the film the father's suicide attempt that YangIk Jook uses mood music  the rest of the soundtrack containing only diegetic sounds of incessant kicking punching slapping and screaming noises which provide like a percussion set the internal rhythm of the film.Littered with more swear words than a vintage Scorsese epic Breathless whose original title Ddjongpari could be translated flyshit is also a study of the social alienation that comes with the lack of education that often originates in the trauma of child abuse its main characters don't have the words to express their frustrations but only their fists and can only mimic what they have witnessed. Even marks of affections are sent through playfighting SangHoon and his nephew or verbal abuse SangHoon and the adolescent girl he calls crazy bitch. School education is regarded as important by all characters the wannabe gangsters are always asked if they graduated from highschool by the mob boss but remains a vacuous distant superficial dream alien to their world of poverty and violence. The ending works superbly in a series of symmetrical narrative motifs leaving room for hope as seen in the concluding flashforward. The transformation of Sanghoon is brutally quick but remains believable. A martyr of child abuse his will to change his ways and break the cycle will eventually kill him but save his family. It is a powerful conclusion to an overly brutal film that leave bruises like a punch in the face but also handles its gentle moments with a disarming sincerity.More film reviews at ggendron.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Breathless will probably garner comparisons to early Scorsese considering the subject matter. It is not that good but neither is it that derivative. If anything it favorably reminded me of the later TV work of Alan Clarke. Despite the summary above it is not about characters seeking redemption but family and solace from a cycle of criminal abuse fueled by misplaced ancestral reverence. Without giving away the end it is more about insight gained by sacrifice that plays upon cyclical reincarnation themes than a solitary quest towards forgiveness.The multitalented Yang IkJoon does a great job portraying a man so damaged that he expresses affection for a child by repeatedly shoving his head and calling him a bastard. Whether you find it disturbing or funny the gradual manner in which the characters' darker and more intimate aspects are revealed is excellent.Instead of credulous explication backstory or flashbacks the relationships emerge out of frankly rude and often violent interactions which also advance the plot. I might have had a few gripes about the cinematography especially in relation to scenes of violence. I kind of expected a bit more from Yang IkJoon in this regard.

It's clearly a heartfelt project from IkJoon Yang who wrote and directed as well as taking the starring role. Yang is excellent in all three capacities.With a constantly profane script a gritty level of realism throughout and an entire lack of sentimentality BREATHLESS is a thoroughly engaging piece of realist cinema. It has a cinema verite look about it taking place on mean and rundown streets and if some viewers find it depressing then that's because it strives to reflect real life rather than movie fantasy.Violence  in the form of beatings and slappings  comes thick and fast and there's so much of it that the viewer soon becomes as desensitised as the central characters so that the latest punishment almost becomes expected. Yet the quality characterisations and the intermingling of lots of different characters' lives is handled expertly so that this is never less than riveting. It's a strong film indeed one that's tough to watch at times but once which explores the depths of the human condition that most movies dare not tread.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately some technical issues marred the supposedly powerful introduction where violence get unleashed by all characters on screen both physically and verbally. Clearly played from a DVD screener with the Showbox watermark the audio was left silent for the good part of some verbal barrage which to the prudish might seem like music to their ears.If there's one thing I learnt  have reinforced after the movie is how ubiquitous the Korean swear word which sounds phonetically like sheebal can actually be. It's more versatile than the English language's Fword and the Korean one can be used to describe a whole host of bodily parts both male and female with colourful adjectives strung together as well. Either that or the person subtitling the show has some really colourful imagination to tag some appropriate swear words of hisher own liking in order to spice up the dialogue for nonKorean speaking audiences.Breathless is almost like a oneman effort with Yang IkJune wearing a number of hats in producing writing directing and starring in the lead role of Songhoon a violent gangster who doesn't have to think twice when deciding to lay hands on his victims and insulting them concurrently with his foul mouth. He's a debt collector in a small outfit which he cofounded but finds more pleasure in being a field agent bringing along underlings whom he can abuse as well and show the ropes to in teaching the essence of collecting money and to show no mercy to those who cannot pay up.Most of the violence happen off screen though the aftermath is seldom shielded in order to elicit a response from the audience. It actually makes for a great 3D movie with objects flying all around and at the screen from furniture to fists and even spit and I enjoyed the many unintentionally comedic moments that IkJune effortlessly paints into his narrative despite the very negative elements of violence and language that pepper throughout and almost every character was left tainted by dishing out or be at the receiving end of bad signs or an uncouth mouth.I suppose the question here is and the issue that IkJune could have wanted to address is that of violence and domestic violence even if a circumstances of a tragedy would lead to impressionistic youths turning to violence as a means of release and addressing their emotions. Or more directly if being brought up in a violent environment would lead to the nurturing of violent tempers given the lack of proper role models and being unable to break out from the vicious circle as that painted in the film.Breathless may seem a little too long as it had attempted to give each character equal opportunity to shine from the schoolgirl that Songhoon befriends to his boss a young boy whom he takes as his own and his mother coupled with a protg in the making. It's quite the complete story serving as a cautionary tale and a statement of the neverending cycle but would have benefited from tightening up the pace a little and could have gone under 2 hours. That said however it did result in enough apathy given toward the characters here given the antiheroic stance they're all under and you'll buy into its story of redemption toward the last act and the fortification of the positive relationships that Songhoon had through his own violent ways brought together.".

	schema:headline " James Garner shines in highly agreeable western spoof";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is a funny goodnatured parody of classic westerns starring James Garner in the role he was born to play  the reluctant hero tackling crises with his wits not his fists.  You don't have to be familiar with western clichs to enjoy this film but those who are in on the jokes will find it especially rewarding.  Of course Mel Brooks' similar Blazing Saddles' is better remembered today but I feel that Support Your Local Sheriff!' is the more successful film.  It achieves its results through the writers' ingenuity and the actors' flawless timing and delivery as opposed to the riotous hitormiss gags of Brooks' film.Garner plays a drifter who is gradually making his way to Australia for no discernable reason.  He arrives in an unruly western town that's been through three sheriffs in the past two months and is now in desperate need of another.  The town council is not choosy and he is hired almost sight unseen.  Then he sees the jail  real nice but no bars for the cells.  He picks the most incompetent man in earshot Jack Elam for his deputy and sets about cleaning up the town.  Garner is adept at all the usual gun tricks and is in fact an expert marksman but he prefers to talk his way out of tight situations always getting the better of his intellectuallychallenged opponents.The real trouble begins when he arrests a whiny ruffian Bruce Dern for murder and books him in one of the cells without bars.  In the true western fashion his crotchety pop Walter Brennan and all his brothers ride into town to engineer a jailbreak.  What happens next would be criminal to reveal here except to say that it consists of one comic gem after another.Each line is written and delivered to perfection by a cast that seems to have been formed from a convention of old character actors.  Brennan is hilarious sending up his Old Man Clanton role from My Darling Clementine. His very presence in any western gives it a feel of authenticity but here he proves to be a good sport in spoofing one of his definitive parts. Elam Dern and Harry Morgan contribute priceless support and Joan Hackett is effective as Garner's most unorthodox love interest.  All this would be for naught however without Garner in the central role.  It calls for a very specific type of actor quickwitted sarcastic astute overly accommodating and not especially tough.  This is a tailormade role for Garner and he fills it in such a way that any other casting would be inconceivable.  Thanks to him the other performers and the droll clever screenplay the film hits all the right notes for a pleasant and genial western comedy.".

Although he is funny he's still the straight man to to all the town loonies. Bruce Dern and Jack Elam are over the top hilarious as a dimwitted bad guy and dimwitted town character respectively. Harry Morgan is as funny as he's ever been which is saying a lot considering his role in What Did You Do In The War Daddy? Walter Brennan is typically excellent in one of his later roles as the typically grump head of the bad guy's clan. Even the lesser roles such as Kathleen Freeman as a passerby are delightful.But I get sad every time I see the late Joan Hackett as the mayor's daughter the  madcap eccentric Prudy. She gets lovelier every time I see this. She's as beautiful as she is funny in this and she's a riot. She left us way too soon. I wish one of our revival houses would run this coupled with The Cheyanne Social Club another delightfully comic western from that great era in films.

It's a clever comedy that is perhaps a bit too anxious to please but can make you laugh all the same. The supporting actors are tremendous too. It's funny to see Dern play such a naif but Brennan has the best time of it. His expression when Garner sticks his finger in the barrel of Brennan's pistol is priceless.No scorpion fights no blownup trains no Italian dubbing or even Strother Martin.

	schema:reviewBody "Support Your Local Sheriff! is directed by Burt Kennedy and written by William Bowers. It stars James Garner Joan Hackett Walter Brennan Jack Elam Harry Morgan and Bruce Dern. Harry Stradling Jr. is the cinematographer and Jeff Alexander scores the music. The film is essentially a parody of a Western splinter that encompasses an iconoclastic new arrival in a troubled town who sets about taming it. Here it's James Garner as Jason McCullough who is on his way to Australia to make his fortune. Stopping over in an Old Western town for some rest a bite to eat and maybe earn some cash? McCullough is disgusted to find corruption and murder is rife. Showing a firm backbone and some nifty skills with a gun McCullough highly impresses the town dignitaries who offer him the position of Sheriff. A job he finally accepts and begins taming the town with his unconventional methods.Support Your Local Sheriff! Very much had time on its side when it was released. Interest in the Western as a genre had waned considerably with the advent of free television potentially ready to drive the final nails into the coffin. Four years earlier Cat Ballou had shown that a comedy Western in the 60s could be well received. While master craftsman Howard Hawks had parodied his own Rio Bravo a year after Cat Ballou with the well regarded El Dorado. Throw into the pot that James Garner had good comedic Western credentials behind him on account of his run in TV series Maverick 19571962 and it's evident that Messrs Kennedy  Bowers knew exactly what they were doing.Roger Ebert famously accused the makers of the film of being thieves not buying into the parody basis he hated the film and thought it just stole from other Western movies whilst being made in a TV show style. Well that's kind of the core of a parody movie is it not? Bowers  Kennedy have crafted a top dollar irreverent Oater embracing the clichs of many standard genre pics that had gone before itand then turning them upside down. While all the time with this cast of very knowing genre participants cloaking the picture with love and affection. It's not so much biting the hand that feeds you but more a tasteful appreciation of what was sometimes fed.Full of truly memorable scenes such as a jail without bars the film is immeasurably helped by the on fire cast. Garner deadpans it a treat and is charismatic into the bargain. As he goes about taming the town more by logic and suggestion than rapid gunfire he's a hero that's very easy to warm too. Hackett who owes the Western fan nothing after Will Penny is simply adorable as a bumbling rich girl quickly getting the hots for the new Sheriff. Morgan  Dern play it firmly with a glint in the eye and tongue in cheek and Brennan a godlike bastion of Western's is hilarious as the patriarch of the bullying Danby clan. But best of the bunch is Jack Elam The Far Country Vera Cruz Gunfight at the OK Corral who playing the town character somehow finds himself in spite of himself employed as the Sheriff's deputy turns in a lesson in visual and physical comedy. Fittingly it's Elam who closes the film out with a suitably knowing piece of smart.It lacks some great scenic photography and the score is a bit too much Keystone Coppery but really this is about the excellent script and the players bringing it to life. A Western comedy gem. 910".

Walter Brennan did a sort of parody on some of his other villainous characters still maintaining a good performance and still being a comical character without making any of the modern funny tactics such as acting out of the ordinary.That goes for the entire film.

	schema:reviewBody "The late sixties and early seventies were an extraordinary period for the comic western. Although not all western comedies were directed by Burt Kennedy some of the best of them were. Kennedy worked with some of the best if slightly aged Hollywood leading men who looked right at home on a western set. In James Garner Kennedy found his perfect leading man. Although Garner had done some really serious westerns like Duel at Diablo Hour of the Gun and A Man Called Sledge he was really at his best in comedy. The man who first became known to us on TV's Maverick was perfect for films like Support Your Local Sheriff.One element of the humor of Support Your Local Sheriff is lost on today's audience. Back in the day among the more conservative elements in America there was a backlash against protesters in the Sixties. The right wing kind of liked police using nightsticks on the heads of irate citizens. Three years before in New York City when Mayor Lindsay tried to put in an independent Civilian Review Board for the NYPD the Conservative Party of New York State and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association led a referendum campaign against it. The slogan of the campaign Support Your Local Police.Out west of course that means Support Your Local Sheriff. So as Kennedy spoofed the title it has a double meaning because in this film James Garner an amiable stranger who drifts into a mining boom town gets the job so he can earn enough money to get passage to Australia. And when he does need help the town council consisting of Mayor Harry Morgan Willis Bouchey Walter Burke and Henry Jones is convened in a secret meeting in the town pleasure palace.The only two people Garner can count on is Morgan's tomboy daughter Joan Hackett and Jack Elam who shovels horse waste product at the stable. Hackett patterns her role after Betty Hutton or Doris Day and a generation earlier they would have been in her part. Charlton Heston who worked with her in Will Penny said she was kind loving and talented and a great loss to acting at a young age.As for Jack Elam when he started in the Fifties he parlayed that blind eye of his into playing some of the most vicious psycho villains ever on screen. Look at him in such films as Rawhide and Kansas City Confidential and you can hardly believe it's the same actor. Starting in the Sixties Elam began playing more and more comic parts and he had a natural gift for comedy. No one thought more of that than Burt Kennedy who started using Elam in just about all his projects after Support Your Local Sheriff.The main villain in the piece is Walter Brennan in what turned out to be his last major theatrical film. He's the father of a trio of lunkhead sons one of whom Bruce Dern gets himself arrested for murder after Garner is made sheriff because Garner witnessed the killing. The rest of the film is Brennan trying to free Dern and calling in all kinds of reinforcements to do it.Best scene in the film Garner throwing rocks at a gunfighter instead of drawing down on him. Second best scene Garner disarming Brennan by sticking his finger in the barrel of the six shooter Brennan is pointing at him. Burt Kennedy had a great sense of humor.Support Your Local Sheriff is Burt Kennedy and James Garner at their best. They did another film Support Your Local Gunfighter which is not a sequel to this film but just as funny. Too bad they didn't team for more films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This comedy western skirts the edge of parody and never falls over the edgeI suggest thanks to the solid construction of the storyline by William Bowers. What I like about it as a writer is that it draws its humor from oneliners incharacter speeches actions reactions plans stories character confrontations satirical moments and ideas. The only nearparody element in the film that matters is the fantasticlevel ability of the sheriff played by James Garner to shoot a sixgun. In the storyline he is a man trying to earn his way to Australia a place which fascinates him. He comes to a town where gold has been discovered and finding the inflation of food prices going up faster than he can eat he takes a job a sheriff with meals provided despite what the town's councilors tell him about the fate of the last gentlemen to wear the badge. He is helped in a shooting situation by Jack Elam whom he takes on as a deputy since he knows he can trust him when the chips are down. He promptly loads him with all the dirty work and sets about taking care of his one prisoner a member of the murderous Danby family the youngest and dumbest. He pour a red line in paint across the floor of the ufinished jail cell leads Joe in and mentions that the red stain came from the last occupant instant jail is achieved. The remainder of the film consists of two strands of development. Old man Danby and his other sons the patriarch played by Walter Brennan tries to get his youngest out of jail and then to rid the town of the sheriff by hiring gunfighters to ventilate him And the sheriff in his odd fashion thwarts them and courts the Mayor's daughter played by Joan Hackett she is feisty lovely and lethal with weaponry. When the Danby's round up all their cowboys and make one final try for Joe the youngest played by Bruce Dern the sheriff ties him to a cannon and threatens to fire it thereby ending the shooting war the Danby's had begun. Inisisting it had never been loaded later to his team he sets it off and it destroys the local house of ill repute where the council had taken refuge. Surrendering to his fate the sheriff then marries Miss Prudie Hackett becomes governor and gives up on Australia while as he reports Elam becomes one of the most beloved characters in all of western folklore'. The film is shot as if the world were always full of sunlight it is colorfilled only a touch cynical around the edges of the dialogue and generally makes light of a solid western dramatic duel between a lawman and a gang of outlaws. Many viewers believe it to be one of the most hilarious of westerns myself among them. Veteran Burt Kennedy directed music was supplied by Jeff Alexander. The vivid full color cinematography was supplied by Harry Stradling Jr. art direction was done by Leroy A. Coleman and the very fine set decorations were the work of Hugh Hunt. Perfomers in this laughriot besides the excellent leads included Harry Morgan as the Mayor Henry Jones Willis Bouchey and Walter Burke as the town council with Kathleen Freeman Gene Evans Dick Peabody Dick Haynes Chubby Johnson John Milford and Tom Reese. Garner in my judgment offers one of his best performances in this film and Jack Elam did awardlevel comedy in this comedic offering. In a spinoff called Support Your Local Gunfighter director Kennedy tried to repeat thebasic elements so well used here but was much less successful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoof Western with magnificent starring duo as James Garner as a likable sheriff and Joan Hackett as femlib mayor's daughter  both of whom giving great lots of fun . In the old west a man becomes a sheriff just for the pay figuring he can decamp if things get tough. The film talks about a gambler just passing through who gets roped into being sheriff James Garner who finds his nemesis an old baron land Walter Brennan . One troubleshooting sheriff always puts his finger on it or in it  no wonder they call him  The fastest finger in the west . The sheriff cleans a lawless town in his own highly individual way and is helped by an inept deputy Jack Elam . In the end he uses ingenuity instead and gets to tame a lawless mining town against all odds . This wacky spoof is packed with mayhem  lots of silly laughters and great entertainment and fun . Most of the laughs and sight gags galore work acceptably well  humor is also bold and intelligent with a myriad of imaginative sketches . Demystified Western was one of a group of muchimitated which changed the concept of this particular genre each bent on disproving a popular myth  yet tinged with humor  spoof and combining with antiheroes  and the inevitable decadence protagonists . The formula deals to enhance the comics observations of the western originated on the decade 60 with the following filmmakers  Andrew McLagen and Burt Kennedy  fine director of this movie and a bit later on  Mel Brooks directed the indispensable Blazing saddles  a surrealist  extreme and grossout spoof with the ordinary bunch of loonies and loopies . Burt Kennedy directed similar Western blending comedy such as  Support your local gunfighter one of his better spoof Western  Support your local sheriff his highpoint  Dirty Dingus Mcgee  War Wagon and  The Good guys and bad guys . The picture is wonderfully amused and enjoyable with James Garner as a tough but sympathetic sheriff with his Maverick image who uses brains as well as brawny and guns . William Bowers's screenplay besides having more than its fair scraps of funny lines throws up rich personages . Thus  Walter Brennan makes a robustly likable characterization as well as Bruce Dern as a snide gunman and Harry Morgan as the Mayor . Special mention to Jack Elam as the old brawler clearly relishing his comic relief . Colorful cinematography rightly shot by excellent cameraman Harry Stradling  Burt Kennedy's usual . Jolly and agreeable musical score by Jeff Alexander .This very funny motion picture was well directed by Burt Kennedy . He initially was screenwriter  his initial effort Seven men from now 1956 was a superb western the first of the esteemed collaboration between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott. Kennedy wrote most of that series as well as a number of others for Batjac although it would be nearly 20 years before Wayne actually appeared in the film of a Kennedy script. In 1960 Kennedy got his first work as a filmmaker on a western The Canadians 1961 but it was a critical failure . He turned to television where he wrote and directed episodes of Lawman 1958 The Virginian  1962 and most notably Combat!1962. He returned to films in 1965 with the successful Te Canadians 1965 later producing and directing the pilot for the TV series of the same name. Support you local sheriff results to be one of his best Western . The film will appeal to absurd unruly  wacky Western comedy fans . This raucous Western spoof is a James Garner vehicle  if you like his particular performance you'll enjoy this one .".

	schema:headline " Comedy Western extraordinaire!";
	schema:reviewBody "Support Your Local Sheriff! is a superb comedy Western that seemed to give a real career boost to its star performer Mr. James Garner. Garner was the perfect choice for the role of Jason McCullough who is simply the greatest sheriff any town could ever hope to have. Jason seems amiable and mildmannered but he has very sharp senses and a witty intelligence. He can always predict when somebody will run afoul of the law and when disaster will strike and he can always tell without looking when an outlaw is trying to escape his jurisdiction. He takes care of one particular outlaw by simply tossing rocks at him as he flees! Jason's romantic interest is Prudy Perkins well played by Joan Hackett. Prudy is quite a spunky gal who just can't seem to give Jason a good first impression resulting in some embarrassing mishaps. The elderly Walter Brennan is terrific as the cranky Pa Danby and Henry Morgan is great as the friendly mayor Olly Perkins father of Prudy. And who could forget the superb Jack Elam as Jason's deputy Jake? Although he is uneasy about it at first Jake provides the perfect sidekick for Jason as he quickly develops a great rapport with the new sheriff and willingly becomes his deputy. Bruce Dern as Pa Danby's outlaw son Joe is quite laughable he may appear rough  tough on the exterior but his personality is very whiny  childish! In fact some of the funniest dialogue in the film centers around Joe being in jail Pa Danby and his two other sons Gene Evans and Dick Peabody are in a bar discussing how to break Joe out He stuck his finger in the end of your WHAT? Would you shut up! Everybody'll be lookin'! and What's a martyr? Oh I'm sorry. They didn't use words like that in the third grade did they?.On a personal note a dear friend of mine who passed away in March of 2005 made a cameo appearance in Support Your Local Sheriff! His name was Richard Hoyt. Richard portrayed the slender bad guy who walks up to Jake asking him for Jason's whereabouts upon spotting the sheriff exiting a hardware store this outlaw tries to gun him down but not in time! The part of Joe Danby was originally written for Richard but since director Burt Kennedy declared that Richard Hoyt was not a household name he gave the part to Bruce Dern and slated Richard for a cameo. Richard Hoyt was a man of many talents he was a singer actor painter dancer martial arts instructor counselor and overall a darn good entertainer. He lived his life to the fullest and declared that the kind of day you have is a choice you make. It shall therefore come to no surprise that I never watch Support Your Local Sheriff! without paying close attention to the special cameo appearance by a fine gentleman whom I have always admired and will always truly miss Dr. Richard Hoyt.".

James Garner is terrific as the levelheaded sheriff as quick with his wits as with a gun. Great character actor Jack Elam is lots of fun as his sidekick.

Because gold was recently discovered in a tacky and funny way at the beginning of the film there is a lot of violence. The last three sheriffs didn't lastso everyone expects the new sheriff James Garner to either be killed or run off like one of his predecessors.Garner plays a part that is very much like his character from Mavericka guy who uses his wits to win the day instead of brawn. Now this isn't to say that Garner can't shootin this movie he's an amazing shot. However being a bit lazy and pragmatic he usually finds a way to avoid the violence and STILL keep the town crimefree. Most of these ways are pretty funny I particularly liked the red paint scene and the film is a nice change of pace from the usual violent and brainless Western.This movie was so successful that it triggered a sequel that was exceptionally similarheck the name was even similar. In SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER the plot is pretty similar and so is the action so if you liked one movie you'll no doubt like the other. A good film that is more than just another formulaic Western.".

Most of these ways are pretty funny I particularly liked the red paint scene and the film is a nice change of pace from the usual violent and brainless Western.This movie was so successful that it triggered a sequel that was exceptionally similarheck the name was even similar. In SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL GUNFIGHTER the plot is pretty similar and so is the action so if you liked one movie you'll no doubt like the other. A good film that is more than just another formulaic Western.";

	schema:reviewBody "Support Your Local Sheriff! 1969 Starring James Garner on the rise and riding the new tide of interest in the revised western along with the great Spaghetti Westerns this is surpisingly nimble and good. It's vivid and cheerful and well written with flunny comebacks and a wry sense of absurdity. That's not to say it's a great movieit isn't The Good The Bad and the Ugly at allbut that it's fun like the best television of the time and with much higher production values. It reminded me of the slightly earlier A Big Hand for the Little Lady. Director Burt Kennedy was a writer more than a director at first but he didn't have a hand in the screennplay here though it is so sharp at times you wonder if there were some little adjustments as they went.  Garner is clearly the star here and he's handsome with that pleasant smile that made him famous and carries him through many scenes. Around him are some veteren character actors including the great Walter Brennan and they help overall even if they are sometimes caricatured a bit.  In truth the movie might have tipped into greatness with some more subtle direction getting the irony and silliness to have some style or weight somehow. There's a lot of talent here a fun idea for a story and excellent dialog. See it yes. Good enough that even the sequel Support Your Local Gunfighter with Kennedy and Garner both back in their slots and without an exclamation point is worth a casual look.".

	schema:reviewBody "What I like best about Support Your Local Sheriff! is that it is a true story that accurately depicts daily life in America especially the Western states like West Virginia Indiania and Detroit. This movie is full of valuable information for travelers and tourists from abroad.In every town in America two or three people get shot in gunfights in just about every saloon every day and that's before sundown. So it's important to know the rules of engagement You can't draw first. If you do and kill the other guy you could get yourself hanged. America's a very backward country we don't have the guillotine here. If you don't draw first of course you could be killed by the other guy. So a word of advice Don't cheat at poker.Now if you do get into a gunfight the first thing to do is make sure you have your gun strapped to your waist and in it's holster the holster tied to your leg. If you don't you could always try throwing rocks. Now just before you draw with your right hand lift your left shoulder and move your left arm. This will trick the other guy into drawing first so be ready to draw with your right hand. If lefthanded remember to reverse the feint. Oh and remember to put bullets in the gun. Sixshooters are handy but oldfashioned and of limited value when in a gunfight that's 20 against one. Then what you need is a canon or two. The movie provides just one of the many creative ways to use canons to restore law and order. So all you foreign travelers when you visit the United States your first stop on arrival should be to visit your friendly local armaments dealer and stock up on canon balls. Better yet make reservations ahead with Hertz RentoCanon that way you can return unused canon balls at the end of your trip if you have any and if you do return home in one piece.If you are just passing through on the way to Australia you can often pick up some pin money with a temporary gig as the local sheriff particularly in Fargo. Don't worry the townspeople will be there to help out when the going gets rough.I'm so glad director Burt Kennedy did such a wonderful job of capturing the true spirit of America in this film. So all you Brits and Spaniards and Canadians come on over. You too can strike it rich and find your very own gold mine. Provided you're armed to the teeth and have plenty of firepower.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another nice Raj Kapoor movie directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee.The story is about Rajkumar Raj Kapoor an unemployed honest painter who lives in a rented room to Mrs. D'Sa Lalita Pawaar. He never pays his rent and though Mrs. D'Sa gets annoyed she treats him like her son.On his way to finding a job Raj bumps into Aarthi Nutan who was climbing over a wall to get out of her boring college class. Then he goes to his job interview which is at a restaurant. He checks the daal lentils he finds a roach floating at the top. He reports this by screaming it out to everyone at the restaurant...which makes the manager very annoyed. Raj's honesty wasn't getting him anywhere he gets kicked out.He goes home only to make Mrs. D'Sa mad. The next day he bumps in to Aarthi again in a chain reaction biking crash lol. Aarthi tells him that her name is Aasha. But Aasha Shuba Khote is actually Aarthi's naukrani...even though they're like sisters. Aarthi continues to pretend that she herself is the naukrani. She invites Raj to paint a picture at her malkin's house the next day. Raj readily agrees.The next day Aarthi keeps on making up stories about her poorness saying that her mom was really sick and that's why she's working at the mansion. He gets paid 1000 rupees for his work but because of his kind heart he gives it all back to Aarthi...saying that it would come in handy for her sick mother.Which makes Aarthi like him all the more.He goes back home again with no pay to give Mrs. D'Sa. After a long argument she gives him a quarter to go eat. When he's outside Raj is almost hit by the car of Seth Ramnath Motilal. Raj continues to look for his attani in the dark. To test his honesty Seth Ramnath drops his wallet in the middle of the road. When Raj notices he picks it up and wants to give the wallet back to Seth Ramnath...he gets chased by gonads...and goes through a lot  but he returns the wallet. Impressed Seth Ramnath gives him a job in his office.Raj's life starts going well. He does hard work. Mrs. D'Sa doesn't take his rent because they basically become like mother and son. And of course he has his dear Aasha.But what Raj doesn't know is that Seth Ramnath is the uncle of his Aasha and what Seth Ramnath doesn't know is that Aarthi likes Raj. Poor Raj doesn't even know that his Aasha is actually Aarthi. He has yet to find out about what's in store for him.And once he does in a quite saddening way...his life is upside down. To make matters worse Mrs. D'Sa gets the flu.Another thing that Raj doesn't know the company he works at sells contaminated medicines sometimes.How is Rajkumar's life supposed to come back together? Can a poor man ever marry a rich girl? Or ever be given justice? That's the plot. It's a great movie with emotion as well as entertainment. Raj Kapoor Nutan Lalita Pawar and everyone gave wonderful performances. Nutan looked exuberantly beautiful and matched well with Raj Kapoor.And my god the music! Shankar Jaikishan once again delivers a perfect sound track. Songs like Dil Ki Nazar Se Kisi Ki Muskarahoton Woh Chand Khila Tera Jaana and so many more are just classics. Lata and Mukesh at their best once again. The background score is quite touching too. Helen's dance was a delight as usual.Hrishkesh Mukherjee's direction is pretty good and there are many times in the movie where you just have to cry. The relationships between all of the characters just light up the screen. Despite a few extremely sad situations and some unreasonably evil characters the direction is very nice. I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10! Watch this classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though Raj Kapoor was a versatile actor and performed various kinds of roles in his acting career spanning around 38 years 19441982 he's best loved by the Indian audience for the SeedhaSaada simple straightforward and naive and therefore vulnerable gentleman's role who's purehearted and cannot play with anybody's sentiments but people can easily play with his sentiments and break his heart. Many movies showcasing his talent in such type of roles were made under his own banner and under the outside banners too. One such memorable movie is Anari 1959 which is definitely a classic not to be missed by a moviebuff interested in watching quality cinema.Anari too simple devoid of shrewdness is the story of Raj Kumar aka Raju the evergreen screenname of Raj Kapoor who is poor and lives as paying guest with Mrs. D'Sa Lalita Pawaar a Christian widow whose personality is like coconut i.e. apparently stern but very sweet tender and benevolent inside her heart. Raju gets a job in the pharmaceutical company of Ramnath Moti Lal whose daughter Aarti Nutan falls in love with him but pretends to be the maid of his daughter and presents the actual maid Asha Shubha Khote as herself. Though she does it in just in prankplaying way but before she could tell Raju the truth he himself comes to know of it and feeling badly hurt to see that his sentiments have been played with alienates himself from Aarti and his father. But when ailing Mrs. D'Sa passes away after a medicine manufactured in the pharmaceutical company is injected to her Raju is arrested because it is found that she has died of poison. After a few twists in the story Raju is acquitted and the real culprit surrenders to the court. Aarti and Raju get reunited.The characters involved are above the plot of the story. The character of Mrs. D'Sa and the affectionate relationship between herself the landlady and Raju the tenant goes deep inside the hearts of the viewers. Both the performers have delivered performances of a lifetime in the movie. Especially for Lalita Pawar I can safely say that it's the best role performed by herself in her entire acting career. Nutan first as the carefree daughter of a rich man and thereafter a true lover who feeling the pain inside her own heart after inadvertently hurting the man she loves and later standing by him in his time of adversity is just marvellous. And finally Moti Lal as the proud businessman who is never ready to accept defeat has delivered a knockout performance. The performers have enlivened the script on the screen with their towering performances. And the director has shown his class by presenting the story in an extremely effective interesting and above all touching way. It's a movie which first entertains you and thereafter moves you deep inside your heart.The cinematography and other technical aspects of this black and white movie are also up to the mark.The music preparing team of ShankarJaikishan composers Shailendra lyricist Mukesh and Lata singers has done an outstanding job. It contains gems like Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe Ho Nisaar Tera Jaana Dil Ke Armaanon Ka Lutt Jaana Bann Ke Ye Panchhi Gaayen Pyar Ka Taraana Dil Ki Nazar Se Nazaron Ki Dil Se Woh Chaand Khila Woh Taare Hanse etc. My favourite song is the title track sung by Mukesh  Sab Kuchh Seekha Humne Na Seekhi Hoshiyaari Sach Hai Duniya Waalon Ki Hum Hain Anari.Anari is a timeless classic from the black and white era of Bollywood movies which had won five Filmfare awards in 1960. Its repeat value is beyond measurement. See it once and you will love to see it countless number of times. It scores in every department of cinema. If you have not watched it till date please do watch it now and you will know at once what quality cinema is all about.".

Though she does it in just in prankplaying way but before she could tell Raju the truth he himself comes to know of it and feeling badly hurt to see that his sentiments have been played with alienates himself from Aarti and his father. But when ailing Mrs. D'Sa passes away after a medicine manufactured in the pharmaceutical company is injected to her Raju is arrested because it is found that she has died of poison. After a few twists in the story Raju is acquitted and the real culprit surrenders to the court. Aarti and Raju get reunited.The characters involved are above the plot of the story. The character of Mrs. D'Sa and the affectionate relationship between herself the landlady and Raju the tenant goes deep inside the hearts of the viewers. Both the performers have delivered performances of a lifetime in the movie. Especially for Lalita Pawar I can safely say that it's the best role performed by herself in her entire acting career. Nutan first as the carefree daughter of a rich man and thereafter a true lover who feeling the pain inside her own heart after inadvertently hurting the man she loves and later standing by him in his time of adversity is just marvellous. And finally Moti Lal as the proud businessman who is never ready to accept defeat has delivered a knockout performance. The performers have enlivened the script on the screen with their towering performances. And the director has shown his class by presenting the story in an extremely effective interesting and above all touching way. It's a movie which first entertains you and thereafter moves you deep inside your heart.The cinematography and other technical aspects of this black and white movie are also up to the mark.The music preparing team of ShankarJaikishan composers Shailendra lyricist Mukesh and Lata singers has done an outstanding job. It contains gems like Kisi Ki Muskurahaton Pe Ho Nisaar Tera Jaana Dil Ke Armaanon Ka Lutt Jaana Bann Ke Ye Panchhi Gaayen Pyar Ka Taraana Dil Ki Nazar Se Nazaron Ki Dil Se Woh Chaand Khila Woh Taare Hanse etc. My favourite song is the title track sung by Mukesh  Sab Kuchh Seekha Humne Na Seekhi Hoshiyaari Sach Hai Duniya Waalon Ki Hum Hain Anari.Anari is a timeless classic from the black and white era of Bollywood movies which had won five Filmfare awards in 1960. Its repeat value is beyond measurement. See it once and you will love to see it countless number of times. It scores in every department of cinema. If you have not watched it till date please do watch it now and you will know at once what quality cinema is all about.";

	schema:reviewBody "Here comes the Korean Sherlock Holmes with plenty of fast paced plot and slapstick humor. Sure few parts don't make much sense and may even seem pointless but the movie as a whole. It's actually a pretty good adventure. I enjoyed it from the start to finish even if like I said some parts were just pointless and ridiculous even for a comedy such as this. So the plot is about a really smart detective who is actually a bit a awkward goofball that goes around solving cases during the Joseon Dynasty. I thought it did a good job of blending the case revolving a conspiracy involving murders politics embezzlement and the rich oppressing the poor and Christianity all into one. Even if it may seem like it's all over the place at first. It gets interwoven pretty well at the end. Anyways his sidekick who is actually really likable is played really well by Dalsu Oh. The duo actually really does a great job of brining out that awkward but comedic feel. Overall this is a fun slapstick mystery adventure movie that I actually enjoyed more than the 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie. Korean comedic adventure movies are usually misses over hits so it's pleasant to actually find a good one.7.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Anastasia is not a film for everyone. Those who insist on historical accuracy in films depicting real people and events would do best to stay away from the movie house altogether. Anastasia however is not exactly about real people although it does incorporate the lives of real humans and parallels with their true stories to depict a compelling whatif scenario and this is incredibly effective even after DNA tests have revealed that Anna Anderson was definitely not Anastasia Nikolavena Romanov but instead in all likelihood a Kashubian factory worker. I am unaware whether she ever used the name Anna Koreff.As a matter of fact those who are familiar with the real story are in for an even grander treat. We are thrown into 1928 Paris with a brief shot of this wretched madwoman at Russian Easter lonely and rejected outside the Russian Orthodox Cathedral and on the brink of suicide and we are definitely prepared to think of see as the impostor that Anna Anderson was. Yet as the film progresses we are shown a woman quite literally without any past. Michael Thornton opined of the real Anna Anderson Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Kashubian factory worker Franziska Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person.Ingrid Bergman's Anna Koreff however is not simply mentally lost the world has lost her as well. It helps perhaps that Bergman is infinitely more convincing as a princess than as a vagabond and the retrospective certitude of the falsity of Anna Anderson's claim helps to disguise her limits at the beginning of the film when like Yul Brynner's General Bounine we are meant to doubt her identity. Bounine creates Koreff's new identity as the Grand Duchess Anastasia and so effectively that he begins to believe in it himself. But the entirely unsolvable questions remainIs Anna Koreff Anastasia? Does she actually believe she is Anastasia? More ominously whoever she is does she even truly and consciously remember?This piece carefully avoids resolving these questions. On the one hand the speed and thoroughness with which she slides into her new role is difficult to explain and impossible to deny. On the other hand the ending among other things is cleverly constructed so as to expose her assumed royal identity as a construction. This is not of course the real story and in the post1900 world such a thorough and complete break with any sort of past anchor is next to impossible. But if it happened... this may be just how it happened.Anastasia is above all a beautifully designed film full of elegance and taste. Ingrid Bergman is as beautiful as the interior architecture against which she assumes her royal identity. Again it is not a film for everyone many will have great difficulty connecting and sympathizing with the royal circles and personalities in this tome but those who are able to understand premodern preliberal c.f. human sensibilities will love it. Helen Hayes is absolutely perfect and inspiring as the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna it is plain to see how the real Empress was so beloved in her adopted Russia and her chemistry with Bergman is incredible to behold. The only thing I can find to critique is that the scriptand to some extent a steely wall between Bergman and Brynnerdoes not fully back up the eventual culmination of the relationship between Koreff and Bounine the conclusion fits quite well thematically but is mildly illogical with regard to the plot. Still this is a minor complaint as Anastasia is first and foremost a film about identity and one that will jar and confound its viewers time and again.".

The role of Anastasia marked Ingrid Bergman's return to an American film production after her exile from America after 1949 and she won her second Oscar with it. She runs a whole gamut of emotions from absolute despair to an assumed air of royalty. After a while Brynner and his confederates think that just maybe Ingrid's the real deal.Of course the ultimate test is whether the Dowager Empress of Russia Helen Hayes accepts Ingrid as the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Although Ingrid got her Oscar I've always felt that Hayes gives the best performance in the film.At the age Dowager Empress Marie was in the Twenties all she had left was memories. She's from the Danish Royal House and was the widow of Alexander III and the mother of Nicholas II of Russia. Her world was turned upside down in 1917 with the Russian Revolution not just toppled from the privileged position she had she lost her entire family of the next generation of Romanovs to political upheaval. Hayes is back in her native Denmark a lonely proud but regal woman with nothing but memories. She truly becomes the Empress Marie.Yul Brynner as General Sergei Pavlovich Bounine is one of that crowd of Russian refugees who apparently got out of Russia with more than just a skin. He's the owner of a Russian caf in Paris and should be doing OK but he's got a streak of larceny in him and a taste for high living. He's involved in bilking a whole lot of Russian exiles in a search for a Romanov heir to claim millions deposited by the late Czar for his children in the Bank of England. He's got to come up with an heir of some kind and fast. But he's a charming fellow and gives one charming performance.Both Brynner and Director Anatole Litvak with their own Slavic backgrounds give Anastasia a real flavor of authenticity for the main characters and the Russian exile background of the film. It was shot on location in both Paris and Copenhagen and the camera work is first rate.Anastasia became a milestone film for Ingrid Bergman and while Anna Koreff may have been a bogus Russian princess as an actress Ingrid Bergman was always the real deal.".

She gives a gracious confused eloquent moving performance following back the progress of a woman from the deepness of hopelessness and confusion through strenuous efforts with uncertainty and disillusion to a successful display of bravery selfrespect and love...Directed with elegance by Anatole Litvak and with a fascinating music score by Alfred Newman Anastasia is a combination of mystery and romance a compelling drama with quite considerable charm which persuade without projecting any flame on history...".

She must be recognized by her grand mother the Dowager Empress of Russia who lives in Copenhagen Denmark...Helen Hayes is simply superb as the melancholic old Empress with a wistful desire to accept the vague truth...Yul Brynner plays his role with enormous task...The motion picture marks Ingrid Bergman's comeback to the Hollywood cinema after the European exile... She gives a gracious confused eloquent moving performance following back the progress of a woman from the deepness of hopelessness and confusion through strenuous efforts with uncertainty and disillusion to a successful display of bravery selfrespect and love...Directed with elegance by Anatole Litvak and with a fascinating music score by Alfred Newman Anastasia is a combination of mystery and romance a compelling drama with quite considerable charm which persuade without projecting any flame on history...";

A great script that is witty and often funny filmed and acted beautifully.In addition to containing the finest performance of Ingrid Bergman's career including Casablanca Yul Brynner is at his best and Helen Hayes delivers an absolutely brilliant gem of a performance.  While Bergman justly won Best Actress of 1956 for her performance I find it astounding that Brynner and especially Hayes did not even get consideration.  Yes Brynner was nominated and even won for his silly over the top performance in The King And I.  And I'm sure like Jim Broadbent this year he was rewarded as much for his body of work for the year as he was that single performance.  Still though I'm baffled as to why he won for The King and not for The General.  The snub of Hayes though is even more mystifying.  Particularly because 1956 was a pretty weak year for great films and performances especially in the supporting actress category.  Any year in which a performance like Dorothy Malone's in the Sirk trash de l'annee Written on the Wind can win has to be weak.  Hayes performance in addition to being played to perfection also seems like the kind that is almost a given to at least be nominated.  In other words if Anastasia was remade again this year Judi Dench would play the role and a nomination would be a given.  Almost as much a mystery to me as the Is she or Isn't she thing.This film fluctuates wildly between dark and light.  One minute you're shocked by the horrors Anastasia must have endured over the years the next minute Ingrid Bergman is making you laugh out loud at a brilliant drunken performance.  One minute Bergman is in tears the next she's overjoyed. Definitely one of the all time great performances by an actress. However there are a few things I'm just not sure how I feel about.  And perhaps that's one of the films' intentions.  Possible spoiler ahead  The ending is very surprising and very abrupt.  And not entirely satisfying.  Or is it?  I'm not sure.  Not being familiar with the story before I saw this film I expected a letdown in the final twenty minutes after Anastasia's grandmother accepts her.  I predicted they would plant one final seed of doubt and then end it.  And they do...in a way.  But not the way I would have hoped.  I would have liked to see it end on a dark and sinister note. To put it into our heads that maybe Ingrid Bergman's character might be playing everyone for a fool.  Maybe.  As it stands the apparent flight with Brynner's character is functional enough I suppose to create some mystery. In other words for me the ending is a letdown but not a total letdown. The difference between a great film and what could have been a brilliant one.".

	schema:reviewBody "America gave a belated welcome home to Ingrid Bergman in this film her first studioproduced movie after being practically banished from the US for having an illicit affair and an illegitimate pregnancy! It was thanks to her rather regal nature and the persistence of Darryl F. Zanuck that she even got the chance. The story is a fictionalized account of what became of a Russian princess believed assassinated with the rest of her family during the Russian revolution. Like several others before her Bergman's character turns up believing that she could be a surviving royalin her case Anastasia. Brynner is a con man who doesn't particularly care if she is or is not the princess so long as the Dowager Empress Anastasia's grandmother believes that she is. In order to fully enjoy the film one must say goodbye to a lot of the cold hard historical facts and just accept the film as a dramatic fantasy. Bergman shines in the title role though at 41 was a touch too old to be playing this character! She has the right European strength and dignity beaten down by time and turmoil. She's a heroine to root for much more so than the actual woman she is based on. Brynner completes a stunning threesome for 1956 with this film and his work in The Ten Commandments and The King and I. He and Bergman make a compelling pair. An added bonus is the rather surprising casting of Helen Hayes as the Grand Duchess. She was choen in order to win the approval of Americans who had reviled Bergman previously...if a monument to American values like Hayes approved enough to appear in the film then the rest of the country had permission to enjoy it. Though some reviewers didn't approve of her at the time her scenes are filled with great professionalism and finally stirring emotion. Her stoic countenance is quite a contrast to her impish work with Disney and other projects later. The supporting cast is colorful and interesting as well keep an eye peeled for Mrs. Howell of Gilligan's Island! Special mention goes to the effervescent Hunt who steals every frame of film she appears in. The icing on the cake is Alfred Newman's magnificent score. The music is grand and appropriately Russian and royal in flavor. Some of it was derived from original Russian works. It adds the perfect feel to this gloriously beautiful film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love to watch great acting even a movie with a mediocre script or direction can still be wonderful if it is wellacted.  Happily ANASTASIA is brilliantly directed and wellwritten as well as containing some of the grandest acting I have ever seen on film.Yul Brynner had quite a year in 1956.  He won the Best Actor Oscar for his stagy but fascinating work in THE KING AND I yet in ANASTASIA he delivers a brilliant subtle and completely captivating performance as the Russian general who engineers the plot to convince the world that the unknown woman he has encountered in Paris is in fact the Grand Duchess Anastasia.  His is a complex character scheming dishonest and unscrupulous but it is impossible to dislike him.  Quite an accomplishment.As the woman Ingrid Bergman won the Oscar for her thrilling rollercoaster ride of a performance.  She is astonishing one minute she is laughing wildly the next sobbing heartbrokenly.  She veers from coquettishness to desperation without so much as an eyeblink.  You have to watch this film more than once to really see everything Bergman put into this role.And then there's Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress.  Oddly enough she was cast by accident the producers wanted a British actress named Helen Haye but someone misread a telegram and the rest is history.  Hayes is magnificent as the elderly matriarch who has lost her entire family to the Russian Revolution.  Again there is a duality in her performance she is at once astonishingly stubborn yet unbelievably frail.  It is a fascinating performance and there is a scene between Hayes and Bergman that is unforgettable.This is a film full of rich performances the rest of the cast right down to the smallest bit part performs superbly.  Kudos especially to Martita Hunt who provides hilarious comic relief as the Empress's ladyinwaiting.".

Quite an accomplishment.As the woman Ingrid Bergman won the Oscar for her thrilling rollercoaster ride of a performance.  She is astonishing one minute she is laughing wildly the next sobbing heartbrokenly.  She veers from coquettishness to desperation without so much as an eyeblink.  You have to watch this film more than once to really see everything Bergman put into this role.And then there's Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress.  Oddly enough she was cast by accident the producers wanted a British actress named Helen Haye but someone misread a telegram and the rest is history.  Hayes is magnificent as the elderly matriarch who has lost her entire family to the Russian Revolution.  Again there is a duality in her performance she is at once astonishingly stubborn yet unbelievably frail.  It is a fascinating performance and there is a scene between Hayes and Bergman that is unforgettable.This is a film full of rich performances the rest of the cast right down to the smallest bit part performs superbly.  Kudos especially to Martita Hunt who provides hilarious comic relief as the Empress's ladyinwaiting.";

	schema:reviewBody "We now know that the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna of Russia the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II was murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918 along with the rest of her family. For decades however rumours persisted that she had survived and escaped from Russia and the truth was not definitely established until 2007. Several impostors pretended to be her and this film is very loosely based on the story of one of them a woman who has become known to history as Anna Anderson although even that was not her true name. She was probably Franziska Schanzkowska a German factory worker of Polish descent. A second film a cartoon also titled Anastasia was made in 1997 and revolved around the premise that the real Grand Duchess did indeed survive the Russian Revolution. The story is set in Paris in 1928. A young woman confused and suffering from amnesia is hailed by a group of Russian expatriates led by General Bunin as the longlost Anastasia. Now had the real Anastasia truly survived she would have been invaluable to Russian migrs as the figurehead of an antiCommunist movement possibly even a contender for the Russian throne had the Soviet regime collapsed as many expatriates expected it to. The group backing the claimant however has no political interest in her indeed Bunin is quite convinced that she is not the genuine Anastasia. They are simply using her to stake a claim to the 10 million pounds deposited by the Tsar with an English bank. In order to do this however they have to convince not only their fellow migrs but also Anastasia's last surviving close relative her grandmother the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna.The film takes a number of liberties with history although not quite as many as the cartoon version which has been described as treating historical facts with particular contempt. Very few Russian migrs accepted Anna Anderson as genuine nor did she ever meet the Dowager Empress. No evidence was found despite rumours to the contrary that the Tsar had ever deposited money in England. The script takes an essentially neutral stance on the question of Anna's identity she is occasionally referred to as Anna Koreff but the name Franziska Schanzkowska is never mentioned in the film. There is in fact a suggestion that Anna may indeed despite Bunin's scepticism be the true Anastasia. To avoid confusion I will refer to the character as Anna throughout my review. . This film marked Ingrid Bergman's comeback from her sevenyear exile from Hollywood following the exposure of her adulterous affair with Roberto Rossellini. It has certain similarities with her last American film before that exile Hitchcock's Under Capricorn. In both films Bergman's character starts off as an insecure mentally disturbed young woman and gradually grows in stature throughout the film ending as someone much more assured and selfconfident. Bergman is well able to portray both the tormented Anna of the early scenes and the regal dignified young woman who may indeed be a genuine royal of the later ones. I would not agree with the criticism that at 41 she was too old for the role. Certainly the real Anastasia had she lived would only have been 27 in 1928 but Franziska Schanzkowska if she was indeed Anna Anderson was several years older than the woman whose identity she assumed and Bergman looked considerably younger than her years. The big weakness in Bergman's performance is that there is little chemistry between her and Yul Brynner even though a romantic interest is supposed to be developing between their characters and this is a major plot point at the end of the film. Brynner too is far more convincing as Bunin the wily schemer than he is as Bunin the lover. The best of the supporting cast is Helen Hayes as the imperious Dowager Empress. Bergman won her second Academy Award for Best Actress her first had been for Gaslight but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that this award was given less for the merits of her performance than as Hollywood's way of making amends for the shabby way she had been treated over the Rossellini affair. Mind you I cannot think of any really great performances by a female star in 1956 and this was far from being the most eccentric decision taken by the Academy in that year. They gave Brynner Best Actor ahead of Kirk Douglas in Lust for Life not for this film but for The King and I nominated Katharine Hepburn for Best Actress for The Rainmaker despite her being horribly miscast and even Don Murray's dreadful performance in Bus Stop was felt worthy of a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Another weakness in the film is that it was all too obviously adapted from a stageplay. Not all films which start life as a theatrical production are necessarily bad ones and there were some very good ones in the fifties such as A Streetcar Named Desire. Too often however producers and directors of the 1950s adapting stageplays for the screen failed to open up the action to take advantage of the greater freedoms offered by the cinematic medium and the result was often a cramped static film with The Rainmaker being a particularly egregious example. Even a great director like Alfred Hitchcock was not exempt from this fault as shown by his Dial M for Murder. Anatole Litvak occasionally tries to open things up here especially in the spectacular ball scenes but in general Anastasia still seems too narrow and stagebound too dominated by talk with insufficient action. 510".

She made several good films but she was basically dismissed from Hollywood studios for her illicit affair which produced a child out of wedlock. She made a comeback with this film about a confused Russian woman groomed to impersonate the deceased Russian princess Anastasia. Yul Brynner was busy doing several films at this time The King and I The Ten Commandments and the 50's was his most productive period. In this film he portrays General Sergei Bounine a former Imperial general who hopes to gain his title again as well as his fame through an elaborate scheme passing off a poor amnesiac woman as Anastasia. The film was shot in beautiful color and the costumes are exquisite. With a musical score by Alfred Newman which provides homage to Imperial Russia this film seems to be begging for Oscars. Ingrid Bergman especially steps up the drama of her role. She is still wonderful but she is not doing anything particularly memorable. Yul Brynner has performed better roles. As Bounine he's not very developed or interesting. It's sad that there is no chemistry between Brynner and Bergman when there is supposed to be their characters are supposed to fall in love. Instead they bicker and struggle against one another through most of the film but there is no real passion between them. There was greater chemistry between Debora Karr and Yul Brynner in King and I. Helen Hayes however steals the show as the Dowager Empress. She's outwardly cold imperious and bitter but she is so desperate for the old days and for her dead granddaughter Anastasia that she is willing to go along with the fraud organized by Bounine and his men. The scenes between Helen Hayes and Ingrid Bergman are excellent in fact the best part of the film. There is very little about this movie that is truly great. It's a beautiful moving film but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth after it's over. The ending is abrupt and seems unresolved. Where will Brynner and Ana go ? What have they truly learned about all this ? How have they changed ? This film is a big empty decorative piece which suffered from a poor adaptation from a play. But it's a classic example of films of the 50's and Ingrid Bergman despite her dramatic outbursts is still amazing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Excellent film about a group of Imperial Russian expatriates who try to pass off a nobody as the Grand Duchess Anastasia who was supposedly executed along with the rest of her family a decade ago. No one knows not even the woman herself whether she is or is not Anastasia. Ingrid Bergman plays this woman in her glorious return to Hollywood after several years of exile on account of the affair she had with Italian director Roberto Rossellini. History or at least some of us film buffs see her exile as something other than shameful but you can't really judge Anastasia without seeing it as a homecoming. The story echoes Bergman's life as I'm sure it was meant to. Can this Anastasia convince those who once knew her that she really is the long lost Grand Duchess? Can Ingrid Bergman convince the American public that she is worthy to be taken back into their confidence? To answer the first you'll have to see the film. The answer to the second question is a definite yes as the film was quite successful and earned Bergman her second Academy Award which she much deserved her first was for 1944's Gaslight. She was not present at the ceremony in 1957 to accept that award but I'm unsure of whether she was still in exile at that point. The film was made outside of the U.S. After Bergman there is still a whole lot to love. As for the other actors Yul Brynner playing the man who enlists Bergman in his plot to win Anastasia's inheritance gives a fine performance easily the best of the three films he made in 1956 even though he won an Oscar for his ridiculously overthetop performance in The King and I. Akim Tamiroff always reliable gives one of his very best performances as Brynner's assistant. Helen Hayes is great as the dowager empress whose opinion is absolutely necessary to accept Bergman as the real Anastasia and Martita Hunt gives a delightful comic performance as her attendant she was the best thing in the film in my opinion. The musical score by Alfred Newman won the only other Oscar nomination for the film and it is excellent. The dialogue is wonderful. There are only a couple of things I didn't like and they are relatively minor. Nearer the beginning for instance the screenwriter or the original playwright has a problem keeping the ambiguity of whether Bergman is actually Anastasia or not. The hints the woman gives off are instantly convincing that she is the lost woman. Fortunately this improves over the course of the film and the ambiguity becomes somewhat more pronounced. I'm not sure whether I liked the ending either although it has a great last line which I expect was even greater when it was a play.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sure 'Anastasia' may be inaccurate especially with DNA and forensics confirming the real fate of Princess Anastasia around 2007 well after the numerous film adaptations based on the fascinating what if story were made of which this is one. This said it is a well done and interesting if imperfect film on its own merits.While it is not quite one of her best performances in a career that includes her timeless performances in 'Casablanca' and 'Gaslight' Ingrid Bergman is nonetheless exceptional in the title role bringing equal vulnerability and dignity with intelligence poise and nuance. People will argue whether she deserved the Oscar or not part of it may be due to it being a comeback performance or for personal reasons but also the Academy could also have thought it that good a performance personally have nothing against her winning while thinking that she has been better.Yul Brynner is similarly very good portraying Bounine with some subtle menace but also authority wit and likability. If 'Anastasia' was released in a different year to his Oscarwinning turn in 'The King and I' a case of him dominating that film in a more colourful role than here and the chemistry between him and Deborah Kerr was stronger than between Bergman he would most likely have gotten some kind of award nod not since 1942 with Teresa Wright in 'The Pride of the Yankees' and 'Mrs Miniver' was the same actor nominated in the same year for more than one film.One mustn't overlook Helen Hayes also in a comeback performance though for different reasons to Bergman having suspended her career due to her daughter's death and her husband's health who gives a powerful and poignant performance as the Empress a role so far removed from her usual roles. If there was one performance that deserved an Oscar or at least a nomination it was Hayes and that she didn't is something of an enigma. Nor the delightful scenestealing of Martita Hunt.The acting is not the only reason to see 'Anastasia'. The film is very well made with exquisitely opulent costumes that give a real sense of time and place sumptuous scenery of London Copenhagen and Paris and positively luminous cinematography. Alfred Newman's music score is one of his most stirring and beautifully orchestrated in a career full of scores of both those qualities.Much of the script is witty literate and clever if at times a bit rambling largely succeeding too in putting flesh on the bones. Most of the story is gripping helped by that the story it's based on is one of the most intriguing there is especially telling are the scenes between Bergman and Hayes very powerfully written emotional and beautifully performed by both actresses.'Anastasia' for all these great things is not perfect. The ending does feel abrupt and it felt somewhat of a cheat for the point of the story to be left ambiguous. It may have been due to being careful not to offend but this was a kind of story that deserved to have that question answered and to be perfectly honest ambiguousopen to interpretation endings tend to generally not do it for me.Was expecting more chemistry between Bergman and Brynner which comes alive in the dialogue and the delivery but not on screen between them. It's all well played and competent with some wit but one misses the fire love and passion which was clearly meant to be there but doesn't quite come alive here. Some of the pacing drags too with the workmanlike and sometimes impressive but too often undistinguished and too measured direction not helping.Overall not perfect but interesting and very well done on the whole. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Anastasia is based on the Broadway play that starred Viveca Lindfors Hurd Hatfield and Eugenie Leontovich and it was this film that brought Ingrid Bergman back to the United States after the big sin that drove her out of the country. Besides Bergman the film stars Yul Brynner and Helen Hayes.We know today that Anna Anderson was a Polish actress and not Princess Anastasia but before DNA this was one of the world's great mysteries. In the real story Prince Phillip's DNA was used since he is related to the Russian royal family and proved that Anna Anderson was a fake answering a question that had vexed people for decades.In this version a Russian businessman Bounine Brynner and some other Russian expatriates living in Paris plot to collect millions of Romanov money by grooming an unhappy depressed young woman who has recently been institutionalized to be the Princess Anastasia due to her resemblance to the Tsar's youngest daughter. Bounine begins to believe that she might be the real Anastasia. But the big test will be before the Dowager Empress Hayes who has no interest in meeting another pretender.The acting is wonderful with the beautiful Bergman giving a fully fleshed out performance beginning as a confused woman and developing through the film into a real royal presence. Brynner is very strong in his role with moments of grace and gentleness.Bergman won her second Academy Award for her performance but she is matched by Helen Hayes' powerful performance as the Dowager Empress externally a hard woman but one whose heart has been broken by the tragic loss of her family. Though she can't let herself believe at first that this is Anastasia she is longing for her to be.Very good movie with an interesting ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wonderfully charismatic Yul Brynner and a 'reborn' Ingrid Bergman  making her reappearance in Hollywood after years in exile  star in this slightly odd film a fantastic reworking of an original true story. Anna Anderson Bergman sick amnesiac and slightly mad is brought from the brink of selfdestruction in 1920s Paris to dubious life by a group of mercenary cynical exiled White Russians led by General Bounin Brynner. As they groom her to convince their fellow exiles that she is the Grand Duchess Anastasia rumoured to have escaped the firing squad that destroyed the rest of the Tsar's family Bounin's feelings about his and her 'part' in the 'play' become more complicated. There's an interesting mix of things going on here great clever script strong cast hot leads but something doesn't quite gel so that you're left or at least I was wanting just a little bit more than you get. I'm used to seeing Yul Brynner generate chemistry with any actress he plays opposite  so I was surprised to hear and see for myself that in this film the sparks only fly in the script. But also the whole wordy film was shot in a terribly 'British' way I can get away with saying that!the camera is almost always too far away to get that incredible intimacy of shot and reactionshot which is so much a part of screen chemistry. The great Helen Hayes makes up for it amply as Grandmamma the Dowager Empress whose belief in Anna's addresses is crucial to the whole enterprise and whose tired face and withering oneliners usually aimed at her marvellous ladyinwaiting form the chief humour of the piece. But closeups of Anna and Bounin are as rare in this film as hen's teeth at crucial charged moments between them when Anna is petulant drunk when he is jealous letting slip that he has started to care the camera is on the other side of the room watching with all the indifference of a translator. Incomprehensible  try Brynner and Deborah Kerr in The Journey only three years later for exactly the kind of closeup driven chemistry I mean  and with very different results from the slightly chill effect here. Granted Brynner's cynical character in Anastasia is correctly summed up by Bergman's as vodka  cold hard sharp  but even a cold hard sharp man can fall in love  surely this is precisely the dramatic opportunity that's been thrown away? A typical example Bounin has whisked Anna off back to their suite cutting short a romantic encounter with exactly the man Bounine wants her to be with she drunk on champagne he impenetrable and just a shade jealous. She calls drunkenly to him from her room and from a fly on the wall position in the central suite we see him slowly respond to her calls. He doesn't know that she's already fallen asleep what then is he walking towards as he stalks into her bedroom with his catlike dancer's grace? The sexual charge is lost en route to the distant static camera like being in the 'gods' at the theatre you know that something exciting is going on down there but you can't make it out.Rant over the story is intriguing and wellplayed despite the real Anna Anderson's claim having been firmly discredited now. Bergman seems quite literally to be acting to save her soul  as indeed she was  begging her passage back to a hypocritical Hollywood which must have been pretty galling. But I think Bergman is better in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness and Brynner underused here is better in Invitation to a Gunfighter and the excellent The Journey.".

She would like to retire into respectability but unfortunately Ray Kirschman G. W. Bailey a retired police detective who once busted Rhodenbarr is now blackmailing her into stealing for him. During one of her jobs for Kirschman Bernie is surprised when Christopher Marshall Stephen Shellen the man she's stealing from comes home unexpectedly. Bernie hides in the bedroom closet but Marshall isn't alone and when he and his companion decide to hit the sheets Bernie is trapped there for the night. In the morning Bernie overhears and argument between Marshall and someone who comes to see him. Then she hears the sounds of a struggle and then silence.

She leaves but is ultimately fingered as both a murder and robbery suspect.

Rhodenbarr is resourceful and that resourcefulness not only helps to keep her out of jail as well as allowing her to figure out who really killed Marshall. The story is told in a comic way but it is quite credible nonetheless.The acting was quite enjoyable. Goldberg of course turns in a masterful performance. Warren's over the top hysterics work well with her character and show just how much range she has. Goodman and DeSalvo are amusing as the bumbling detectives. Goldthwait and Bailey are rather annoying as is par for the course with both of them but they do manage to make their characters work. And Handy's performance is nicely layered between the public face as an upright lawyer and the private face as a disturbed man capable of shocking violence.Yes it's a silly movie but if you look beneath the silliness you may be surprised to find a well crafted whodunit. And either way it's just an enjoyable movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Another in a series of comic vehicles for Whoopi Goldberg in the late 80's this one features a pretty well crafted mystery buried in amongst the comedy.Bernie Rhodenbarr Whoopi Goldberg is a cat burglar by trade. She would like to retire into respectability but unfortunately Ray Kirschman G. W. Bailey a retired police detective who once busted Rhodenbarr is now blackmailing her into stealing for him. During one of her jobs for Kirschman Bernie is surprised when Christopher Marshall Stephen Shellen the man she's stealing from comes home unexpectedly. Bernie hides in the bedroom closet but Marshall isn't alone and when he and his companion decide to hit the sheets Bernie is trapped there for the night. In the morning Bernie overhears and argument between Marshall and someone who comes to see him. Then she hears the sounds of a struggle and then silence. Eventually she emerges from the closet to find Marshall dead on the floor with a rather strange looking object sticking out of his chest. She leaves but is ultimately fingered as both a murder and robbery suspect.

	schema:reviewBody "Bernice Rhodenbarr is a cat burglar and used book shop owner.  When an excop comes to her with a threat to hand in evidence that he withheld years ago that would incriminate her she is forced to do a job for him.  She agrees to steal a woman's jewellery back from her exhusband after a messy split.  She carries out the crime but is interrupted and has to hide.  When she comes out of hiding she finds the man dead and her bag of jewels gone. In order to clear herself she must find out who would want the man dead before the cops can get to her.There was a time in Whoopi Goldberg's career where they constantly tired to use her smart mouth and streetwise appearance to make her into a female Eddie Murphy.  This film appears to be another attempt to use her streetwise wit to good effect.  The plot is some form of murder mystery with Bernie being framed and hunted by the police while she tries to catch the real killer.  It's nothing we haven't seen before but it's just not very well done here.  I struggled to care about the people that Bernie was chasing because I didn't know who they were  partly because the film didn't really explain as most of them are red herrings in preparation for the twist' at the end.In terms of tension the film is lacking and as a result I never really got into it.  On top of this it's main selling point the smart comedy is seriously missing.  There was one maybe two good lines in it and none of those was delivered by Whoopi.  In fact you could be mistaken for thinking this film wasn't a comedy as there are so very few laughs in it.  The whole thing feels very dated  I imagine that even when it was released in the cinema people must have looked at it and gone whoa that's soooo eighties'!Whoopi is poorly used and is sold short by a very ordinary script but she does have a good support cast to help her out.  Sadly they are all sold short as well.  Goldthwait is the only one who is allowed to do anything amusing Goodman Warren Bailey and Handy are all pretty much window dressing so badly are they used.Overall this film is one from a series of films aiming for the same effect see Fatal Beauty Jumpin Jack Flash etc but here the film totally fails to make good on any of it's assets.  The plot is boring and overly convoluted given that we all know it'll turn out to be the least likely main character in the film and the comedy usually OK in even average Whoopi films like this is AWOL.  A pretty horrid way to waste 90 minutes  unrelentingly dull.".

I eagerly popped it in the DVD player when I got home and it starting off fairly promising with a suspenseful burglar scene and cool 80's soundtrack music. But then the plot just droops off into a depressingly boring cesspool of garbage. About 20 min into it you're left thinking this isn't going to get any better is it? The movie is hardly funny at all despite tricking you into thinking that with a large array of comedic actors in the cast. The film has more of a gritty cop drama type feel with a dark clublike nature. I like that but this movie shouldn't be played out that way. So basically it's stuck in the middle without a genre. The main highlights of the film are its cool 80's poprock soundtrack slight Miami Vicelike feel and Bob Goldthwait in some scenes. Although I'm a big fan of Goldthwait and this film doesn't showcase his hilariousness nearly as well as others. Whoopi Goldberg has a strange character that leaves you thinking Huh? in almost every scene. Her character isn't likable at all much less funny or anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1985 Whoopi Goldberg made her film debut in 'The Color Purple' and gave one of the best performances of all time. After the success of 'The Color Purple' it seemed like Hollywood wasn't really sure how to find the right fit for Goldbergs talents. In 1986 and 1987 she starred in three action comedies 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' 'Fatal Beauty' and 'Burglar.' It seemed like Hollywood was trying to mold her into a female Eddie Murphy.Of the three 'Burglar' is easily the best. Goldberg plays Bernice Rhodenbarr a cat burglar and used book shop owner. When an excop comes to her with a threat to hand in evidence that he withheld years ago that would incriminate her she is forced to do a job for him. She agrees to steal a dentist's jewelery back from her exhusband after a messy split. She carries out the crime but is interrupted and has to hide. When she comes out of hiding she finds the man dead and her bag of jewels gone. In order to clear herself she must find out who would want the man dead before the cops can get to her.While 'Fatal Beauty' was too dark and 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' was too scattershot 'Burglar' manages to find a good balance between the comedy and the action. Most of the comedy comes from Goldberg who plays the smartass streetwise type very well. The rest of the laughs come from Bobcat Goldthwait playing Goldberg's manic friend and Lesley Ann Warren playing the frazzled dentist. The rest of the cast plays it straight not attempting to upstage the star and it works well.The film does have it's major flaws. Some sequences drag on too long some of the comedy falls flat and the movie is filled with clichd twists and turns. But when the film works it works thanks completely to Goldberg.".

After the success of 'The Color Purple' it seemed like Hollywood wasn't really sure how to find the right fit for Goldbergs talents. In 1986 and 1987 she starred in three action comedies 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' 'Fatal Beauty' and 'Burglar.' It seemed like Hollywood was trying to mold her into a female Eddie Murphy.Of the three 'Burglar' is easily the best. Goldberg plays Bernice Rhodenbarr a cat burglar and used book shop owner. When an excop comes to her with a threat to hand in evidence that he withheld years ago that would incriminate her she is forced to do a job for him. She agrees to steal a dentist's jewelery back from her exhusband after a messy split. She carries out the crime but is interrupted and has to hide. When she comes out of hiding she finds the man dead and her bag of jewels gone. In order to clear herself she must find out who would want the man dead before the cops can get to her.While 'Fatal Beauty' was too dark and 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' was too scattershot 'Burglar' manages to find a good balance between the comedy and the action. Most of the comedy comes from Goldberg who plays the smartass streetwise type very well. The rest of the laughs come from Bobcat Goldthwait playing Goldberg's manic friend and Lesley Ann Warren playing the frazzled dentist. The rest of the cast plays it straight not attempting to upstage the star and it works well.The film does have it's major flaws. Some sequences drag on too long some of the comedy falls flat and the movie is filled with clichd twists and turns. But when the film works it works thanks completely to Goldberg.";

She's not yet been able to give up the robbery work despite constant reminders at the climax of each heist how she's getting too old for this. And she would give it up were it not for Ray Kirschman G.W. Baileyhe was Captain Harris in Police Academy a detective who is hounding Bernie for 25000 and a mink coat for his wife to keep from turning over evidence that could put her back behind bars. However due to their friendly relationship though Bernie is very calculating around Ray it's hard to believe he would be a guy that would be blackmailing her. And halfway through the movie they're hardly at odds with each other at all.Bailey lets Bernie onto a high stakes heist. Dr. Cynthia Sheldrake Leslie Anne Warren is a dentist. Her patients are mostly illegal immigrants so they pay in cash. With the cash she and her husband bought some pretty expensive jewels totaling somewhere around a hundred thousand or more. When they split up Sheldrake's husband kept the jewels at his place and she wants them back. That's where Bernie comes into the picture. One last heist to make enough money to square with Bailey and in the end get out of the business for good. It seems easy enough. That is until Sheldrake's husband is murdered while Bernie was hiding out in the closet. And now she's the prime suspect. But Bernie a smart cookie that she is isn't about to go down without a fight. And she seems to be the only really intent on serving the murder and prove her innocence. And it isn't going to be easy.Burglar isn't a whole lot of comedy as much as it is a murder mystery. Of course with Whoopie Goldberg in the lead you can expect a load of funny antics as Bernie sweet talks her way through the story with the help of her slurring spastic friend Carl Bobcat Goldwaith who has some pretty funny moments himself especially during the interrogation scene with John Goodman. Also there's a pretty good chase scene as the cops chase Bernie through the wild hilly asphalt of San Fransico with some of the chase done with camera views from the bumpers. But the movie like I said before is largely a murder mystery. Unfortunately the audience may start losing interest towards the end as Bernie seems to have her end of the mystery solved. The movie puts on the brakes once she reports her findings to the wife Sheldrake and everyone drags their feet around deciding what to do then. By then any suspense of Bernie's snooping around is turned into a totally dull bit of scenes followed by a pretty lame conclusion. So I'd say the movie was decent at least up to the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "One wonders how Whoopi Goldberg ever became a movie star but then we're remembered about how good she was in The Color Purple. Burglar is interesting I guess in a strange or enigmatic sense but one thing it isn't funny not even remotely. I can't even believe this was based on the Lawrence Block novels. The movie almost makes you forget you're watching a comedy. It takes itself too seriously for one thing where they should of really concentrated on one genre. The film too throws in a couple of added touches as if to compensate for what laughs there are in this dry comedy and slightly dry film. Examples here is not a badly shot car chase down those dangerously steep S.F. streets with too many close ups of cars flying over ascents. It's hammy. It also purposely throws in one still slanted street CU shot you never see coming featuring cops Goodman and DeSalvo. You feel like you with them on that incline a kind of cool shot but really a stupid one. I've never seen a movie do that before but like I said you feel this is compensating for it being a misfire where we feel too much is poured into this. The film actually starts off with promise in one nifty driven house robbery you could say that nearly see our Granny disguised Whoopi busted. The plot has crafty cat burglarbook shop owner Goldberg set up and framed while knocking over a young stud's place trying to retrieve some jewellery for an ex lover of the deceased. What I really liked in this movie though was the surprisingly good performances from the supporting cast especially G.W. Bailey while Goodman again make you stand take notice of how good an actor he is or was too before I first saw him in Sea Of Love. Vyto Ruginis was fun too as a slick haired bad dude thief again acting in a film inspired by a Lawrence Block novel he also acted in '86's' 8 Million Ways To Die prefore. Bobcat Goldwaith is again annoying yet likable as Whoopi's friendless neighbor save for Whoopi where an interrogation scene got me more antagonized than it did Goodman. As for Whoopi's performance it's hard to tell if it's good or not with these 80's comedies. I felt I was just going through the motions with her. She wasn't really engaging but she did have her moments. Small ones. Out of interest or a Whoopi fan Burglar is worth a view. It's not a bad film at all but it was intended as a comedy and on that note it fails terribly.".

It mixes a lot of great work especially from Bobcat my favorite is his delivery in the Mayday bar this movie is so 80's. Maybe it rubs some wrong but if you were an adult in the late 1980's this movie would be a real treat. Unfortunately many of the jokes are for Americans and our culture I can understand it not working for other English speakers such as Canadians etc. A lot of slang and !  etc. I almost forgot the most offensive part of the movie for those politically correct tobacco Nazis. Almost everyone including Whoopi is shown smoking and smoking and enjoying it!!! That's right kids it was a widely practiced social interaction between people especially the opposite sex. Just look at it as a time travel back to the 1980's sex drugs and rock and road were still alive and well big hair and all the rest. You either love it or hate it.".

The protagonist is a small meek cheerfully dressed sixtysomething woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's who has to look after her troublesome grandson dramatically connected with a shocking event in the small Korean city where they live. It's a slow movie which leaves ample scope to the unsaid and the unwritten but dripping with strong and deep humanity. Mija reveals such determination in her simple and peaceful going on holding on she proves the real strength of real strong people that strength that does not need any evident outward demonstrations but only the inner will of a meek nature who continues to see the beauty of a flower or the perfection of an apple and the beauty of poetry of course against the ugliness of men and here the ugliness of a male chauvinist society is to be underlined. The movie reveals such delicacy such subtlety and tact while approaching the most disturbing topics that we as viewers can manage everything feeling a kind of respect towards us and feeling also grateful for that. Great work by the director Lee Changdong then and standing ovation for Yun Junghee for her intense poignant stunning interpretation of Mija. The last shots on her finally achieved poem are petrifying and soothing at the same time showing an incredible emotional intensity. These are movies that should reach the big screen more often and more widely.".

	schema:reviewBody "In recent weeks five teenagers have killed themselves as a result of bullying. A new poll has indicated that slightly more than a third of teens in the U.S. personally have been subjected to bullying behavior. In the poll more than twothirds of teens also said their friends about been bullied. Yet a majority of adults according to the poll believe bullying is a minor problem or not a problem at all. In the macho society we live in and tolerate women are even more likely to be victims than men. In Lee Changdong's latest film Poetry winner of the award for Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival a young girl commits suicide after being repeatedly raped by a group of juveniles. Sadly the fathers of the other boys are only interested in protecting their sons from prosecution silencing the press and school officials and collecting enough money to pay off the girl's mother.Like Secret Sunshine Poetry revolves around a woman mourning the death of a child although here it is not her own. The idea for the film had its origin in a true case where a small town schoolgirl had been raped by a gang of teenage boys. In contrast to the grandmother in BongJoonho's Mother who refused to believe her son was responsible for a murder Mija a 66year old played by Yung Jungee in her first role in 16 years learns from the fathers of the other boys that her 16year old grandson Wook Lee Dawit was one of the six people involved in the rape and wishes to pursue justice. Though Mija privately knows that it is more important for the boys including her own to acknowledge their role in the crime living in the maledominated middle class Korean society she reluctantly tries to raise her share of the payoff money but expresses her feelings in not wanting to participate by the look on her face and by abruptly walking out of meetings.Rebelling against society's norms comes naturally to Lee's characters even though they have suffered a terrible loss or in the case of Mija is beginning to suffer the effects of encroaching dementia. Always dressed in flowery clothes and looking cheerful Mija takes care of Wook in the absence of his mother who is divorced and living in Pusan and she supports herself by taking care of a strokeridden elderly man. Unfortunately Wook spends most of his time on his computer or cell phone and there is little communication between grandmother and grandson. Aside from screaming at Wook Why did you do it? Mija does not attempt to engage in conversation with the boy about treating others with civility and respect nor apparently do the fathers of the other boys talk to their sons about their atrocious behavior.After seeing a poster that reminds her that one of her teachers once told her that she had a vein for poetry Mija on a whim enrolls in a poetry class and the film follows her attempt to write a single poem before the class ends. Some of the most affecting scenes in the film are the discussions in the poetry class led by their teacher who tells them poetry does not require a special time or place or even inspiration it only requires seeing the world as if for the first time and asks the class to share their memory of the most beautiful time in their life. Another poignant moment is when Mija meets the mother of the deceased girl Park Myeongsin in a field and establishes a relationship based on the world that they see around them even though she neglects to ask her if she would accept a cash settlement the reason she went to visit her.Lamenting the fact that poetry is a dying art Lee challenges us to see the beauty and the transcendence beyond the pain of the modern world. Speaking at a press conference he said Poetry is not just like a bouquet of flowers that is beautiful in itself he says. It is life. No matter the ugliness of the world there's always something beautiful inside. That's what I wanted to show. Lee succeeds in showing us the beauty beneath the ugliness and the fact that regardless of our age or circumstances we have the ability to transform our lives. Yet the question must be raised  would not Mija have made more of a difference if she had engaged in a quiet conversation with her morallychallenged grandson about knowing why it is wrong to be reckless with the lives of others than in waxing poetic about flowers and fruits or even life and death?".

	schema:reviewBody "What a wonderful film! To give my personal answer to one interviewer's question Do you regard cinema too to be a dying form? to the director Lee ChangDong. I believe and deeply hope that as long as films like Poetry are being made cinema will continue to flourish because it is important. It will continue to exist as long as humans exist because they are about being human. I was struck by how masterfully two sides of our humanness were presented in the film. On the one hand it is about our search for beauty as beauty can only be experienced if something of our own potential beauty responds to the beauty around us. There is something spiritual in this as Beauty and Truth are essentially one. On the other hand there is the human predicament. That includes the pro and cons of the fact that we always have the choice to decide if we act ethically or not. That means if we actually say Yes to what is intrinsically our positive potential or we say No and harm others our environment and as a kind of end result ourselves. What for me links the two is impermanence. Old age illness and suicide as it is shown in the film. Everything that is born will have to die goes a very old Buddhist saying and that happens no matter if we like it or not. At the same time would we experience beauty if everything was to exist forever? Is it not because a beautiful flower grows out of a very simple looking seed in spring and then withers away after some weeks that it can become so precious to us? Without impermanence there is one could say by definition no beauty. Both are somehow the two sides of the same metaphorical coin. The same is true about this film. It still lingers on in my heart and mind weeks after I saw it. Very much like a true and wonderful poem for example Rainer Maria Rilke's First Duino Elegy. It is is just about that the wonder and horror of beauty.".

I believe and deeply hope that as long as films like Poetry are being made cinema will continue to flourish because it is important. It will continue to exist as long as humans exist because they are about being human. I was struck by how masterfully two sides of our humanness were presented in the film. On the one hand it is about our search for beauty as beauty can only be experienced if something of our own potential beauty responds to the beauty around us. There is something spiritual in this as Beauty and Truth are essentially one. On the other hand there is the human predicament. That includes the pro and cons of the fact that we always have the choice to decide if we act ethically or not. That means if we actually say Yes to what is intrinsically our positive potential or we say No and harm others our environment and as a kind of end result ourselves. What for me links the two is impermanence. Old age illness and suicide as it is shown in the film. Everything that is born will have to die goes a very old Buddhist saying and that happens no matter if we like it or not. At the same time would we experience beauty if everything was to exist forever? Is it not because a beautiful flower grows out of a very simple looking seed in spring and then withers away after some weeks that it can become so precious to us? Without impermanence there is one could say by definition no beauty. Both are somehow the two sides of the same metaphorical coin. The same is true about this film. It still lingers on in my heart and mind weeks after I saw it. Very much like a true and wonderful poem for example Rainer Maria Rilke's First Duino Elegy. It is is just about that the wonder and horror of beauty.";

	schema:reviewBody "First let it be emphasized as stated above that this review contains spoilers some quite major ones at that so if you have not seen this movie and intend to do so I'd advise you to skip this piece for now.Last year I had the good fortune of seeing the rarelyscreened albeit oftenpraised Brazilian silent film LIMITE and it left me in a state of mind where it seemed quite stupid to say anything about it as no written word could do it justice. This reaction is not necessarily a negative thing providing that you defy it and write something anyway. The next time a film had this effect on me was a few days ago with Lee Changdong's POETRY. Made some eighty years after the former I won't compare the two films other than noting that I think both at least indirectly cover a sort of identical inner subject beauty within ugliness. Both films are extremely visual LIMITE inescapably so as it is a silent film whereas POETRY confirms that also in this day and age the power of the spoken word is ultimately dependent on our ability to use it sparingly and let what can only be seen felt and smelled remain only seen felt and smelled. Lee Changdong one of the most promising Korean directors around these days understands this as he brutally deprives us of the comforting accessibility found in whoknowshowmany Hollywoodfilms and instead presents to us something which is maddeningly cruel and frustrating but equally inspiring and peaceful.Mija brilliantly portrayed by Jeonhie Yun in what seems to be her first performance in a number of years is a poor elderly woman who is trying to raise her muchtroubled grandson. Being a victim of the largely maledominant society still present in some Asian cultures she is unable to respond with much else than personal frustration when realizing that the fathers of a group of boys responsible for the raping of a girl which led to the latter committing suicide are concerned about nothing else than the futures of their own sons her own grandson is among the suspects. Apparently the fathers are incapable of feeling any genuine sorrow on behalf of the girl and her family and arrange it so that the relatives of the victim are paid a certain sum of money to get the problem out of the world and avoid that the police gets involved. While Mija undergoes this extremely difficult time she tries to complete a poetry course but feels unable to write satisfactorily. She is explained by the teacher a wellknown poet that writing poetry should not be about seeking a moment of inspiration but to SEE THINGS experience their shapes and forms. She tries to little availfor a considerable time.This leads me to one of the most poignant scenes in the film and one that tempted a few tears out of me. During one of the poetry lessons the attendants are asked to share their most beautiful moment in life. As we hear their experiences it is startling to notice that several of the stories consist of things which if solely observed from the outside would appear sad or even ugly but when said memories are being projected through the minds of their beholder they will often become beautiful in some confusing inexplainable manner. As Mija realizes this she manages to write one profound deeply moving poem dedicated to the poor girl who committed suicide she finds beauty within ugliness. I do not need to stress that a suicide the earthly departure of an unfortunate soul as a result of terrible circumstances is NOT in any possible way a beautiful thing. But when the immediate shock and frustration following such a tragedy has begun to fade and the gradual distance between the present and the tragedy makes the victim reappear in our consciousness again as something more than a victim but as the smiles laughs shapes and colors which also once defined this person it may evoke a feeling of beauty. I wasn't very conscious of this while the movie played but I did indeed begin to think of sad but beautiful memories as this scene went on and afterwards.POETRY is a film which invites you to enter a certain state of mind and demands that you stay there at least as long as the film running. At two and a half hours it may sound long but the fact is that I didn't think of the time. One thing worth noting is that the film does not have a soundtrack beyond occasional noise from the records of the grandson yet I felt that it largely gave me a sort of musical experience if I was to do something so banal as to compare it to a musical piece I'd probably choose Shastro's Tale of the Sands. Much more could be said but wellI feel stupid enough already!".

Mija is a sixtysix year old suffering from early onset Alzheimer's disease who lives in a rural Korean town with her indolent teen aged grandson Jongwook. In an attempt to stimulate her cognitive abilities she enrolls in a poetry class. Things are looking up until she learns that her grandson was involved in the suicide of one of his classmates. Jongwook and some of his friends had been sexually abusing a classmate and this drove the young girl to take her life. Soon Mija is contacted by the fathers of the boys and learns that they want to pay the girl's mother a large sum of money to keep her from going to the authorities. In her poetry class at the community center Mija learns that in order to create poetry one must learn 'to observe' 'to notice' and 'to witness'. The need for a heightened awareness or sensibility becomes the compelling dichotomy of the film. We observe that the fathers only focus on the ramifications of the incident on the lives of their sons while Mija becomes moved and deeply empathizes with the loss of this innocent young girl to her family and the community. And in the end Mija forces her grandson to face up to his responsibility and she also constructs a loving and heartfelt poetic eulogy for the young girl. And in a remarkable way of relating these two crucial events the character of Mija is not even present as the actions unfold. Director Changdong Lee delivers a wonderful film which touches on a wide range of difficult subjects poetry dementia sexual abuse and suicide and casts an elderly semiretired Korean actress as the star of the film. However these kinds of mature topics and deliberate presentation are out of favor in Hollywood and unpopular with contemporary film audiences. I'm afraid that this film will never garner much commercial success but if you take the time 'to witness' you will enjoy a truly rewarding cinematic experience.".

The inspiration is difficult to come by and external events will accentuate the duality of seeing life as an observer while also being an essential actor. The multilayered story has poetry dialogue imagery and much time for reflection. The film builds up to the last poem Agnes' Song by Mija Yang the protagonist which is powerful and perfect.

She's not bad at badminton either! It's actually the way the film contrasts several issues the modern contemporary ones that give the film its backbone the age difference clashes with the grandson and the lyrical  but unsentimental  softer side and you get a modest and modern masterpiece.Avoid if only Iron Man 2 can move you.

	schema:reviewBody "Not a lot of people probably have saw Shiaka Poetry due to its limited opening in theaters and the fact that the movie is in Korean. Those who did see the film probably have the same feeling like me it's a beautiful influential film. I think the movie title can be a bit misleading just as much as the trailer. While it's does have an elderly woman name Yang Mija Yun Junghee struggles with new vocabulary and the challenges of the creative process trying to write one poem while struggling Alzheimer's disease. It's Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival's story is mostly about something else. This South Korean film written and directed by Lee Changdong is mostly about the elderly woman having to deal with her grandson's Jong Wook Dawit Lee actions. She discover that her grandson along with his five male friends might have over a period of six months repeatedly raped a girl at their school. The victim left a diary at home before committing suicide by tossing herself off a bridge into a river. The movie opens up with the powerful image of children playing near the river only to find that a lifeless body is floating in the water with little to no soundtrack. The diary is discovered and in order to avert a full police investigation the parents of the boys offer to pay a settlement to the family affected. The film deals with the fact that Mija must chose to expose the crime or hide it from the public. Only by using poetry does she find her answer to that question. Lee wrote the lead character specifically for Yoon Jeonghee a major star of Korean cinema from the 1960s and 1970s. Yoon Jeonghee is perfect in the role despite the fact that she hasn't act in a film in 16 years. There was some many subplots that it can be overwhelming. Examples are Mija having to deal with the behavior of the elderly stroke victim M. Kang Hira Kim for whom she cleans and cares a couple of times a week and her having poverty problems to make the amount for the settlement that her grandson friend's father Naesang Ahn is asking. At less in the end it all connects in a powerful ending with Agnes' Song poem by the protagonist. I cried to tears when watched Poetry ant the very end when the old lady reads her first poem. An extraordinary vision of human empathy Indeed empathy should be the name of this film however I believe the poet must have empathy sensibility compassion and understanding about every little think something most do not have and we need to learn it like the old lady did. The director leaves a lot of loose ends in the end of the film letting the viewer form his or her own interpretation of what happened and what it means. The film is beautifully shot with some great cinematography. The scene with Mija looking at the bridge that the girl jump off is very commanding and get you emotional into the film. The idea for the film had its origin in a true event where a small town schoolgirl had been raped by a gang of teenage boys. Some of the faults of the film might be its slow pace. A little on the long side at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I think if they had cut about 1015 minutes from this movie it would have worked much better. There are a lot of scenes with little to no dialogue. It's really does seem like an unrated International Art House film with a lot of poetry reading scenes that has nothing to do with the main plot. I think those scenes were used just to lecture people how poetry should be people's life more. I think humanity would be in such a better place if we alongside the sciences also learned poetry as a fundamental part of our education. Not just reading poetry but writing it living it and being completely free in it. Very inspiring part of the film but not really needed. Overall Extraordinary film totally took me by surprise. Sadly it didn't win or wasn't nominated for Best Foreign film for the Academy Award. In my opinion I think it's the best foreign film of 2010. It really deserves a Oscar win that year. Although not for everyone those who enjoy cinematic experiences can definitely be taken away by this movie. The acting was beautiful and it was heartbreaking and touching at the same time. One of the best films of the year.".

He won't acknowledge his crimes but Grandma has to deal with them herself. Meanwhile she tries as hard as she can to find solace in the poetry class which she has recently signed up for though she has huge problems finding beauty in the world at this point.

However the cinematography is ultrafine with some very lush scenery and Yun Junghee is just superb as Mija a 66yearold poetatheart who has just been diagnosed with Alzheimer's and is also beset with a troublesome grandson who along with five of his friends is part of a serious scandal involving the suicide of a female classmate. This is a truly poignant film that succeeds in being artsy without being the least bit pretentious. Anyone interested in poetryingeneral should like POETRY.".

	schema:reviewBody "We just came home from seeing the lovely South Korean movie Poetry starring Jeonghie Yun as Mija a 66yearold woman who is raising her grandson Wook Dawit Lee alone in a smallish town while her daughter Wook's mother is working in the big city of Busan. As the film opens we see a beautiful river with some children playing nearby until one child spots a corpse floating in the river. It turns out to be the body of a 16yearold girl who has committed suicide. Leaving that scene we find Mija in a hospital complaining to the doctor about a sensation in her arm that is bothering her and oh yes she's having trouble remembering words too. The doctor tells her to exercise for the arm condition but he refers her to a larger hospital in Seoul to test her memory. As the story plays out Mija finds that she must cope with the heinous activities of her grandson her gradually progressing dementia her ongoing poverty and the behaviour of the elderly man apparently a stroke victim for whom she cleans and cares a couple of times a week. To help settle her mind she decides to take a poetry class at the local community center a monthlong class in which the teacher proclaims that everybody will be asked to write a poem by the end of the sessions. Mija takes in all the advice about really seeing what is in her environment and writing down her feelings about the things she is observing but still she feels unable to write a poem. She keeps trying though through all her trials and tribulations....I don't want to say much more about this film because I don't want to give anything away but I will say that it moves in directions I did not expect. It is a long film almost 2 12 hours and it's got a very languid pace I almost want to say that not much happens in it but in fact a lot does happen it's just that it happens slowly over time without any ferocious outburst of action or jumpcutting or all the frenetic film work we're used to seeing in North America. No this is a quiet film that takes it's time. It's beautifully photographed by Hyun Seok Kim and the writerdirector Changdong Lee allows the marvelous actress Jeonghie Yun to gradually reveal the multiple layers of this richly observed character. I suppose it's mostly a character study really and the character of Mija is one we really come to know and respect and even love. It's sad very sad in parts but it's just so beautiful and heartfelt that the sadness seems just the way it should be. I know it's been playing in cities throughout North America a bit at a time and if it comes to your town you really should make an effort to see it.".

Poetry is one such film of the last category.The plot has been discussed by others so I will not dwell into it. Throughout this film one also gains an insight into the modernday Korean society a young divorced mother leaving her teenage son to her ageing mother to care for full time while she is in a different city pursuing a career her independence and perhaps happiness. A raw deal for the grandmother Mija but I have a feeling this not uncommon. A group of men fathers of teenage boys who have repeatedly bullied sexually a girl are more concerned with paying off the victim's mother so their sons can move on in life without showing the slightest of remorse toward the victim's family. Very unpleasant and yet believable in any maledominant society.Still the 'hero' in this film is an old woman one that is poor but still has an appreciation for beauties in nature and in poetry.At 140 minutes this is one long film. If you are in the right frame of mind this film is a great way to kill an evening meaningfully. Good acting a good script and surefooted directing by Lee Changdong pull together what first appeared to be disconnected events together to make great drama. The ending may be a bit puzzling for some but I find it to be very appropriate.Highly recommended for fans of contemporary Korean cinema or just good cinema in general.".

The story blends regular cruel dirty life with a poetic spirit and a dilemma that the main character should decide about.

And the fascinating fact about this movie is that the poetic flavour and ethic aspect are merged very beautifully together in that interesting story. The stories like this usually do not attract the audiences after one hour and half and this fact is mainly because poetic movies do not follow a good story. As an Iranian I should mention the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami whose movies sadly do not deserve to be seen because of the lack of a good story. The length of a film should have a direct relation with the strength of the story. This is the reason that Kiarostami should be a photographer than a director and it seems that he has understood this fact! About the ethic aspect of the story I should just mention that it concerns the ethic despite religion and this abstract view has helped the movie a lot to connect with foreign audiences although the special literature that the film is made on is far from the world of the audience. To put everything in a nut shell I should just narrate my sadness after leaving the movie theater.

	schema:reviewBody "It's well known that Alfred Hitchcock had a penchant for casting icy blondes as his leading ladies but it's often forgotten Doris Day was once one of them. In The Man Who Knew Too Much the pronunciation of which was forever immortalized by Robert Osbourne she's married to James Stewart another of Hitchcock's favorites. In a rare dramatic turn Doris shows her hidden talents. There's a famous and heartwrenching scene that's nearly impossible to watch without a tissue handy. Doris and Jimmy's son has been kidnapped and Doris is having a meltdown. James injects her with a sedative because he's a doctor and believes that's the best way to help her and she hysterically cries until she passes out. While Doris usually gets all the acting praise from this movie it's probably because everyone expects James Stewart to be great in a Hitchcock film. But let's not forget he was the other actor in that difficult scene watching and deciding how to help his wife. He's wonderful in this movie but if you know and love him like the rest of the country it's not really a surprise.The Man Who Knew Too Much isn't the most famous Alfred Hitchcock movie out there but it's absolutely worth watching. It has Doris's quintessential song Que Sera Sera and she also credits it with spawning her lifelong devotion to animals. Plus it's pretty suspenseful a necessity in a Hitchcock movie. There are exotic locations goodlooking leading actors murder and intrigue. What else do you want?".

	schema:reviewBody "Both versions of Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much have their strong points and are well worth watching.  This 1950's remake is carried mostly by its star power with Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day being convincing and very sympathetic as the parents of the kidnapped child.  It also has more lavish settings and better not just because it is color photography than the earlier version.  On the other hand it lacks the wittiness of the British version and moves more slowly.The remake spends much more time setting up the story than the original did with the family spending a lot of time on their vacation in Morocco before the crisis occurs.  It makes possible some colorful scenery and settings and allows you to get to know the family a bit more although the quicker pace in the original established more tension and kept your attention throughout.  The Albert Hall sequence works well in both films with this one having the added bonus of allowing the audience to see Bernard Herrmann who wrote so many great scores for Hitchcock's films conducting the orchestra.Despite having essentially the same story the two versions of The Man Who Knew Too Much have a much different feel.  Which one you prefer is largely a matter of taste  while neither is usually considered among Hitchcock's very best they are both good movies with a lot of strong points.  Take a look at both if you have the chance.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original The Man Who Knew Too Much brought Alfred Hitchcock acclaim for the first time outside of the United Kingdom. Of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how Hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish Hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen. The original film was shot inside a studio.For whatever reason he chose this of all his films to remake Hitchcock now with an international reputation and a big Hollywood studio behind him Paramountdecided to see what The Man Who Knew Too Much would be like with a lavish budget. This is shot on location in Marrakesh and London and has two big international names for box office. This was James Stewart's third of four Hitchcock films and his only teaming with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film.I do wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance she would fit the profile of blond leading ladies that Hitchcock favored. Possibly because her wholesome screen image was at odds with the sophistication Hitchcock also wanted in his blondes. Doris does some of her best acting ever in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her doctor husband James Stewart gives her a sedative before telling her their son has been kidnapped by an English couple who befriended them in Morocco. Stewart and Day play off each other beautifully in that scene. But Doris especially as she registers about four different emotions at once. Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco and they make the acquaintance of Frenchman Daniel Gelin and the aforementioned English couple Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzie. Gelin is stabbed in the back at a market place in Marrakesh and whispers some dying words to Stewart about an assassination to take place in Albert Hall in London. Their child is snatched in order to insure their silence.For the only time I can think of a hit song came out of a Hitchcock film. Doris in fact plays a noted singer who retired from the stage to be wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera and I remember it well at the age of 9. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing it in 1956 it even competed with the fast rising Elvis Presley that year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song beating out such titles as True Love from High Society and the title song from Around the World in 80 Days. It became Doris Day's theme song for the rest of her life and still is should she ever want to come back.In fact the song is worked quite nicely into the plot as Doris sings it at an embassy party at the climax.Instead of doing it with mirrors Hitchcock shot the assassination scene at the real Albert Hall and like another reviewer said it's not directed it's choreographed. You'll be hanging on your seats during that moment.This was remake well worth doing.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you start watching the 1956 version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH you'll think it's a minor work by Alfred Hitchcock.  The countless scenes showing a lovely but buffoonish vacationing American couple James Stewart Doris Day seem to lead nowhere.  But hold on about thirty minutes into the film during a very dreamlike murder sequence which takes place in bright sunlight and involves blue paint the film really takes off. Personally I find the opening character development sequence between protagonists James Stewart and Doris Day very charming.  It sets you up for the second and third acts of the film.  You get to like this couple so much you are raelly rooting for them as they try to rescue their kidnapped son amidst a plot to assassinate a visiting diplomat.  Of course the highpoint of the film is the assassination itself a twelve minute wordless sequence. Hitchcock beautifully brings us back to silent film!  The ending which involves a rescue at an embassy is wonderfully silly and tense. For those not familiar with Hitchcock this is Hitchcock's own remake of a film he made under the same title in 1934 in England.   This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.  It's proof that this master loved his audience and wanted to keep them thrilled!".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike most people I actually feel that The Man is at its strongest in the Morocco sequences at the beginning of the film particularly the wonderful restaurant sequence much of which seems have been adlibbed but probably wasn't. Once the son of Stewart and Day has been kidnapped and they fly to London the film becomes messy although the Albert Hall sequence is admittedly well executed.Most of my criticisms of the film revolve around the plot not to mention Day's interminable singing of Que Sera Sera such as why does Louis Bernard when he is dying not tell James Stewart about the English couple Mr  Mrs Drayton but only tell them the name of the chapel in London where they live? I suppose the answer is because Stewart and Day would not have allowed Mrs Drayton to then take their son and there would have been no kidnap and no film. Also the information that Stewart has about the assassination ceases to be important once he and Day confront the Draytons at the chapel and Day calls the police. At that point in the film Stewart has actually passed on everything he knows to the police i.e. the name of the chapel and the fact that someone will be assassinated. Why do the kidnappers still need his son? He has nothing left to say.With regard to the chapel itself there is the ridiculous confusion regarding the name Ambrose Chapel. Any right thinking person would realise it is a place and not a person. Yet Stewart thinks Ambrose Chapel is a person and amazingly manages to find the name listed in the telephone directory doctors in Indiana obviously don't have to be too bright. The film then goes through the pointless confrontation at the Taxidermists between Stewart and TWO men named Ambrose Chapel  how stupid.Notwithstanding these problems The Man is a decent film. Stewart puts in a very good performance as always and there are some nice scenes but this is well short of Hitchcock's best films and even some of his less regarded films such as Rope. I haven't seen the original 1934 version of The Man so I don't know how it compares to the 1956 remake. The general consensus is that the remake is far superior  if that's true I don't think I'll be rushing out to see the original any time soon even if it does star Peter Lorre.".

	schema:headline " The master of thrills delivers another thrilling masterwork....almost";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twentyone years earlier is infinitely superior to the original. Hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur and although it certainly isn't a bad film he does appear to be right. That being said this remake although definitely better still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. That's certainly not to say that it isn't good it's just more than a little overindulgent and that drags it down. Hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying. Some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our American protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.The plot follows a middleaged doctor and his wife that go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While there they meet a French man on the bus and another middleaged couple in a restaurant. However things go awry when the French man dies from a knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to London in order to try and find him. The film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through. In fact I would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. There is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well.The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre. This film doesn't benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him and this one is no different. Although his best performance remains the one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Stewart conveys all the courage conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. In fact that's one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. Doris Day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little.As I've mentioned this is not Hitchcock's best film but there's much to enjoy about it and although I'd recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this one I'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.".

That being said this remake although definitely better still isn't among Hitchcock's best work. That's certainly not to say that it isn't good it's just more than a little overindulgent and that drags it down. Hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying. Some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees James Stewart and Doris Day eating in a Moroccan restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our American protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse.The plot follows a middleaged doctor and his wife that go to Morocco for a holiday with their young son. While there they meet a French man on the bus and another middleaged couple in a restaurant. However things go awry when the French man dies from a knife in the back shortly after whispering something to the doctor. The holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the couple's son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to London in order to try and find him. The film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through. In fact I would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that Hitchcock ever made. Like most of Hitchcock's films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is diffused. There is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well.The original version of this story was lent excellent support by the fantastic Peter Lorre. This film doesn't benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing James Stewart and Doris Day. James Stewart is a man that is always going to be a contender for the 'greatest actor of all time' crown. His collaborations with Hitchcock all feature mesmerising performances from him and this one is no different. Although his best performance remains the one in Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Stewart conveys all the courage conviction and heartbreak of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly. In fact that's one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the couple's loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling. Doris Day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie. She's definitely a good actress but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to flex her vocal chords a little.As I've mentioned this is not Hitchcock's best film but there's much to enjoy about it and although I'd recommend many Hitchcock films before recommending this one I'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "Just when I had convinced myself that Alfred Hitchcock didn't make any clunkers during the fifties I decided to watch 'The Man Who Knew Too Much. Maybe 'clunker' is too strong a word but this is definitely one of Hitchcock's lesser films. It is ponderous with phony suspense illplaced humor and Doris Day singing 'Que Sera Sera'... twice. There are to be sure some typical Hitchcock touches but not enough to sustain this overblown twohour melodrama. Which is really what it feels like more than the thriller or international intrigue it was meant to be. James Stewart is fine in the lead his performance is better than the material. It would be easy to say Doris Day is overwrought in her portrayal but again it is really the script that fails her. I don't know that any other actress could have done better. The film veers from feverishly serious to clumsily comedic often in the same scene. A problem here is the subject matter. All parents' worst nightmare is the thought of their young child being kidnapped and placed in danger and that is exactly what happens. Stewart and Day go from being greatly worried one moment to making silly banter the next and it just doesn't work. Day in fact often has a confused look on her face as though she doesn't know HOW she's supposed to react. The climactic scene in the Royal Albert Hall is beautiful to look at and provides the added treat of having famed film composer Bernard Herrman actually conduct the orchestra but as a suspense setpiece it is completely ineffective. The scenes following it not only feel superfluous but during the second rousing rendition of 'Que Sera Sera' are also almost unbearably interminable. The standingaround and emotional handwringing in this movie really grow quite tedious. When the boy starts whistling from upstairs you'd think nothing could stop Stewart from running up to free him but no he just stands there impatiently decorum apparently demanding he wait till the end of the song. 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' just goes to prove that even a Master sometimes comes up short.".

	schema:headline " the famous twelveminute sequence at the Albert Hall alone is enough to demand an audience for this richly entertaining thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1956 Alfred Hitchcock owed a film to Paramount Studios and was given the task of remaking not just any film but one of his own. That film was his 1934 movie The Man Who Knew Too Much which starred Leslie Banks and Edna Best as vacationing parents who unwillingly become involved in an international espionage involving an assassination plot. In order to keep their mouths shut foreign spies kidnap their daughter and hold her hostage. Hitchcock was in no particular hurry to tell the same story again but he did owe Paramount a movie and proceeded to do it again. But like a professional he did not simply tell the same story. He used the same plot and circumstances but generated a newer better film with a fresher story from his 1934 hit. This time casting the always competent James Stewart and the lovely Doris Day as the vacationing parents and having a son  not daughter being kidnapped Hitchcock created one of his most underrated films that I think deserves to be placed alongside his lists of masterpieces.This was the third of the four movies that Hitchcock made with James Stewart and this is the one that is the least dark and the most freespirited. It is not a dark twisted movie like Vertigo or Rear Window nor is it as good as the said features but it's one of the director's most thoroughly enjoyable movies. It takes a serious tone but also has carefully placed moments of comedy that do generate laughs. Hitchcock was a gifted and versatile filmmaker who has entries in his filmography that should accommodate for all mainstreams in the audience. And for those who just want Hitchcock as an exciting adventurous level this is the movie I recommend.Part of the reason why I enjoy this more than the original is that I like the parents in the movie more. We get more threedimensional development from them this time and we sense the struggle to find their son and possibly save a diplomat's life if they can. The movie is held up by the performances by James Stewart and Doris Day. This is the least dark Stewart was in the four movies he had with Hitchcock and it's probably the most conventional performances he did for the Master of Suspense but nevertheless a very good one. He is totally believably and competent as the frantic but coolheaded father in love with his family. But what shocks me so much is that in reviews people oftentimes overlook Doris Day who I think is just as good as Jimmy Stewart. I'm enthralled by the enthusiasm and the energy that she puts behind her performance. Yes Day is beautiful but she's also a more than competent actress who carries out her scenes especially her emotionally and distressful ones with absolute perfection.If there is a weakness in the movie it does relate to the villains whom we don't see very often but that's part of what makes this movie work. Because we don't see the villains often we sympathize and follow the parents played by Stewart and Day better than if we toggled frequently between both sides. Hitchcock always liked to play against conventions and it shows here. That's another one of the minor differences this has from the original which did jump between parties more often.And if you're seeking Alfred Hitchcock performing his art of suspenseyou will find it here never you fear. Hitchcock believed in a theory called pure cinema in which you did not need sound or dialogue merely images to generate any emotion. And there is one very famous scene in this movie taking place at the Royal Albert Hall in London which proves this theory. Hitchcock tells us what to look for  but not the protagonists  and this builds up tension that can go on for as long as he wants to. The scene goes on for twelve minutes  twelve minutes  and every moment of it is sheer suspense coupled with powerful emotion. And there's no dialogue. The sound is dominated by the music. It's very much like watching a silent movie. And it's the most powerful scene in the picture.The original The Man With No Name is one of the most interesting examples of Hitchcock's career as an amateur but the remake done by a professional is vastly superior and infinitely entertaining. If I do have a complaint it's the last thirty seconds of the movie which wrap up a little suddenly but the previous two hours were so much fun I easily forgive that and enthusiastically shell out my highest rating. The Man With No Name is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock saw this remake of his 1934 film as a more professional job and thus an improvement. It's certainly more polished and pitched for maximum audience engagement yet also a tad off the high standard the Master was setting for himself by the 1950s.Dr. McKenna James Stewart and his wife Jo Doris Day are vacationing with their boy in Marrakesh when they become witnesses both to a murder and to a secret so dangerous their boy is kidnapped to secure their silence. Can they save their child by themselves? And will they be able to prevent the crime from happening without costing their son his life?It's tough to discuss this movie since so much that happens in it is better seen for the first time with minimal foreknowledge. Rest assured that there are some fine setpieces on display and that Hitchcock is indeed very clever with his camera and his way of building suspense.Yet the film seems less than completely successful. For one thing there's an unusually slow buildup almost a Hitchcock loyalty test in the first thirty minutes of the film with some particularly strained bits of comedy around a Moroccan restaurant. There are more than the usual number of plot holes and improbable coincidences on display here.The biggest problem I have are with the two leads. While Day shows us she can be more than a perky comedienne in her more demanding scenes both she and Stewart seem uncomfortable in their roles. The McKennas appear at times to be a singularly unhappy couple he a domineering type who doesn't like the fact his wife was a famous singer known by something other than his last name she a paranoid hysteric prone to winding her husband up unnecessarily. The idea of their domestic misery is gently presented Ben are we about to have our monthly fight? and then just as quickly abandoned ironically after a scene where he arguably pulls a rather cruel stunt to keep her in line.I'm not sure if this GeorgeandMarthatype film would have been better than the one I actually saw but it would give us more of a rooting interest in the McKennas getting their act together while saving their son. Here in the main they are played so squarely they seem more likely to hail from Disneyland than Indianapolis.But give the second hour credit for being one of Hitchcock's best. It could have used a bit more humor but there's ample misdirection and a mischievous spirit guiding the proceedings. Add to that one of the great climaxes of any suspense film here ironically not a climax here but a set up for another which is almost as good. The villains are appropriately seedy if lacking the menacing charm of Peter Lorre in the 1934 version.If you are a fan of Doris Day or her hit song Que Sera Sera you may enjoy this film even more than I did. As a Hitchcock enthusiast I was entertained enough not to mind the feeling of shallowness. Hitchcock was a master of surfaces as well as depth you get a riveting example of the former here.".

Mr. Hitchcock was lucky in having collaborators that went with him from one film to the next thus keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and George Tomasini's editing shows his talent. Ultimately Bernard Herrmann is seen conducting at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the picture.James Stewart was an actor that worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him they are on their way to Marrakesh in one local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the lovely Doris Day at her best. She had been a well known singer before her marriage and now is the perfect wife and mother. The film has some good supporting cast Brenda DeBanzie Bernard Miles Daniel Gelin Alan Mowbray among others do a great job in portraying their characters.Although this is a light Hitchcock one can't dismiss it as a failure. The Man Who Knew Too Much is a change of pace for Hitchcock's fans.".

	schema:headline " Hitchcock!  The Musical";
	schema:reviewBody "A film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception  It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings!  Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most underrated film and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.This is in more ways than one Doris Day's film. Not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against James Stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is after all a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horsedrawn carriage over her concerns about Louis Bernard implying that she is jealous that Bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career. This is clearly a recurrent joke between them  she responds with a 'hardeharhar' that denotes the familiarity of this gag suggesting that she has a certain latent resentment about her confinement and that they both realise it.After their son has been kidnapped Stewart insists on doping her before giving her the news. This is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power imbalance in their marriage  he is seeking to control and subdue her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has suppressed her singing career.The potency of that voice is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the congregation of female drudges  they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to suppress her talent. At the Albert Hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive lungs that saves a man's life and in the Embassy finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son. By contrast all of Stewart's masculine activity is counterproductive  his visit to the taxidermist is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the Albert Hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus depriving the Police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice in the rescue of Hank from the embassy that he actually succeeds in doing something useful.Far from being forced into the film to give Day an opportunity to sing 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical device in the film foreshadowing the nightmare that is about to engulf the McKennas 'the future's not ours to see' indeed. It also neatly prepares the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow Doris to save the day.The most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature  the build up to the assassination attempt in the Albert Hall. This lengthy wordless sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing Hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually. We see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say. We don't need to  the images say everything. It is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly. There isn't a frame out of place  anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the geography in which all this is playing out. It builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable. When Jo screams it isn't just a relief for her but for the audience.The Ambrose Chapel sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stickinthemud Nonconformist church. The Embassy sequence seems a little flat after the Albert Hall one that preceded it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at gunpoint really benefiting from the gorgeous use of Day singing in the background reminiscent of the musicasambientnoise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from onscreen sources to be foregrounded effectively.Bernard Miles is a lowkey villain a little banal but with a dry wit. He's outshone by Brenda de Banzie as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette whilst her husband preps the assassin  her stance is pure gangster's moll belying the MiddleEngland exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank.Stewart is excellent although if Hitchcock really did always cast him as 'Everyman' as the Director's daughter seems to think then it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who espoused fascist ideology in Rope a voyeur who mistreated his girlfriend in Rear Window and an obsessive necrophiliac in Vertigo. Day is nothing short of phenomenal. Just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped  she never overdoes anything but neither does she sell it short. This is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the stakes are for the McKennas they feel the most fully human of all his central characters.".

It is hard to imagine a clumsier sight than this plus it makes his character seem particularly stupid. Another scene is when the little boy is told to whistle in order to attract his mother's attention. This is so contrived as to make one shudder in disbelief. Finally there is the matter of Doris Day. She simply is not believable in a socalled serious role and her constant whining of Que Sera Sera eventually makes one want to throw rocks at the TV.

In fact had it been so categorised I would probably have watched it with a totally different mindset and this review might have read quite differently.The whole story is farcically unbelievable. OK I know it is a remake of an older movie but it had obviously been updated as evidenced by the cars and aircraft shown in it. I cannot believe that Scotland Yard Special Branch police officers were ever as incompetent as portrayed here. In fact I'm surprised that there wasn't an official complaint from The Yard to Mr Hitchcock for showing them thus in what was supposed to be a serious thriller.The story is unbelievable and as another reviewer has already written an insult to high calibre actors such as Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. Is there any record of their embarrassment at being sucked into this?. The cameo by Richard Wattis a onetime very funny British actor may have given anyone looking at the cast an inkling that this was a farce but then when he actually appeared he wasn't cast in a funny part at all. Come to think of it apart from the ridiculousness of the plot as a whole there wasn't one funny part in the entire film! What genre would that make it? Serious farce??One thing I must say though is that Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day displayed amazing composure for parents whose only child was kidnapped in of all places Morocco. I doubt that ANY mother would almost happily pop off to England without any idea where her little boy was and then on arrival calmly entertain friends making a lame excuse that she had to pop out for a few minutes and asking them to entertain themselves and wait for her soon return. People in her situation don't behave that way and it is insulting for filmmakers to expect their audiences to accept it.A big disappointment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much which I have not had the opportunity to view. By itself the '56 version is a very well done film. The run of midtolate fifties Hitchcock films including Rear Window Dial M For Murder Vertigo and To Catch A Thief as well as this film is one of my favorite periods in his career. In The Man Who Knew Too Much Jimmy Stewart throws himself vigorously into his role as always. Doris Day is very believable in the role of an atypical Hitchcock blond. I thought there was nothing fake about her performance. Her character may not have been written as strongly as the original but she's definitely not reduced to the role of a passive Yes dear pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart's arm.There were some really clever lines written for Hank the couple's son who later gets kidnapped in the opening scene on the bus it's too bad Christopher Olsen read them so woodenly. It's rare to see a good performance from a child actor in the 50s though. Most of the rest of the supporting actors in this film were very competent though most notably the assassin played by Reggie Nalder. Some little touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian the use of nonEnglish dialog especially French something Hitch did on a much larger scale in To Catch A Thief the use of foreboding Arabic music in the hotel when the assassin appears Stewart and Day talking to each other in the church singing their words to the tune of the hymn the Albert Hall scene specifically showing the musicians and the assassin's accomplice following the score building up tension as well as the percussionist getting the cymbals ready and finally the assassin's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically an effect Hitch used at the end of Spellbound also.All in all The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun film to watch. It's not as deep or as heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films Vertigo Strangers on a Train but all the same it is one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.".

And if ever there was any importance for a song then this movie permeates a cut above the rest for it's usage of music and song.I cannot even think that any other director would have thought on earth that if we shoot a gun when the cymbals crash the noise of the trigger would not be heard and would be lost. Ah that is what is Hitchcock is all about and shall continue to be.Okay done with Hitchcock coming to the movie it's a tale of a couple whose child has been kidnapped in an alien country now they get him back forms the story. In the meanwhile there are few characters of great importance who form the plot completely. The usage of music is so very important and poignant if for once it is used as a backdrop for a murder then it is also used for a mother to reclaim her child. The acting as expected is top notch. Screenplay is very good and so is editing. Above them all is the Hitchcock direction that takes a plot filled with anxieties to that filled with tension and suspense. It grows on gradually.Its 45 for a great Hitchcock film.".

The scene in the auditorium where the assassination is attemped is simply marvelous.  With the live music playing and the filming excellent I think this is one of the most exciting best filmed scenes I've ever seen.  Seeing his films today what amazes me about Hitchcock more than anything is his ability to draw you into his films without all the milliondollar technology that today's films have which proves just how much substance there was to film in the past. The way he lets us into his films is just genius.  And The Man Who Knew Too Much is no different.".

With his last words Bernard whispers the details of a conspiracy to assassinate a statesman in London. To keep McKenna quiet the criminals kidnap his son. The McKenna's go to London to try and track down their son with the one clue they have  Ambrose Chappell.If you are looking for someone to remake a Hitchcock film then probably Hitchcock himself is your best bet. Here he takes his black and white British film and updates it to the 50's. Much of the plot stays the same but it's a little padded out. This is particularly evident in the first half where it does go a bit too slow for my liking and feels like a travelogue film for some parts! The majority though moves along nicely and is more dramatic than the 1934 version. Where that was a little still and very British this has a lot more emotion and is pretty tense at times.Stewart does very well in the lead and is convincing as the man becoming increasingly desperate as he hunts for his son. Day is OK but is a little annoying. I'm not a big fan of her so that may have something to do with it but her singing was stretched and caused the film to drag and I only felt for her character in the Albert Hall scene where she showed her conflicting emotions very well. The villains are less than the original  but who could compete with Peter Lorre?Overall this colourful version starts slowly and feels padded with African footage. However once the drama actually starts it works very well and is actually tighter and better than the 1934 film of the same name.

	schema:reviewBody "I was shocked and disappointed by the many negative reactions among the recent user reviews of this film Hitchcock's only remake of one of his own works. No film is perfect and many successful suspense movies have holes in their plots as this one does but these lapses had no impact on my overall appreciation for this oneofakind remake. I liked the original version as well which featured an unforgettable female protagonist played by Edna Best who was a sharp shooter rather than a professional singer and an early setting in Switzerland rather than Morocco. One reviewer here went so far as to claim that the first half of this version was NOT produced on location in Morocco. Then where was the first half filmed? Dearborn Michigan?In spite of several plot holes and a generally weak if not lame script the excellent direction the solid camera work the fascinating location scenes in both Marrakech and in London and the wonderful work by leads James Stewart and Doris Day overcome all of the obvious weaknesses. Stewart's performance alone is worth watching as he runs the entire gamut of emotions from start to finish. His awkwardness and physical discomfort at the Moroccan restaurant and the gradual discovery that his son has been kidnapped are examples of his very natural and superb acting. The scene in the taxidermy shop was hilarious. Remember the stuffed birds in the office of Norman Bates? Very Hitchcockian eh? Hitchcock picked Day for the role of Jo McKenna when he saw her in Storm Warning one of her few dramatic roles. Considering her good work in both dramas and in films such as Love Me Or Leave Me it's a pity that she didn't appear in more substantial films. As much as I love her many of her films were just plain silly and she clearly had much more potential than most of the nonsensical work that had been thrown at her. Jo's anguished reaction to son Hank's kidnapping was quite convincing. In real life Day decided to commit herself to the cause of animal welfare when she observed how cruelly the animals were treated on the Moroccan set of this film. Among the plot lapses was the McKennas' decision to leave Hank with strangers in a totally unfamiliar and foreign place such as Marrakech Morocco. I was seven years old in 1956 and my parents would have never done that even during those far more innocent times and in far more familiar locales. I also didn't understand why the thugs didn't decide to kill Ben McKenna after the worshipers left the chapel. If the object of the kidnapping was to make sure that Ben wouldn't reveal the assassination plot their problem would have been instantly solved and they were certainly ruthless enough to knock him off right then and there. Then came Que Sera Sera a song that I detest and if that didn't ruin the film nothing else could including twelve long minutes of a lackluster classical piece at Albert Hall that should have been shortened significantly. As to Bernard Herrmann's musical score it sounds very similar to his music in Hitchcock's other classics North By Northwest and Vertigo with very little variation. Speaking of Vertigo does Miss Day's gray suit look at all familiar to you? And I am sorry that I missed the director's trademark cameo appearance at the market in Marrakech but I'll try again during the next viewing and there surely will be another opportunity because regardless of its many imperfections I still love this movie as well as the original 1934 version.".

The plot itself is largely the same as the prequel and with the same leads it is easy to know what to expect and as the original was a great movie all this bodes well for this installment.First and foremost this is a comedydrama unmistakably so. It jumps back and forth between well acted comedy that is quick and clever and wrenching if not somewhat predictable drama. In fact the dramatic aspects are largely reminiscent of basically every teacher drama out there from GTO and Gokusen to Dangerous Minds and Mr. Hollands Opus while the comedy is a culmination of several elements especially direction and editing.The movie runs just over two hours which at best is maybe 20 minutes too long however this is a minor complaint.

It proves to be a young man one from the earlier encounter on a drunken tryst with his girlfriend Miyeong. Kang is commended yet horrified. Miyeong is unhinged.

Here is a director who makes it quite clear what is being stated without ever having to say it.Along the SouthNorth Korean border a military troop is instructed to kill on site any person trespassing the beach territory after dark considering them all spies. When a drunken couple head to said beach for their reveries tragedy ensues as the man is shot and killed midcoitus. The woman involved goes insane from shock and becomes an infantilized sex addict. The man who shot her lover goes insane from grief and becomes a maniac with a death wish. The two then slowly begin to tear apart the military compound with their insanity.The movie is focused on the border and rather isolated in general. Though extras appear and a few scenes are set in the city most of the action revolves around a rather separate and hermetic community of soldiers and fisherman civilians and it's really easy to feel as if the rest of the world is entirely cut off from this area with the fences and such. Kiduk is pointing out that in isolation a community begins to tear itself apart from the inside and from the perspective of the Koreans the concept is directly pointed towards their current borders.By and large this is a horror film. The characters are haunted by a tragedy caused by the necessities of their social roles. No one is willing to stand up for what is right so all must eventually suffer.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "Writer and director Kim 3 Iron and Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring broaches new territory in this tight riveting drama about the ugly underbelly of a society in perpetual preparation for war. Kim admirers may miss the understated beauty and gentleness of Kim's previous work in this gritty realistic rendering of modern Korea's army complete with fierce beatings accidental shootings and the inculcation of warrior bloodlust in its fresh young recruits. In a rare introduction Kim explains that he made the film as a statement against war and to help viewers realize that a nation always on a war footing can never be a happy one. Astute viewers will not miss the parallels with films about America's Vietnam experience such as Born on the Fourth of July Casualties of War and perhaps most apt Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Kim's message is clear the nature of Korea's mandatory conscripted military is a destructive social element that should be altered.While Kim revolves his story around a private in a platoon based on the seashore who is obsessed with finding and shooting a North Korean spy his artist's vision and broad understanding of contemporary social issues leads us into adjacent themes including the effect of the military on civilians his culture's strict adherence to obedience to elders and the ultimate madness that the brutal disciplinary conditions engender in young Korean men. Private Kang is the story's simultaneous protagonist and antagonist as he takes his duties to extremes always wearing camouflage paint ambushing fellow enlistees and terrorizing area fishermen. One night he sees images of people in restricted space through his night vision goggles and opens fire killing a local man while he is making drunken love to his girlfriend Miyoung portrayed in startling fashion by Park Jia. Despite the circumstances his superiors reward Kang for following standing orders by firing on intruders in the restricted zone and he is granted a leave of absence to visit his family in Seoul.And this is just the beginning of the story. Kang becomes increasingly unstable the local civilians increasingly vengeful and his peers and superiors increasingly confused about how to handle Kang. Eventually he is discharged from the service but faces shame and dishonor both at home and within the military from which he cannot bring himself to break away. In this regard The Coast Guard examines military recruits as trained killing machines and begs the question of what they are to do when they are no longer asked to kill. Again American audiences will find chilly reminders of Vietnamera soldiers who were ostracized by the very people they vowed to protect. As Kang's delusions progress Miyoung descends toward her own doom in an Ophelian selfdestructive and insanitysoaked orgy of despair and depravity.No happy endings here folks. This is Kim at the edge of his expertise. He has played the madness card before with sex and violence in passionate personal dramas. But to directly characterize his country's military status quo as culturally destructive is a first. Kim deftly avoids political pronouncements yet the message of this disturbing film resonates long and loud beyond the final scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps the reason why this movie is getting such a bad rap is mainly a fault of its wellmeaning but still incoherent style and narrative structure. I have not read any articles on this movie or interviews with the director to know what his overt intention was but in the end I think the movie falls short of its mark due to Kim's perennial fixation on obsession whether it was his intention to delve into this subject matter or not. On most levels obsession is a largely private affair and any exegesis of obsession enmeshed within the loaded geopolitical situation that is now Korea would require a broader vision and canvas matched with a technical command of story telling than any that Kim has been able to provide here or elsewhere. However one thing that I must praise Kim for is the reality with which he portrays military life in South Korea. It is in my view the grittiest downtoother depiction on the silverscreen of life as a grunt doing mandatory military service in Korea. I should know since I've done my two years' service as no doubt Kim also has. The situation might be unreal a loosecannon grunt suddenly acquiring the killing skills of Jason Bourne but the military's reaction to it certainly wasn't. The ineptitude of the commanders to stop the problem the fear of the soldiers and the conflict it breeds within and most important of all the corporal punishment that gets amplified as it spreads down the chain of command.So here's my recommendation if you want a well thought out movie which pits issues of personal obsession against major geopolitical themes of our day this movie is not for you. If however you want to see a curiosity piece about how troglodytic an existence military conscripts lead in South Korea then you've come to the right place.".

Mistaking a groundlevel head that he sees in his nightvision goggles for that of a spy the soldier opens fire then as the poor guy crawls desperately away he is blown to smithereens with a grenade. Presumably this is what the soldier is trained to do as he is rewarded for his bravery and given a week's furlough to pull himself together. Turns out the dead guy was an innocent local who was killed as he was making love to his girlfriend in a forbidden area of the beach. Naturally the girlfriend is traumatised by the incident which sends her mad. She starts hanging around the base clinging to any and all soldiers she finds mistaking them for her boyfriend. The soldiers are rather obliging and she winds up pregnant.The soldier who also experiences an estrangement from rational thought is discharged and he too begins to haunt the base gradually becoming more and more unhinged and taking revenge on the unit he feels has betrayed him.Also known as The Coast Guard this film sheds no new light on anything unless you're unfamiliar with the existence of two Koreas. I could see no real point to it  all the themes it raises are not resolved. nor are the incidents at all realistic. If the aim of this film was to make a kind of fable it's a failure. If you want to see a film that has heart drama reality and An Actual Point see Joint Security Area  JSA 2000 director Park Chanwook".

He is very enthusiastic about his services and takes it a bit too serious. In one night he shoots a spy who shows up on the coastal area. But it is actually not a spy but a civilian who lived nearby. This event seriously messes up the lives of many people. Small Spoilers I thought this was a promising theme but after about the first half of the movie the movie gets out of hand and tries to be a thriller while picturing the now lunatic minds of the involved persons.

	schema:reviewBody "Kang DongGun Jang is a soldier assigned to patrol the border of the NorthSouth Korea divide. His sole job is to shoot anyone that crosses the border as they are to be considered North Korean spies. As it holds many rewards Kang is eager to kill someone. One night on duty in town he gets into an argument with a gang of youths having drinks including MiYeong JiA Park. As a means of defying the soldiers who they believe are just living easy off the tax payers' money MiYeong crosses the border with a young man and the two have sex. Kang spots the man's head and opens fire killing him and throws a grenade that blows him apart. MiYeong descends into madness stalking the army camp and having sex with various soldiers. Kang also goes mad with guilt and is eventually dismissed from the coast guard only return with vengeance on his mind.As good as the premise for this film sounds I really did find it disappointingly amateurish. The interesting themes lying throughout the film are drowned out by bad plotting and simply unbelievable incidents. How Kang a relatively green soldier with no real combat experience turns into a superslick Jason Bournealike who can deceive a whole patrol overnight is just ridiculous. It's clear that director KiDuk Kim is trying to portray the soldiers as useless but the amount of times they are disarmed by having their weapons simply grabbed out of their hands is unrealistic. And some scenes are just repeated over and over again notably Kang appearing ravaged by madness not realising he has been dismissed only to be told he is mad by his exfellow servicemen and punched and kicked away. It gets tiresome quickly and appears that the director just ran out of ideas.It's not to say that some parts of the film aren't effective. The tragic MiYeong having slept with many of the soldiers believing them to be her dead exlover finds herself pregnant. Her brother enraged demands that the soldiers responsible come forward. MiYeong kisses the guilty men one by one on the cheek gleefully unaware of the gravity of the situation only for her brother to stare horrified as one after the other step forward. The scene where she crawls into her brother's fish tank bloody from a forced abortion is truly brilliant. The water fills up with blood as she sits there unable to grasp what is happening. It's a powerful scene in a disappointingly poor film.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Everything about this movie is great the actingthe action and sometimes even the script.Watching this you'd think it was based on a Japanese manga comic but it isn't the director Kim TaeGyun was heavily influenced by these comics and animated movies and set out to do a live action japanime movie and he was successful in every aspect.Jang Hyuk who plays Kim does such a wonderful job in this role he is able to be a serious hardass one moment then straight away making himself look like a total goof.A great highlight in the movie are the fight scenes in my opinion they make good use of wire work and visual effects which is very reminiscent of movies such as 'The Storm Riders' or 'The Avenging Fist' The humour is some times lost in the translation which is to be expected if you don't speak Korean. This movie is one of the few which has been making Korean cinema more and more prolific over the past few years its up there with such other Korean gems as 'Friend' 'Bichunmoo' 'Musa' and 'Guns n Talks' I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Andrew Lau fx laden fantasy epics or Japanime you will not be disappointed.I also recommend you try and pick up the Region 2 Premiere Asia DVD as it contains the best versionThe 95 minute one and also contains the cut footage and the second disc full of great extras.".

All original music has been replaced by assorted rap that seems out of place. The story and characters have been dumbed down to the point of unrecognizability. All characters are voiced by rappers many of whom had never acted before yes not only is it badly dubbed the Asian people are talking gansta. Much of the humor has been left on the cutting room floor.It tries so hard to be hip and cool that everything that made it hip and cool is lost.

However if you love martial arts movies you will be disappointed  the martial arts is spread pretty thin. Although Volcano High is Korean it appears to have gone the way of recent Hong Kong kung fu films in that choreography is either obscured or entirely replaced by CGI effects. However the special effects and acting are topnotch Hyuk Jang especially evoking both sniggers and respect.  Well made and good fun if you don't take your moviewatching too seriously.

For example from Japan there was Battle Royale and Fudoh. And from Hong Kong there was My Friend the Barbarian. For a genre these films are quite a mix and Volcano Highschool is no exception.The mood is bleak and intense. The color pallete fits the grimness of the setting lots of muted browns blues and gray. The Highschool looks like it was from the 16th century. The fighting scenes were better more in the way they were filmed than the actual martial prowess of the actors. The translucent energy effects were a fair representation of ideas about kung fu just read about taoist energy arts like tai chi and ba gua. They even talk about yin and yang so it points to some of the inspiration though the real stuff is more awe inspiring to watch.I found myself thinking That's a Korean Hottie? Maybe the korean girls i've met that i think are sleek and beautiful looking are thought of as not that attractive by the public at large in Korea. Maybe. The female lead did grow on me more as the film progressed. For a girl who beats off the advances of suitors with a stick literally she did display her nurturing side and in the end if her character were real I would risk getting beaten for the sake of asking her out for a cup of soujou like Japanese sochou but often the secret ingredient is antifreeze.My biggest gripe with plotpoints was with the secret scroll. As the film progressed and its nature became more obviously symbolic i was forced to accept it as a sort of philosopher's's stone that promises selfknowledge and selfmastery since this is the role it plays for our leading protagonist. This is a lofty goal implicit in this high school! If you can master the secret scroll then a fine adult you will indeed be regardless of what facts you may retain or job skills you possess. Kind of an abstract execution but after studying mythology I am convinced this is indeed the role of the scroll in this story.".

The fighting is secondary followed by plot because much of the movie goes unresolved in the end. You may be wondering what the main purpose of this movie is then? Well its just fun!! This was a fun movie to watch the acting was spot on and could only have been helped if say Jackie Chan was cast as the Vice Principal. I gave the movie 9 out of 10 stars because very few movies these days of any genre can keep my attention. This movie has put itself in my movies to watch 1000 times bin and believe me I will be watching this again and again.

This film's special effects and fight scenes make the matrix look like a Bmovie. The storyline isn't the best and leaves some unanswered questions but who even cares? This film is all about extreme martial arts and telekinetic powers and does not disappoint. I watched the longer korean version and I must admit the first half could have been better but the second half more than made up for it with some of the most over the top action sequences ever.

This film's special effects and fight scenes make the matrix look like a Bmovie. The storyline isn't the best and leaves some unanswered questions but who even cares? This film is all about extreme martial arts and telekinetic powers and does not disappoint. I watched the longer korean version and I must admit the first half could have been better but the second half more than made up for it with some of the most over the top action sequences ever.

The movie is graded to look almost black and white easy since all the korean school uniforms are black and the action is a lot of wirefu with computer effects throughout. The story isn't meant to be deep and the characters are twodimensional on purpose. Some of the action scenes are an incomprehensible blur but some make this movie worth the movie ticket.

	schema:reviewBody "VOLCANO HIGH SCHOOL You'll either LOVE or HATE this movie depending on what mood you're in when you watch it. But let's see what exactly have we got here? This movie is like playing a video game on the hardest difficulty setting. It's just like standing in line for the premiere of a blockbuster motion picture. It's a front row seat at a Korean ROB ZOMBIE concert. It's a shot of whiskey without the chaser. Rough and rowdy it's fast oh yes! it's furious oh hell yes! it's THE XMEN meets THE MATRIX in high school. It's WHASANGO aka VOLCANO HIGH directed by KIM TAEGYUN and it doesn't get any better than this! Leave your brain at the ticket booth and kick back for a supernatural Martial Arts CGI assaultfest on your senses for which there may NEVER be an equal to. Yet again the Korean Cinema kicks the door open to the boundaries of film storytelling with an epic effort that has everything going for it. There's mucho action wacky punk rock characters hilarious foreign comedy snazzy computer animated special effects babeolicious Asian teen hotties and a smackyouinthemouth fight scene finale that borderlines pure unadulterated KungFu Theatre bliss. It tells the tale of the student body of the infamous Volcano High who after the studentteacher war have begun to adjust to a slightly normal education process. Of course with students running around with extraordinary superhuman powers it's never easy for the teachers to keep order in the classroom and the fact that whoever runs the school becomes the inheritor of the fabled sacred manual of fighting techinques means there's trouble brewing all the time. Enter the major cast of characters who are in competition for this award Kim Kyung Soo actor JANG HYUK our main star and newest transfer student. Hak Rim aka Elegant Crane actor KWAN SNAGWOO the current number one fighting champion. ChaeYoo aka Icy Jade actress SHIN MINA the captain of the Kendo Club and Soh Yu actress KONG HYOJIN her suprasexy second in command. Jang Ryang aka Dark Ox actor KIM SOROH leader of the Weight Lifting Club. And Shimma actor KIM HYEONGJONG orange haired head of the Rugby Team. This motley crew together with a zany supporting cast of student followers teachers and principals makes this extreme viewing pleasure all that more enjoyable. There's even a little love story for the chicks. And when things really heat up the viceprincipal calls in The School 5 Masters of Suppressing School Wrongdoing to handle the situation. And believe you me those five can kick some major behind. But does the whole thing make any sense you ask. NO! Does it have to? NO! It's simply mindless eyecandy entertainment for those interested in such fluff and if you think too hard about the actual story or plot I do believe that your brain just may turn to mush. Everyone will certainly walk away from this film with a different take on it but for me the benefits of seeing this flick not only satisfied my craving for another fix from the exaggerated cinema but gave me the wonderful opportunity to witness the existance of probably the sexiest girl in South Korea the sultry Soh Yu with her nappy matted hair permanent angry face and super take no shit saucy attitude. And she can GO too. Too bad she didn't have a bigger part with nude scenes though. So with all that being said what are you still waiting on?! Go see this movie right now! In my opinion no Asian DVD collection can be complete without it.".

This movie is very entertaining if you like nonstop action in a cool hightech environment.The ingredients are pretty standard. There's a stylish kickass villain Travolta with a plan being a hightech bank robbery. This is all garnished with lots of weapons technology car chases and beautiful women. This movie really delivers on the action front I don't think there's any 'quiet' scene that lasts more than 2 minutes. It also contains the now standard implausible hacking scenes where getting into the computer system of a bank involves solving a kind of Rubik's cube on your computer screen. I hope you're not offended by product placement because a certain computer brand is quite prominent when IT hardware is involved in this movie. But it's by far not as obnoxious as in I Robot.The filming is topnotch unlike some other movies you can actually see what's happening in the action scenes which is sometimes due to the amazing slowdown effects in some scenes. Unfortunately the entire plot becomes quite thin when the movie is stripped of all this action and style. However it works. The ending is rather vague as if room was left for a sequel without making it too painful if there wouldn't be one after all.Overall I would say this is a pretty OK movie but don't expect the best cinema ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "Swordfish was one of my anxiously awaited summer flicks.  And after seeing it a couple hours ago I am not at all disappointed.  It's been awhile since I've seen a truly enjoyable mature action movie.  With the slew of PG13 action movies of recent years it's refreshing to see one that at least acknowledges that many intense situations do involve language sex and mixed character reactions  it wasn't just another black and white good and bad movie where the good guy does only good things and the bad guy has only evil intentions.  The good guy Jackman didn't always do the right thing and the bad guy Travolta could hardly be accused of sinister motives.The film starts off with a bang ... literally.  A bigtime action sequence to get out attention then a flashback to show how the climax of the film came to pass.  The outoforder editing was actually effective and interesting rather than seeming like yet another failed attempt to mimic Pulp Fiction and those other movies that brought attention to the idea of showing a film out of chronological order.Jackman was great as computer hacker Stanley Jobson devoted father who just happened to get brought down for computerrelated felonies after hacking into and making public an FBI email surveillance operation.  Forbidden to even touch a computer for the rest of his days he is lured back into the life by Travolta who offers him 100000 just to meet him and take an interesting version of an initiation.  Jackman is quickly becoming Hollywood Alist material and with his performance in Swordfish it's easy to see why.  He can keep up with the smoothtalking fastmoving Travolta as well as show enough emotion to make him seem like a real person and not just a runofthemill action hero.The plot of the film is fantastic.  It's not just a typical heist film or action plot where the hero has to save the hostages blowing the hell out of the bad guys in the process.  The plot is complex interwoven and has a point.  The plot was crucial to keeping interest during the slow parts of the film.  Starting out with an action sequence carries the danger of losing audience interest if not followed up by more and more action.  Thankfully the plot manages to retain interest during those points in the film where things aren't exploding and buses aren't flying through metropolitan airspace suspended from a heavy loading chopper.The best part about this film was the interractions between the characters. Stanley is a smart guy and Gabriel's smarter.  Just when Stanley and the audience thinks they have Gabriel in a tight spot he'll surprise everyone with some improvised ingenuity.  There are so many films in the action genre that result to dumbing down the smart villains just so the hero of the story will look good when he comes up with a relatively weak solution to the complex plot.  The villains often slip up or make some kind of fatal faux pas in judgment that allows the hero to triumph.  There's none of that here. The hero and villain are both smart and both stay that way until the very end.This is a great summer movie.  See it.  See it twice or three times even. If you're looking for high art or something that really speaks to you and changes the way you see the world don't see it.  But if you want to see a movie for the sake of entertainment and having a good time Swordfish is the movie to go to.  If Swordfish is any indication of the rest of this summer's big action blockbusters we're certainly in good shape this year.".

It's been awhile since I've seen a truly enjoyable mature action movie.  With the slew of PG13 action movies of recent years it's refreshing to see one that at least acknowledges that many intense situations do involve language sex and mixed character reactions  it wasn't just another black and white good and bad movie where the good guy does only good things and the bad guy has only evil intentions.

The explosion scene where people are flying sideways is awesome particularly in the sound department if you have surround system. Oh and yes Halle Berry and her figure was on display in this film and quite a sight. Wowzer!Some of this script is a takeoff on Dog Day Afternoon which Travolta's character reenacts a role from that famous '70s film. Shear talks about that movie during the film. I almost got discouraged watching this in the first half hour because there is so much computer terminology that I was lost. However if you find yourself in a similar spot take heart because that that ends after that first 30 minutes and is no longer a problem.Credibility and bias aside it's still a fun movie for at least one viewing with that early bomb scene most memorable.".

The girl is very pretty but absolutely fails in convincing of guile and intelligence. The plot doesn't play fair and that is a must with these types of twists.

Vertical Limit' was another disappointing film with a slambang beginning.The second part of the opening segues to the very set of Dog Day except the attitude here is much more ruthless. A hostage IS killed in a spectacular fashion. And that fashion is highly cinematic with all sorts of postmatrix still pans and small object tracking. The point is clear we are here creating a new form here by annotating the LumetPacino model.A very clever notion.

And Jackman has the face halfway between Ed Norton and Mel Gibson. He's at the level of Ms. Berry though and that's at the merely mugging level.Finally I have done some hacking in my time not cracking as shown here and I can say that nothing in this film except maybe the keyboards resembles either the appearance or the real mystery of the enterprise. It is far cooler and spookier than is imagined by these kids just hard as hell to show on a screen with what they had to work with.".

The fact that all these innocents are considered as pawns by the filmmakers not even given a shred of individuality or humanity just shows how utterly immoral and dishonest the whole enterprise is. If this is what the action movie has stooped to then maybe the whole genre should be put in the cooler for a few years. And the writer obviously never heard of the saying 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel'. Instead in the world of Swordfish Might Makes Right and any terrorist attacks on Americans are 'rightly' avenged on an innocent civilian population. Apart from this moral point of view which will play really badly outside of the US but then who cares about the population of 5 other continents right? the movie as a whole is disappointing. The plot never makes much sense the emotional aspects of the story are forgotten quickly and clumsily developed. Hugh Jackman should go very far he is reminiscent of the younger Mel Gibson and a magnetic screen personality. Unfortunately the character is so underwritten that he spends the last 40 minutes scowling desperately rather than being allowed to actually act. Add some excessive CGI which diminishes rather than enhances the spectacle some really bad oneliners and an unfortunate penchant for ridiculous subTarantino monologues about movies geek country  would any rogue superspy REALLY spend his time thinking about the difference between Hollywood movies and real life? Of course not. But slacker video clerks would and you are left with a subpar action movie which leaves a truly foul taste in the mouth. Any good points? Well Jackman of course and the sight of a bus being hauled over the LA skyline by a helicopter. But apart from that a total waste of time money and some talent.".

Now obviously he has to be portrayed as the 'good guy' so he explains midway through the movie that he was jailed because he hacked into and destroyed an FBI program that was illegally gathering info about people. But we also have to believe that the courts refused him any access at all to his child and sent her to live with a porn producer instead. OK... but it gets stupider. The way he can supposedly get his daughter back is by getting tons of money to hire a better lawyer and that's why he works for John Travolta's terrorist organization. What a hero. Of course he doesn't get any punishment for singlehandedly enabling the entire bank robbery because he did it to get money to hire a good lawyer to overturn a court case that was ruled repeated against him.John Travolta's character Gabriel is even stupider. Gabriel runs a radical antiterrorist terrorist group. He wants to 'protect the American way of life' by retaliating for terrorism with even harsher terrorism to make 'rogue states' stop harbouring terrorists. Gabriel is willing to kill as many people as it takes to preserve 'the American way of life' including Americans. But Gabriel doesn't lead the American way of life he lives in a mansion full of sluts alcohol and techno music. This movie came out before 911 so it is not clear what Gabriel is even retaliating against. He is the biggest threat to the American way of life. Not to mention that murdering civilians in countries that harbor terrorists will do nothing to change the minds of the dictators who rule those countries. Gabriel has a bone to pick with the government in this case the FBI so why doesn't he realize that all the other antiAmerican terrorism is caused by that same government?The other actors aren't very good Halle Berry is a bimbo Don Cheadle is awful and so is Vinnie Jones. The plot twist at the end is poorly explained why is Halle Berry still alive? and the action sequences are dull. All in all a poor attempt to rip off Tarantino and Guy Ritchie. John Travolta's description of bad movies at the beginning of the film will ring true by the time you have finished watching it.".

When should an audience have to fill in all of the holes by conjecture based on their own opinions not what the film showed them?   The filmmakers claim to have created complicated characters...who is good and who is bad...but the film was so poorly written that I doubt that the actors even knew what their character's motivations were.  That is except for the Hugh Jackson character whose motives were so blatantly obvious getting his daughter back.  If the screenwriter had written one more dialogue scene stating that fact I would have screamed!!  We know we know!  He loves her  he loves her!  He wants her back!!  Just don't say it again please!!!How do movies like this get made?  Did Joel Silver really read the script and say Wow what a great piece of writing...we've got to make this!  And I'm certain that Domenic Sena doesn't have a clue how to tell a good story or how to recognize good material or how to make bad material somewhat good.  If he did then he would have seen all of the holes in the script.  My goodness Domenic! Don't you think it would have been interesting to see how the cops got to be seated with  the Travolta character before the explosion? That's called TENSION.  Look it up in the dictionary it might be useful.   And not to mention you put the best thing in the entire movie in the first five minutes the explosion thus leaving the transition to the third act weak.  ALL OF THE TENSION WAS GONE FROM THE ROBBERY!!  Couldn't you recognize that?  But then again you're the type of filmmaker that would turn down a beautiful script like All About Eve to make Gone in Sixty Seconds Part II...because there was just so much left out of the first one.  If I could I would give you my address to send me my 7.50 back. People will decide for themselves if they like it or not.  And everyone has different tastes.  But I KNOW for certain that this is bad storytelling.  There are so many holes in the plot and characters that they should have called this movie Swisscheese. Even the thing everyone heard about Halle Berry displaying her breasts was unmotivated.  You'd think that the filmmakers would have made it intregal to the story like her using them to seduce someone or something but no she just happens to like reading books topless that's all.   She definitely couldn't have been sunbathing because the entire world of the film existed only at the magic hour.  Why Halle Berry?  Is it worth it to show your breasts for extra money?  If it had a point to the story sure but come on!!  I find it amusing to imagine Halle Berry on the set before filming that scene asking Let's see what's my motivation?.   That had to be the question on most of actors minds because it couldn't have been written in the script.  And if it was then Dominic Sena is more horrible than I thought for taking it out! And if the actors knew who their characters  were and their motivation then they had to do what everyone in the audience will have to dofill in all the holes as wide as the Grand Canyon.   For brilliant movies like Memento it works.  But I believe there's enough information in that film to draw logical conclusions from. Swordfish doesn't have that.  It leaves you filling in holes you shouldn't have to something filmmakers who know how to tell good stories would recognize.  My suggestion if you're going to see this moviesit down relax clear your mind and when the movie starts pull out some swiss cheese to snack on and PONDER...".

You need to pay attention to this movie to fully understand the plot. I really don't see how people can say that this plot is confusing. It makes sense as long as you watch and pay attention just like all movies. Also the action scenes are just incredible to watch especially with the dvd that uses 5.1 sound. The ending and the villains motives will shock you! The movie will also cause you to contemplate many things once the movie has ended. By the way  Halle Berry looks amazing in the movie!All in all this movie is just the epitome of cool and it was definately one of the better action movies of 2001. Finally Travolta is back at what he does best. As a side note this is a hell of a lot better then BATTLEFIELD EARTHwhich by the way was not as bad as everyone said it was. I really think that you should see this I don't think that you will be dissapointed.910 Great.".

	schema:headline " I gave it a 3 and I was being generous!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy perhaps to understand why films like this get made. Nominally they're lightweight action thrillers with a catchy theme. In this outing the theme is hacking the ability of some shady genius to get into mainframe computers anywhere anytime and work superscams that will shift millions of dollars  or in this case almost 10 billion  into the bank accounts of your choosing. It sounds harmless enough but it all goes badly wrong in Swordfish and what comes out the other end is a nasty stupidly obscene film. I have  difficulty imagining why wealthy bigname stars like John Travolta Halle Berry Don Cheadle and Hugh Jackman allow themselves to be involved in this sort of enterprise. Do they really need the money? If the answer is yes then can someone tell me just how much money such people want or need?This is not to say that the technical production values aren't high. They are. The explosions are impressive there are cars and bodies and fragments of bodies flying through the air. There are fireballs. We have helicopters zooming all over the place. Many people are picturesquely slaughtered. Good technical stuff indeed. And it was on the basis of the impressive optics that I gave the film a 3 instead of a 1.The film hits a low point shortly after the opening violent scenes. Ginger Halle Berry tracks down Stanleythehacker Hugh Jackman in his dilapidated trailer in Midland Texas to make him an offer he can't possibly refuse. A great big pile of money so that he can hire a super law firm to help him get custody of his 10year old daughter who is ten going on thirtyseven but Hollywood kids are always special from his sluttish wife who now lives with one of Hollywood's porn kings. Intense moral drama unfolding here. Ginger immediately impresses Stanley and all of us with her sparkling wit and incisive intellectStanley If you'd told me you were coming I would have cleaned the place up.Ginger I didn't come here to suck your dick Stanley.Brilliant dialogue for the ages. How did Swordfish fail to get a nomination for best original screenplay I wonder? And later rising to even greater heights of taste and intelligence the head honcho Gabriel  no angel he as we quickly discover  played by John Travolta has a gun put to Stanley's head and forces him to hack into a government site in 60 seconds or his brains will be moved someplace else on the business end of a heavy calibre slug. And to add more wit and tension to the scene  I guess  a blond bimbo busily buries her head in Stanley's lap and we know for certain that she's not rummaging around for loose change. I guess this must be director Dominic Sena's notion of a climactic scene.And so on. The plot is wildly improbable and stupid but it at least unfolds rapidly thus minimising brain damage to the viewer. Probably the best scenes belong to Jackman an actor of talent and potential range who only needs to develop a degree of taste and judgement in his roles. But then he did go on to make Kate  Leopold didn't he? Travolta who is also talented if not as much as he thinks walks through the film doing a kind of reprise of his Chili Palmer role from Get Shorty  a vastly superior film  but with an overlay of nastiness here that does him no credit whatever. As for Halle Berry  well she looks great just as she did in Monster's Ball and as in that film she mostly acts with breasts and crotch. But as we used to say in the military  If you've got em smoke em!At film's end I guess we're supposed to conclude that Gabriel is a misdirected superpatriot a true son of J. Edgar Hoover's resident paranoia and he wants to rid his country of the threat of terrorism apparently by being the toughest terrorist on the global block If they blow up a church I'll blow up ten churches! Hell I can buy a nuclear warhead in Minsk for 40 million if I buy six I can get a discount. So yes the film appears to be telling us let's make sure this lunatic antihero gets his hands on 10 billion so he can buy all kinds of ordnance and bring the bad guys to heel. Why not? It works for Israel doesn't it? It doesn't? Darn! And at film's end after wiping out quite a few innocent people Gabriel does get his 10 billion and the voiceover tells us that hitherto untouchable terrorists are now dying like flies in a winter chill. The viewer is left with the impression that chaos and dead innocents aside Gabriel is just the kind of guy we need  or American superpatriots think they need  to set the world to rights. Gabe even gets Ginger the dishy if essentially vacuous Halle Berry to assist him and one supposes make his bedsheets hum. Slaughter and sex are after all staple companions in this kind of sad nonsense.Swordfish was made before September 11 2001. One wonders in the persistent  pall of 911 and the mostly unanswered questions that atrocity has raised if such a film would be made today. One hopes not. But Hollywood being what it is and what it too often is not one suspects that we have many more films like Swordfish in our collective future. And that's a shame. The world's a complicated place and it might actually help if moviemakers would divert some of those millions of production dollars to making intelligent films about complicated issues rather than mindless trash like this.".

Travolta who is also talented if not as much as he thinks walks through the film doing a kind of reprise of his Chili Palmer role from Get Shorty  a vastly superior film  but with an overlay of nastiness here that does him no credit whatever. As for Halle Berry  well she looks great just as she did in Monster's Ball and as in that film she mostly acts with breasts and crotch. But as we used to say in the military  If you've got em smoke em!At film's end I guess we're supposed to conclude that Gabriel is a misdirected superpatriot a true son of J. Edgar Hoover's resident paranoia and he wants to rid his country of the threat of terrorism apparently by being the toughest terrorist on the global block If they blow up a church I'll blow up ten churches! Hell I can buy a nuclear warhead in Minsk for 40 million if I buy six I can get a discount. So yes the film appears to be telling us let's make sure this lunatic antihero gets his hands on 10 billion so he can buy all kinds of ordnance and bring the bad guys to heel. Why not? It works for Israel doesn't it? It doesn't? Darn! And at film's end after wiping out quite a few innocent people Gabriel does get his 10 billion and the voiceover tells us that hitherto untouchable terrorists are now dying like flies in a winter chill. The viewer is left with the impression that chaos and dead innocents aside Gabriel is just the kind of guy we need  or American superpatriots think they need  to set the world to rights. Gabe even gets Ginger the dishy if essentially vacuous Halle Berry to assist him and one supposes make his bedsheets hum. Slaughter and sex are after all staple companions in this kind of sad nonsense.Swordfish was made before September 11 2001. One wonders in the persistent  pall of 911 and the mostly unanswered questions that atrocity has raised if such a film would be made today. One hopes not. But Hollywood being what it is and what it too often is not one suspects that we have many more films like Swordfish in our collective future. And that's a shame. The world's a complicated place and it might actually help if moviemakers would divert some of those millions of production dollars to making intelligent films about complicated issues rather than mindless trash like this.";

Korea just repelled the Japanese invasion with Ming China's aid which alternated between being an ally and being racist tormentors of the Korean populace.ManchuJurchens were a nation of fierce warriors from the north or they thought of themselves that way at least. They had been under the Chinese yoke and just threw it off. They are eventually to invade China proper and to rule over Chinese for the next 300 years. If you saw Last Emperor you will understand this historical setting.An important thing to remember here is that they were NOT Chinese. Their hatred of Chinese was immense almost pathological.and the reason that they invaded Korea was precisely that the Korean court acted like a vassal of Ming China. This contrasts very sharply with today's Manchu who think of themselves as Chinese.Just 40 years prior to this event there was the infamous Japanese invasion of Korea and Ming China sent a force to aid Koreans. But this force came from Liatung base the primary function of which was to suppress Jurchens and Mongols.Even though that war ended in the victory for Korea and China this created a power vacuum in Manchuria as Ming China no longer controlled the region effectively. This is how the JurchensManchu rose to power. They were burning with hatred of Chinese for their condescending and racist treatments of their people.The Korean King who was the crown prince at the time of the Japanese invasion ascended to the throne in the early 17th century. And because of his war time experience he was a practical man and saw the newly arising Manchu as a force to reckon with. He tried to be neutral between Ming China and Manchu.However he was deposed by a group of Korean nobility and they tried to justify their coup with a more pro china stance. This is how Manchu invaded Korea twice and the second one was more catastrophic as shown in this movie.So this movie is about the anger of the Korean masses felt toward the effete and effeminate Korean nobility class who were incredibly more loyal to Chinese than to their own people. It is about a war that could have been avoided if the Korean King at the timegenerally regarded as the weakest and the most effeminate king in the history of Korea and the nobility could back their word with action or had a more practical sense.The Korean government did not help their people actually did not even want to as long as they could hold onto their power so the people had to help themselves against all odds. This is the basic premise of this film.Anyway for those who are not interested in Korean or East Asian history... Manchu are not Chinese and the language they spoke in the movie was not Chinese.In fact it was the Manchu language which is now dead. It was recreated from the Korean records of the Manchu language. The movie creator deserves some credit for this.If you can free yourself from this common misconception that Manchu were just a type of Chinese people you are already halfway there. Manchu were no more Chinese than Mongols are.".

	schema:headline " One Of The Best Action Films Out Of Asia In A Long Time";
	schema:reviewBody "War of the Arrows is not your typical action film. Certainly much about it is typical. The lone hero avenging his nation which has been taken over by some other hostile nation sets out on a journey to rescue his kidnapped sister. In the process he becomes a hero of the people. Yes we've seen this before. But where this film truly shines is in it's inspired choice of focus that of the bow and arrow. This is particularly interesting because archery is something that takes great skill. So seeing an action film that takes on this weapon as focus is interesting in and of itself. But the film actually succeeds where it might otherwise fail.As stated before the film is fairly typical. It takes place during the Second Invasion of Manchu when China invaded Korea in the early 1600's. The focus is on NamYi a skilled archer who along with his sister JaIn must flee to a friend of their father's when he is killed. We spend a good deal of time in the beginning of the film seeing these two characters as children and then when they are young adults but it's mostly somewhat interesting drama that does a decent job of setting up the story. The real meat of the film kicks off in the second hour when JaIn is kidnapped and NamYi must go after her. Once this part of the story gets underway the action gets underway with it and it's pretty damn impressive.The choreography and cinematography following the battles between arrow slinging warriors is fantastic. There were moments when I had to rewind and play the scene again just to get a second look. This isn't out of poor filmmaking but because some of the scenes are so damn cool you want to see them again. And luckily these scenes are rapid fire and a plenty. From the chases through the woods to a ravine shoot out to the final stand off you barely have a moment to catch your breath. Although you realize that these men aren't actually as skilled as they come off there are moments when you're none the less amazed at what's being shown.Of course this action would mean nothing if it weren't surrounded by at least competent filmmaking but there is great skill displayed here. Our actors never feel unnatural even if the acting isn't to rave about and the cinematography is fantastic. This film would not work at all if the camera work was shotty and thankfully it's not. You can savor each moment of fantastic action in calculated collected shots that take the time to slow down when necessary and catch you by surprise when necessary. Suffice to say all of this creates one fantastic action film one of the best I have seen from Asia in quite some time.If you're a fan of Asian action films you owe it to yourself to give War of the Arrows a try. It's completely worth the time even running over two hours. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "WAR OF THE ARROWS is an excellent historical action flick with a twist almost all of the action sequences are centred around bowmen facing off. Now I've always loved archery when it's depicted in films so I was delighted to read the premise and watch the trailer for this movie. For me there's something intrinsically exciting about the look and the skill that goes into wielding a bow efficiently I'd much rather watch a shootout staged with bows and arrows than guns. WAR OF THE ARROWS turns out to be just the film for me.As usual for the Asian historical epic genre of recent years the film looks great. Director Hanmin Kim crafts a greatlooking movie that ably matches the finesse of other recent Korean movies known for their style and substance. The cast are fine giving their all in emotive turns without ever openly overacting. And the action scenes blow you away time and again.Okay I'll admit that the first halfhour is a little shaky. The setup although exciting is followed by a slightly dull get to know the leads type scenario which drags a lot. Once the plot begins proper though it doesn't let up. There are twists and turns galore plenty of moments of high drama and then in the second half of the movie things turn into a virtual rerun of the Mel Gibson epic APOCALYPTO. Think a pareddown narrative smallscale action  one versus a group  and suspense going through the roof. Yes it's that good and even some slightly dodgy CGI doesn't let it down. If only ROBIN HOOD another recent film about a forestdwelling archery champion could have been this good!".

This movie grabs you from the opening scene and is action packed and keeps you interested the entire time. The story and action are very well done and there is not a dull moment in this at all. There are some very brutal scenes in this but it's not over the top at all and it helps the story. For fans of this genre this is a must see.

	schema:headline " An exciting Korean movie which triumphs with its fast paced action sequences";
	schema:reviewBody "The very mention of arrows in a movie makes us think of Legolas. You know that dude in The Lord of the Rings trilogy? The elf with straight silky golden locks who never misses when he shoots his unlimited supply of arrows? While Orlando Bloom has made quite an impression with that suave character the arrow shooting men in this Korean production are a different breed altogether. They are rough ragged and well to put it simply manly. Set during the second Manchu invasion of Korea the manliest one of them all in this movie has to be the protagonist played by Park Hae Il who goes against the Qing Dynasty to save his younger sister. He also happens to be the best archer in Korea but because his father was killed as a traitor one can imagine how limited his future in the country is. One unfortunate follows another when his younger sister is abducted during her wedding ceremony. Thus begins the quest to save her sister and her husband from the Qing army. In the process countless arrows are shot and as you'd expect from a revenge movie there will be lots of blood.Director Kim Han Min's work was the second highest grossing movie in Korea last year and it is not difficult to see why. The fast paced epic action movie boasts of exhilarating sequences which will keep you at the edge of your seats. While you may wonder how a war of arrows can possibly be exciting you will be thrilled by the perfect execution and choreography of the battle scenes beat that Legolas!. The action comes at you fast and furious and even though there aren't many hand to hand combat the long distance fighting is heart stopping and riveting.The story may be based on a period of Korean history which we aren't very familiar with but the filmmakers make sure it doesn't alienate foreign viewers. Essentially it is a story about heroism justice and revenge  universal themes which anyone can identify with. This creates a win win situation Box office success both at home and in foreign lands.The 122 minute production being an action flick does not provide many emotionally engaging moments. Not that we are complaining though because for most of the movie you see the protagonist either chasing his sister's kidnappers or the bad guys chasing him. There are invasions battles confrontations and quarrels. The set pieces are impressive and there is quite a bit of decent use of computer graphics to enhance the storytelling. The ensemble cast does a nice job of portraying the anguish and tension felt by the characters during this war of arrows. Park manages to exude a respectable charm with his predictably written character while the fragile looking Moon Chae Won plays his sister in distress with grace and elegance. The two actors took home the Best Actor and Best New Actress at the 2011 Daejong Film Awards an established award presented by Korea's Ministry of Culture and Information. The film also took home the accolades for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects.This undeniably enjoyable popcorn production packs just the right amount of punch and pizazz to engage and entertain for a good two hours at the movies".

	schema:headline " Great societal commentary in a decent thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "First it is a decent thriller but not great. And I agree with other reviewers that it does contain clichs and borrowed elements from different movies. However this is not a knock against the writerdirector Hanmin Kim because nothing is new under the sun. Quentin Tarantino is a master of using clichs and borrowed elements into his own for example. Although Kim might not have meant to borrow conscientiously as Tarantino. Regardless the movie's pace character developments and great visual make this a pleasure to watch. I'd give 7 or 8 just for the movie.I hope many of you get to see the director's cut because a great societal commentary could be missed if those deleted scenes are not shown. The studio apparently envisioned more of a popcorn blockbuster with faster pace and shorter runtime or they didn't want to shove the morality pill against moviegoer's throat. Nevertheless the societal commentary was brave and well thought out. This embedded element make this a solid 9.Let me explain for those who didn't get to watch the director's cut. Namyi and Jain live near border between China and Korea. Korean government has set a harsh law to curb migration whoever crosses a river to China regardless of reasons can never be back. Modernday North Korean government has that rule now. North Korean refugees when captured in China are sent back to North Korea to have them tortured in concentration camps andor killed. Even families and relatives even grandchildren can be punished. Thus those who escape to China are stuck there and live in fear. An escaped North Korean in China who are an epitome of a refugee has never been granted a refugee status. Only escape route is going into an embassy or go through the desert to Mongolia. Sadly many are captured and killed in trying to do so. The tragic thing is that South Korean government even though they recognize every North Korean as its citizen as stated in its Constitution do not try to get these North Korean refugees out of China.In the movie NamYi and Jain are also stuck as shown in a deleted scene. They are not allowed back by their own countrymen. Chinese military are after them. Only a hero raised up to face its fears brought its loved ones back home. I hope South Korean government faces its fear of economic power of China and put up a fight to get its rightful citizens their refugee status and their ticket home.Last scene includes NamYi wanting to go to Seoul and give his sister Jain pretty shoes. He deserves to have that dream of going home and enjoy its prosperity because he and his sister belongs in Seoul. That's where their home is.Now the fight comes to us. China wants to use North Korea as a strategic buffer between Western allies of South Korea and Japan. North Korean government needs China to survive and keep their people bottled up because North Korea and China sees the refugees as a precursor to the reunification as was in Germany. This is the frontier of the greatest injustice of our generation. It is time for them to pay for the horrific crimes against humanity. We may sit quietly. Or we may wake up and be aware of the most evil government in the face of the earth today North Korea and its biggest enabler China.".

Well as a movie fanatic I found my getaway in foreign movies and man was I not entertained. This is one of the best movies of 2011 in Korea Korean is making its mark in Movie industry and it boasts with Four Awards The film won four awards in 48th Daejong Awards to Best Actor for Park Haeil and Best New Actress for Moon Chaewon. The film is about an archer who risks his life to save his sister from slavery under Prince Dorgan's rule. Other reviews have likened it to Apocalypto but this is nothing like it and Apocalypto doesn't even come close to it and I will tell you why War of the Arrows is not your typical set battle piece it shows emotions you can see their fear desperation and panic for example the way they portray death is sad there is no joy in it even for your enemy while Apocalypto showed victims and victimization this shows sacrifice and dedication and staying true to your promise no matter the situation. While Apocalypto was on Native Americans and doesn't make you relate to the whole ordeal this one makes you wonder what you could have done faced with the same situation. While Apocalypto showed blood thirsty humans turned to beasts kind of thing for their benefit this one is the survival of the fittest. The common thing in them is obviously the gore and violence. Taking this into consideration I find this one a winner. It is fast paced and will have you glued to your screen from the beginning till the end and what makes it a masterpiece is that the stunts are real it doesn't use you CGI except on the tigers scene which I will excuse as getting the real tiger could have dumbed it down a bit Overall this is a masterpiece and worth your time".

A person learns a little history and the thematic messages can be so relevant to the culture you live in today. However war of the arrows failed to do that because it forgot to talk about it. Visually its obvious it takes place in a certain time way back when in history. But thats about it. Sure there are enough references here and there to add to the plot but it begins to tear at the seams abit. I loved this movie because it had great pacing it had great acting and overall it used every movie clich and trope to its advantage. But it needed a little bit more substance in story. So if you are happy with excellent visuals great acting  THe guy who plays the villain oh my word he is in my top ten list of villains and killer archery scenes then definitely watch this movie. However if you are going to scratch your head at the thin plot... don't. While I wished there was a bit more it was entertaining and moving enough for me to give it a 810.".

The acting is of a high level. The lead actor is very cool and although I watch a few Korean films They have become very good in recent years as has their anime. I have never seen him before. The only part I felt let it down was the CGI tiger. Still that's a small criticism of what is a very fine film. If you get the chance watch it. You won't be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful Movie! and some clarification for others.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best movies I've seenI can watch it time and time again without getting bored. It gives a very nice depiction of Korean culture and history that I enjoy but I know for a fact that many others can't understand many of the situations and problems that appear because of the cultural factor as well as other small details.1. The reviewer was unsure as to how the brother and sister's family became traitors. If you pay attention early on in the movie you learn that the children's father was framed for treason against the king. If the father is a traitor his wife children and even servants are guilty of the same crimes by default. The movie even goes on to explain that the king had betrayed his country and that he didn't care for his faithful subjects in other words he abandoned a faithful subject like the children's father. 2. The reviewer claimed that the brother looked too old to play the part. Well the child actor as well as character in the movie would have been anywhere from 15 to 18 years old based on the fact that he still wore his hair in a long braid down his back. Therefore it would make sense that 13 years after the prologue the brother is well past his twenties and looking older than one might expect. He actually isn't young. 3. How did the brother know about the tiger and why did it only attack the villains? The scene prior to the appearance of the tiger shows that the brother sensed the tiger's presence. Having spent his life honing his senses in the woods and living near a tiger trap tiger trap  tigers nearby as shown in the early scenes it's not a surprise that he could sense the animal's presence. As for the tiger only attacking the Chinese...story purposes. Also the villains kill it before it can turn around to attack the brother. 4. The reviewer wondered how the brother pulled the arrow out of his own heart and then was able to accurately shoot. With this kind of logic how would anyone expect wars to be won? The brother was running on adrenaline and desperation to save his sister. Damaging the heart in that way does not result in immediate death. He still had time before the heart finally stopped beating. 5. The reviewer thought that it was harsh of the brother to burn the Manchu Prince and that he didn't deserve such a horrific death. We can't forget that the prince invaded a country while butchering innumerable people and raping a different prisoner every night this is implied in at least two scenes. Yes as the reviewer said he didn't do anything to the sister but he intended to rape her and attempted to kill her after doing the same to many others before her. 6. The reviewer thinks that it was too easy for the brother to find and rescue his sister and overcome the fierce looking soldiers. Um. But untrained American soldiers won the Revolutionary War against highly trained British militia did they not? Again the brother had lived his life honing his skills. He was far from untrained and it's far from improbable that he could overtake a few fierce looking soldiers. In addition there is cultural meaning behind the whole chase itself. The brother had made a promise to his father to protect his younger sister acting like her father. The promise itself is what drove him to such great lengths in order to save her. Without that immense determination to keep that promise and honor his father he would not have had the means to do what he did. The chase was far from easy and the movie is clear proof of that. 7. Finally the reviewer disliked the movie because of the endless supply of arrows. In case no one else notices during the movie the brother is constantly retrieving used arrows fixing them turning old arrows into new ones and making new ones altogether. There are whole scenes dedicated to showing the reason behind the endless supply.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the largest Korean blockbusters of last year it's not too difficult to understand why it's such a crowd pleaser of an action movie. Lone skilled marksmen almost always makes for a beeline at the box office just look any war film and you'll probably find the sniper the sexiest of the lot for that one shot one kill mantra that gets translated on screen in romanticised terms. If it's a period piece then that will be the skilled archer relying on his ranged weapon to take down enemies before they even know what hit them.But it's not just plain wall to wall action from start to end as there's a proper story to ground and root the audience emotionally to the characters involved in this period war film. Set in the 17th century it tells of the brother and sister pair of NamYi Park HarIl and JaIn Moon ChaeWon having to escape from a purge by the King on their household for what would be treason supposedly committed by their father. He sacrifices himself to get them going to one of his friend's abode where they grow up and JaIn is soon to be married to their benefactor's son SeoGoon Kim MuYeol. But the marriage ceremony got rudely interrupted by the second invasion of the Manchus who come in full force to plunder rape and enslave.Separated from his sister and her groom War of the Arrows becomes that one man bowand arrow Rambo who's forced into violence and killing of anyone standing in his way to be reunited with his sibling. The stage was carefully set to let the audience know just how skilled our leading protagonist is using what would be his father's famed bow with the ability to bend his projectiles ala Wanted except that this is more science than science fiction. For amateur archers out there there's also a distinction pointed out by the invading Manchu forces who compare the difference in skillset and equipment used by their lone enemy involving a shorter and thus more mobile bow as compared to their longer versions with a half pound arrow tip able to bust through bark trunk and tear a hole in the body. There's also the crossbow involved but it's just not as sexy as the traditional stringed weapon.Writerdirector Kim HanMin maintains a keen pace and never lets the narrative sag once danger sets in from all quarters with everyone involved both hunter and prey realize that the tables can be turned at any time. Battles are kept tremendously tensed with build up just like how one would arm the bow weapon building up a good old fashion tension before letting it all rip. And a good balance is struck in keeping things quite varied rather than to be reliant on the stringed weapon all the time especially since SeoGoon doesn't have any fighting ability other than the ubiquitous sword. And it's not just kill or be killed as a mantra as NamYi has decent humanity put into him never wanting to kill for the sake of and demonstrating fair play even if the enemies fail to reciprocate.Park HaeIl plays the mustachioed leading man with aplomb and draws you to his cause without much fuss. Everyone will be able to identify with the need to rescue one's family and sibling and the story has it all to include daring raids and treacherous escapes heightened by the cat and mouse game of pursuit almost all of the time as it races toward a fantastically set up finale. Moon ChaeWon also won the 2011 Blue Dragon and Daejong Film Awards for Best Mew Actress and it's no surprise to see why being the feisty sister who doesn't back down without putting up a good fight a marked difference in the standard damsel in distress role which makes the final battle all the more exciting with a random factor thrown into the entire equation.With all round good performances and a story that sucks you in from the get go it's a standard fare action film done right with likable heroes and heroines and villains that you'll love to hate drawing a very clear and distinct line between good and evil death and survival that makes this a clear blockbuster and crowd pleaser. It's not every day that one gets to see a Robin Hood equivalent film that's grittier and more gripping with plenty of edge of your seat material and War of the Arrows is that kind of film done to perfection. Highly recommended!".

After the movie really got going it kept building momentum right up until the climax. Some parts seem a little unrealistic but overall I was emotionally invested in this movie and enjoyed it quite a bit.";

Even though for me the rating of stars were low because how the movie I felt was rushed and not a whole lot of explanation in the movie. It was solely survival and escape type of movie. I watched Mel Gibson's Apocalypto and this was nothing like it. Like Phanatic said in the beginning it's on the surface but it's not what the movie is about. Just because you see someone getting murder the same way doesn't mean it's a knock off. It's a lot different a whole different movie. This is also not a Hollywood film the way they portray death is sad there is know joy in it even for your enemy. One thing I like in this movie is their emotions that you can clearly see in this film. When their in battle you can see their fear desperation and panic. And to overcome this shows what a true hero is it makes you feel like this can easily be me and what will I do would I have done the same? This is where all my stars go for characters and the actors that played in the film. I just felt something was missing in the story and not fully explained. Oh yea one thing tons of action but none of that special effects flying through the air type of things. This thing is real battle scenes that trained people can do.".

	schema:reviewBody "War of the Arrows is a story about a young man in hot pursuit of a marauding Manchurian army that has captured and enslaved his sister and her groom on their wedding day in 15th century Korea. Wayward though the young man may be he's a savant with the bow and arrow and he puts his deadly skills to use as he relentlessly pursues the attackers.Although it doesn't involve the gun battles typically associated with the genre this film is really more war movie than action flick. The film rarely deviates from the harried catandmouse game between the marauders and the ostensible hero and could mistakenly be seen as taking place in real time. Therein lies one of the film's problems. The chase sequences and flurry of arrows piercing the air are relentless and absorb nearly all the film's running time leaving little room for plot or character development. This film is all style over substance it's barbarian Manchurians the baddies vs. saltoftheearth Koreans the goodies.We know the Manchurians are the baddies not just because they throw Korean babies down wells but because they're the cool ones with their brassstudded leather coats shaved heads or razoredged mohawks and general exhibition of badassery. They are lead by a playboy prince who prefers to spend his time ravishing newly captured women in a garish mobile bordello he leaves the details and actual fighting to his ubermacho uncles and the elite squad of warriors they personally command. But little else is known about them. Is their attack part of an allout invasion of the Korean peninsula or a quick raid across the border for booty? Why is the pampered prince who appears to have no military role even there? Certain early scenes suggest the possibility of a strained relationship between the young prince and his allwarrior business uncles but it's never explored. There are no strategy sessions between the prince and his commanders or among the uncles and their elite warriors that might flesh out the characters.As for the Koreans little time is spent preparing us for the mayhem that ensues. At the onset the hero is a teenager who barely escapes his family's destruction with only his little sister and his father's prized bow and arrows in tow. Flash forward thirteen years and the hero is a wayward fellow with mean archery skills who reluctantly allows his sister's marriage to their benefactor's son to proceed. The relationship between and among these characters is barely explored. There are no tender scenes between brother and sister or the betrothed that make us yearn for reunification after separation and much bloodshed. Ironically one of the film's best sequences involves the pampered prince attempting to have his way with the pretty sister. Her feistiness and the fact that she speaks his language intrigue him. He likens seducing her to tanning a tiger's hide as her roughness will become supple under his handiwork. The brief battle of wills between these two characters and the mild sexual tension elicited provide a muchneeded break from the pure actionoriented sequences that predominate. Unfortunately the prince is killedoff far too soon and the rescue of the girl halfway through the film leaves the finale somewhat anticlimatic. The final confrontation may be dramatic by virtue of the manner in which the arrow battle is executed but emotionally it falls flat.The failure to adequately develop the plot isn't the only flaw with this movie. While the cast is for the most part good the lead male is woefully miscast. Aside from possessing superior archery skills there's little to distinguish the hero from the other household staff who are caught up in the mayhem. Quite simply he lacks the charisma and screen presence to carry this film which is propelled almost exclusively by the baddies. They possess the macho physicality and exhibit the serious badass 'tude required for their roles. Although the story compels me to feel something for the hero I found myself far more interested in the invaders. I enjoyed the film for what it was but was left emotionally flatlined at the end because of its flaws.".

Imagine the excellent TV series Vikings but with way more action and set in 17th century Korea. This is a topoftheline adventureaction flick with awesome forest cinematography superb costuming effective score convincing acting and consistent thrills. All you have to do is persevere through the first half hour and then it's nonstopthrills from there. There are some flaws like the villagers being wholly surprised by the Manchurian attack to the point of obliviously performing their regular activities to the very moment the horsemen strike by the sword even a wedding ceremony is completely surprised. Why sure! The chasm sequence is also weak because the warriors wouldn't be able to successfully jump across unless it was 20' wide or less but it looks much wider. Then there's the lame tiger CGI. Despite these negatives this is an eminent adventureaction flick.Unless you speak Korean you'll have to click on the English audio or subtitles on the DVD. The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in South Korea. GRADE B".

	schema:headline " War of the Arrows  A duel with bows and arrows";
	schema:reviewBody "Its simple story is unfolded in Korea of the 17th century the mid period of the Chosun Dynasty. In 1623 Kwanghaegun was dethroned by the Injo revolt and immediately replaced by his cousin King Injo. Young Nam i's father a military officer was killed being labeled as a traitor and as ordered by his father before his death Nami managed to escape with his younger sister at the last minute. They went to their father's friend living outside the capital who took a great risk by raising them as the part of his household while hiding their identities.13 years have passed. Both NamiPark Haeil and JainMoon Chaewon are now grownups. Although still protected well Nami has virtually no future except enjoying the hunt with his servants or polishing his archery skills for it is impossible for him to enter the government due to his background. Meanwhile Jain is happily going to marry Seo GoonKim Mooyeol the only son of their protector who has liked her since they were young and Nami is happy for his sister.However in the middle of their wedding the vast army of Qing suddenly invades their town. Unlike King Kwanghaegun King Injo made an unwise diplomatic choice of disregarding the rising power of the Qing Dynasty which would soon replace the Ming Dynasty in China. He paid a hefty price for underestimating Qing he had to personally surrender to the Emperor in legendary humiliation while many of his people were taken to Qing as the prisonershostages. Jain and her groom are among them and it is Nami's mission to rescue them from the Qing army and take them back to their country. He is willing to eliminate anyone standing on his way with his bow but it won't be easy. While he is mostly alone there is the elite force led by the Qing general Jyu SintaRyoo Seungyong who notices Nami's uncanny talent right from their first encounter and recognizes him as a worthy opponent to him and his men.The film relatively lags while establishing the characters and their situations during the first half but once everything is set and ready it kicks into high gear to the full speed. You may find the use of shaky cam in period drama distracting but it is right approach because it is necessary for the characters to move fast and think fast like Jason Bourne for their survival and win. While rarely losing the sense of the direction the movie is filled with energy to tighten our attention to what is going on the screen. Being real is always important for this kind of action movies and the director Kim Hanmin and his crews do deserve the praise for their accomplishment. You can see the people in the movie are really running in the mountain forests or in one gripping scene jumping over the cliff to reach to the other side across a ravine.And I was very amused by how the arrows were used in the film. The arrows are more flexible than bullets so some seemingly impossible trajectories are possible at least in the movie. While I believe the arrows on the screen are CGIs in many cases like the bullets in Wanted2008 these arrows look real and destructive and they are not shot mindlessly. The characters usually shoot their arrows based on quick calculations and their instincts  that makes the confrontations between them look like a deadly chess game between the expert snipers with rifles.The characterization is broad but the performers have strong presence to pull us into the plot. Although it is the national conflict at first the story ultimately becomes the personal conflict between the characters determined to stop each other with their all hearts and brains and we become involved in it. Park Haeil is a believable action movie hero of the 17th century you can sense he will even descend to the bottom of hell to save his sister and his friend. Moon Chaewon is also good as the bride who is as resourceful as her groom. In the action movies made in these days the female characters no longer stand back from guys' actions and Jain does not disappoint us with her quiet but defiant attitude to her enemies.The villain is always one of the crucial factors determining the success of the action movies and Ryoo Seungyong who was impressive as the leader of North Korean military unit in recent South Korean movie The Front Line2011 gives a forceful performance with his penetrating eyes and steely will behind them. He and other nonChinese actors are pretty much believable with their Manchurian dialogues at least in my viewMachurian has been almost a dead language since the Qing Dynasty engulfed China and then assimilated itself into the Han Chinese culture so few will find faults in the movie. I find it interesting how the movie allows them to have some human sides. They are not vicious monsters and they have an understandable reason for being a lot furious about Nami and others who meddle with their business. Though they are quite determined to kill our hero you may feel a little sorry for them.Sidenote As some South Korean critic pointed out there is a major historical error in the movie with Qing prince Dorgon who is depicted as the character more or less than a petty bad guy. Unlike his fictional counterpart he lived longer and did lots of thing to solidify the Qing Dynasty as the regent prince. That does not spoil the entertainment but I think it is not bad to know about such a historical fact before watching the movie.".

While he is mostly alone there is the elite force led by the Qing general Jyu SintaRyoo Seungyong who notices Nami's uncanny talent right from their first encounter and recognizes him as a worthy opponent to him and his men.The film relatively lags while establishing the characters and their situations during the first half but once everything is set and ready it kicks into high gear to the full speed. You may find the use of shaky cam in period drama distracting but it is right approach because it is necessary for the characters to move fast and think fast like Jason Bourne for their survival and win. While rarely losing the sense of the direction the movie is filled with energy to tighten our attention to what is going on the screen. Being real is always important for this kind of action movies and the director Kim Hanmin and his crews do deserve the praise for their accomplishment. You can see the people in the movie are really running in the mountain forests or in one gripping scene jumping over the cliff to reach to the other side across a ravine.And I was very amused by how the arrows were used in the film. The arrows are more flexible than bullets so some seemingly impossible trajectories are possible at least in the movie. While I believe the arrows on the screen are CGIs in many cases like the bullets in Wanted2008 these arrows look real and destructive and they are not shot mindlessly. The characters usually shoot their arrows based on quick calculations and their instincts  that makes the confrontations between them look like a deadly chess game between the expert snipers with rifles.The characterization is broad but the performers have strong presence to pull us into the plot. Although it is the national conflict at first the story ultimately becomes the personal conflict between the characters determined to stop each other with their all hearts and brains and we become involved in it. Park Haeil is a believable action movie hero of the 17th century you can sense he will even descend to the bottom of hell to save his sister and his friend. Moon Chaewon is also good as the bride who is as resourceful as her groom. In the action movies made in these days the female characters no longer stand back from guys' actions and Jain does not disappoint us with her quiet but defiant attitude to her enemies.The villain is always one of the crucial factors determining the success of the action movies and Ryoo Seungyong who was impressive as the leader of North Korean military unit in recent South Korean movie The Front Line2011 gives a forceful performance with his penetrating eyes and steely will behind them. He and other nonChinese actors are pretty much believable with their Manchurian dialogues at least in my viewMachurian has been almost a dead language since the Qing Dynasty engulfed China and then assimilated itself into the Han Chinese culture so few will find faults in the movie. I find it interesting how the movie allows them to have some human sides. They are not vicious monsters and they have an understandable reason for being a lot furious about Nami and others who meddle with their business. Though they are quite determined to kill our hero you may feel a little sorry for them.Sidenote As some South Korean critic pointed out there is a major historical error in the movie with Qing prince Dorgon who is depicted as the character more or less than a petty bad guy. Unlike his fictional counterpart he lived longer and did lots of thing to solidify the Qing Dynasty as the regent prince. That does not spoil the entertainment but I think it is not bad to know about such a historical fact before watching the movie.";

This movie can easily compare to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon House of Flying Daggers HaraKiri  Warriors of the Rainbow. But unfortunately this movie didn't get its due credit and also publicity because this movie don't have big names like Ang Lee or something otherwise acting direction screen play story and editing are top notch. This is a one among few war movies which shows violence and bloodshed very much but you don't feel like its just gore you feel pain you feel brutality of the war. Of late Koreans are coming up with great movies but among all the Korean movies I have seen so far this is the BEST. A 7.1 critic rating somehow don't justify at least to me.".

We get to see the characters cracking up under pressure and fighting with each other giving the movie a realistic feel. The horror element is present throughout the movie going from mild to fullon ghostly tension as the story progresses. The movie does a good job at developing the characters and building up the menacing atmosphere.The actors all did a fine job especially the lead actress with some overthetop acting from the other members of the group albeit not very distracting. Although it was marketed as a horror the movie takes a turn towards the mystery genre towards the end and tends to drag a bit in the unveiling of the final twist. The truly scary scenes are quite rare but pretty effective and wellmade albeit not very original if you've seen your fair share of Asian horror. The cinematography is beautiful to look at and it even dabbles a bit into experimental territory towards the end.While this isn't anything groundbreaking or original in terms of horror the music aspect and the commentary directed at the life of idols gives an interesting spin. Overall the movie does a good job at entertaining you being a nice addition to the genre.".

When they start performing the song 'White' they rocket to the top.Unfortunately for them members of the band start having mental problems. One thinks she's being strangled. Another starts having problems with her eyes. Both end up in hospital with some actual injuries. How the real injuries occur is not explained all that much in the film.The agency attempts to fill in the injured parties to reconstitute the group. The remaining members investigate the old band and agency to see what went wrong the first time through. One of the replacements is injured in a freak accident well perhaps while filming a side reality show segment.Eunjoo the girl who is to be the next lead singer makes some progress after sleeping with the sponsor of the group. She has a vision of her predecessor being wounded and committing suicide then is able to find what's left of the suicide note. The two remaining hold a religious ceremony to soothe the dead lead singer and they hope things will be better this time around.Eunjoo dies her hair white and makes a solo recording. All seems to go well. The three injured girls wake up simultaneously in the hospital and make rapid recoveries. They blame Eunjoo but she is not having it.Meanwhile the remaining girl from the original Pink Dolls and the sound engineer continue the fine examination of the VHS tape content from the first filming of 'White.'The three girls injured previously make a date to perform. Instead of performing they drink poison to commit suicide. Live.The research with the sound engineer continues. Will new information save Eunjoo?ScoresCinematography 1010 Sharp focus lush color saturation good framing just lovely.Sound 1010 Good!Acting 710 Meh.Screenplay 710 I rate it high on coherence but low on resolution.".

When they start performing the song 'White' they rocket to the top.Unfortunately for them members of the band start having mental problems. One thinks she's being strangled. Another starts having problems with her eyes. Both end up in hospital with some actual injuries. How the real injuries occur is not explained all that much in the film.The agency attempts to fill in the injured parties to reconstitute the group. The remaining members investigate the old band and agency to see what went wrong the first time through. One of the replacements is injured in a freak accident well perhaps while filming a side reality show segment.Eunjoo the girl who is to be the next lead singer makes some progress after sleeping with the sponsor of the group. She has a vision of her predecessor being wounded and committing suicide then is able to find what's left of the suicide note. The two remaining hold a religious ceremony to soothe the dead lead singer and they hope things will be better this time around.Eunjoo dies her hair white and makes a solo recording. All seems to go well. The three injured girls wake up simultaneously in the hospital and make rapid recoveries. They blame Eunjoo but she is not having it.Meanwhile the remaining girl from the original Pink Dolls and the sound engineer continue the fine examination of the VHS tape content from the first filming of 'White.'The three girls injured previously make a date to perform. Instead of performing they drink poison to commit suicide. Live.The research with the sound engineer continues. Will new information save Eunjoo?ScoresCinematography 1010 Sharp focus lush color saturation good framing just lovely.Sound 1010 Good!Acting 710 Meh.Screenplay 710 I rate it high on coherence but low on resolution.";

While the paranormal stuff is prominent there's also a strong focus on the characters who are as much affected by their shifting fortunes as they are any bumps in the night. You would think once the ghostly stuff showed up it would take center stage. Instead it runs parallel to the sudden pressures ego trips and bouts of jealousy of their new found fame meshing together very well and creating a greater emotional and psychological depth than one might expect from such a premise. The film is even fairly touching and somewhat sad at points aided by pretty good performances.The second main area is the visuals. There is a certain flare here. It's not Argento or Fulci by any stretch but the film does look really good. Whether it's a dark roomhallway or the flashiness of the dance stage the cinematography and imagery are strong. Even without caring for the plot and characters one could sit back and appreciate the look.Is the movie a masterpiece? No I wouldn't go that far but it is very enjoyable and if you're a horror movie fan with nothing to do on some afternoon you could do a lot worse than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Suspension of disbelief is a wonderful phenomenon. It's used in many genres effectively and why not in romantic film? Although the Lakehouse mailbox took on some magical qualities the plot still worked for me on a deeper level. It's about connecting with your true soulmate when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt alone at a crowded party? Or who hasn't feared if they wait too long that they may never find that special someone? It's a part of the human condition this film examines. I mean look at the architecture of the Lake House itself. It's isolated yet beautiful in a Frank Lloyd Wright kind of way.This is a characterdriven story. It was fueled by the solid performances of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. They are so natural and comfortable together on screen. It's more than just physical attraction between two people and that's why the love story works. It's real chemistry between them. I believed these two could be walking along Lakeshore Drive holding hands together.I was rooting for these two characters to get together. They are likable. They have angst in their lives. They show vulnerability. Real human feelings. They are successful in their careers but there is still that void. In my opinion they are the right fit for each other. It's the underlying themes of this movie that give it substance not the fact that some of the plot is a bit farfetched. Love is illogical in many ways but when you find that certain someone it's magical.David Auburn's screenplay is firstrate. It creates the right mood. It has emotion in each scene. He makes the story palpable. This kept me interested. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. What more can you ask for in a touching love story? I enjoyed it.".

	schema:headline " Not without its shortcomings but interesting all the same";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't get it said one confused old man as he filed out of the theater.Listen up folks this movie is not that hard to understand. Take the time to wrap your brain around it and you shouldn't have a problem following along. However after listening to people talk after the movie I realize that some of you may walk away a little confused. So let me hold your hand and reveal a few facts that you should grasp before seeing this A Sandra is corresponding from 2006 B Keanu is corresponding from 2004 and C These time periods aren't mutually exclusive. Sandra's character still exists in the 2004 time period that Keanu is communicating from and vice versa.Got that? Good. Sandra can tell Keanu where she was in 2004 and Keanu can cross her path but the 2004 version of Sandra will have no clue who Keanu is. Makes sense right? So the trick is that the 2006 version of Sandra has to figure out where the 2006 version of Keanu is so that they can meet in Keanu's future AKA Sandra's present. Everything unfolds from there. Seriously it's not that complicated.I think most of the confusion exists because the script isn't as tight as it needs to be. It's frustrating because the story could have been much better and a few plot holes could have been easily eliminated with a couple of more rewrites. The most frustrating thing to me and I reveal this because it's best you know it upfront is that we're never told what exactly is causing the time rift between them.We're expected to just accept it as fantasy and not demand any explanations. You'll enjoy the film much more if you understand that not all loose ends will be tied and you can ignore the plot holes I alluded to. I'd love to discuss them and explain my specific issues with them but doing so would reveal way too much of the story. Email me after you see it and we'll discuss.Throwing those quibbles aside I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. Perhaps I'm a sucker for romance movies that aren't scared to throw a little of Nick Drake's Pink Moon down on us but I like that this is a romance that plays it a bit unconventionally. Is it for everybody? No. There's a lot of talking though it never gets as gay and flowery as I feared and some of you might find the pace slow. Though I felt it more deliberate.I also applaud the performances of Sandra and Keanu who is nowhere near as robotic as you may expect. I actually bought into his emoting! Good job Mr. Cool Breeze but you really need to work on making your sneezes more believable.Fans of romance movies will adore the theme of love and how its power can change someone's life but since I'm into more masculine topics I preferred watching the pieces of the time puzzle fall into place. It reminded me a little bit of Frequency  Keanu does something in 2004 and then Sandra recognizes its impact in 2006. Then we follow along as they try to figure out how to meet.I wanted one of them to leave their hand in the mailbox and see if the other could see it when they went to retrieve the next letter. Perhaps a disembodied hand wiggling around in a mailbox wouldn't have fit with the mood that the writers were going for but I would've laughed.Speaking of mood I thought this was another strongpoint of the movie. The cinematography is great creating a cold atmospheric setting. Chicago's impressive architecture is used to great effect. If you like stunning visuals to set your romantic mood then you won't be disappointed.As long as you're willing to give this film your undivided attention for approximately 100 minutes and you can easily forgive its shortcomings then The Lake House will prove to be an intriguing piece of film for lovers of the romance genre.And hey even if romances aren't your thing there might just be enough mystery here to keep your interest. After the movie my friend commented As far as romances go this is probably the best I've seen. And he hated The Notebook ladies.THE GIST The Lake House suffers from lapses in logic unnecessary plot holes and predictability but I appreciated its attempt to add something fresh to the romance genre. The intriguing mystery and the performances of Sandra and Keanu are effective enough for me to grant my approval to those of you who already have an interest in this one.".

It's best if you don't overanalyze the timetravel details and just go with it... it's a movie after all. Seriously I wasn't expecting that much and I got a better feeling from this movie than I have in a long time  it made me feel warm and happy. Plus the whole theater laughed at some parts plus people gasped and cried and at the end everyone applauded. That's a good sign if you ask me. I don't watch previews so I don't know what they give away about the plot so I'm not going to give much of anything away here. I will just say that to me this was a uniquely told romantic story. I happen to like Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock although they are by no means favorites of mine nor do I consider them to be consistently amazing actors more often they're not... at least he's not.... But they made this story work for me and I believe they have good chemistry. The movie is set in Chicago and shows the city off nicely without trying to beat you over the head with it a la The BreakUp. One thing I think I related to a lot with these characters is that they are both pretty isolated and lonely although not in a sadsack way. I felt a longing from them for someone to relate to and even though they have opportunities for other people to be involved in their lives... well it's not what's best for them and they don't settle. Plus the actors are both in their 40s and I like seeing love stories that aren't about either two 22yearolds or a 40yearold man and a 22yearold girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "There IS a quality to The Lake House that lingers in the mind days afterward.For a film in which the element of Time is uniquely important The Lake House manages to convey an odd sense of universal timelessness. It is as though the specific When is less relevant than the universality of human thought feeling and decision. An almost mystical quality.The Lake House is that rare film which not only invites but welcomes a repeat viewing. The first time simply follow What happens in the story. See the film again to more fully enjoy How this story elegantly unfolds.This is NOT a time travel film. Repeat NOT. Each character in this film experiences only his or her own natural time moving forward in the usual linear chronological way. What changes is each character's perspective on what they are experiencing over time and how each's perception of their Past informs Present decisions which impact Future events.If I had to pick one theme to describe this picture at the time they occur we may not even recognize the most important encounters or events in our lives.Alex Keanu Reeves and Kate Sandra Bullock are two seemingly unconnected persons who have lived in the lake house of the title  exactly two years apart. Through seeming accident they find that they can communicate with each other directly in immediate personally experienced time through the mysterious mailbox at the lake house. We then follow the often startling events each experiences  and writes about to the other  over the next two years of their lives Alex from February of 2004 to 2006 Kate from February 2006 to 2008. The result is . . . an extraordinary film that both satisfies the intellect and engages on a surprisingly emotional level.Their roles here are a significant departure from usual for both Reeves and Bullock but not to worry. Individually this is either's best work anywhere. Collectively their chemistry is exceptional. Subplots in the story are developed through some superb supporting performances most notably the two parents. Christopher Plummer is achingly brilliant as Alex' demanding genius architect father and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy positively oozes wit and warmth as Kate's mother.The lake house itself . . . physically brings out so much emotional subtext in this film that it ought to be credited as a separate character. If no artistarchitect has actually built this house they should!Altogether The Lake House is one of most rewarding films of any type I have seen in many years.HIGHLY recommended.".

	schema:headline " Truly Moving Picture";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on May 26th 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the  judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A  Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically  expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland  gave that award to this film.  An attractive educated professionally fulfilled Doctor Sandra  Bullock meets an attractive educated sensitive architect Keanu  Reeves via letters and a past common residency of a particular lake  house. What could be the problem? The problem is that they are  currently living two years apart and then again at the exact same time  in this romantic heartwrenching dramatic fairy tale.  The Doctor leaves the lake house in rural Illinois in 2006 in order to  advance her career and find happiness in Chicago. She leaves a note to  an unknowntoher new tenant the architect to forward her mail. They  correspond to each other and slowly discover that he is actually living  in the house 2 years earlier in 2004. And  they share the same dog.  But somehow the viewer can suspend disbelief and get into the story  because the two characters are believable and intelligent and are  initially just as skeptical of the time riddle as the viewer.  Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock reunite for the first time since  Speed. The genre of The Lake House is completely different but the  actors are just as complementary and likable in this fantasy tale. They  both display a deep patient and profound love for each other. And  they do so with grace and charm and a chemistry that can't be readily  explained.  Much of this film plays like a mystery with mothers and fathers  siblings and boy and girl friends weaving in and out of the story in  the present time of 2004 and the present time of 2006. But through it  all the Doctor and the architect ultimately never lose hope that they  can solve this time puzzle and can actually be together at the same  moment in time.  FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a  listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either  at the theater or available on video.".

	schema:headline " Waiting for the Right Time and One";
	schema:reviewBody "In a great scene from The Lake House Kate Forster Sandra Bullock tells Alex Wyler Keanu Reeves what she loves about Jane Austin's Persuasion. What Kate loves about the book is that love can occur at the wrong time and even when the characters wait it doesn't work out. Alex again inquires why it is Kate's favorite. Kate laughs. Magical chemistry. This is part of the brilliant charm of Director Alejandro Agresti's The Lake House. It is a touching and funny love story about Kate's conceit that you wait for the right time and for the right one. Those familiar with the movie's trailer know that in the story by David Auburn based on previous work by EunJeong Kim and Jina Yeo that time is the insurmountable obstacle posed to Alex and Kate. As the story opens Kate Bullock is a lonely doctor dedicated to helping people who leaves this exquisitely designed lake house outside Chicago as she begins her residency in the city. She leaves a note to the incoming tenant in the mailbox. Alex a talented architect who sold out on his craft to build tract homes receives Kate's letter. However for Alex it is 2004. For Kate it is 2006. Yes this involves time travel. But fear not. There are no treaties on worm holes or Special Relativity. Agresti instead focuses on impact of completing relationships and true love.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are awesome together as Kate and Alex. Along with Agresti they create Kate and Alex as both lonely characters not in the morose sense rather people caught up in their lives without any compelling romantic relationship. Bullock is wonderful as Kate. Reeves who is often much maligned as wooden embodies an ease and compassion in Alex. Bullock and Reeves are great looking and they are a great looking couple. Their screen chemistry overcomes the inherent narrative constraints. The Lake House so works because we want to see Alex and Kate get together. David Auburn's story enrolls us in Alex and Kate's love story. Alex is estranged from his father Simon Wyler the cantankerous Christopher Plummer who is a legendary architect in the realm of Frank Lloyd Wright. Upon the prodigal son's return after traveling the world and selling out on his gifts all in an attempt to forget his father Simon asks Did it succeed? When Alex was 8 yearsold Simon built the Lake House for his wife Alex's mother. As Simon became successful and famous Alex's mother suffered and she eventually left. Later she became ill and passed away. Simon did not even attend her funeral. His cold words to Alex remained with him. In his eyes his father is a monster but he is still his father and commands his respect though not necessarily his love. Kate Bullock had only one significant relationship in her life that being with attorney Morgan a good Dylan Walsha nice guy but not the guy. Kate has also sold out on love under the guise of dedication to her work. In a touching moment Kate's Mom Willeke van Ammelrooy tells her about the forsaken great love of her life. The preposterous dual time line works only because Kate and Alex are smart running with it without ponder. And they fall in love. Alex says to his brother Henry Ebon MossBachrach She's more real to me than anything I've ever known.Writer Auburn brilliantly weaves the plot twists throughout and the results are funny and poignant. Acknowledge Auburn too for the clarity in retrospect within the story particularly at the end. Throughout there are hints that Kate and Alex have met before. There is the train station scene that is so heartfelt the theater was silent. Agresti and Auburn are great romantics. The Lake House is a testament to true love and having one's life being whole and complete. They manage a sense of yearning and regret with humor and compassion. Sandra Bullock is stunning in her understated performance. She brings such a grace and authenticity to Kate. Keanu Reeves compellingly displays the swirling emotions just below the surface. Here his subtle charm is impressively leveraged. The Lake House is an amazing and timeless love story well worth seeing.".

Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing and enough closeups to satisfy all. Christopher Plummer was an interesting supporting actor and as always commanded the screen. As a matter of fact there were a lot of interesting supporting actors one from the TV series 24 there was Jack the dog and of course the Lakehouse. I'm sorry I forgot to mention the architecture of Chicago and the mailbox.The whole time issue kept us talking long after the movie was over. Don't get too caught up in the plausibility aspect just enjoy it as a romantic fantasy we all need some escape now and then. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves fans won't be disappointed and I am sure they may pick up a few new ones along the way. A great release to end the Hollywood drought of late. Go see it!".

As a matter of fact there were a lot of interesting supporting actors one from the TV series 24 there was Jack the dog and of course the Lakehouse. I'm sorry I forgot to mention the architecture of Chicago and the mailbox.The whole time issue kept us talking long after the movie was over. Don't get too caught up in the plausibility aspect just enjoy it as a romantic fantasy we all need some escape now and then. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves fans won't be disappointed and I am sure they may pick up a few new ones along the way. A great release to end the Hollywood drought of late. Go see it!";

I can truly say that you are sitting on the edge of your seat anticipating that moment that they will actually meet. The scene where they danced in the yard was beautiful.

I have often wished that someone would remake not that movie  because it is perfect as is but more the sensibility and many of the themes of that movie.There are many parallels here. It is partly set in Chicago. It is about time travel of a sort that relates to time blocking you from the one you love. Christopher Plummer who played Jane Seymour's manager in Somewhere in Time here plays a variation on that crotchety character in the role of Keanu Reeves' father  nicely bookending his career. Also the similarity in the last names of the lead  Christopher Reeve Keanu Reeves.There are so many things I loved about this movie. The soundtrack was pitch perfect including everything from Nick Drake to Carole King. The wardrobe was beautifully chosen conveying warmth and romance. The script was measured and never overblown. The performances were genuine and real even though the subject matter could be taken as fanciful by the unromantic at heart. The direction and cinematography were breathtaking. I would have given it a 10 but for the fact that in some spots the looping for dates was a bit off.There are many twists and turns and you never know until the last moment how it will actually end. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and sobbing by the end of it. This is the movie I have been waiting for Keanu Reeves to make for the longest time  I always knew he had this performance in him but was disappointed by the artificiality of films like Sweet November. And Sandra Bullock has never been better. This is a new addition to my all time top five movies.You will never look at slow dancing the same way again. I promise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am from Taiwan. I watched this movie on July 29 2006 in Taiwan. I cried real hard while watching the movie because it reminded me some of my most and beautiful memories. Nine years ago I was traveling in the US. Three weeks before I came back to Taiwan I met a very nice young man who was only 19 going 20 years old very soon. I am sure we had strong affection for each other but I was leaving soon and I am a lot older than himthough I never told him how old I was. I didn't think it was possible for us to have a future because I wanted to settle down and I don't think it was his time to do so. So I kept my affection for him as my secret and never told him how I felt about him. After I came back to Taiwan I tried to keep in touch with him but somehow we were just not meant to be. We were both busy and were moving around so we lost contact for a while. Finally about a month before his 21st birthday we got back in touch. I was so happy then. We exchanged a few emails and the last one I received from him was one week before his 21st birthday. The last thing I remembered was I said and did something silly which could have offended him on the phone and I didn't get to explain it properly. So after his birthday I never heard from him again. I thought that I offended him that's why he never got back in touch with me again. I was sad but to me he was too good to be true anyway. So I didn't think too much of it and just moved on with my life. At the end of May this year I occasionally read the diary I had kept during the 3 weeks with him and all my affection for him came back. I started to google him. After trying hard crazily for a month or so I finally confirmed that he died on his 21st birthday. An instant heartache caught me upon hearing the news and I can't believe that I didn't know about his death until 8 years later! I still hope that I had found the wrong guy who happened to have the same name.... After watching The Lake House I also wrote him emails to warn him. Who knows there are always mysterious things. What surprised me about the movie was it took place in Chicagowhere he was from. Although I know he wouldn't be able to receive my email physically I still write to him from time to time. And now I can finally tell him how I felt about him. I love this movie because in a way my dream came true in the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alright let's face it. Hollywood has yet to give us romance stories that actually have the elements of a good love story. Much less any good movies at all from chick flicks to clich stories.So I was sitting in the theater for another movie becoming bored at all the previews that were about love drugs sex and snakes on a plane. By chance I watched the trailer for this movie The Lake House and was enticed automatically. Being a teenage male myself I immediately set my sights on seeing the movie. It was a couple week's wait with me watching the trailer over and over again. Yes even the trailer is worth watching again as well as this movie.It's true that this movie is simply a remake of the Korean version which naturally has the same greatness as this one. In both the female lead has just moved out of the house overlooking the lake. She leaves a greeting in the mailbox asking the new tenant to forward her mail to her new address just in case some mail slips through the post. However the receiver of her letter the male lead finds this surprising because his father built the house and nobody's lived in it for years. So he sends back a letter received by the female lead after she visits her old home. They become aware of the dates that the other is placing on the letter and suddenly they realize that they are living two years apart the female lead in the future and the male lead in the past. The mailbox is their only way of contacting each other and through it they develop a deep understanding of each other falling in love. But they soon find out that living two years apart prevents them from being with each other. Their time lines run parallel with each other never clashing until now. No doubt that a masterpiece like this would raise a few confusions among audiences.I haven't seen Keanu or Sandra in any other films yet but that was all the more better for me to be surprised at their excellent acting without any bias of my own. While Keanu has to act as one that's stressed by his father and his brother Sandra's character is the more carefree spirit of course sentimental at times when needed.While the Korean version makes more sense on some parts the American version makes more sense on others. But unfortunately the thought of not understanding a movie and actually having to work in your mind frightens many Americans today and so they rarely enjoy these kinds of movies. But the true essence of Asian films is about making the audience actually think about the film and this leads to them becoming closer to the characters and the movie itself.I can leave an action film with a high spirit. I can leave a chick flick with a feedgood mood. But to leave a movie and actually having it stick in your mind is something that Hollywood rarely ever gives us and I was glad that out of the many films that Hollywood has and will give us this summer it gave us The Lake House.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Lake House starring long time friends Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock  working together again for the first time since Speed 1994  is a story of semimagical connection between a man and a woman which spans the width of two years. You see Kate Bullock and Alex Reeves have both lived in the same gorgeous house made entirely of glass. Kate is moving out and leaves a letter in the mailbox wishing the next tenant good luck and enjoyment in the house as well as a forwarding address for her mail. Through movie magic and possibly fate Alex  who just purchased the house  receives this letter and the two begin to correspond.Confused at first they soon realize they are living two years apart Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006. While an odd set of circumstances and theoretically impossible they continue to write. Both are failures when it comes to relationships and they find the letters a great chance to talk to someone of the opposite sex and not have to face rejection. Soon they fall in love but are not sure how they could ever meet to make a relationship work because of the time issues. They share a dog too complicated to explain here and their hearts. Attempts to meet do not work and they begin to lose hope. Can they find a way to be together? Or will this simply be another failed relationship to add to their lists? Despite what people have been saying I thoroughly enjoyed The Lake House. Complex scifi plot aside it comes down to a story about how two peoples lives change when they allow themselves to connect. It's honest. Its cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are good. Keanu and Sandra have an amazing onscreen chemistry as we have witnessed before in Speed but here it is more mature. Sandra delivers a performance closer to her character in Crash 2005 and less like that of Miss Congeniality. Kate is a charming but selfconscious and lonely woman. Keanu gives what I believe is his best performance in a movie yet! His famous slightly wooden acting style is perfect for the character of lonely architect Alex and he can really become someone quite believable and open in the moments when his character is happy. While the two do not share much direct onscreen time that serves to make the moments they do share it SO desirable. The viewer longs to see Alex and Kate meet face to face and for this relationship to work out for them. Especially delightful were the voiceovers of the letter reading and writing which filled the movie as other things happened. It was a clever way to keep them from always sitting at a desk and brightened the tone of the film overall.Forget thinking about how all the time travel works that's not the important part. The important point of this movie is the relationship between these two people. The magic of the time transcending mailbox only serves to bring them together but so do many other things in their lives as we come to find out. It gives the viewer hope that maybe they are destined for love like this  maybe not with the assistance of a post office receptacle  but fated in some way to meet that one person for them.The Lake House is a touching film free of all the hustle and bustle of modern American cinema and culture in general. There's no emailing just good oldfashioned letter writing. It's a throwback to the real movies  before we forgot how to make them  before we forgot that a movie is about the people in it and not about sex drugs and rock and roll. The Lake House is a beautiful film and you should really go see it. Don't go in expecting it to all make sense but go in with an open heart and open eyes and let it win you over. Critics have gone to theaters with their arms crossed and their minds made up already. Take a lesson from Alex and Kate open your heart and see what happens. And hey it's only 8.00. ".

Keanu gives what I believe is his best performance in a movie yet! His famous slightly wooden acting style is perfect for the character of lonely architect Alex and he can really become someone quite believable and open in the moments when his character is happy. While the two do not share much direct onscreen time that serves to make the moments they do share it SO desirable. The viewer longs to see Alex and Kate meet face to face and for this relationship to work out for them. Especially delightful were the voiceovers of the letter reading and writing which filled the movie as other things happened. It was a clever way to keep them from always sitting at a desk and brightened the tone of the film overall.Forget thinking about how all the time travel works that's not the important part. The important point of this movie is the relationship between these two people. The magic of the time transcending mailbox only serves to bring them together but so do many other things in their lives as we come to find out. It gives the viewer hope that maybe they are destined for love like this  maybe not with the assistance of a post office receptacle  but fated in some way to meet that one person for them.The Lake House is a touching film free of all the hustle and bustle of modern American cinema and culture in general. There's no emailing just good oldfashioned letter writing. It's a throwback to the real movies  before we forgot how to make them  before we forgot that a movie is about the people in it and not about sex drugs and rock and roll. The Lake House is a beautiful film and you should really go see it. Don't go in expecting it to all make sense but go in with an open heart and open eyes and let it win you over. Critics have gone to theaters with their arms crossed and their minds made up already. Take a lesson from Alex and Kate open your heart and see what happens. And hey it's only 8.00. ";

	schema:headline " Entertaining  but not as good as Il Mare";
	schema:reviewBody "I made it a point to rewatch the Korean original Il Mare the day before I watched The Lake House so that I would be able to compare the two. I enjoyed Lake House and as far as performances go I liked Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock as much as I did Lee Jung Jae and Jeon Ji Hyeon. Still I think it was in the filming editing and overall scripting that sees Il Mare winning hands down. The Lake House while entertaining and nice enough loses the innocent and whimsical quality that made Il Mare magical.Some thoughts on why this was so  The house. Il Mare was quaint while the Lake House was impersonal. In fact this was also a point made by Alex Keanu Reeves in the movie. He said that the house was made for ownership but was not a home. Hence it struck me as funny that Kate Sandra Bullock would find the Lake House the place where she felt most like herself. No such problems with Il Mare. The house truly WAS quaint...and magical. The letter box. The letter box in Il Mare was made of wood and beautifully carved. The one in Lake House was just...a letter box. In fact it looked beatenup and weathered. Of course it looks realistic  but it takes away the magical quality somewhat.The physical interaction between the 2 leads. There was none in Il Mare  which added to the desperate and aching loneliness of Sang Hyun and Eun Joo Jeon Ji Hyeon  especially for Sang Hyun when the closest he came to Eun Joo apart from the ending was at the train station when he sat next to her on the bench but did not talk to her as she was the girlfriend of another man. In Lake House Alex not only had a hearttoheart talk with Kate but even danced with her and kissed her. Somehow that also lessened the poignancy. I felt very deeply for Sang Hyun but not for Alex. And really isn't it a rather crummy thing to do to be kissing another guy's girl at the surprise party the said guy threw for that girl? Sang Hyun was even willing to help Eun Joo save the failed relationship with her boyfriend but Alex homed in on the girl when she was still with another guy. Of course one could argue that Eun Joo was in love with her boyfriend while Kate never quite felt the same way about Morgan which brings me to my next point...Kate's character. She seemed to me to have led Morgan on. I mean if you don't love the guy then why settle for him? Yet Kate in her loneliness wasn't fair to Morgan deciding to choose him when her heart was really still with Alex. Eun Joo felt she was still in love with her boyfriend and wrote to tell Sang Hyun so though she knew it would pain him. But at least she was being honest and apologised to Sang Hyun when she found out that she still could not quite forget Ji Hoon. Kate leading on Morgan annoying though he was somehow made her less admirable.The incessant talk in The Lake House. One of the things I really liked about Il Mare was the stillness of the movie. There were scenes when Sang Hyun and Eun Joo would just be doing things alone in silence with no talking. This again magnified their solitary state. The Lake House seemed to be afraid of silence. There was talk and action ALL THE TIME as though Hollywood was afraid that we wouldn't get what was going on.Annoying love rivals. Apart from Morgan there was Mona. Yes I know we are supposed to root for the leads but really would Mona be much of a threat anyway? The girl in Il Mare whose name I forget but she was very pretty and sweet and acted by Choi Yoonyeong was the one who helped Sang Hyun build the house he dedicated to his true love after he died.And I think that encapsulates the whole problem of why I like Lake House a lot less than Il Mare. The type of love showcased in Lake House seemed to be of a more selfish variety. In Il Mare it was selfless. The one time Eun Joo was knowingly selfish in asking Sang Hyun to stop her boyfriend from leaving her when she knew Sang Hyun's feelings for her it turned out to be a huge and crushing mistake that had tragic consequences. In The Lake House Kate and Alex were finally together when Kate made the selfserving decision to dump the guy she had promised to marry albeit saving Alex's life in the process.Just like the 2 houses. Il Mare the wooden childhood house come to life by the sea had a whimsical and magical quality about it that reflects the whole tone of the movie. The Lake House all glass and metal rings cold and hollow even as it appears attractive.".

Four characters in Brighton Beach Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in The Exorcist.But this is a director's film if there ever was one.  Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound editing and cinematography.  The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.Requiem for a Dream is not a movie for everyone.  It is the essence of independent filmmaking a daring engrossing artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.  Hollywood bubblegum this ain't.".

Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.

It's a film that has never been made before with nothing to compare to it  a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this but can't recommend it to them.  I've recommended it to two friends and they both had the same reaction  I am glad I watched it but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again knowing what you feel.As I sat watching the credits roll I began crying but I'm still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending partly the beauty yes of the film partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend not because I wanted to upset her but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line Happiness River's Edgeand The Deer Hunter.These films all share a quality that's difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film a work of art a piece of music but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think not just be entertained is important now and then.Favorite does not apply to this for me  this isn't about entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.I bought the film on DVD the day it came out but it took me around six months to watch it again. And only then because a friend of mine was curious. If anything the impact was heavier than the first time I watched it and I've vowed never to watch it ever again.Yet I have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films I have ever seen. Why? The acting is just amazing. Jennifer Connolly gives the best performance of her career not too tricky considering the movies she's been in and remains stunningly beautiful in a haggard sort of a way and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. Jared Leto annoyed me intensely in Fight Club but he's perfect as hapless junky Harry  forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. Marlon Wayans is equally brilliant  wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.As for Ellen Burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an Oscar and I've seen the atrocity that won Marcia Gay Harden that Oscar for. She is just the picture of sadness the whole film through  a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. The scene where she complains to Harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things I've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.As such I can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. If your favourite film is 'You've Got Mail' steer well clear. If 'Snow Dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. Trust me it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.However if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and selfdestruction then you must watch Requiem For a Dream.".

The characters start off with somewhat mild addictions and then next thing you know the four main characters are living in hell. I couldn't believe how low they all fell. This movie may be the greatest antidrug message of all time. I dare anybody to watch this and to not be touched and frightened by these characters. Before the movie started I noticed the audience was quite loud and garrulous but as it ended and the credits rolled the whole place was stone cold silent. It was amazing.As a whole I felt the movie was excellent. The visuals were well done and the editing was outstanding. The actors really put themselves into their roles. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had very good chemistry while Marlon Wayans showed he is a talented actor and not just a talented comic. Ellen Burstyn. Wow! She was amazing. I can't believe an older woman would allow herself to be filmed like that. She has some serious guts. Hands down the best female performance I've watched this year not even close.  I was totally amazed by her.All in all I would say Requiem For a Dream is a great movie. It had a profound impact on me and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it on opening night. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Requiem For A Dream and I have to say I was blown away. Not since 1995's The Basketball Diaries has a film so accurately portrayed the craving and depravity of a person dealing withor succumbing to addiction. It is a beautifully articulated piece of artwork intricately presented on a silver platter. Director Darren Aronofsky shines in his brilliant direction and style in this depiction of the downward spiral of the lives of four people living with their respective addictions.Jared Leto gives an excellent solid performance as Harry Goldfarb a man living an inch from his life always in search of a fix. In an emotional powerhouse of a performance he proves to audiences that he can shine through in a major role as opposed to previous smaller roles in Fight Club and American Psycho. However it appears to be a Hollywood injoke of sorts in that it seems he has a penchant for mutilation or at least the roles he seems to take on seem to have for him. In Fight Club he had his face rearranged and in American Psycho his head cut off. In Requiem however it is the mutilation of his life his whole character that takes centerstage ending in a satisfying climax of gargantuan proportions in which he gives the audience more than their money's worth in his powerpacked performance.However the real star of the film lies in the talent of Ellen Burstyn. Audiences will wonder at her appearance at the beginning of the film not really knowing if it is in fact her. Her performance as a television sugar and eventually diet pilladdicted mother of Harry shows that she's still got it after all these years. If you want to make a comparison of her thespian skills throughout the years watch the revived version of The Exorcist. She can only get better. She takes on the role of Sarah Goldfarb with gusto never backing down for a second. Totally throwing herself into the role you tend to forget how she really looks like given only fleeting moments in the film which suggest her real appearance. I have to say she's got guts. How many female actresses her age would dare to have a camera strapped to her personas Aronofsky so creatively did an inch away from her face with a wide angle lens? She definately deserves her Oscar nomination if not the Oscar itself for her tourdeforce performance.The other characters themselves hold their own with the two abovementioned powerhouses. Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans both realistically portray their respective roles as Marion Silver Harry's girlfriend and rebellious suburbanite chick who degenerates to prostitution for her fix and Tyrone C. Love Harry's best friend and fellow pusher. Here Wayans shows that he can lose his comic edge if needed to portray a boy trapped in a man's body just yearning for his mother's approval but seeking it instead in drugs. Connelly as well who has been taking on smaller roles and projects over the last few years is finally given enough room to play with her character and gives a winning performance in Requiem.The cinematography of Matthew Libatique gives total light on the chracterizations of the people in habiting Aronofsky's sick world from the sliently flickering sickgreen flourescents to the exaggerated wide angle shots and the beautifully sad and haunting Coney Island picturesque of the pier which suggests a certain beauty amidst all the sadness and depravity. A Downer Picturesque as portrayed by the photographs of Robert Frank and the Frank influenced cinematography of Darius Khondji in Seven. In my books Matthew Libatique has just joined those ranks.Jay Rabinowitz' editing stands out as well with inyourface smash title cardsemphasising the downward crash of the character's lives through the seasons as well as the closeup constructions of the drug taking process. The latter sequences edited so tightly and seamlessly make the moment so beautiful but so fleeting as is the case with drugs. The sequences are almost like a drug making you crave for more of them a fix which you get whenever the characters get their own fix in the film. Lots of people might misinterpret this as glamourising the drug culture but these moments are so fleeting that they're over before you even know it and then it's back to Harry Marion Sarah and Tyrone's sick and depraved search for the next fix which very accurately portrays the twisted quest of a true and sincere addiction.The film is also superbly scored by Clint Mansell and hauntingly performed by the Kronos Quartet. A series of hauntingly shocking yet mindnumbingly beautiful pieces which linger in your head long after you've left the cinema.Lastly the direction of Aronofsky brilliant beautiful empathic. There are not enough words to describe his direction or this film and I think the best way to say it is that I am speechless. Aronofsky has shown me that jaded by so many films something can still prompt me to sit up and take notice. To see something that I have never seen before or learn something I don't already know. The ending is sheer power. A masterpiece of all the elements of what filmmaking is about mixed together in some sick souffle and thrown into your face burning hot and scalding. The film leaves a deep impression in fact a huge scar. And it is a scar I am proud to wear.".

Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone and felt so stunned afterwards I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously this is a brutal one more time  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful  Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it for it's entertainment value and more importantly it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had been looking forward to Aronofsky's followup to his critically acclaimed arthouse film Pi of a few years back and when it did finally open in 1 theatre in Toronto I gathered a bunch of friends to go down and see it.  Some have never even heard of Pi before.  For others this would be their first Independent film experience.  However coming out of the movie we all agreed that it was one of most powerful piece of contemporary cinema that anyone has seen.Requiem for a Dream tells the story of 4 people connected either through blood or some kind of personal relationship whether it be family girlfriend or business partner.  Although the characters lived far from what you and I would consider to be normal lifestyles they shared something in common with each and every member of the audience hopes aspirations dreams.  Sara Goldfarb played so wonderfully by Ellen Burstyn dreams of one day being on a TV show and one day gets her chance.  She fantasizes about how she could wear her favourite red dress that she wore to her sun's graduation on television.  However upon trying to wear the red dress Sara discovers that she has gained some weight over the years and tries desperately to lose her weight eventually resorting to medication.  All of the characters have drugs the bad kind affect their lives which eventually take over their lives.  The movie documents how for each of the 4 people are effected and eroded by drugs.The look of the film is extremely  stylized but justifiably so. Aronofsky uses surreal imagery as a vehicle for realism something that really works when done well and done well it was.  By using a combination of slow and fast motion shots extreme closeups and more edits than you can shake a stick at Aronofsky successfully brings the audience into the world and mind of someone with a drug problem.  The audience visually experiences firsthand what it is like to be 'scared' or 'high'  all this in 3rd person all this in the comfort of the theatre chair.Of course all of this effort would be in vain if it didn't mean anything at the end.  The film leads the audience down a spiral of addiction until the grand finale which features a montage of graphically intense scenes and images with more edits per second than any film.  The pacing at the end when compared to earlier parts of the movie was so fast I started to find it hard to keep up and literally took my breath away as the credits came up.  All in all the effect was amazing and something that I have not personally experienced when watching any film before.As the title indicates Requiem for a Dream does not contain a happy ending.  It is in no way optimistic and only gives the audience faint pieces of hope and happiness.  However It does show what desperate people are willing to do and how desperation will change someone's life to its entirety.  It is in the recognition of desperation where hope lies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was tempted to title this Drugs are bad mm'kay? because Requiem was so sad I was desperate to inject some humor. Man what a sad scary excellent grim disturbing wellmade movie. The more I read about RFAD and learned the more fascinating it seemed. I'm one of those people who upon hearing a movie is extremely shocking has a burning urge to see it as fast as possible to see if it shocks me especially unrated or NC17 since I'm pretty jaded. So I eagerly anticipated seeing it.Unfortunately I read so much about the making of the movie that I knew a little too much about the plot going in so there were few plot surprises. Requiem concerns four addicts. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly play a young loving couple Harry and Marion who dabble in heroin and plan to make a big sale with their friend Tyrone Shawn Wayans so they can be set for life and Marion can start her own business. Their recreational drug use turns into daytoday addiction and things start to get ugly. VERY ugly. Ellen Burstyn plays Harry's mother Sarah a lonely widow who wants to lose weight to fit into a red dress to appear on her favorite TV show. She starts out addicted to TV and candy but has the bad luck to visit a doctor whoin what I thought was the only unrealistic aspectgives her an RX for 'diet pills' that turn out to be speed. I say unrealistic because as anyone who's ever worked in the medical profession knows few doctors will write a new patient a huge prescription for extremely powerful addictive controlled substances without even an exam.I found her story thread the most memorable and heartbreaking. Sarah takes her pills and starts losing weight plus suddenly becoming energetic and chatty. Like any addictive drug her happy blue pills stop working after prolonged use so she ups her dose more...and more...and things slowly start getting very weird and scary. In one of the best scenes midway through Harry visits her the only visit where he doesn't openly steal her TV to pawn for dope. He's briefly riding high in more ways than one and announces he bought her a bigscreen TV he wanted to do something nice for her and figured out that TV is her fix. He looks uneasy when she's babbling happily about how she has a reason to get up in the morning then he hears her grinding her teeth and figures it out ...the first time in the movie you see real fear in his eyes. Sarah soon starts having very scary strungout hallucinationsstarting out with subtle things like time woozily slowing down and speeding back up and when her refrigerator suddenly starts moving on its own the real nightmare begins. An aggressive fridge may sound Monty Pythonesque now but trust me you won't be smiling by the end of the movie.One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. Another reviewer compared the experience of watching the film to a drug and that's not too far off the mark either. Whenever a character gets high there's a slambang fastcut montage of the same images over and over a sigh a pupil dilating cells changing color. The description I probably agree with most came from Aronofsky himself he compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The last few minutes that show the gruesome depressing worstcasescenario fates of all four characters are just as intense hard to watch and nightmarish as I heard they were. I don't think I will ever forget Harry's mother's transformation from a harmless plump friendly older woman to someone so frightening looking that people cringe away in fear and revulsion at the sight of her.My only complaints would be that I wished there was more time for character development. The film is divided into 3 segments Summer things going fine having fun getting high Fall the beginning of the downhill slide and Winter end of the line. I would've liked more scenes of what these people and their lives were like before addiction as well as their relationships with each other. The cast is stellar Wayans shows that he has the most range and talent of the Wayans bros I laughed so hard at him in Don't Be A Menace that I ended up buying it but here ...wow. I would've liked to see more of his character. I never liked Leto much before but he's excellent and also almost unrecognizable he dropped 15 of his weight for the role and oh it shows. Connelly I actively disliked before but I was very impressed and now know she can act. Burstyn gives the performance of a lifetime not only convincing but dedicated enough to let the filmmakers make her look like absolute and total hell few actresses over 55 would probably be as fearless.Not recommended if you're easily shocked squeamish or upset. If you only like movies that take you to a happy place stay away. Everyone who left the movie theater looked like they had just been hit over the head with a very large board and we all who knew what we were getting into. Recommended for those who want to see a movie that will completely overtake you and involve you emotionally. In addition this film should be required viewing for everyone in the fashion industry that supportedglorified that whole 'heroin chic' crap. Also a good movie if you are having some problems in your life and want to put them in perspective VERY fast. 9 out of 10 stars. I'll probably never look at my fridge quite the same again...".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry and Tyrone are drug users who decide to try and make some money by cutting their cocaine and selling it on. This idea works very well and the pair start filling a shoe box with 20 bills  Harry even buys his mother Sara a television to make up for all the times that he used to steal her old one to sell it for cash. Sara has her won good news after years of being an ordinary lonely widow she has the chance to appear on a television show herself and is actively dieting to try and fit into her favourite dress for it. With Harry's girlfriend pregnant but happily high things take a bad turn when rival dealers start a war and dramatically cut the availability and up the price  forcing Harry and Tyrone to do whatever they can to get not only a fix but a supply to sell. Meanwhile Sara's desire to lose weight sees her starting a regime of diet pills morning noon and night.I came to this film with not even the slightest idea of what it was about but only that it was supposed to be 'good'. I was not totally prepared for a story that grabbed me from the start and delivered an intense narrative at breakneck pace with great acting amazingly stylish directing editing and production. While this onslaught will not be to everyone's tastes I defy pretty much anyone not to be astonished by this film although I expect many will find it to be a pretty hard ride. The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control  and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing  and I'm not overdoing that hers is a fearless performance that is totally totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs  an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here  avoiding all the ethnic clichs that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on as the extras on the DVD show. Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David Baker Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well  making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see  certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two while others will look at the reference to Dark City even though Aronofsky or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time this is not a rip off or a fluke this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive  whether it be the different cameras the make up the editing the use of mobile stop motion it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances  in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years.".

The story sees four characters each getting into addiction and having it cause their lives to spiral out of control  and that's pretty much it. However it is not so much the story but the telling because it is the delivery that makes the film as amazing and compelling as it is I don't want to oversell it but all aspects of this film come together perfectly. The writing is realistic and although not containing the speeches that make a cast shine is really well written and never strikes a bum note. The script writes highs and lows of addiction so very well that it is easy to forget that what you see in the film has come from a script and story boards.Of course without the delivery then this would have struggled but it is blessed not only with good actors giving great performances but also average actors giving great performances. Burstyn is amazing  and I'm not overdoing that hers is a fearless performance that is totally totally convincing. Her descent is so tragic and involving that it is a major art of the story instead of the subplot it appeared it would be. Connelly is the next to stick in the mind conveying a total peace and beauty when things are good but a terrible sweaty look of inner agony on her face as she degrades herself for drugs  an amazing performance. Leto is not someone I'm that aware of but he was good here and held his own well beside the two actresses. However the actual surprise of the film came from Wayans I'm so used to hating him in lazy performances that I forgot he can act and he is good here  avoiding all the ethnic clichs that he usually does. McDonald is excellent in his cleverly used segments. It is easy to dismiss his performance as cheesy and easy but he does get it spot on as the extras on the DVD show. Supporting roles for people of the recognisable likes of David Baker Weeks and Naidu only help.Of course the main impact of the film comes from the relentless direction that not only produces a stylish product but also draws the audience into the highs and lows the characters experience as well as the repetitive rituals of their lives. He also handles the hallucinations really well  making them genuinely disturbing when they come have been silly. I cannot describe it very well but the direction really hits the nail on the head with heavy style and different techniques. Of course some may feel that they have seen elements of it before and will say of Aronofsky that he has borrowed much of what we see  certainly the front mounted camera on the characters harks back to Mean Streets and Spike Lee to name two while others will look at the reference to Dark City even though Aronofsky or claim that the hyper direction is Trainspotting X10! However to accuse him of just stealing is lazy and nonsensical because he weaves it altogether for the whole running time this is not a rip off or a fluke this is a talented director spinning style and substance. The score by Mansell and the Kronos Quartet is perfect and is a wonderful compliment to the images increasing their impact and making the film feel fast and exciting at times tragic and moving at other times. These are just two examples but the film is technically impressive  whether it be the different cameras the make up the editing the use of mobile stop motion it is all impressive.Overall this is an amazing film but it is not one that will appeal to all audiences. It is bleak relentless and a hard watch but it is worth it because it grabs you and refuses to let you go until the very end. The film has a simple plot but a great script that is delivered by a collection of great performances  in particular from Burstyn and Connelly. The direction only adds to Aronofsky's reputation and the original score is fantastic. I am rarely left breathless by a film but I was by this one and I honestly cannot believe that this escaped me for so many years.";

	schema:reviewBody "I respect and admire this movie even though and perhaps because it is complex occasionally irritating and often very hard to take.  Frankly I avoided seeing it for a long time but now am glad I did.  To complain that the film fails as a realistic portrayal of addiction is I think to miss the point.  Far from being the mere depiction of a collective downward spiral fueled by drugs the movie is in fact a meditation on loneliness greed corruption desperation and the pervasivenessbanality of media among many other things.The subtleties of the text are communicated first and foremost by superb acting.  The performances of Ellen Burstyn Jared Leto Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are all revelatory.  In particular I was knocked out by Burstyn who is almost comically pathetic in the beginning but who manages by the end to convey her character's utter devastation in the truest most heartbreaking manner imaginable.  The others are absolutely perfect as well I was simply astonished by Leto and especially Wayans may he eschew scary movies forevermore.  Connelly has perhaps the most difficult role in the film with opportunity and motivation galore to go over the top and she delivers not a single false note throughout.My only real quibbles with the movie have to do with certain instances of the splitscreen and jumpcut techniques which struck me as somewhat gimmicky and repetitious respectively.  That being said overall the style of the film is impressive and appropriate.   The cinematography is beautifully conceived and executed and the score is every bit as haunting as the performances thanks largely to the work of the Kronos Quartet.In sum regardless of whether or not the subject matter itself shocks you this movie will put the viewer through the proverbial wringer.  Give it a chance and you will connect with the characters and then witness their destruction spiritual and otherwise.  It is a punishing but unforgettable experience.  I'm not sure whether I'd necessarily recommend it or not it all depends on your personal tolerance level with regard to an unflinching portrayal of human nature and behavior at their most extreme and ultimately tragic.  For my part while I don't expect to watch this film very often in the future I'm sure glad it'll be on the shelf.".

To be more precise RFAD is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain its...well a requiem for the characters who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Bjrk in Dancer in the dark. Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in Pi and some of his ideas like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel without creating a long music video. On the downside you could say that this movie offers no hope no solution  but then this wouldve been a lousy compromise.".

	schema:reviewBody "This will likely be the most modest review you'll read of this film in the first few pages of a sea of 10s. I nonetheless am convinced a 7 is the highest the film deserves. Aronofsky creates a unique film about the horrors of four characters spiraling into a chaotic conclusion due drug addiction. However his reliance on creating an extreme hyperbolic film undermines the movie's appeal. The film seems to be an example of pushing the boundaries simply for the sake of pushing boundaries as no real message. It would be similar to calling a horror movie a 'classic' because the director showed a bloody decapitation after bloody decapitation or a romance movie being considered a 'classic' because it has 12 hour of real sex. Nonsense. The best films are the ones that leave the gory or gruesome details to the imagination yet leave you with an extraordinary impact and a message. I really got no message from the film which is heavily focused on torturing four miserable characters again and again....and again and again. What's the point? The four main actors in the film are phenomenal. Marlon Wayans surprisingly gives a stunning break out performance for someone known for starring trivial and mediocre pop culture comedies. He may have given the best or second best performance of the four. Jennifer Connelly gives a credible performance as a desperate and loyal girlfriend forced to do unthinkable sex acts. The actors strengths are their modesty and ability to succumb themselves to the most demeaning things possible.The music of the film is memorable. The film has one main theme song but it is the most memorable and haunting theme song ever I've ever heard. I downloaded it immediately after the film. The music emphasized the tone of the film.The major weakness of the film despite the great acting are the characters. There's no bones about it the characters are pure idiots. The fact that they're idiots leaves me little ability to sympathize with them and I was trying my hardest. Furthermore despite other reviewers efforts to paint them as tragic heroes the main characters are not heroes in any form. It's even a stretch to suggest that they're good people. For instance Connelly's character initially seduces an older man simply to get money. Leto's character upsets his mother repeatedly by selling her television set. Yes they all do this to subdue their addiction.. but the term hero cannot be thrown around aimlessly. They're simply dubious protagonists. Yeah they try to aim to get out of the drug culture and start prosperous lives. The characters have great chemistry with each other they are somewhat slightly charismatic but they don't do anything remotely generous or pious in the film to warrant praise as tragic heroes. You can watch this film and immediately see the end coming. Part of you naively and helplessly hopes the film takes a sudden right turn into brighter pastures but that is simply not the case. Aronofonsky might tease you in the beginning but he brings you to the most overly dramatic conclusion like a car crashing into a brick wall. Ironically while many critics bashed 'The Passion' for overemphasizing torture and maiming of Christ again and again and again and again over other aspects of Christ and rightly so that film has its flaws as well it surprising these critics praise similar methods of repetitive how can it get any worse torture done to rather shady characters nonstop.I'm not saying this film needed a happy ending to be a good movie. But if it has a tragic ending it should have a message. If it's just don't do drugs than that's a grave disappointment and waste of time for a supposedly deep experimental film.To his credit the director utilizes a neat and impressive artistic style known as hip hop montage. The surreal spinning directing was a doozy but a great asset to the film.This film I guess is worth a watch once. But once is only time I've seen it and I'll never sit through that film all the way through again. Period. I'm pretty confident in saying that most of those 10s people have only seen it once and will make an excuse not to see it again. The only people who will see this film again are overly depressed and eccentric pessimistic types.... A classic has to be more than a overly nihilistic novelty act.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film. This a film addicted to gimmicks. SPLAT! Any questions?The pretentiously titled REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is a film that is dark depressing achingly dreary and laughably awful at every turn. It is like watching a drunk or an addict wallowing in self pity only to have him interrupt his moaning and groaning with fits of uncontrollable laughter. You don't know whether to pity him laugh at him or just smile and slowly back away. Nowhere else will you find a film so selfconsciously solemn and meticulously constructed yet so hysterically out of control.The film is about the evils of addiction so it is ironic that the director is hopelessly addicted to clichs and gimmicks. One thing for certain is that director Darren Aronofsky seems desperate to impress somebody. He's the kid with the thesaurus who can't turn in a book report unless he makes certain that every word is at least 10 letters long. Only now he's a film school kid who just figured out how to use all those cool gadgets on the camera. As such REQUIEM is walltowall cinematic tricks split screens splitsecond editing fisheye images fast forward time lapse and ohso many really niftycrazyweird camera angles. It all goes for that Ohwow! factor. But when every scene is a calculated stunt then no individual stunt has any effect. It's like an opera screeched in only one note or a room where everything is the same shade of blood red. The overall effect is shockingly effective only because it is all so unrelentingly unpleasant.The idea I suppose is to clue us in on how hyper the world must seem in a drug induced haze but that is rendered meaningless since the film goes hyper even during innocuous moments. Indeed what passes for everyday reality is presented as being so melodramatically arty or intensely overwrought that at times Aronofsky has to resort to the overtly ridiculous to even get back our attention. By the time Ellen Burstyn as a diet pilladdicted old lady finds herself being terrorized by her refrigerator the film takes on the air of a particularly grotesque skit from Monty Python. Even worse than Aronofsky's taste for psychedelic overkill apparently inspired in equal parts by bad MTV videos trendy TV commercials and gradeC drug movies of the 60s is the director's selfrighteous arrogance in assuming he has something original to say. Drugs are bad! Gosh who knew? But even the simple nobility of that sentiment is buried under the sludge of his technique. The fates of the four main characters is so extreme and so extremely presented that the film unintentionally trivializes the very lecture it so pompously presents. Their fates  insanity mutilation prison and sexual degradation  are presented not with an air of remorse and pity but as a manic cinematic freak show. This is REEFER MADNESS on LSD scare tactic propaganda served up as if it were from a crazed evangelist. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt but the poor actors are forced to overact just to keep up with the hectic pace of the film's stylistics. Lost between their obviously phony Nu Yook accents and bugeyed emoting there is little room for genuine characterizations. Indeed the fact that any semblance of a performances even survives is remarkable considering Aronofsky's vegamatic editing style. There are poignant moments however fleeting when the actors reveal depth and complexity in their characters but those instances of subtlety are brushed aside as Aronofsky rushes to get back to the grandiose surrealism. Can there be anything more personal than an addiction? Yet Aronofsky has made a film that is frenetic yet cold and mechanical. This is a film by a filmmaker who has no faith in either his message or his audience. Everything is hammered home amplified and repeated because the director doesn't think we will get it if he simply states the obvious. Had Aronofsky just made a simple little horror movie maybe his grossoutcreepoutfreakout stylistics might have been amusing. But he has tackled a serious social issue and reduced drug abuse to the level of being a Freddie Krueger bogeyman. I don't doubt the sincerity of his antidrug rant I just find it hopelessly condescending. It is filmmaking as shock treatment designed to beat the viewer down to the point of vulnerability exhausted and ready for brainwashing.".

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt but the poor actors are forced to overact just to keep up with the hectic pace of the film's stylistics. Lost between their obviously phony Nu Yook accents and bugeyed emoting there is little room for genuine characterizations. Indeed the fact that any semblance of a performances even survives is remarkable considering Aronofsky's vegamatic editing style. There are poignant moments however fleeting when the actors reveal depth and complexity in their characters but those instances of subtlety are brushed aside as Aronofsky rushes to get back to the grandiose surrealism. Can there be anything more personal than an addiction? Yet Aronofsky has made a film that is frenetic yet cold and mechanical. This is a film by a filmmaker who has no faith in either his message or his audience. Everything is hammered home amplified and repeated because the director doesn't think we will get it if he simply states the obvious. Had Aronofsky just made a simple little horror movie maybe his grossoutcreepoutfreakout stylistics might have been amusing. But he has tackled a serious social issue and reduced drug abuse to the level of being a Freddie Krueger bogeyman. I don't doubt the sincerity of his antidrug rant I just find it hopelessly condescending. It is filmmaking as shock treatment designed to beat the viewer down to the point of vulnerability exhausted and ready for brainwashing.";

Requiem for a Dream' Darren Aronofsky's followup to his 1998 cult indie Pi' is basically the closest thing you are going to find to a nightmare on celluloid. It really accomplishes what it sets out to do which is to disturb us with the downward spiral of drug addiction.Does the film go far enough to maybe even scare some people straight? Yes! The story focuses on four Brooklynraised lives Harry played by Jared Leto Marion played by Jennifer Connelly Tyrone played by Marlon Wayans and Sarah played by Ellen Burstyn in one of her top performances.Sarah is a lonely overweight widowed daytime television addict whose only perks in life are her television and an occasional visit from her son Harry even though he's normally there to pawn her tv for drugs. One day she finds out that she has been selected to be on television. Determined to lose weight and fit into her precious red dress again she starts taking three diet pills a day. Before you know it she's popping them down like MMs.Around the same time Harry and his best friend Tyrone are becoming very successful and prolific with their drug dealing on the Coney Island boardwalk. They begin to score pure coke and frequently get high fantasizing their own dreams. Also through shooting up Harry and his girlfriend Marion experience their beautiful love for each other but by Fall business begins to slow down and things take a turn for the worst.The film takes place throughout Summer Fall and eventually Winter. The characters completely fall apart as do their dreams loves and health. The beautiful Ellen Burstyn becomes an emaciated monstrosity with these harrowing nightmares which eventually abolishes her saneness. Harry's inability to score well draws Marion away from him and into giving away her body for drugs. And Tyron's All of this leads to a finale that will send chills up the back of your neck and will refrain you from sleep for at least a week.Everybody in the film puts on the performances of their careers especially Marlon Wayans who shows us that behind the comic idiocy of his Scary Movie' stereotype he is really a great actor. Still even with the three other breathtaking performances Ellen Burstyn steals the screen with her rendition of Sarah Goldfarb which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination and probably should have even earned her the award sorry Julia but it's true. Darren Aronofsky shows us with Requiem' that he could very well be the next Kubrick. To express the feeling of Hubert Selby Jr.'s 1971 novel on which the film is based Aronofsky uses every filmmaking trick that he knows from split screens hyper edits speedy and slow paces and even his famous snorriecam which he made famous with Pi.'Requiem for a Dream' is one film that should be shown in high school classrooms across the country to give kids nightmares about their futures with drug addictions. Instead thanks to the MPAA it has been rated NC17 which restricts the age group of people from seeing it who sincerely need to see it the most.Sure sometimes it can all seem like too much I for one could have lived without seeing the shock therapy scene but it is all necessary to get the film's point across making Requiem for a Dream' more like a nightmare.

I think after seeing the reviews on here my expectations of the movie was way too high. The first 2030 minutes of this movie was incredibly boring I thought that maybe it was just to make us get to know the characters so I gave it some more time. Then after an hour had passed I realized that this wasn't going to get any better. somehow the same feeling the characters have about their own lives in the movie It seems like the moviemakers didn't want to make a movie they wanted to make a masterpiece. It's like the movie is saying hey look at me have u seen anything better?!? Look at these cool cameraangles and these amazing closeups. And I don't only look good I'm deep too. Anyway I don't buy it. Just because you show closeups of an eye and pills thrown into mouths it's not automatically a great movie. I'm not impressed. Anyway I've noticed that with IMDB the newer the movie is the higher ratings it gets. If you want to see a movie about drugadiction watch panic in needle park or the german movie christiane f both those movies are far better than this one and rated lower. I don't hate this movie but I can't for my life understand how so many people can love it. I'm giving this a 1. That might be unfair but it's just as unfair as the 8.5 that it has on here. If I see it again I sure hope I discover something new since it feels like I'm the only one in the world who's not impressed with this. Over 40 voted a 10 for this.".

If you manage to keep your cool under the barrage of imagery thrown at you from frame one you should be able to spot plot holes in this film so large that they'll make Pi's nonsensical ending look like plausible narrative.What bothers me most with these apart from the fact that they make this film essentially pointless is that they are all there simply to justify some supposedly shocking visuals. I can't help it I must provide a list.SPOILER SPACE you shouldn't care but it's the rules     1. Harry goes to a hospital to get his obviously gangrened arm cured. A doctor spots him as a drug addict and calls the police WITHOUT TENDING TO THE ARM FIRST. The weirdest thing about this is that the poor guy is later sent back to the hospital to have his arm cut off. The good part for Harry is that he should become a rich man in no time after suing the doctor the hospital and probably the police.2. A dealer won't sell heroin for money but he will trade it for sex. He could hire all the hookers he wants with the money he'd earn selling the heroin specially considering he's the only provider for the whole city at that time. Still all he wants is to see some lesbian sex live. Apparently this is in the movie only to create tension between the lead and his girlfriend. Well and to show Jennifer Connelly naked.3. A previously healthy old lady is allowed to degenerate mentally to the point of being confined and given electroshocks without receiving any help even though she's been shown previously socializing with many other people. For some reason the only person who realizes she's sick is his son who doesn't care much for her anyway. Not that he does anything about it either. Strangely enough there's a shot of her friends waiting in the asylum looking worried while she receives electrical discharges without anesthetics.4. Even though heroin can be injected practically anywhere the lead will do it always in the same place. Even when the spot becomes a purulent wound he'll still do it the exact same position. Not an inch above not in the other arm not in a leg. Right in the middle of the wound.    END SPOILERS but there are more of these believe meYou know I wouldn't worry about plot holes that much if the filmmakers had set out to create just a series of disgusting images to show them around. The thing is they didn't. They made an attempt to create something vaguely resembling a storyline they even had a shot at a subtext. They simply failed miserably. Let's see this film seems to be about addiction. The points made about addiction in the film area Many people have addictions of different kinds.b Addictions aren't good things.c Disgusting things happen when people let their addictions go out of control.and maybe just maybe...d With addictions at first you'll feel good but then you'll feel bad.So much for depth.But we might also have some character development right? We could neglect story and subtext and still have strong compelling characters.Just we don't.Even the best of the characters we're shown is one dimensional and flat. Everything the characters are or do is put there to be dismantled later which makes it all feel like a cardboard building in a Godzilla movie. It's fake and cheap. Everything. The leads' love story the motherson relationship friendship between Harry and Tyrone and between Sarah and the other women. Nothing feels real because Aronofski only cares about the next cool shot.This film might get you distracted enough the first time you watch it and make you to believe there's some depth behind that nauseous feeling in your stomach. In the end it's just empty imagery planned to create a nauseous feeling in your stomach.If you want imagery go and see the latest summer blockbuster. It might at least be some fun.".

I mean are we going back to The Goldbergs and 1950?The whole film struck me as ersatz artificial  it had this 1950 junkie sensibility of Selby grafted onto this hip hop style that was simply jarring. The screenplay which was cowritten with Selby was so predictable I began amusing the woman I was watching the film with by actually giving her the next line. I was right too often for comfort. The massacre during the dope dealing sequence in the back of the supermarket not only was telegraphed far ahead but was incredibly STUPID. I did not believe the scene for a minute. Is it supposed to be a dream? I ask that as it has NO LOGIC.Perhaps the biggest problem were the two leads  Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. While their acting was quite good they looked like they had deplaned at JFK from Beverly Hills that very morning. Connelly is too good looking for the role she does not look the part of a junkie in contrast Samantha Morton who granted is a better actress looks the part of a junkie in Jesus's Son a woman that looks like Connelly could be a call girl making many thousands of dollars a night which made her descent into hell ridiculous. What is the problem with her character she's just plain stupid?Leto looks like a male model. There used to be an old joke when I was a kid Funny it don't look Jewish. Leto whose character I assume is at least half Jewish looks as pure Irish as Connelly in fact they look enough alike to be brother and sister which I'm sure was intentional but which was downright weird.The ending the denouement of the three main characters' stories was so overthetop that my friend and I began laughing out loud. I will say Burstyn was excellent during the harrowing scene of the force feeding. The look on her face of pain humiliation and resignation was haunting  a great moment in screen acting. Just intercutting two of the stories son and mother would have been enough but the sexual imagery and situation of Connelly's character was so evocative of a throwing everything in but the kitchen sink mentality we just couldn't stop howling. I mean  COME ON! I'm chuckling right now thinking of the scene. It certainly dissipated the power of the son's horror though not that of Burstyn due to the great control she displayed in her acting perhaps Aronfsky should learn the value of SUBTLTY from that part of her performance.I think people were wowed by the directoral pyrotechnics but frankly this film's triumph of form over substance ranks as audience abuse!".

	schema:reviewBody "I vaguely heard a few years ago that the director of PI followed it up by making a film based on a novel featuring drug addicts called REQUIEM FOR A DREAM . It got a couple of good reviews but I couldn't help noticing it took another six years for Darren Aronofsky to make another movie entitled THE FOUNTAIN which was one of the worst pieces of pretentious nonsense I ever watched . Still however the cult of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM grew and grew over the years . It is highly rated amongst the prolific voters on this website and has received almost aggressive praise from some quarters . And yet I had serious doubts to its worth as it was ignored by most award ceremonies and only received a very limited release in cinemas . Certainly I had no real intention of watching it until it appeared on a Sky movie channel . How good was it ? Let me put it like this  72 hours after seeing it I still can't get it out of my mind !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Aronofsky has made an entirely expressionist film . He expresses in visual form what the characters are feeling . This goes all the way back to almost a hundred years ago to a movement in Germany and since then we see influences in productions as diverse as the BBC serial of QUATERMASS 2 to Harvey Keitel's drunken sequence in MEAN STREETS but I can't think of anything where this technique is better suited than here where the mental as well as the physical disintegration of the characters take place . The technique may put off a potential audience but that's the point  the characters are going through a living nightmare that they will never recover fully from and Aronofsky conveys their misery totally The director also brings a subtle in joke of semiotics . In THE GODFATHER before someone is killed the colour orange is prominent . In CHILDREN OF MEN someone is peeling an orange before they're killed . It's a subliminal code used in films but one that is familiar to pretentious film students and movie geeks . When the characters enter a drugs den the audience are shown a close up of an orange being peeled and then all hell breaks loose . Expressionism and semiotics in the same movie ? Not necessarily the work of a genius  nor is it the mark of a genius for noticing this but should still be appreciated One criticism the film has is that it's rabid anti drugs propaganda . Such criticism seems to be missing the point since Sara is addicted to legally prescribed drugs  amphetamine based diet pills and barbiuates . It's not a subtle film but does make subtle points that the amphetamine has almost certainly caused Sara to become schizophrenic . Likewise much of the drug taking and destruction is fuelled entirely by self delusion such as Harry and Marion wanting to open a store funded by the money they made dealing drugs . One criticism that is possibly valid is that there's medical facts that are ignored such as electro convulsive therapy being used on a conscious patient or how limbs are amputated but Aronofsky has rightly ignored these facts in order to make a more shocking film Make no mistake that this is a truly shocking film . Compared to this TRAINSPOTTING is a cartoon for children and no other film has ever portrayed the misery and danger of drugs so potently . Nine years after its limited release the soundtrack by Clint Mansell has become legend and rightly so . However REQUIEM FOR A DREAM itself deserves to become legendary amongst a mainstream audience . It is quite simply a masterwork and a film that whilst I'm in no hurry to see again due to its harrowing content is a film I will never forget".

	schema:headline " An amazing human story  insightfully illustrating how 'wrong' our points of view can be as we take things for granted going about our daily lives assuming we are always right. Truly an eyeopening film";
	schema:reviewBody "I rated Oasis as a MUST SEE. Yes it may be difficult to watch all those cerebral palsy twitching scenes but focusing on the heart of the story you shall appreciate as the story unfolds. It's an intriguing human drama needed to be told  to rouse the malaise and complacency of society. We are so prone to being judgmental of others taking things for granted  we are actually quite full of it ourselves thinking we are 'normal' while others  those who seem to us acting not to the 'norm' we see or feel are labeled as 'queers' or 'misfits'. We can be so callous and literally 'blind'  not taking the time to pause step back and see beyond the faces or empathize the possible feelings or needs liken to ourselves. Korean writerdirector Lee Changdong's insightful film Oasis 2002 sensitively and sensibly gave us a chance to see the true state of being and what's possible between two persons that are socially shunned and dismissed as 'nonentity' to the everyday world we live in. Yet to Sol Kyunggu's Jongdu the General and Moon Sori's Gongju the Princess Your Highness they created a world that they mutually shared  alone and together unbeknownst to the community outside of their energized circle. The two of them are selfsufficient contented within appreciating every minute of being alive gently nurturing and genuinely enjoying each other's company. The two main actors delivered poignant performances of their characters. The writing by director Lee essentially facilitated the core drama. Actress Moon's portrayal of her character is astounding  brings to mind Daniel DayLewis' gutwrenching performance in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot 1989. Director Lee cleverly introduced segments where we see Moon's Gongju standing up dancing around singing and smiling in a nonspastic state. Such imagination is at once endearing and poetic allowing us relief and pauses to entertain such thoughts along with her. Sol is just as amazing  beguilingly effortless in his portrayal of a simpleminded man childlike if you will yet entangled complexity reveals as family 'secrets' are picked up through the translations thanks to subtitles by Tony Rayns  certainly provided clues to verbal interactions and plot progression. One wonders if Jongdu's three prior charges were somehow family 'endowed' conveniently using him since he doesn't care much one way or the other. Simpleminded he may be uncomplicated by guilt he is basically a kindhearted and caring person. Subtle and simplistic it takes talent and restraint to deliver this character and Sol brilliantly complements Moon's Gongju. An unnerving powerful pairing. There are sprinkled humor and we would smile and be just as delighted as the two of them. We get to see more clearly than the other people in the story family members neighbors restaurant ownerscustomers policemendetectives. We feel the frustration when Gongju tried to express her side of the story  conveniently dismissed as part of her twitching agony. We worry for Jongdu when he doesn't speak up  then again who in the society's mind would believe a 'misfit'. We felt the helplessness  yet Lee ingeniously provided a logical and satisfying plot turn even if it takes yielding to imagination  but why ever not it could very well be providential. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from the two lovebirds they are simple and content with themselves without 'guilt' complex gutsy and confident in their own way of communicating to each other with exclusive personal word references and clarity of purpose in the deeds they do be it turning up the radio or being high up on a tree. They are happy in spite of what happens  knowing each would continue on with bright hopes and tender loving for each other in their hearts. This is a worthwhile film embracing humanity. Life's too short to expend energy on being angry at others. It's human to make mistakes. If we gripe less and focus on the positive reciprocate respect and kindness to each other take the time to appreciate this world we live in  'oases' we'd be in.".

	schema:headline " What love truly means";
	schema:reviewBody "We talk a lot about love in our society but often love is only acceptable to us if it fits our pictures. For example the love of an older person for a younger love between members of the same sex or between disabled individuals may make us uncomfortable and rejecting. Winner of five awards at the 2002 Venice Film Festival Oasis a film by Lee Changdong stretches our comfort zone to the limit with a boldly unconventional portrait of the love of a mentally retarded young man for a woman suffering with cerebral palsy. The film is both emotionally honest and powerfully realized and will keep you pondering its implications for a long time. Moon Sori's performance as Gongju is nothing short of astonishing. She goes through contortions to make us aware of the agony of her illness but is never inappropriate or overthetop. Her movements are spasmodic and uncoordinated and she appears to be in constant pain but there is a kindness in her face that allows us to see the person behind the pain.As the film opens Jongdu Sol Kyunggu has just been released from prison and is freezing in his short sleeve shirt in the middle of winter. Jongdu is a sociopath who flaunts society's rules unaware of or unconcerned with the consequences of his actions. Unable to hold a job and always on the edge he has been in jail three times for attempted rape causing an accident while drunk he took the rap for his elder brother and armed robbery. On the spur of the moment he decides to visit the family of the man killed by his brother and apologize. When he arrives he finds a husband and wife moving out of their apartment leaving the husband's seriously disabled sister Han Gongju Moon Sori for the neighbors to look after.Jongdu is attracted to the disabled woman who seems barely in control of her own body. He returns for another visit but it sadly ends up in a disturbing sequence that is very difficult to watch. Surprisingly Gongju invites him back once more and the two slowly begin a friendship based on their mutual feelings of isolation. He provides her with the closeness she desperately needs and she finds someone to care for maybe for the first time in her life. As their relationship becomes known both families are scandalized and aided by the prejudices of society transform the innocence of their love into something sick and twisted. Oasis is a thought provoking film that does not stack the deck towards one point of view. It depicts the joy that the relationship brings to the lovers but also shows the understandable unease of the families about the fitness of a man who has demonstrated his emotional instability. The film shows the thin line between the desires of the individual and the needs of society and forces us to look at the disparity between the reality we see and that seen by others. While his ultimate message may be ambiguous Lee makes us brutally aware that for many people life is a party to which they haven't been invited. Out of a willingness to have his characters confront the truth of a world that will be forever hostile he offers a compelling vision of what love truly means and allows us to experience the oneness that defies reason and logic.".

	onyx:emotionText "We talk a lot about love in our society but often love is only acceptable to us if it fits our pictures. For example the love of an older person for a younger love between members of the same sex or between disabled individuals may make us uncomfortable and rejecting. Winner of five awards at the 2002 Venice Film Festival Oasis a film by Lee Changdong stretches our comfort zone to the limit with a boldly unconventional portrait of the love of a mentally retarded young man for a woman suffering with cerebral palsy. The film is both emotionally honest and powerfully realized and will keep you pondering its implications for a long time. Moon Sori's performance as Gongju is nothing short of astonishing. She goes through contortions to make us aware of the agony of her illness but is never inappropriate or overthetop. Her movements are spasmodic and uncoordinated and she appears to be in constant pain but there is a kindness in her face that allows us to see the person behind the pain.As the film opens Jongdu Sol Kyunggu has just been released from prison and is freezing in his short sleeve shirt in the middle of winter. Jongdu is a sociopath who flaunts society's rules unaware of or unconcerned with the consequences of his actions. Unable to hold a job and always on the edge he has been in jail three times for attempted rape causing an accident while drunk he took the rap for his elder brother and armed robbery.

All of them I answered to make a point Korean's movies were just unbeatable in 2002. Then I confessed that I was actually a journalist not a buyer. The young man surprised me with another question Did you cry at the end of 'The Way Home'?  No I said thinking of my grandmother actually I cried at the end of OASIS.Movies should move viewers. No hight tech genre film can beat what goes straight to your heart. The love of a naive warmhearted fool Sol Kyunggu as Jongdu to a spasmic beauty Moon Sori as Gongju that is unable to walk and clearly articulate herself is attacked by both of their families. It could be considered a love between handicapped and thus underline the demand for a change of law which seems to have its flaws in Korea as well as here in Germany. Prohibited is the unthinkable i.e. the sexual demands of those who are stigmatised to not have them. The sad outcome of the events is lightened by the unchangeable affection of the male protagonist. Feminists might argue against the easy way in which the attempt to rape the spasmic woman turns into mutual love. The real challenge for the excellent actress Moon Sori was indeed to transmit whether we see joy or pain in her wincing mimic. Have you ever asked yourself how a person suffering from cerebral palsy would look during orgasm? See for yourself. The elegant camera moves from the common theme of the movie to dreamlike scenes where all of Gongjus illness is gone. Her dancing with a young elephant had the same nonintellectual humor as the treecutting of Jongdu. When the lights go on in your theatre you might ask yourself how deeply YOU are able to love.".

That they establish a relationship comes as much because of their handicaps as in spite of them.I knew before seeing the film that Moon Sori was an ablebodied actress. As a result at first I wasn't convinced she was playing someone with cerebral palsy.  But Lee Changdong does a brilliant thing.  He films several scenes that become the imaginings and fantasies of Gongju Moon's character as an ablebodied woman.  This had the effect on me of seeing Gongju as disabled.  And it spells out clearly that cerebral palsy is a physical condition not a mental one.Sol Kyunggu as Jongdu is perfect.  I've been describing Jongdu as simpleminded to others but that doesn't pinpoint his mental condition.  I might say he is carefree but it's not just an attitude he is carefree to the point of mental illness.  His condition makes him act both bad he's been in prison three times and good he absolutely sees right through Gongju's handicap and truly comes to care for her.  While Gongju is frustrated over her condition and how others use her it Jongdu appears so utterly accepting of his fate that he doesn't even defend himself.  I can't stop thinking about how Mr. Sol has played this interesting character.Both Gongju's and Jongdu's families scorn and pity their conditions.  But watch how they also come to exploit them as well.I highly recommend this film.".

She manages to show every possible emotion within the confines of c.p. spasms and she brings the character to life with a fully developed range of emotions and intellect.Sol Kyunggu's body language is just as effective though his performance is easily overshadowed by Moon Sori's.

	schema:reviewBody "The director had been known in Korea as a novelist before he started to make films. That must be the reason why his films give us always the impression that they are deeply literary much more than cinematic.Oasis is a very literary film like his other films but it also gives us the specific pleasure to watch movies by the imaginary scenes dreamed by a handicapped woman named Gongju for instance. These scenes are sentimental but they are incredibly beautiful and delicate these pigeons and butterflies flying in her room for example. And the scene where Gongju sings a song to another protagonist Jongdu must be one of the most beautiful scenes of confession of love ever depicted by a film. That is the moment I am sure when this film takes suddenly on the features of something sacred.The director says this is a film about border as well as communication. And in order to show the difficulty of communication andor of going across the border he tried to make Jongdu an abominable and disgusting person especially at the beginning of the film. If you feel uncomfortable when you start to watch this film you should consider that such discomfort was intentional even though the behaviors by Jongdu seem to be extremely violent and selfish. And you should also be patient until the miraculous moment of the mutation from vulgarity to holiness comes. You will certainly forget about the discomfort you had felt.And this is naturally a film about Love. It shows us just one of the forms of love should I probably say since the one shown in this film is too special and peculiar but still I am tempted to say This is the Love.I though of The Legend of St. Julian Hospitator by Gustave Flaubert but I do not know if I should expect that the protagonists would be called under the name of the saints or so. And I also remembered the heroine Sarah of The End of the Affair by Graham Greene. Sarah writes in her diary thinking of her lover named Maurice with whom she had decided not to meet again because of the promise with God I'm not at peace any more. I just want him like I used to in the old days. I want to be eating sandwiches with him. I want to be drinking with him in a bar. I'm tired and I don't want any more pain. I want Maurice. I want ordinary corrupt human love.Once swore to God to separate from his lover Sarah wants him always being full of desires and wanting corrupt human love even just before her death. She stayed secular and even vulgar until the end even though the author must have wished to lead her to the path toward God. And that is just why Sarah that miserable mortal stays always in my mind.Same thing for Gongju and Jongdu. Their happiness may exist in this real world full of prejudice and discrimination where ugly desire or ordinary cheapness of human life smears them. But it may also give them pleasure to love to help each other andor to share something precious between them. They do not need God but they just need each other.Nobody knows whether or not the future will congratulate them in the end but probably as did the director should I leave them in the room of Gongju where many dusts floating in the air are shimmering with the sunlight and Gongju seems to be smiling reading the letter from Jongdu. We don't know if they will be able to finish their story but anyway they have started it. Everything is now up to them.1010.".

When Movie begins you would never think you would feel sorry for the main character but because of the great performance by Kyonggu Sol and equally so by Sori Moon You really care about these two people. I do not cry to often during a movie but this brought tears to my eyes. This story of two people one mentally disabled and the other physically is a pure gem. You feel for these two people and want them to get together.I will not tell the ending but it definitely bittersweet. I wish American movies can be made like this. I don't think American filmmakers are brave enough to do this".

When Movie begins you would never think you would feel sorry for the main character but because of the great performance by Kyonggu Sol and equally so by Sori Moon You really care about these two people. I do not cry to often during a movie but this brought tears to my eyes. This story of two people one mentally disabled and the other physically is a pure gem. You feel for these two people and want them to get together.I will not tell the ending but it definitely bittersweet. I wish American movies can be made like this. I don't think American filmmakers are brave enough to do this";

Yes it is about a physically challenged person. Yes it is about prejudice and sexual violence. This might not be a movie that many Korean movie Last Presents or Love letter... lovers like. This movie is not sweet but very bitter. The people around the two protagonists seems terribly selfish. But most of us are on that side not the two outsided protagonists. Watching them treated badly by the world full of prejudice which we might commit in real lifeis really painful.

I loved how the film allowed us to get to know him gradually. At the beginning of the film I identified more with the folks on the street whom he embarrassed but by the end of the film it was clear he was a hero.Sori Moon's character I thought was very convincingly played as a person with cerebral palsy. She portrayed the intelligence and full range of the character's emotions with striking authenticity. I found myself moving from a point of seeing her as a victim to seeing her as the full person that was her character. In fact this was one of those rare films when not once did I think These are actors acting. The direction was outstanding. I loved the scenes showing her fantasies as an ablebodied woman. It was a very effective way to help an ablebodied audience identify with her character and come to understand and empathize with the isolation belittlement and objectification that differentlyabled people are often subjected to. I especially liked the playful scene on the bus. But my favorite scene of all was the last one showing her in her apartment now well lit clean with green growing things with his voice over. Even though the film did not have the expected and wishedfor happy ending the ending was a happy one.".

JongDoo is a three time exprisoner and GongJu is cebral palsy.  Sol Kyoung Gu and Moon So Ri give such brilliant performances that at first I was annoyed by JongDoo and felt uncomfortable watching GongJu's twisted body.  The scenes that GongJu sometimes turns into normal and sings and plays coquetish show her wish very well. And the scene that JongDoo cuts off the branch which GongJu scares is so powerful and emotional.    Some audience say the last scene is passimistic but I see that someday their love will blossom.

That's what it was largely about for me too.I'm thinking mainly of the scene where Jongdu and Gongju are both at the police station. When Gongju is being asked for her account of the incident her sister keeps speaking for her. The policeman doesn't give Gongju time to speak for herself. One of the most difficult scenes for me is when Gongju repeatedly bashes herself against the cabinet to try to get somebody to listen to her. Similarly her brother when trying to reach a settlement with Jongdu's family speaks for Gongju. When talking about how traumatised Gongju has been he says 'Just look at her'. As if she could never enjoy physical love.This brings me to the second theme of the movie as far as I am concerned. The world is set up for people with a certain range of abilities. Which means that people who fall within this range can exploit people who fall outside of them. Which is exactly how Gongju and Jongdu are treated by their families.Jongdu is the fall guy for his brother who has a family and a career and can't 'afford' to do time. To add insult to injury Jongdu gets out of jail to find that his brother has moved without leaving a forwarding address! Gongju's family similarly exploits her. Jongdu and Gongju are fairly forgiving of their families' despicable behaviour.My final comment on this film is that Gongju and Jongdu know their place in the world. They know not to even bother trying to convey the truth. In fact I get a fleeting disturbing feeling that their families are the only people whose behaviour towards them is a true and honest symptom of how the world really works.".

The extent to which the filmmakers writerdirector and actors alike remain true to the characters they are portraying is amazing never reducing them to either grotesque caricature nor helpless objects worthy only of our pity and easy manipulative tears. Instead the film takes a truly unflinching yet nuanced look at mental and physical disability. When you consider that the subject of disability in cinema usually results in sterile vapid films like Forrest Gump and The Other Sister Oasis is practically a miracle. At times I admit it is hard to watch but it is honest and never at all meanspirited. Ultimately the effect is messy transcendent truthfulness rather than shock or unpleasantness.

	schema:reviewBody "When I bought this movie on Amazon I hadn't heard about it before. I just saw the rating people had given it and being a sucker for Asian movies I decided to give Oasis a go.And wow I am so glad that I bought this movie. Oasis is without a doubt one of the most moving heartfelt and touching movies I have ever seen. You might actually just want to prepare a box of tissued before sitting down to watch this movie though.The story is about Jongdu Hong who has been released from prison and you figure out immediately that there is something not fully right with this man. And he befriends Gongju Han who is suffering from cerebral palsy. Their friendship is one without limitations and restrictions as imposed by what we need normal society. It is a friendship regardless of physical and mental state. The friendship turns to love and it is so beautiful. I especially loved the scenes where Gongju Han daydreamed about being able to do stuff that we normally functioning people take for granted.Oasis is driven by a very emotional and compelling storyline and it is especially helped along by the amazing performances by the two lead people Kyunggu Sol playing Jongdu Hong and Sori Moon playing Gongju Han. They both put on really good performances and they really carried the entire movie all by themselves.I am also in awe at the boldness of the director Changdong Lee to have the courage and the genius to have put together this story and actually made a story with this topic. It is not something you'd seen in every movie and it really was right on the money. The director hit the nail right on the head here driving the story right into the hearts and souls of the viewers because this movie is so much more than beautiful. It also leaves you with something to think about after the movie has ended and it imparts you with something to take with you as part of your personal growth and experience.I can't recommend this movie enough. If you are a fan of movies and enjoy movies that offer more than just glamorous 3D effects and nonstop action then you should treat yourself to Oasis because it is a movie that will stay with you in your heart and mind for a long long time.This movie really makes you take a step back and see the world from a whole new perspective because you are thrown right into the predicaments of Jongdu Hong and Gongju Han. And you get to see how they are treated by the world around them the world that we deem as normal. Just because you have a disability doesn't mean you are not normal and whom are we to say who is or isn't normal. Everyone is unique and this movie really celebrates love and acceptance for whom and what we are.Thumbs up way way up for Oasis. This movie went straight to my top 10 best movies of all times list.".

Obviously the producers screen writers actors and director are all doing their best to generate a positive response.But it is a tribute to the integrity of the story that a yes vote doesn't come easily. Jongdu is an excon with three convictions on his record. After being paroled for vehicular manslaughter he unaccountably decides to pay his respects to the family of his victim. There he meets Gongju a young woman stricken with cerebral palsy. He gives her flowers but a followup visit ends disastrously in an attempted rape that is interrupted only when Gongju faints from horror.During this visit Jongdu gave Gongju his phone number in an attempt to put her at ease and Gongju eventually decides to call him. Against all expectations they find they have a lot in common and a romance blossoms.Against this unpromising backdrop Oasis has a long uphill climb to win the audience's sympathy. It's not an easy transition. The revelation that Jongdu is innocent of manslaughter and confessed only in order to save his older brother helps. The inexcusable neglect and mistreatment of both Jongdu and Gongju by their families helps even more. These are two people that deserve better treatment than they are getting from their closest relatives.Oasis benefits from outstanding performances by both its stars great directing and a riveting screenplay. In a lot of ways it's not an easy movie to watch but I was mesmerized by the characters coming to life before my eyes and forming a relationship that for a time provided a refuge from their bleak existence just as an oasis in a desert provides relief from an otherwise barren landscape.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like My Sassy Girl this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet but that's where the similarities end. The story is generally about this rebellious guy named JiHoon Kwon Sang Woo who is still trying to finish high school whose parents hire a tutor named SuWan Kim Ha Neul a woman who comes from a poor background but happens to be the same age as him. Add to that some obstacles martial arts thugs are always after JiHoon for revenge a scorned thuggish lovesick girl who is after him his proclivity for ditching the lessons and you generally can guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fight scenes great visual humor and a lot of spunk thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo that bring a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of that reason. And I must say I'd want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from My Sassy Girl personalitywise at least. She has some spunk but it's more on the cute sweet goodhearted way. Characters are already mostly likable so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than My Sassy Girlan obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. The story kind of sags though about 23 of the way where it sort of treads on familiar standard fare where nothing really interesting happens but near the end it picks up a bit again. Overall a fun cute movie. 810".

Add to that some obstacles martial arts thugs are always after JiHoon for revenge a scorned thuggish lovesick girl who is after him his proclivity for ditching the lessons and you generally can guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fight scenes great visual humor and a lot of spunk thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo that bring a lot of energy to the story. The romantic elements also work because of that reason. And I must say I'd want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from My Sassy Girl personalitywise at least. She has some spunk but it's more on the cute sweet goodhearted way. Characters are already mostly likable so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than My Sassy Girlan obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way. The story kind of sags though about 23 of the way where it sort of treads on familiar standard fare where nothing really interesting happens but near the end it picks up a bit again. Overall a fun cute movie. 810";

The story is easy about a rich boy who got a tutor to teach him because he is still in high school even he is 21 years old. Then you will know whats next.Just one thing impressed me its ending.

Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent weak girl in the Korean soapopaeras.  But this time she plays a cute tomboy very well.  Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very believable.What I like the most about this film is the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated.

	schema:reviewBody "I first came across 'My Tutor Friend' accidentally one or two years ago while TV surfing. Prior to that I'd never watched any Korean films before in my whole life so MTF was really the first Korean film I've ever watched. And what a delightful surprise! I was thoroughly amused from the beginning to end and had a great time laughing. Its comic style is quite different from those of the Hong Kong comic films which I've been to used to all my life and hence tired of as well breathing fresh air into my humdrum film viewing experience. I thought there're quite a few scenes and tricks in MTF that are pretty hilarious witty and original too.I watched MTF the second time a few days ago and having watched it once already the surprisecomic effect on me kind of mitigated. That has however by no means affected negatively my opinion of the film. Instead something else came through this time it moved me the story about how two young seemingly 'enemies' who're utterly incompatible get thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without realizing the feelings themselves reminds me of the long gone high school days. To me Su Wan and Ji Hoon ARE actually compatible as they both have something that is pure and genuine inside them a quality that separates them from people like say Ji Hoon's sassy girlfriend.The film is divided into two distinct parts the 1st part deals with the 'fight' between Su Wan and Ji Hoon and is more violent and faster in pace. After Ji Hoon gets a pass in his final examination and Su Wan dances the in Ji Hoon's opinion provocative dance things start to change. The pace slows down and... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes he cares for Su Wan more than he could ever imagine. So the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings leading of course to a happy ending accompanied by a final showdown with the gang boss.Just one last comment. I find this to be a bit unbelievable the fact that a 21yearold selfproclaimed 'bad boy' would feel embarrassed being almost naked in front of the girl he bullies and loses his 'cool' is just a little... odd. I guess that shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy pure at heart and isn't really what his appearance seems. Btw Kwong San Woo Ji Hoon DOES have a sexy body and perfect figure!  MTF is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite films of all time.".

Later while tutoring the girl's way of contributing to the family income she said something embarrassing and a parade of animated chickens marched above her head each laying an egg. I guess you got the hang of it.There are a few things that go against this movie. First there is little plot and no story. Not that anything elaborated is needed for this genre but MTF is more like a series of disjointed sketches. Second the character of the male lead is unattractive. Kwon Sangwoo who had made an impression in Volcano High suffers here because of the lame script. Yes he is cool in both. In Volcano High the image worked well because his role was onedimensional an ambitious ruthless contender who wanted to be at the top. In MTF however in the role of a superrich overaged delinquent high school student who sometime seems to find a heart this coolness is embarrassingly misplaced. Finally I think a lot must have been lost in the translation literally speaking. I suspect theres probably plenty of Korean colloquial and pun that are simply lost. In general the Chinese subtitles look like something fished right out of a garbage dump. The English subtitles make much more sense but didn't tickle any funny bones.On the other side of the balance sheet there are good things about this movie. Kim HaNeul is one. I understand that this actress has so far been nothing but sweet and demure in Korean movies and TV series. In MTF just the extent she would go to make herself funny deserves applause. And it wasn't such a bad job either. While Kwon Sangwoo does not make much of an impression in his delivery of drama he certainly exceeds passing grade as a fighting star. Compared to Volcano High which offers choreographed fighting MTF has more solid fighting scenes and there are quite a few of those. Finally the cutest star in the movie in my view is the guy playing Kwon Sangwoos father. I am not being sarcastic. He is really a joy to watch.".

Enter Kangpae a vicious gangster who loves movies. After an awkward runin at a club with both their entourages in tow Soota gets the bright idea to cast him as the other actor. He agrees and everyone is so desperate to shoot they go along with it. The only problem is that Kangpae fights for real. That means Soota needs to get tough quick if he's to win the final fight hes scripted to win  but now he has to do it for real!

	schema:reviewBody "Movie Rough Cut 18Rating 4.55After watching So Jisub's impressive action thriller A COMPANY MAN I decided to watch more of his action films and while browsing I came across this. The synopsis seemed extremely different and this is what made me watch this film. After watching it I can say it's a unique masterpiece from South Korea. ROUGH CUT is a highly entertaining movie thanks to its highly impressive action sequences new story and the lead actors So Jisub and Kang Jihwan.

There are certain scenes which are highly commendable. I was seriously impressed with the film's storyline I have never heard a story or seen a film like this before. Without adding much I would just say that ROUGH CUT is an effective and highly impressive action film which you'll love for its originality and uniqueness apart from everything else it has.".

The synopsis seemed extremely different and this is what made me watch this film. After watching it I can say it's a unique masterpiece from South Korea. ROUGH CUT is a highly entertaining movie thanks to its highly impressive action sequences new story and the lead actors So Jisub and Kang Jihwan. They hold the film together very well and deliver enough of entertainment to make you remain hooked to it completely. Even emotionally the film manages to engage you.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the hot ticket films at this years New York Asian Film Festival concerns a hot actor who no one will work with because he tends to actually beat up his costars in the fight scenes. While partying one night he meets a gangster who once was an actor and who roughs up him up when a request for an autograph turns insulting. Everyone goes back to their own lives until the actor once more beats up his costar and they need to find a replacement. The actor thinks of the gangster and before you know it the pair have agreed to really go at it in the fight scenes. From there the film spins out as the actor tries to handle his personal life women blackmail and the gangster tries to get his boss out of prison and stay alive while romancing the leading lady.Well acted especially by Ji Seob So as the gangster Kangpae who manages to say so much without really doing anything.Its the sort of performance that will make him big in America if the film gets a big release. As for the restall I can say its an odd film. Despite being billed as one this is a film that isn't really an action film. Sure the film has action both the movie fights but also explosive violence from the gangsters doing their normal line of workthe sound of violence can be a sickening thing but mostly this is a rambling tale of a couple of lost souls trying to find themselves. In someways I'm not sure what I make of it. Other than the plot thread of the making of the film this film rambles around with in the lives of its characters in a directed but not particularly charted way. Its good but at the same time its a bit too rambling since bits don't completely connect the way they should. Don't get me wrong I like the film the final fight between the costars is bound to become iconic and Ji Seob So is absolutely amazing in I have little doubt he will become a new level of screen cool but the film never manages to reach the great level. Its good often very good just not great despite its attempts.Somewhere around 7 out of 10 I'm not sure why some people have been angling this as the next great film from Korea.".

The three principle actors are superb but Mia Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart as she emerges from her innocence into her latent self  a mesmerizing performance. This movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical and open to endless interpretation along with a subversive wit.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of ChanWook Park's Korean films particular his gross twist on a vampire story in 2009's Thirst I was incredibly excited to see his first English language offering. Stoker the first film made stateside by CWP defiantly doesn't disappoint. This is largely due to the director staying with what he knows telling a story that has all the dark hallmarks from his Korean works. However Stoker is also less extreme then one would expect from ChanWook Park as many moments of violence and depravity that could have been much more over the top are toned down. Stoker focuses on the titular family of India Evelyn and Richard Stoker Mia Wasikowska Nicole Kidman and Dermot Mulroney. When Richard dies in a mysterious car crash his oddball daughter India begins to further distance herself from her estranged mother Evelyn. After burying their patriarch the family is visited by India's Uncle Charlie. Charlie seems a little out there and begins to form a sketchy relationship with India that suggests Uncle Charlie may desire more than family bonding. To elaborate any more would spoil the film but needless to say it's an interesting premise. The story unfolds very slowly with few dramatic developments until the second half of the film which contains much more wizzbang than the somber and meticulously paced beginning. This isn't a bad thing largely because the characters are so fascinating from the getgo that accompanying them while they go about their day to day lives is a pleasure. Even when the movie seems to be resting on its laurels early on the performances are great all around in particular Wasikowska's performance as distant and onedge India. Except for a few odd holes the script stays strong throughout providing plenty of great dialogue courtesy of Wentworth Miller you read that rightthe dude from Resident Evil Afterlife. Who saw that coming?. Of course the strongest link in the chain is Chanwook Park. From the opening scene of fragmented shots with computer generated transitions that occur throughout the movie his mark is clearly laid on the film. Stoker never has an ugly moment and each shot oozes with that distinctive Chanwook flair. My personal favorite is an early scene in a basement involving a swinging light fixture think Once upon a time in the West. The only thing that feels absent compared to CWP's other efforts is a slew of neaseaindusing scenes whose only purpose is to shock the audience. Although Stoker has a few jarring moments think showers for the most part its very restrained compared to Chanwook's other works. This is fine up until the last act when the nature of the story demanded for a more powerful and shocking denouement then what was given. So despite not quite sticking the landing Stoker is effectively creepy well acted and an enjoyable beginning to what I hope will be a long English language career for Chanwook Park.".

In order to accurately review this film it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.Sometimes a movie tries to do a little too much and Stoker is a great example of such a film. I feel as if I am one of the few who while watching this movie wasn't very impressed by anything it tries to do. It's a story about a girl who grows up shying away from society and all it's norms and begins to become inspired more or less by her charismatic yet outwardly creepy uncle who shows up to comfort her mother after a tragic car accident takes her husbands life who also happens to be said uncle's brother. He in turn is infatuated with her.The obvious things about this film that should be creepy are as eerie as can be without gore and disturbing imagery but what keeps this from being a good watch is more due to the ever widening gap between blockbusters and indie films. These middle of the road films that try to look big budget with modest financing all to often grant themselves a campy and dated vibe almost having a made for TV type gloss to their finished product and when this movie in particular chooses to be stylized from time to time it often ends up looking amateur and even clich. The flow of these stylized moments also lack good pacing as they occur either in quick succession or disappears all together for extended periods only to start showing up in troves again at a later time. It's far more distracting than it could ever been seen as a means to accentuate the film and it makes things feel less serious and organic.It's other weakness is in it's decision to favor the less than plausible over sensibility and logic. One would assume for entertainment reasons yet it's a mystery to me how any entertainment could be found most of the time during this film. Mia's character gives a good hour run just buying into this mans insanity only to pull a complete 180 in the last fifteen minutes. It's also beyond hard to believe that no one single authoritative figure could pieces together how suspicious it is that her father just happens to die the exact same day that he picks up this mentally ill uncle from an institution he was committed to for something very similar in nature when he was growing up. Don't people have to sign release forms and stuff at those places? It's almost as if is movie was written without a clear intent or a consistent motive planned throughout and in the end a jumbled up puzzle of confusion and creepiness prevailed without any solid message. It's clear why everyone's the way they are yet their resolves their choices and even their actions throughout the film feel forced from an illogical world of ridiculousness as if the only reality that exists is within the perimeters of their house a highway and a restaurant type place. When Nicole Kidman who plays Mia's mother begins to piece everything together why would she call the uncle she suspects of foul play into the bedroom upstairs of all places? Again in terms of logic it couldn't feel more like a sandbox film.Maybe if this film was deliberately shot low budget as a showcase of a friendship between the uncle and niece that budded into a unique understanding of one another through not accepting society and people it would've been a much more interesting movie or even more so as a period piece during the 1800s or something. But instead it's a messy blend of style and eerie atmosphere that lacks proper pacing and feels very haphazardly put together. It tries to empathize with it's leads and give reason for their madness but instead it comes off as relentlessly grim and faithless all too often as it doesn't give much of a chance to things like hope or even common sense as plausible tools to pull a character through a situation. It paints a picture of the introverted and angstridden individual as a kind of 'different' that automatically rejects all basic human reactions to norms and situations like no one trait could exist without all the rest of an assumed identity or label to be present inevitably leading to the worst. Case and point Biggest Spoiler Mia's character ultimately becomes her uncle in the end by taking his life and begins her pursuit of freedom by following in his footsteps which is all the more evident that he understands this by smiling at her before she offs him. This could've been a unique and creative film moment even if disturbing but instead the film's aforementioned grim and faithless interpretation of introverts makes this an eye roller rather than an Oh My God! moment. Fortunately you will find some moments of resolve if you stick this one out till the end where you may go yes! thank you! but those moments are short lived as it's clear they only exist as a way make sure in the end that more people enjoyed their experience watching this than hated it. Color me jaded I did't buy most of Stoker.Anyways just to clarify the subject matter and the story on a whole had potential to tell decently disturbing tale and the ideas on display where not the worst nor where they the ultimate problem. It's depth just suffers serious sense and direction and it's surface seems like it would've been much more suited for a gritty horror film or even a lower budgeted blatant indie type art thriller more so than this unfortunate throwback madeforTVmeetsstraighttoDVD fare it tries to pass off as something much more grandiose in the end.".

	schema:headline " 'Stoker' is a rare case of an Asian Director's first English language film not being a let down";
	schema:reviewBody "What typically happens when a prestigious Asian Director makes the transition to their first English language film is that the resulting feature is a stylistically watered down less edgy affair and the worst film of their career. Presumably Hollywood studios interfere so much they end up robbing them of what people loved in the first place. I can firmly say with utter relief that this is not the case with Chan wook Park's 'Stoker'.Stylish artistic beautiful controversial and feeling much more like a movie from his native South Korea Chanwook Park is bang on form. All that's changed is the actors are American and speak in the English language and the location of course. I sincerely hope Hollywood takes note that this is how to do it right! Don't interfere with the artist and corrupt and americanise their vision. However I have heard there was a 20 minute enforced cut made to the film by an editor for the studio. Here's what the Director has to say about it It's just such a different animal from what I've experienced in Korea he says but it's just like how you can't really complain about the weather in the States when you're going over to shoot a film. The Searchlight people had good taste though. There were some differences of opinion but at least they didn't make any nonsensical remarks. Chanwook Park is responsible for such acclaimed movies as 'Oldboy' 'Lady Vengeance' and 'Thirst'. Until now at least 'Oldboy' was his most famous movie and an American remake nobody wants is due for release soon. 'Stoker' is admittedly less violent and more subtle than those movies but only because frequent action isn't suitable for this particular script. It's primarily a character study focusing on the loss of innocence and I'm sure some less contemplative people hoping for frequent action will be disappointed. When it comes to style and controversy though this movie delivers and was everything I'd hoped it would be. It's stunning to look at and almost every shot is symbolic. More often than not it's sexual symbolism regarding loss of innocence and the same goes for the frequent symbolism in the dialogue. Furthermore there's a wonderful Hitchcock feel to it and clearly pays homage to 'Shadow Of A doubt' with a character called Uncle Charlie.The writer is Wentworth Miller an actor and this being his first screenplay makes it all the more impressive. Erin Cressida Wilson Secretary Chloe is credited as contributing writer. Based on the quality of this movie Wentworth Miller needs to get writing some more screenplays.I also felt the subject matter was a perfect match for Director Chanwook Park who's no stranger to controversial themes. It's a really rather pervy film even if done subtly artistically and almost entirely nonexplicitly. However there's one particular scene I found gloriously wrong and solidified my opinion that the filmmakers had at least been respected and the goal of the studio wasn't to tame and americanise the Director. However it will be interesting if a Director's cut comes out or at least deleted scenes to see what cuts were made and if they were a good move making it less baggy or toning it down. The important thing as of now is that the result is a great movie. Movie critic Chris Tookey for The Daily Mail was disgusted by the film so it can't be that toned down. A one star review from this man almost guarantees greatness.The title and characters' surname 'Stoker' has obvious vampiric connotations so some will be wondering if it's a vampire movie. Well it is and it isn't There are no fangs or capes or turning into bats but the name 'Stoker' is certainly no coincidence. Vampire mythology literature and movies are loaded with symbolism of the sexual predator seducing the innocent. Furthermore one of the definitions of the word 'vampire' is nonliteral simply meaning a person who preys on others. Vampires are also natural hunters and killers and there's a nature verses nurture aspect. These themes are essentially what the movie is about.Nicole Kidman plays mother 'Evelyn Stoker' and Matthew Goode plays charismatic creepy Uncle 'Charles Stoker' but there's simply no argument as to who steals the limelight and it's Mia Wasikowska Alice In Wonderland Jane Eyre as 18 year old 'India Stoker'. The actress is 23 but easily passes for an 18 year old. Her character is the main focus of the film and I feel she was perfectly cast for the role. She's old enough to be sexy yet young enough looking so you feel a little conflicted about thinking so and despite her innocent appearance has a facial quality that you can believe hides a personality more sinister. The character she plays is deeply intriguing and her acting as a dark sexually ripe moody introvert was magnetic and convincing. If it happened to be awards season I'd say she was in with a chance of some nominations but then when does subtle acting as a quiet introvert ever get nominations? It may only be the beginning of March and there's been a lot of great movies so far in 2013 but I think 'Stoker' is the best film of the year at this point. It's not only the exception to the rule that Asian Director's first English language features are watered down missteps but it's a film I thoroughly enjoyed and left the cinema genuinely excited about. You know that feeling when you find a movie that you really connect with and you can't wait to tell everyone about it? It's one of the best feelings in the world. Produced by Ridley and Tony Scott 'Stoker' is an example of Hollywood getting it absolutely right so please go and support it.".

A total mess of footage that we are meant to see as 'total Arthouse'. Matthew Goode must have laughed his way through this garbage thinking of the paycheck. Nicole Kidman simply did what she has done in many of her previous movies by acting strange. Last but not least the very over rated Mia Wasikowska who simply plays the oddball and is better known for her unpronounceable name and whiter than white skin. This movie is typical of today's output by directors making a name for themselves with sub standard crap pretending it is art.I have not been so bored since i watched the aforementioned 'Meeks Cutoff'. Straight in with a bullet as one of the worst movies of this decade.".

	schema:headline " A Potpourri of Vestiges Review Chanwook Park's ode to the Master of Suspense Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "Stoker celebrated Korean director Chanwook Park's Englishlanguage debut is a dark disturbing and diabolical film about an introspective young girl named India who witnesses the loss of innocence following the sudden and untimely death of her beloved father. In Stoker Park's fixation for the bizarre and the morbid is once again on full display. But he is clearly a bit more cautious than usual. He seems to keep his characters on a tight leash for a much longer duration and this makes the movie's first half appear much slower and less hyper than a typical Park film. But once the dust settles down the viewer is treated to sheer mastery of Park's craft. In Stoker Park pays homage to the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. Those who have seen Hitchcock's 1943 thriller Shadow of a Doubt wouldn't find it hard to draw parallels. Park limns a colorful canvas like only he can and his characters tread it like spirits caught in a limbo. While the characters are highly emotional their strangely selfish actions make it difficult for the viewers to sympathize with them. Chunghoon Chung's alluring cinematography gives the movie a hypnotic feel. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia Wasikowska Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in that order. Overall Stoker is an intriguing work of cinema that despite managing to stoke the fire of curiosity may still leave any keeneyed intelligent viewer high and dry. Those accustomed to watching the quintessential Hollywood product are likely to find Stoker very strange and deeply disturbing. But if you are looking for something different to break your monotonous daily routine then Stoker will surely not disappoint you. 810For more please visit my film blogsitehttpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

Those who have seen Hitchcock's 1943 thriller Shadow of a Doubt wouldn't find it hard to draw parallels. Park limns a colorful canvas like only he can and his characters tread it like spirits caught in a limbo. While the characters are highly emotional their strangely selfish actions make it difficult for the viewers to sympathize with them. Chunghoon Chung's alluring cinematography gives the movie a hypnotic feel. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia Wasikowska Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in that order. Overall Stoker is an intriguing work of cinema that despite managing to stoke the fire of curiosity may still leave any keeneyed intelligent viewer high and dry. Those accustomed to watching the quintessential Hollywood product are likely to find Stoker very strange and deeply disturbing. But if you are looking for something different to break your monotonous daily routine then Stoker will surely not disappoint you. 810For more please visit my film blogsitehttpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com";

	schema:headline " Twisted Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Stoker is a psychological thriller that you might not expect. It's not the usual type of the genre. The storytelling is in pure style and it features its terror in a completely twisted way. It's a weird cinematic experience that might stuck in your head for some time. It didn't offer much new to the plot but it creates a both melancholic and terrifying atmosphere to the picture which made it fascinating. What's more fascinating is the filmmaking understands the psychosis beneath it and it clearly shows them on screen. Stoker is quite peculiar but in a remarkably stunning way.The story is just simple but it is told very differently. Thrillers usually slowly builds the tension of the plot until it gets to the point that everything what's happening is not right. Here it already shows the oddness of their lives. The only thing it does now is to explore what's happening to the characters and what they are going to do. The plot isn't really that complex but it's all rather provocative. It embraces the strangeness that is manipulated from the two Stokers. It's not ought to be scary or anything. It's all about taking the ride on their horrifying acts. These scenes are without a doubt bizarre and somehow disturbing.The film has a set of amazing talents. Mia Wasikowska has always been lovely and talented. She gives a sense of weirdness inside of her innocence which is perfect to the character. Nicole Kidman makes a great desperate mother. Matthew Goode adds some creepy mannerism to the psychotic Uncle Charlie. It's easy to get infatuated by his deceiving charms. The violence is a bit tamed for a Chanwook Park film but here he aims more at the fortitude. He fills them with an impressively energetic style which helps executing its eerie. The gorgeous cinematography captures the melancholia of their world. Everything is just stunning.The story isn't really that subtle or original but Stoker is a stylishly made film that will give you a quite different experience. Instead of jump scares or whatever tricks that typical thrillers use the film rather tests the anxiety of the audience in these strange haunting exteriors. The film is not trying to be innovative but the reason why it's interesting is because of its intense use of filmmaking styles. It leaves the clichd modern thriller plot points for a while and it simply tells the story by exploring these people's little twisted lives. Overall it's visually captivating despite of the horror underneath the surfaces and that what makes the film so appealing.".

Just terrible in my opinion. The entirety of the story could be summed up in 30 minutes and it would make for a wonderful short movie. But as it is  it is tedious and unrewarding.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the first English language film from South Korean director ChanWook Park. He is probably most famous for the intense psychological thriller Oldboy. With his American debut he reigns in the extremity somewhat but does retain the visual inventiveness that is also one of his trademarks. In many ways Stoker is a modern update of Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt 1943. Like that one this film has a mysterious uncle reemerge into the life of a family after many years of absence. Before long it becomes pretty clear that all is not as it seems with this man and he is in fact extremely dangerous. The main character is an 18 year old girl called India Stoker played by Mia Wasikowska who was recently in the not very good but very popular Alice in Wonderland. She leads the film very well and carries off the bookish character effectively. There is also able support from Nicole Kidman as her mother.The look and feel of Stoker is impressive. The atmosphere is well sustained throughout. If I had a criticism it would simply be that the story ultimately isn't all that original and there aren't really a lot of surprises. What it does do though is to take a fairly standard psychological thriller story and make it interesting by way of cinematic techniques. It isn't a movie that is exactly going to break the mould but it is pretty accomplished nevertheless and is a pretty good first English language feature from its director.".

How does the boy get on top of the girl rape! after he's been tied up by the uncle and kicked by the niece  did they just arrange it to make the neckbreaking more spectacular? So that will be 10 lines if I manage to finish this one  I refuse to add anything more about the film.";

The cast itself includes some incredibly talented and experienced names yet it is India Wasikowska and her raptorlike awareness that truly sets the tone for the film when drawing upon the mystery and oddity of supporting characters who sink deeper into their roles like fangs in flesh as the film clicks along. The script itself could be rewritten with more depth and attention to the emotional wealth and strange sway of the characters for all of them are skilled enough to operate powerfully under the shroud of mystery director Park ChanWook erects so flawlessly yet the film could be much improved in tragic and horrifying value through a more tailored script. Editing must also be noted for ChanWook's is very engaging in that it utilizes the temporal frequency to link certain events building upon India's character and the internal struggles of those who surround her as well as the realization of her uncanny ability to cope with the revelations that come about and fit so frighteningly together. The audience comes to realize that some mysteries are exclusive only to those who are bound to travel the same blood trail that links generations in infinite conclusion and everlasting despair and a terrible longing and love can be as exclusive in it's own forbidden and lonely way. The soundtrack is pleasantly surprising and fitting with a piece from Clint Mansell Black Swan Requiem for a Dream and the debut of Emily Wells's Becomes the Color which serves to chart India's multifaceted transformation. I strongly recommend this film and highly praise actors Mia Wasikowska Nicole Kidman Matthew Goode and Dermot Mulroney who all contribute to the initial and lasting allure.".

Considering the director's previous films I went for Stoker expecting something newdeep and gripping. But the movie was beyond disappointing. It was borderline awful. While the shots and frames are beautiful in Stoker the movie on the whole and characters lack soul. It appears that the director wanted to make something very abstract without delving into much depth. The characters open mysteriously which makes you wonder about who they are but very soon they all become too cartoonish. The story of Stoker is waferthin and the director makes no bones about it. The director desperately tries to impress with his serene shots refreshing soundtrack and shockvalue but he remains desperate till the very end. The movie fails on both arty and entertainment values. There are way too many loopholes as well and the by time the movie credits roll you're thankful that it's over. Make no mistake this is nowhere near the director's best. The most disappointing aspect of it all is not the movie it's that a great director gets a chance in Hollywood to showcase his talents and he fluffs it big time.".

However this show reminds me initially of Beelzebub although later that diverged greatly.It is enjoyable as it has comedic and reflecting moments while not being overly dramatic. Ploy was consistent for most of the movie though there were some part which seem convenient. However the main plot of the movie is really heartwarming as it explores love family ties forgiveness sacrifice etc among other deeply touching topics. Not sure why the ratings and other reviews are so bad but generally it does show the hardship of a single parent especially one with other issues. And how they need the help of those who know of their plight.".

	schema:headline " Oh Baby! This movie was below average. This rattle barely made any noise.";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't get me wrong I don't really hate this lighthearted and quirky South Korean movie to the point that it needs to be aborted. It's not a smelly diaper. It's just pretty mediocre. The drama and comedy didn't mixed well. Because of that this film and I wouldn't party at my crib anytime soon! Directed by Kim Jinyoung and loosely based on a Japanese manga by author Marimo Ragawa the film tells the story of rebellious high school student Han JoonSoo Jang KeunSuk who sees his life take a strange turn when he goes to the grocery store and someone leaves a baby WooRam Moon Mason in his shopping cart along with a note claiming he's the father. Although the situation in the film is somewhat similar to the source material there is a lot of things that are different. Without spoiling the movie too much the first thing to note is while the film's main character is a troublemaker high school student that goes through character development in the manga the main character is a model hard working boy next door fifth grader. In addition to that Han Joonsoo has a baby because of pregnancy in contrast the original comic had Takuya Enoki deal with a younger brother after his mother dies and his father is too busy. Despite the changes the movie does have some really good emotional moments. Even if some of them are ruin by over the top acting from supporting characters out of place sound effects and really bad voiceacting from comedian Park MyeongSu who gives the baby a very angry very jarring adult husky sound. Somebody please put a pacifier on that 1989's film Look Who's Talking style of humor. It was getting kinda annoying. Most of the jokes fall somewhat flat for me anyways. There were barely any scenes that I found really funny. Lots of really crude jokes that kinda anger me. I thought some of them weren't needed. A good example of one is Han rubbing the dirty diaper on a fellow student books just because that student wanted to study without the baby distracting him. That was really not call for. There is also clearly several language barrier mistranslates in the subtitles from Korean to English that really confused the living hell out of me. One good example is the whole subplot of Han Joon Soo  the school. While I don't know much about Korean schools I do know enough that they tend to be highly rigorous with their long studying program and make the majority of student unhappy. So why was the unfortunate Han Joon Soo in high school in the first place if he didn't like it!? It's not like here where high school is mandatory. Isn't he eighteen? Isn't he technically an adult? Doesn't he have the choice of going to school? Also why did the parents felt the need to run away? They have the right to kick him out. It doesn't make sense. Also what was the connection with him with his teacher Mrs. Cho Kim Jungnan? Why is she so into Han Joon Soo's business? Is she in love with her student? Another thing how in the hell does she get away with beating up students? How in the hell was she able to get Han out of jail when he acts up? Something is a bit off here. Talking about off loveinterest what was the deal with the brainy neighbor girl Kim Byul Song Hayoon that wears preposterous chicken outfit time after time becomes his surrogate coparent. Don't get me wrong Song HaYoon's acting is alright but her character seem a bit fake and unrealistic. She felt like a manic pixie girl. Plus Han Joon Soo barely does anything to help her with her life so what is the connection here. However the main issues with the movie come during the finalact where clichs begin to pile on and the story becomes very predictable and generic. It gotten so bad that there is airplane lovechase scene. Not kidding! Also at this point the story begins to develop a strong sense of false emotion with Jang KeunSuk overacting. It's doesn't feel very effective. The pacing is also a bit off as the movie went a little too long for my taste. There is way too many subplots with Han Joon Soo's friends and their problems. The whole severe poverty and sick mother scene felt a different movie. Overall This movie is not as good as I thought it should be. While it's beautifully shot. It's clearly has some growing up to do.".

After their second bout of love making he asks her if they can go steady.The film follows the progression of their relationship from giggling amorous lovers to a more problem filled stage to the point where the lady cheats on her boyfriend with an ex.It's a serious film filled with sex. The plot and characters are probably enough to drive the film without the sex scenes. Unlike the other Korean film I've seen Summertime the sex scenes don't play an integral part to the characterization in this movie. So they feel a little bit like an extended addon to the movie. however the scenes are erotically shot highly charged and it helps that both protagonists are very attractive.The entire film is well shot well lit and it looks like they actually cared about quality. Some parts that defied my understanding though is the scenes where the girl asks her newfound friend to 'come inside' her and yet after the deed is done asks him why he did that. And the other scene where she removes his rubber. The sex scenes definitely do look realistic based on the angles at which they are against each other their muscles tensing and relaxing and the expressions on their faces. Great acting or the real thing?".

Then when the brother commits suicide Yunjeong assumes his identity disguises herself in male drag as Yunbok and lives as a male. This grows complicated once Yunjeong falls deeply in love with a man Kangmu. Meanwhile Yunjeong's longtime instructor Kim Hongdo falls in love with her and a courtesan named Seolhwa falls helplessly into unrequited love with Kim  prompting her to undertake an extreme and fatal act of jealous passion.";

The ending is where I give the movie most credit. Very unpredictable. To me the best scene in the movie is the last twenty seconds of the film. This film is slowrepetitive and slightly draggy at certain parts. However this movie is highly entertaining with the climax coming towards the end. This movie may not be as entertaining as the better ones such as Koma. This movie is more of a fantastic phsycological thriller than a horror movie. It plays in your mind. At the end of this film I guarantee that you will be very satisfied. I will give this movie a very high score of 910.".

It would have made more impact if the movie had a faster pace and if there had been more murders. I understand that this movie is more about the atmosphere. The cinematography and locationthe toll booth in the middle of nowhere provide an ambiance which is creepy enough. In combination with the slow pace and the urban legend concerning 29 February you will be drawn in the movie. The main character is likable and not annoying. Even when you suspect something is wrong with her you will care for her. This is key for the two twists at the ending. I give this movie 6.8 points out of 10!".

Borrowed some Juon gimmicks so as hidden floor but it seems to be universal after the success of Juon ";

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to give a movie a 10 out of 10. And it's even harder to give a movie a 1 out of 10. Why? Because even the worst of films have a tiny little element to praise. 'Transformers Revenge of the Fallen' is something I consider to be one of the worst films I've ever seen and I've watched Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus!...yet that movie had good CGI too much of it but still good in terms of visuals.But here comes 'Sector 7' the first 3D movie to be released in South Korea. I am Korean and I assure you that Americans are more likely to like this movie...because English subtitles will definitely hide the terrible dialogue in this movie.Monster....monster.... says Ha Ji Won when she first sees this glob of CG. Then Sung Kee Ahn grabs a gun. First of all there would be no guns on an oil mine in Korea and second of all this reaction is stupid. Why would anyone believe there'd be a monster on board? What's worse is the doctor on the ship speculates that the gooey substance the monster leaves behind is semen. What kind of doctor is this?!We don't see the monster until we get tired of this movie. What I mean by that is we get boring exposition we don't care about. None of the characters are interesting they are just typical monster food. I am of course talking about the girl who won't shut up the playful boyfriend who will become overprotective when the situation gets serious the seemingly wise old man who knows how to use a gun an obnoxious retard who's blamed for all the damage the monster is responsible for.We finally see the monster about half way into this movie. A good movie like 'Alien' will use this technique by creating suspense. There is no suspense here. When the monster is finally revealed you will wish you hadn't seen it. Not because it's scary but because the CG is faker than fake. I'm not just talking about the looks which is terrible I'm also talking about its mechanical movement. But I should've known better when the opening CG sequence was pathetic. The 1980's flashback in Sector 7 should give you an idea of how poor the special effects are in this movie.And why was this movie in 3D? Yeah I know we get one scene where the monster's tail shoots right out of the screen but that was like 0.3 seconds and this is a movie that is longer than it needs to be.This movie tries to be everything. It tries to be 'Alien' we'll get to that later. It tries to be a comedy the audience laughed once in throughout this movie. It tries to be dramatic. None of the deaths are satisfying none of them evoke any sort of emotion whether sadness or fear or relief.The worst part of the movie is the climax. Here we have the main lead girl fighting with the monster head to head in a factory. Sound familiar? I don't mind a movie imitating a classic in order to create cheap thrills but this just fails to entertain the slightest bit. And besides all I'm doing is looking at my watch.And don't make me mention the motorcycle scenes because they were so random and so stupidly tied into the end. Even in the trailers what was the girl planning to do with the motorcycle? Just ram it into the giant monster?This could've been a legit monster movie. The setting was pretty good it's an oil mine in the middle of a vast ocean. And also there are some moral issues incorporated into the monster not spoiling anything. But the hollow characters and the actors who take themselves too seriously ruin this film completely. The action sucks the CGI sucks. One of the WORST movies I've seen in my life.Do not let this movie effect your perception towards Korean movies. Even we know it's bad.".

	schema:headline " Generic creature feature that still packs enough thrills for an unfussy audience just don't expect another genre classic like 'The Host'";
	schema:reviewBody "Bong Joonho's critical and commercial success 'The Host' set a gold standard for creature features in South Korea but it isn't simply because of this genre predecessor that 'Sector 7' rode on a tidal wave of expectations prior to its release. Nonetheless that wave crashed before it even reached shore overwhelmingly negative critical reception and soon after audience reception all but ensured that 'Sector 7' never became the monster boxoffice hit it was supposed to be back in its home territory.It's unfortunate that the bar was already set unrealistically high for the movie even before it opened. Indeed director Kim Jihoon's followup to his wellreceived 2007 historical epic 'May 18' is really just a wellmade Bmonster movie without the kind of smart scriptwriting needed for it to meet critic and audience expectations. Sure it doesn't have what it takes to be outstanding but those looking for some good old straightforward thrills will find that 'Sector 7' delivers those just fine. In case you're wondering the title of the movie refers to a continental shelf off Jeju Islands that was thought to hold massive oil and natural gas reserves. Its sovereignty was the focus of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan in the 1970s with both nations eager to exploit it for its resources. The history behind the stretch of ocean may add a dose of reality for those who have lived long enough through the tenacious twoparty negotiations but any hopes that this may make for some intelligent social commentary in the movie especially considering the energy crisis facing the world today should quickly be set aside. Instead screenwriters Kim Hwi and JK Youn opt for a standard barebones character setup before unleashing the monster. The most developed character among the lot is Haejun Ha Jiwon a headstrong female engineer atop an offshore oil rig at loggerheads with her captain who believes their expedition is a fruitless one. Next to Haejun is that of her mentor Master Ahn Sungki who arrives on the rig after the order to vacate and convinces the captain it might be worthwhile to persevere. Other than Haejun and Master the others are no more than prey  including Haejun's boyfriend Dongsu Oh Jiho best buddies Sanggu and Jongyun Park Chulmin and Song Saebyeok and socially awkward Chisun. It takes about half an hour before things start to go awry and by that point besides confirming the audience's suspicion that Master isn't as worthy as he seems to be Jihoon is content to let the action take centrestage. So one by one these characters will find themselves hunted by the monster and eventually meet their demise until of course just Dongsu Master and Haejoon are left standing. Jihoon reserves the film's single longest climactic sequence for them substituting the narrow passageways beneath the rig where most of the earlier action takes place for the wide open expanse on the platform. Logic and reason are not required from the start of the unrelenting action up till the end all Jihoon demands of his audience is to sit back and let the adrenaline kick in. At least in this regard Jihoon delivers where it counts aided by no less than his lead actress Jiwon who has been dubbed Korea's Angelina Jolie after performing all her own stunts in this film. Seeing Jiwon in the thick of the action especially when she gets on a motorbike and zips along the platform with the beast fast behind her is thrilling to say the least though that very standout sequence is somewhat marred by some notsogood CGI betraying the green screen against which it was shot. Nonetheless she is more than convincing as a female action hero and one only hopes that the writers had spent more time with her character to make it equally memorable. Certainly if even Haejoon comes off onedimensional you can be sure that the monster will only fare worse. The purpose behind the monster's pursuit of its prey is never clearly defined since it neither seems to devour them or bring them back to its nest where its embryos lay cocooned in some gooey mess. The latter's reference is also pointless since the film makes no attempt to weave it into the story after only a brief scene. And even if it isn't meant to make much sense the leap of logic the film demands from its audience when the monster is explained to be from the chemosynthetic read deepsea ecosystem but spends so much of its time out of the water is just too glaring to ignore. It doesn't help too that Jihoon reveals the monster in its entirety too early into the film abandoning any attempt at building audience anticipation all too quickly. The decision to rely on a homegrown effects studio as opposed to a foreign one like 'The Host' did might be worth touting for their local audience but you're likely to come off thinking that the CG work is nothing remarkable. The same can also be said of the 3D in the movie which lends depth to certain scenes but arguably not in the actionheavy ones that matter You'll understand why then the disappointment that 'Sector 7' was met with when it was released back in its home territory since it lacks the smart scriptwriting and sharp direction needed for it to become another classic like 'The Host'. Instead it is a perfectly generic creature feature offering nothing more than Bgrade movie thrills that would probably still satisfy an undemanding audience. But since it probably doesn't have to live up to such lofty expectations here 'Sector 7' will do just fine as a nofrills action adventure forgettable ultimately but thrilling and entertaining enough while it lasts.".

	schema:headline " Don't Understand Korean But Still Loved It!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am an American living in Korea and my Korean is not yet to the point where I can actually understand movie dialogue fluently. That being said regardless of the fact that Sector 7 was in Korean without English subtitles I very much enjoyed the movie! To my understanding this is the first movie ever made in South Korea for both 3D and iMAX. I saw it in 3D and the visual effects were incredible. The 3D was very real and the CG looked true to life.Many in Korea have already made comparisons of this movie with Alien and compared Jiwon Ha's performance to that of Sigourney Weaver. Known as Ha Ji Won in Korea she is very well known for her acting in Korean dramas but I think this film will definitely take her career to a new level. Her character is very real goes through the entire emotional rollercoaster throughout the movie and is strong in moments without dialogue as well.Koreans should obviously see this but nonnative speakers as well. It's a pure action movie so it easy to follow along and have a good time.".

That being said regardless of the fact that Sector 7 was in Korean without English subtitles I very much enjoyed the movie! To my understanding this is the first movie ever made in South Korea for both 3D and iMAX. I saw it in 3D and the visual effects were incredible. The 3D was very real and the CG looked true to life.Many in Korea have already made comparisons of this movie with Alien and compared Jiwon Ha's performance to that of Sigourney Weaver.

Monster has elongated tongue it uses to attack prey  Alien 4. Monster has extremely thick skin that is only vulnerable to fire  Alien 5. Oil rig is set for self destruct in the finale in an attempt to destroy monster  AlienI could go on but honestly i don't need to. The CGI is awful and the monster design is so bad it i8s almost unwatchable. It looks like a giant killer BBQ spare rib. With legs.

I'm cool with that but come on at least set some minimum standards!For me this movie was about random scenes stupid dialogues and wtf moments. Nothing is developed except for somewhat the main character nothing is explained. Seems like the monster just went nuts and started a killing spree... hey!

LOTS of gaps in basic logic and really big plot holes BUT! if you don't care about that maybe you'll like this movie.Seems they started recording and just made the script as they went by.. that's really the only explanation I can find.It's like reading a book starting on Chapter 1 then 2 then jump to 4 after that to chapter 7 read chapter 3 of another book and jump to the end.OH!! we forgot this was in 3D so lets throw in 5 secs of some 3D scenes throughout the movie!!

	schema:reviewBody "Touted as one of the first 3D monster movie coming out of Korea that was a box office sensation Sector 7 hits all the sweet spots as far as playing up the hunterprey formula of monster versus helpless humans but did it take a long time in getting there weighted down by a pretty lengthy first act that served as an introduction to all the characters involved and dwelling a bit more into their respective formulaic caricatures before unleashing hell onboard an oil rig crew that doesn't have the luck when it comes to looking for and digging for black gold.Ha JiWon plays Cha HaeJoon the lone female oil rig miner besides the other female crew in doctor HyunJung Cha YeRyeon in what would be a testosterone filled occupation out in the rough seas. The team seems to be hitting dead ends continuously and are ordered to cease operations only for Ahn JungMan Ahn SungKi to return to the rig and whose intentions will be made clear as the film progresses. But with the skeleton crew left behind they find what they're looking for and with that success managed to find time to engage in some shenanigans such as motorbike racing on the rig platform and trading of war stories through the comparison of scars earned through their tough jobs. It is here of course that we learn of their broad values and principles which will come useful once the monster gets unleashed.It isn't the first time that the Koreans have dabbled in monster films having the very acclaimed The Host and others like Chaw making it to the country's filmography. Sector 7 proves to be a worthy addition to that list with director Kim JiHun knowing what it takes to keep up the suspense and to build anticipation and utilizing the best of lighting and camera angles to take the narrative forward even though one may have to shrug at the story by Yun JeGyun which is riddled with the usual formulaic clichs. Characters turn into caricatures and remain wafer thin and you know just about everyone is fair game to being chomped by the monster especially those who display negative traits that you will root for karma to make its full circle even if it means having the narrative go through the necessary convenience.Themes such as camaraderie and courage are a given as are minor subplots involving friendships and romance in the middle of the rig south of Jeju Island. Once this film decided to become a monster flick from the halfway mark it essentially became a Ha JiWon vehicle with the actress having come a long way since her Sex is Zero time to the tough as nails cookie character who dishes out as good as she receives aping to reach the ranks of the Ripleys and the Connors through her acrobatic stunts quick wit and keen sense of survival. That benchmark unfortunately was a little bit hard to reach.The creature design is certainly one of the best things about the film with the filmmakers never shy to always want to keep it under wraps or shadows. With such a beautiful beast created the last thing you want to do is to hide it so from the onset we get to see what the threat looks like with its razor like fangs and wicked whiplike tongue as well as armoured skin making it all quite impervious to just about everything everyone throws at it from shotgun projectiles to harpoons yet susceptible to melee weapons such as the good ol' axe. What aced the design was the creature's inherent combustible nature adding much needed gravitas to plot development and requisite rationale why and how things developed the way they were as well as being responsible for some of the more aesthetically shot action sequences complete with slowmo techniques to bring out sheer awe. But ultimately while Sector 7 can be a guilty pleasure as far as monster flicks go with the hunter very much in control and threatening different prey along the way it never quite reached the heights it had the potential to. If only it had a less clich development added a lot more varied scenes in which fodder got dispatched and made characters whom we actually care a lot more for then this would have been something more memorable indeed.".

While I appreciate that the filmmakers are happy to show off the monster here  and quite extensively  which makes a pleasing contrast to the kind of teasing behaviour exhibited in many a Hollywood movie  the CGI effects are only acceptable really and hardly the stuff of greatness as in THE HOST.What is a shame is that a lot of the shooting style is so cheesy. Many of the action sequences were shot on a green screen so they look pretty poor especially the motorbike bits. Plus this was a 3D film so there's all of the screenflying fakery to go with it. The plot is very predictable but the cast all do their jobs well particularly lead actress Ha Jiwon PHONE TIDAL WAVE and there's plentiful action  particularly in the second half  to enjoy.

Well Sector 7 is the visual embodiment of this idea  if you are anything like me after seeing the trailer you were grinning from ear to ear. The movie however is unable to convey that same level of entertainment.Cha HaeJoon Ha JiWon otherwise referred to as Hardass by her male counterparts is a young woman working on an oil platform in an area designated sector 7 a place in the middle of the ocean presumably rich with liquid gold. The crew is soon joined by Ahn JungMan Ahn SungKi a colleague of HaeJoon's late father who goes against the orders of the rig's Captain Hwang Park JungHak to recommence the drilling operation.With the exception of HaeJoon and JungMan the other crew members are provided minimal depth or backstory. Even Kim DongSoo Oh JiHo HaeJoon's paramour has limited characterization their relationship being largely unexplored. Although it is obvious they are mutually ambitious and competitive as the platform's doctor MoonHyung Lee HanWi speculates it is difficult to tell which of them is the man due to HaeJoon's formidable presence. Where HaeJoon could be likened to Ellen Ripley sad to say it  DongSoo is no Corporal Hicks.Oil workers Do SangGu Park ChulMin and Ko JongYoon Song SaeByeok also deserved larger roles however it is scientist HyunJung Cha YeRyun who received the most insultingly underwhelming role of all whose screen time could easily be measured in seconds. The addendum her character is continuously been harassed by Jang ChiSoon Park YoungSoo who's desperate to acquire her affections is a subplot that was as annoying as it was unnecessary.The lacking characterization can be linked to the speed that those on board begin to perish the first deaths happening within only a few minutes of each other once the film's monster makes its entrance.I suppose in a way Sector 7 is a film we should have seen coming. If Japan has Godzilla and America has Cloverfield obviously South Korea deserves a hulking monster of its own. However rather than building up the tension over a period of time the creature is quickly revealed in its entirety which unfortunately confiscates any fear the audience may have had the option of experiencing.The origins of the creature and how it came to be so enormous are largely unexplored for more than half the feature and though there is some subtle hinting it is never quite enough. During one scene we are introduced to a laboratory we have previously never encountered and a crippled glass canister we've never seen. Obviously this is a clear indication that something horribly wrong has occurred however since the backstory takes longer to surface than the monster does the film partially suffers.The creature benefits from its sheer uniqueness in contrast with other monsters that have previously occupied our screens but at the same time this is also its weakest aspect. Originally appearing more aquatic in nature with an unconventional pair of fins and a flipper the creature all of a sudden has insectlike legs and begins resembling prehistoric reptiles. Although there are scientists on board the platform none attempt to postulate a theorem regarding this peculiarity.Furthermore although blood is apparent in the film and I don't mean to appear like an insatiable gorehound the feature could have benefited from additional violence to further immerse the audience in the perilstricken situation. On this note however although the monster was the stereotypical powerful horror whose hide is almost impenetrable to all conventional attacks the damage that is visually noticeable across its physique is very impressive. Overtime the creature whenever it exposes itself does so in all its gory glory after having suffered brutality at the hands of those attempting to stop its onslaught. This aside no matter how unique the creature may have occasionally appeared I couldn't help equating it with The Thing. If this wasn't enough the film resembles both Alien and the Rig in that a small crew are forced to confront a terrifying monstrosity in a dark environment that it begins to dominate. During another instance a conversation between crew members appears to have been ripped right out of Jaws. Although some may be quick to argue that the film is paying homage to American classics I couldn't help but feel a considerable portion of the film is blatantly taken from others.Moving on the effects are often effectively produced and though they are not Hollywood standard they are certainly entertaining. The fight scenes normally don't appear spectacularly new instead mimicking other features namely Deep Rising and the aforementioned Thing. Although the oil rig is in the middle of the sea the audience seldom has the opportunity to appreciate the creature in its natural habitat. This addition may have provided the film with a certain degree of uniqueness though watching HaeJoon fleeing the monster on a motorbike is one such scene that is certainly worthwhile.Although the ending comes equipped with a sense of emotional beauty by then it is cliche expression I know too little too late for the audience to be invested. If the rest of the film had exhibited similar thematic properties the resulting conclusion would have been far more powerful. If you are a fan of actress Ha JiWon or any of the actors who participate in this film then perhaps you ought to give Sector 7 a try. Otherwise you might wish to find something else to feast upon.".

	schema:headline " It's not too Korean it simply gets too redundant";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a loose continuation of the remake The Housemaid and received negative critics at Cannes Festival. Director Im SangSoo regretted for having presented this movie and said that it could only be understood by Korean people. Of course this is a quite weak and almost racist excuse. Koreans have doubtlessly a unique cinema but anybody with some knowledge of Korean people and their culture and any true fan of Korean cinema is able to understand this movie. I quite liked The Housemaid because it really showed us the rift between rich and poor in Korea and how hard it is to climb the ladders of acceptance in this country. The tragic story of the housemaid somehow criticized the Korean society while including emotionally driven parts with addicting characters and suspenseful moments. The Taste Of Money introduces us to a similar but slightly different story line. It shows us the situation of the same family twenty years after the The Housemaid. In the beginning nothing seems to have changed. The daughter and the son are both already divorced and rather egoistic. The mother is still very dominating and tries to control anybody at all costs. The father only married her to get rich and influential and is boozing and seducing a lot of younger women. But he got tired of his lifestyle and feels that his role in his family and the society has become too heavy to carry on. He also has an affair with the Indonesian housemaid. The movie also criticizes the attitude strangers adapt towards South Korea. The American businessman is reduced to a corrupt capitalist who adores South Korea for the money he makes the high amounts of alcohol he drinks and the number of beautiful women he can have sex with. It's true that some businessman from the Western world have this attitude but they would have the same attitude towards any other country than their own. One shouldn't forget that more and more foreigners start being interested in Korean culture movies and language and are even living there. The director only depicts a negative image of the Western world and that was done on purpose because the director could have picked any South Korean businessman as well. Don't get me wrong I think that some kind of criticism of the Western world is justified but in this case it only distracts from the main goal of the movie that wants to show us a cold portrait of the rich and famous in South Korea. In comparison to the first part where the housemaid doesn't get much attention from the family father and acts in the most naive way the new housemaid is a lot more mature. She has two children from a previous relationship and knows how it is to be beaten up. The relationship between the family father and the housemaid would permit both of them to start a new life. The father could finally escape from his responsibilities and trade his power to his children while the housemaid could be together with her children and stay with a man who is truly dedicated to her. While the housemaid of the first movie was only one woman among many others and some sort of amusement for the family father the new housemaid is his key to finally change his life. The character has finally learnt from his mistakes.But both of them can't escape the evil plans of the mother who wants to keep her strong image and her power alive. This conflict leads to a deadly confrontation where everyone turns out to lose something precious.There is another connection between this movie and The Housemaid. At the end of the predecessor the young daughter NaMi had developed a good relationship to the housemaid but the movie didn't tell us if this relation had some sort of positive impact on her as she continued growing up in a very capitalist cold and isolated family. This new movie shows us that what happened in the first movie had an impact. The daughter has developed a sense of morality and is described as a good person by the disciplined and serious main character Youngjak who is employed by the family. He feels more and more uneasy about their lifestyle before he has to take the decision to stay and become a powerful prospect or to leave and start a new life. At some moment the daughter even remembers her old housemaid and her mother simply describes her as crazy and unimportant which shows how different mother and daughter turn out to be.The problem with this movie is not that it's too Korean but that it has a very slow pace. The acting is great and the portrait of the egoistic rich family and its internal and external struggles is colourful but there are too many similarities to The Housemaid. Some scenes feel redundant and fail to surprise. The few shocking scenes are not even shown and that's why no true suspense is developed in here. The only fighting scene in the movie is the most ridiculous and weak one I have ever seen in cinema. The ending was also everything but original.What saves this movie are the atmosphere the dark portrait of contemporary South Korean society and the strong acting. The story lacks surprises and suspense and is too close to the predecessor. Of course The Housemaid rather showed us the impossibility of overturning the classes while The Taste Of Money shows us how hard life is once you are imprisoned in the higher class. Both movies are complementary. I though feel that there is too much repetition in them. That's why The Taste Of Money is only of an average quality. If you liked The Housemaid or dark dramas with some social critics in general you should try this out. If you expect something creative and gripping you should look elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a military history journalist and I first heard about this movie when I researched an article about soldiers who fought in multiple armies during WW2. There were a couple of them. The true story of Kim was very exciting so I wondered how they made it into a movie. Badly! Another stupid romantic flick which turns an interesting piece of history upside down and retains nothing of the original.The real Kim's name was Yang Kyunjong. He was no Olympic runner just a regular 19 year old Korean guy who got drafted into the Japanese army. Not because the Japs were so cruel but that was the custom of the time. Sure serving in the Imperial Japanese Army wasn't a walk in the park. He was taken prisoner by Soviet forces in the Battle of KhalkinGol in 1938 and lived in a Siberian POW camp for years just like in the movie. There he volunteered into the Soviet army. He fell into German captivity during  most likely  the Battle of Kharkov in 1943. After having joined the SS Eastern Legion  and not the Wehrmacht as in the movie  with several more Russian POWs he was transferred to Normandy just before DDay. He survived the invasion and surrendered to the Americans. He was released from a POW camp in Britain in 1946 moved to America and actually never talked about his story not even to his family. He died in 1992. His exodus was only uncovered in 2002 when a South Korean journalist found photos in an US war archive about SS soldiers of Korean nationality being registered as POWs in Normandy.Now for the movie. It's simply one of the most annoying war movies I've ever seen. The true story was seemingly not exciting enough for the filmmakers so they turned it into a cheesy romantic flick. The main hero has three traits he loves to run he can take an incredible amount of beating and takes every opportunity to have his stupid face bashed and for some reason he tries to save everyone from damnation. Probably God likes it and this is why he's always saved in the very last moment before being shot stabbed burnt or something similar.The character itself is outright unrealistic. Nobody stayed an innocent angel in Soviet work camps. I met a lot of old people who spent years there. A misfit like Kim would've been fed to the crows in a week. Also nobody risked their lives for others in the Gulag camps. People simply tried to keep a low profile and shut up. They were barely living. Yet Kim and all others somehow manage to keep themselves wellfed and healthy.The battle scenes are simply ridiculous. Yes they look nice with many swishyswoshy special effects a lot of fake blood and clichs diligently copied in every war movie since Saving Private Ryan. But come on... The battle of KhalkinGol was not fought in strictly tight formations. No battles were. The Soviets indeed used T26 tanks like in the movie but they weren't idiots to send them against the Japanese in a parade formation with no infantry. Fortunately the Japs in this movie are even bigger idiots and march in even tighter formations with only rifles and swords. Their luck is that the Russians still try to top their idiocy and all their tankers stand in the turret under all circumstances with the hatch open. Oh bull!Then comes a very long dragging part about the Soviet POW camp with very predictable twists and suddenly our hero is a Russian soldier finding himself the exact copy of the opening scene of Enemy at the Gates! For some reason the Germans after devastating an entire Russian city have built a hedgehog position in the middle of it decorating a building with neat parade flags just in case the Russians can't find them. Now say why on earth would a German unit entrench itself in a Russian city in 1941? Particularly when facing only ragtag Soviet infantry with barely enough rifles while they have tanks and heavy weapons? Oh bull again!But our heroes survive again without a scratch and that's heroic indeed not only because the battering they receive but also the everrepeating heroic music which gets quite annoying by the time. Probably they can't hear it over the battle noise  good for them. Yes yes we also know John Williams but we don't care how some Korean band can mimic his style. Please stop. Or die. Whatever.Would you believe that soon comes an exact copy of the DDay scene from Saving Private Ryan? Well actually the only merit to this movie is that it shows how it wasn't exactly a birthday party for the Germans either. Otherwise the entire scene is just as ridiculous as earlier ones. Vastly overdone CGI don't compensate for the lack of realism just how many bullets can our hero dodge? and neither for historic inaccuracy. Paratroopers jumping during the Omaha Beach landing really? Hasn't it happened a day before? And why do they land just about a hundred meters from the battle after it was already won? Why would they use paras for that?Spoiler warning! Here comes the worst. So our heroes somehow survive the entire ordeal good thing the battleship Iowa is only pounding the beach with very small grenades and the bombs falling from the B17s are also really undersized and run away... until our Korean hero finally somehow gets mortally wounded. What happens next? He gives the dog tag to the Japanese guy and tells him to become him so he Americans won't kill him. SERIOUSLY?! So the filmmakers allege that Yang Kyungjong who actually survived DDay was an impostor and in fact a Japanese colonel and war criminal? My I hope his family never watched this. This feels like they spat on his grave.".

Nobody stayed an innocent angel in Soviet work camps. I met a lot of old people who spent years there. A misfit like Kim would've been fed to the crows in a week. Also nobody risked their lives for others in the Gulag camps. People simply tried to keep a low profile and shut up. They were barely living. Yet Kim and all others somehow manage to keep themselves wellfed and healthy.The battle scenes are simply ridiculous. Yes they look nice with many swishyswoshy special effects a lot of fake blood and clichs diligently copied in every war movie since Saving Private Ryan. But come on... The battle of KhalkinGol was not fought in strictly tight formations. No battles were. The Soviets indeed used T26 tanks like in the movie but they weren't idiots to send them against the Japanese in a parade formation with no infantry. Fortunately the Japs in this movie are even bigger idiots and march in even tighter formations with only rifles and swords. Their luck is that the Russians still try to top their idiocy and all their tankers stand in the turret under all circumstances with the hatch open. Oh bull!Then comes a very long dragging part about the Soviet POW camp with very predictable twists and suddenly our hero is a Russian soldier finding himself the exact copy of the opening scene of Enemy at the Gates! For some reason the Germans after devastating an entire Russian city have built a hedgehog position in the middle of it decorating a building with neat parade flags just in case the Russians can't find them. Now say why on earth would a German unit entrench itself in a Russian city in 1941? Particularly when facing only ragtag Soviet infantry with barely enough rifles while they have tanks and heavy weapons? Oh bull again!But our heroes survive again without a scratch and that's heroic indeed not only because the battering they receive but also the everrepeating heroic music which gets quite annoying by the time. Probably they can't hear it over the battle noise  good for them. Yes yes we also know John Williams but we don't care how some Korean band can mimic his style. Please stop. Or die. Whatever.Would you believe that soon comes an exact copy of the DDay scene from Saving Private Ryan? Well actually the only merit to this movie is that it shows how it wasn't exactly a birthday party for the Germans either. Otherwise the entire scene is just as ridiculous as earlier ones. Vastly overdone CGI don't compensate for the lack of realism just how many bullets can our hero dodge? and neither for historic inaccuracy. Paratroopers jumping during the Omaha Beach landing really? Hasn't it happened a day before? And why do they land just about a hundred meters from the battle after it was already won? Why would they use paras for that?Spoiler warning! Here comes the worst. So our heroes somehow survive the entire ordeal good thing the battleship Iowa is only pounding the beach with very small grenades and the bombs falling from the B17s are also really undersized and run away... until our Korean hero finally somehow gets mortally wounded. What happens next? He gives the dog tag to the Japanese guy and tells him to become him so he Americans won't kill him. SERIOUSLY?! So the filmmakers allege that Yang Kyungjong who actually survived DDay was an impostor and in fact a Japanese colonel and war criminal? My I hope his family never watched this. This feels like they spat on his grave.";

I won't spoil the twist ending but the script is terrific the acting is great cinematography is excellent and the budget was huge. There are one or two sappy scenes at the very end the title at least as translated into Englishis baffling and irrelevant to the story and an Andrea Bocelli closingcredits song is saccharine and inappropriate but those are the only deficits that keep me from giving this film a tenrating. Highly recommended. In Korean with subtitles.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review My Way";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess I have Korean director Kang JeGyu to thank for sparking an interest in Korean films. No it wasn't any of the masters of old who got me hooked but my first foray into Korean cinema on the big screen was actually to watch his Shiri and while some may be of the opinion it's nothing more than a standard action thriller fare it got me hooked and to wonder just what more is out there in Korean cinema. And Kang went on to direct only 2 more films over a twelve year period the first being the war movie Taegukgi and now My Way.So in a way that makes it three films in a row that he's dabbled with men in uniform exploring themes like brotherhood and friendship in blockbusters starring some of the biggest names in the industry. And in My Way he teams up with Korea's Jang DongGun and Japan's Joe Odagiri who play rivals in Cain and Abel style the former being a young boy working in the latter's family during the Japanese occupation of Korea only for a terrorist incident to forever scar their potential friendship into deep hatred between the men especially for Joe's Tatsuo against Jang's JoonSik. And their rivalry extends to their love for running long distance almost always on par in countless of marathons they participate in.The story written by Kang Na Hyun and Kim ByungIn then centers the narrative against the run up to the Second World War with the premise having to build up and culminate in Normandy during DDay. So that takes the men now in army fatigues with JoonSik being one of many Koreans forced to conscript in the Japanese Imperial Army and under the arrogant merciless leadership of Tatsuo in what would be convenience to further the two men's rivalry especially when one is put in a lowly position and the other having life and death powers over the man he loved to hate. The trio of writers managed to pack this film with enough incidents befitting any war movie from POW imprisonment disobedience of orders torture and the likes and playing on the theme of Karma having what went around coming around to perpetrators. Not a very subtle approach though.With a war setting expect plenty of theatres of battles across different territories and under various banners and allegiances such as the Japanese Soviets and Germans even and you can tell where the money went into recreating their realism from uniforms weapons and vehicles together with the recreation of the Normandy invasion. Don't expect too much accuracy though if you think that DDay and other battles were wonlost in a few minutes but one does get impressed by the effort to ensure that each battle got portrayed on as large a canvas possible making it feel that the series of events the characters find themselves into are far larger than their individual. There are times though that the editing and leaving of material on the cutting room floor had led to episodes being spliced together rather haphazardly so that's a bit of a pity.It's steeped in testosterone if not for China's Fan Bingbing playing a bit role here as a sniper with vengeance against the Japanese at the top of her mind and of course with her potential of opening up this film to the Mainland market. Other supporting acts include the good friends of JoonSik such as JongDae Kim InKwon who probably was the only supporting character given enough time for character development and being somewhat of an in between of the two men offering a view of what each of them had or could have become. And this character alone demonstrates how adaptable Man can be when faced with circumstances that calls for that fine balance between morals ideals and the basic need for survival. Recommended!".

Well see it for yourself.My Way tells a tale of two rivals Korean Kim JunShik and Japanese Hasegawa Tatsuo. JunShik's father works as a servant of Tatsuo's grandfather in Japaneseoccupied Korea. They first met when Tatsuo arrived there with his parents in 1928. Though they differ in nationality and social standings they have one thing in common to be the greatest marathon runner. Every year they compete in races though JunShik wins the most. One day Tatsuo's grandfather is assassinated by a Korean terrorist which only deepens the resentment of Tatsuo towards Koreans.Due to an incident after a marathon race JunShik and several other Korean friends are drafted into the Japanese Imperial army. Little did JunShik know that he would be serving under Tatsuo much much later. That's it for the plot. I won't spoil anymore than that. I find that this film is unique not like any other warlike films because of these two things 1 There are at least 5 different languages spoken Korean Japanese Mandarin Russian and German. 2 If you are a Kim initially you are forced to fight under the banner of the Sun Emperor and then for the Red Army and then for the Krauts. Whoopsie.Blend of cinematography theme and cast are topnotched! From oriental Seoul to desert Mongolia to icy Steppes of Russia to bloody Hedosk and to calm sandy beaches of Normandy France. Tatsuo is played by Japanese Johnny Depp Jo Odagiri Shinobi Azumi while JunShik is played by Korean heartthrob Jang DongGun Tae Guk Gi. Though it's a twohour film rest assured that you won't be left with boredom or too much drama. Fighting and battle scenes will make yourself glued to the screen. One bombscene where both Tatsuo and JunShik flew to the air in slowmotion is really breathtaking!Bottom line is if you're the one who really values FRIENDSHIP this IS a mustsee film for you. D".

The latest of this genre My Way coming out of Korea takes a unique take on the war film. While they have proved the ability to make a great war movie will this new twist with the story manage to create something memorable or just be another loss on the battlefield? My Way follows a Korean and Japanese marathon runner that are thrust into a bitter rivalry that follows them off the track and onto the battlefield as they are forced to enlist. This is not only a good war film it is easily one of the best to come along in quite a while. As it advertised it is very much like Saving Private Ryan but way better. The story is a bit out there at times but is amazing to watch. It has taken the true story of a Korean body found on the beaches of Normandy and created and amazing journey around it. The performances are all really well done and only enhance the overall experience. There are times in war movies that they try to deliver a wellcrafted story to make a better film but end up sacrificing the war aspect. Here they not only didn't ignore it they deliver on a massive scale. With a film running almost two and a half hours it delivers almost nonstop violent bloody action that takes you directly onto the battlefield. While it is a long film it never really feels like it. The story moves at a breathtaking pace with a brilliantly executed pace and beautifully violent visuals that will not soon be forgotten.My Way has not only created a brilliant war film it takes you on a journey of redemption and emotional pain. There are so many levels to this film that it's nearly impossible to touch on them all. If you are a fan of this genre then you have to give this movie a shot.

Hell no make it a 1010 that other point just because Kim Inkwon was in the cast and he was fantastic as usual. I hope the South Koreans appreciate what a highly gifted actor he is. I grew up loving the likes of Bette Davis Joan Crawford etc. I know what I'm talking about i.e. screen charisma AND great acting skills. Taro Yamamoto as Noda was another character played very well. For some reason he reminded me of Doug Hutchison's character Percy from The Green Mile. It annoyed me I'd seen him before but couldn't recall where so I had to look him up. He was the card cheater in Kaiji and one of the older kids on Battle Royale.Back to the point. My Way  Epic movie. I loved it.".

Great acting AWESOME war sequences stirring music and incredible scope all make 'My Way' one of the best war movies I've ever seen. Ever. Particularly since the budget for the entire movie was under 30 millions. While watching 'My Way' I often thought of the budget as massive since ALL of the battles in the movie are epic in scale and very intense. I was surprised to find out how small the budge was Hollywood good take a few pointers.There are two reasons I don't give this flick a 10 out of 10. A few cheesy lines are scattered throughout the film. The dialogue in the movie isn't bad but there are a few lines characters say that are just so dripping with patriotic motoisms that it detracts from the movie's awesomeness.Another thing is I felt the director spent a lot of time on all the other battles but the Normandy invasion wasn't given much effort to authenticity and more effort was put on effects. You see the entire invasion of the beach within a 10 minute span not how it happened.Other than that phenomenal flick!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Was anxious to see a bigbudget Korean take on WWII and overall came away impressed ... despite the shortcomings and annoyances. My history with Korean films have been limited to small intimate stories told with quiet manner and frenetic action flicks with substandard stunt work. Director and cowriter Jekyu Kang attempts to combine an intimate story of two young men with an epic war film with a record body count and excruciatingly frequent number of cutsedits.The movie starts off by showing us how the lives of two boys first intersect. Junshik Kim by Donggun Jong is a farmer's son whose dad works on the estate of Tatsuo Hasegawa's Jo Odagiri grandfather. A wide class difference separates the boys but their love of running generates a severe feud ... a rivalry that won't die easily. All of this takes place in Japanoccupied Korea and it's clear early on that the filmmaker sets out to defend all Korean actions.Inspired by a real life 1944 photo that shows a Korean soldier being captured while wearing a Nazi uniform the backstory here is as strange and complex as any you have seen ... unfortunately it is handled with the manipulative touch of a sledge hammer. As their marathonrunning rivalry reaches a crescendo both boys are drawn into the Japanese Army albeit via substantially different routes. Tatsuo is an officer while Junshik is an enslaved line soldier. Their bitter rivalry does not stop for a little thing like WWII and it leads to many moments of near insanity.What really is impressive about the film is the three main battle scenes especially the storming of Normandy Beach. If you have seen Saving Private Ryan then you know the model ... however this one takes it even further. It is intense loud and brutal. The question of whether the rivalry can survive capture by Russians and then Nazi's or whether survival instincts take over is really the heart of the story.As terrific as the battle scenes are it is impossible not to mention the hyperediting that lasts most of the film's 142 minutes. It is hard on the senses and makes the action difficult to follow ... which is a shame for a film that offers so much realism in war scenes. Still it's not an easy film to watch and we care enough about the two characters to put up with the eyeball attack we get in most scenes.".

We were immediately absorbed in the story. Sometimes the words were of no consequence because the acting and cinematography are so outstanding. Great great story about how the group of Korenas were forced to fight for Japan. It put so much history into a two hour movie and you didn't have that foreign film feel at all. It was well told and directed. I have such great respect for the people of that period. This movie should be shown in mainstream theaters in the U.S!! I'm going to buy it!".

That could be for or against KoreaJapanChinaRussiaGermany and America. I know this was rationalized various ways along the way but i just never was comfortable with it. I also did not find it credible that anyone would turn POW's into armed fighters nearly so easily or that they could forgive heinous things done to them so easily. That part was hard to swallow.Ultimately it was a war fantasy for people who like war movies.".

That could be for or against KoreaJapanChinaRussiaGermany and America. I know this was rationalized various ways along the way but i just never was comfortable with it. I also did not find it credible that anyone would turn POW's into armed fighters nearly so easily or that they could forgive heinous things done to them so easily. That part was hard to swallow.Ultimately it was a war fantasy for people who like war movies.";

I am not sure if the characters really ever liked each other so i am unsure why Junshik Kim attempted to save Tatsuo's life in scenes through the film. I feel a lot of the story may have landed on the editing floor and thats a shame as the story seemed to have sections missing. I will say on the whole this was an excellent movie however.

	schema:reviewBody "Rashmon was about the multiple framings of the story.Chungking Express is about how two different stories or glimpses of stories can share the same emotional and physical space.Both were incredibly important films that changed cinema and necessarily how we dream and follow a story.This film is somewhere in between those two and it extends its hybrid condition as a story framer to the territory of Woody Allen's dialogs. Allen himself a master of narrative frames has his how different set of quirks and obsessions superficially expressed in his incredible dialogs. That is borrowed by this screenwriter also the director.The outer frame is us watching a number of photographs documenting two friends meeting in a mountain something we never actually see and so emphasizes the artificial nature of the device we're seeing someone telling the story of 2 people meeting. In that meeting those two take turns to tell the other bits of stories that happened to them in previous months. So we are watching the meeting of 2 friends who remember several events. 3 frames. Within each story that we are told there are some other minor frames. One character is a filmmaker the other one a poet. In one of the episodes there is a performance framed and for a few moments we are not allowed to see it's a performance. This is a very tight structure very competent writing. But the real fun of this is the interior of this framed world.All the episodes take place in the same small village. Places are very important. So there are places we get to see repeated over and over again with different bits of story taking place the restaurant attended by the 3 men and 2 of the women. The hotel where every assumed sex happens. The new unfurnished apartment. The coffee with a view over the harbor and the harbor itself. Everyone of these spaces receives a part of the story different moments different characters different pieces of the puzzle. There is a sense of interlaced lives which we see by glimpses by small bits told from 2 points of view of 2 people who are protagonists of their own stories. We understand that they pass at each other those stories are one and the same but in the end they hardly touch each other.Food is an important element. Food is central to every cultural idiosyncrasy in the world Korea is not the exception and it is really sensitive how korean specificities in the relation with food are brought to the center of this mosaic. Count the scenes that develop around meals.The last important element is the orange hat given by the film director to his mother who than gives it to another male character whom she's fond of and who has a relationship with one of the women who later ends up involved with the film director. That woman ultimately understands the indirect relation between the two men while the director tries to take her to his mom's restaurant where she had already been with the other man. That's this kind of circular relations crossed lives that we encounter throughout this film. The hat has the same importance here as the teddy bear had in Chungking Express.What put me out of this film was oddly something that usually never fails in korean movies the pure qualities of the images and various aspects of the miseenscne. This has the cheap look of a video lowbudget production there are several aspects of light and shape that would certainly have benefited the sensitive relation the writer establishes with the spaces. Chris Doyle understands this we don't have that here. And the framing of every scene does not remotely match the clever multiple framings in the story. That's really bad this film might have a power that we only sense as it is.My opinion 45httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

The final result is a lighthearted refreshing and very entertaining movie with a nice camera work and interesting settings.The narrative is a bit tricky now and then and probably it is a good idea to see this film at least twice to untie some secondary knots even though the story gets clear enough from the first viewing.All in all a nice movie that certainly deserves to be watched.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hahaha is very similar to the only other film of the director's I've seen The Day He Arrives. The editing is sparse the takes long but full of life and the performances spectacular. The acting is so fluent and natural that all the relationships in the film seem real and for a film based purely on human emotion and relationship  another similarity with Arrives  that's very hard to achieve. For the filmmakers in South Korea however this comes ever so naturally to them. Sangsoo Hong and Kiduk Kim are both exquisite at this and while this is only the second film of Hong's I've seen I think it's safe for me to put them both on the same pedestal  bear in mind I've seen 11 of Kim's films. Like Arrives there is narration but this time it's more frequent and in similarly unique fashion there are two narrators. One would think that having two narrators wouldn't work but their narration is merely a conversation between the two that is spliced in at the end of pivotal scenes and spoken over a still photograph of the two characters speaking. The two friends tell each other their stories and what makes it special is that various characters intertwine without either friend realizing. Again like Arrives there is repetition of places and faces  the characters intertwining with each other is another example of the repetition  this undoubtedly helps the viewer to get used to the visuals which are plain but as I mentioned before full of life. The characters' emotions are laid out flat on the table and we see each and every one of them go through just about each and every emotion which is a feat in itself and just showcases the excellent acting on display. The dialogue like the acting flows brilliantly and the cinematography again like Arrives is perfect  never static never frantic and full of Hong's trademark zoom technique. At first I was irritated by this technique but after seeing it used in both of his films I'm used to it  it helps the viewer focus on what we should be focusing on in the scenes where it is used. The structure is very unlinear and I'm a huge fan of films that use such a structure and Hahaha uses it to it's advantage. The title is very interesting too the characters laugh and cry but overall they are generally happy laughing and joking with each other but in all honesty the film could've easily been called the crying equivalent. Hahaha is another great film from Sangsoo Hong and I can only expect his films to get better.httpdestroyallcinema.wordpress.com".

The story builds the mystery developing four characters and there is a subtle insinuation at least in the Western mind that Sohee is lesbian Jinsung is her passive love and the complex Haeju worships Sohee forming a never clear triangle of love. In the end I liked this refreshing horror movie that slightly recalls the concepts of Wishmaster make a wish but to the stairs Carrie with the bad treatment spent by the schoolmates and Pet Sematary with the return of Sohee from the world of the dead but in a totally different environment and situation.

But Jinsung's nightmare merely begins..secretly Haeju had a fixated heroworship for Kim sohee and takes to the 29 steps in request that the one she deeply cared for would return. In true monkey's paw fashion it's quite possible Kim sohee just might answer that request with both Jinsung and Haeju becoming haunted by her spirit.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was a little frustrating in that it's very very well done in terms of writing acting production design and cinematography but is paced far too slow to manage any real fright factor as a horrorghost story.I'm well aware that Asian horror films tend to run at a much slower pace than American horror as a general rule but in this case that like watching paint dry pace leaves what could have been a good maybe even classic film as just a welldone suspense drama with some light supernatural overtones. With an acceleration in pacing at roughly midway through the film and the addition  there was a multitude of opportunities for it  of significantly more supernatural content this would have been a ripsnorter of a horror film that could have made some real tracks in the American market both financially and critically.Even though as a guy it takes an effort to warm up to the setting of a girls' ballet school the story is very strong  even excellent  and makes the film worthwhile independently of the horrorsupernatural factor as a study of jealousy vs. selfconfidence subterfuge vs. honest effort and irrationality vs. reason.The one weakness I had a little trouble with was the mentallyhandicapped student HaeJu who plays a pivotal role in the story  the fact that she could be present at the school at all. The idea of of a mentally handicapped student being enrolled in an elite and highlycompetitive ballet school isn't plausible unless academic admissions customs in Korea are significantly different than in America. Add to that the fact that she's quite overweight for a ballet student to the point where again it's not plausible that she'd be accepted into such a school. Those implausibility factors are puzzling in that they're unnecessary. HaeJu would have been more believable and a stronger character if she had been not mentally handicapped but simply unpopular nerdy neurotic or a combination of these then had become progressively messedup mentally as the tragic events and malicious treatment by her peers began to weigh on her. There's some additional confusion that comes into play in the fact that HaeJu's character sheds then regains weight fairly rapidly a couple of times as well as changes her hair color  again as intentional parts of the story  which when combined with scenes in dim lighting make it a little confusing at times to distinguish her from other students.Anyway implausibilities aside HaeJu makes the innocent wish for the dead girl she admired SoHee to be returned to her and the way the writers make that role play out is masterful You're not really sure  and the film leaves it intentionally ambiguous  whether HaeJu has just completely flipped out and thinks she's SoHee or whether the spirit of SoHee has actually merged with HaeJu using her as her malevolent tool. In the hands of a lesser director that ambiguity would have introduced a mess of confusion to the plot but in this case it not only avoids that trap but adds a nice depth of complexity both to the two characters and to the story as a whole.It's perhaps unfair or applesandoranges illogical to compare Wishing Stairs to an Americanstyle supernatural thriller like Sixth Sense Stir of Echoes or The Shining but you can't escape the feeling while watching it that it would have vastly benefited from a marked intensification of pacing and supernatural content as the film progressed. There are some very welldone scenes like where JinSung finally is confronted by SoHee's ghost in her dorm room then in her dorm room closet that nevertheless fall a little flat  they play out so slowly that the audience has ample time not only to guess what's likely to happen next but to run through memories of similar scenes from other films and guess at a number of possible outcomes. If the idea is to scare the wits out of people the scares should be paced rapidly and artfully enough to where the audience has no time to anticipate them much less to mull over other possibilities. Because nearly all of the horror aspect of the film is so muted by the pacing Wishing Stairs could be more accurately classified as a suspense drama with supernatural overtones rather than an outandout horror film.Bottom Line On balance Wishing Stairs is a wellmade movie that's definitely worth the trip but disappointing for fans of solid squirminyourseat fright fests.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yun Jaeyeon the first woman to direct a movie of the Yeogo Goedam series faced a big challenge when making Wishing Stairs. It was Yun's debut and the two leading actresses Song Jihyo and Park Hanbyeol were newcomers at that time as well. Also Yun had to meet high expectations because Wishing Stair's predecessors Whispering Corridors and Memento Mori had been very successful.Just like all of the Yeogo Goedam movies Wishing Stairs has a closed story of its own but plays with the same themes. Again it takes place at a girls' school this time a school of arts. There the main characters Yun Jinseong Song and Kim Sohee Park are studying ballet. They are close friends but their friendship gets challenged when they both enter a contest for a place to study at a Russian ballet faculty. Yun Jinseong envies her more talented friend. She works hard but just gets scolded by the teacher whereas Kim Sohee impresses everybody with her effortless skill she looks like the sure winner of the contest. Yun's jealousy grows till the point that she even seeks supernatural help Campus legend has it that there is a stair case on the campus which grants a wish when you reach its last step. But as Yun climbs the stairs the viewer already knows that this is a bad idea. For folklore tells that wishes granted by a supernatural force often come with undesirable side effects and Wishing Stairs confirms this.Like the previous Yeogo Goedam films Wishing Stairs isn't a real horror movie. The supernatural serves as a vehicle to accelerate a worldly tragedy. So the movie is less about horror and more about people feeling trapped because they are unable to become the persons they want to be. This idea is stressed by the third main character Eom. Eom is an overweight outsider and if the other students notice her at all it's usually just to make fun of her. She tries to escape her misery by idolizing Kim Sohee dreaming of being her friend or perhaps even being her.However it is also Eom Jo An where direction wasn't flawless. Unlike her character Jo happens to be pretty and slim so she was put in a fatsuit. The problem with that approach is that viewers always notice fatsuits no matter how well they are made. This might not be a problem in comedies but in this drama it is a distraction. Also Jo's performance is sometimes at the border of slapstick which doesn't do her tragic character justice.Another distraction was the use of an incoherent flashback. It seems an obligation for Yeogo Goedam movies to employ flashbacks to reveal dark secrets of the past so Wishing Stairs has one flashback as well. Without spoiling too much it's about an act of sabotage. However that small part of the plot doesn't roll out plausibly. It causes more confusion than insight and should have been deleted entirely.But the strengths of Wishing Stairs outweigh its flaws. The acting of Song and Park is great. The movie has a high production value. And like its predecessors it has a certain charm and unique mix of drama and horror to it. It is a tragedy of universal nature so viewers can relate to it even if they don't happen to be Korean teenage girls as is the case with this old bloke. Wishing Stairs is a worthy entry in the series which makes director Yun's debut a real accomplishment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wishing Stair is the 3rd movie of the Whispering Corridor series which has 5 movies Whispering Corridor Memento Mori Wishing Stair Voice and A Blood Pledge. I have now seen the 5 movies and I must say this one is my favourite. The worst being A Blood Pledge and by far.Plot  Wishing Stair is the story of three young women confronted by the twisted power of the fox stair. Fox spirits are well known in Asian cultures for being either way good or evil in their actions. Those 3 women will cross the easy path of wishing stair realizing finnally that whatever your wish it won't go as you expected.SooHee is a kind intelligent and skilled person who seems have success in whatever she does. But behind her shiny appearance she's unsecure and rely almost obssesivly on her friend JinSung. Beside her love for ballet the thing she loves the most is her friend JinSung. She wants to be forever with her.JinSung is the contrary she must work hard in anything she does. She loves ballet but she's jealous of her friend SooHee that is too kind with her. JinSung is jealous because her friend is close to her parents has a lot of money and is a shame that SooHee is always on the giving side. Her own words Kim SooHee I really hate you. You make me feel miserable.. JiSUng love her friend but she wants to win at least once.HaeJu is an outcast being constantly bullied for being fat. The only person who seems to be nice with her is SooHee. For that reason she idolize her. The only thing she wants is to have a friend. All those secret desire will turn into a nightmare for each of them.My commentary  This movie has really a great script that is base of the life of Asian students where people are pushed to confrontation by the society. You must be the best in anything always. SooHee is pushed by her parents to succeed in anything. She must take Ballet class because of her mother. She likes it but it wasn't really her choice. Did you notice two huge posters with SooHee's pictures? That meant she was the 1 student in school for at least 2 semester. SooHee was somewhat popular at school but only on the shallow side. Her only true friend was JinSung and it was her own choice. Her love for JinSung was too strong too obsessive. Being with her friend forever makes me think that she felt more then just friendship. She was a little bossy with JinSung making her do things she don't necessary wants to do. But she showered her with gifts expecting nothing more then to be with her.I totally understand how JinSung felt. JinSung really saw SooHee as her best friend. But SooHee was too kind with her and that bothered her. She hates to be always the one to received and the rivalry as a ballerina didn't help. She didn't meant to hurt SooHee but I see it as the work from the fox spirit. It makes do thing you didn't wanted. The only way for JinSung to go legitly to the competition was to remove SooHee from the competition But her wish was granted later when she spoiler pushed SooHee down the stair. I'm not really sure what happens to SooHee. Did she commit suicide believe she had lost the only thing she cared about ? Was she killed by the fox spirit so he could grant her wish ? Anyway I'm sure that JinSung met SooHee's ghost after her death in her room because of the strong emotions.Then the poor HaeJu wished that SooHee came back to her. But SooHee's ghost is not thinking rationally as humans do. Led by the strong feelings to JinSung she takes possession of HaeJu's body. But JinSung do not believe her. And that leaded her to her death. I don't know if SooHee's plan has always been to kill JinSung to be forever with her.I liked the acting the three main actresses where great. Just unlucky that the movie was the same year as A tale of two sisters with the awesome acting from Lim SooJung. Pak HanByeol was believable in her character. Song JiHyo too. And Jo An did a nice performance as mimicking HanByeol's SooHee. Excep the part where she really seems crazy. But that remind me of the scene in The Shining where Jack Nickleson break the door with an axe. It was that kind of crazyness that Jo An showed in her eyes. It might be exaggerated but it's one of my favorite scene in the movie. Oh and Pak HanByeol is really really pretty ".

You make me feel miserable.. JiSUng love her friend but she wants to win at least once.HaeJu is an outcast being constantly bullied for being fat. The only person who seems to be nice with her is SooHee. For that reason she idolize her. The only thing she wants is to have a friend. All those secret desire will turn into a nightmare for each of them.My commentary  This movie has really a great script that is base of the life of Asian students where people are pushed to confrontation by the society. You must be the best in anything always. SooHee is pushed by her parents to succeed in anything. She must take Ballet class because of her mother. She likes it but it wasn't really her choice. Did you notice two huge posters with SooHee's pictures? That meant she was the 1 student in school for at least 2 semester. SooHee was somewhat popular at school but only on the shallow side. Her only true friend was JinSung and it was her own choice. Her love for JinSung was too strong too obsessive. Being with her friend forever makes me think that she felt more then just friendship. She was a little bossy with JinSung making her do things she don't necessary wants to do. But she showered her with gifts expecting nothing more then to be with her.I totally understand how JinSung felt. JinSung really saw SooHee as her best friend. But SooHee was too kind with her and that bothered her. She hates to be always the one to received and the rivalry as a ballerina didn't help. She didn't meant to hurt SooHee but I see it as the work from the fox spirit. It makes do thing you didn't wanted. The only way for JinSung to go legitly to the competition was to remove SooHee from the competition But her wish was granted later when she spoiler pushed SooHee down the stair. I'm not really sure what happens to SooHee. Did she commit suicide believe she had lost the only thing she cared about ? Was she killed by the fox spirit so he could grant her wish ? Anyway I'm sure that JinSung met SooHee's ghost after her death in her room because of the strong emotions.Then the poor HaeJu wished that SooHee came back to her. But SooHee's ghost is not thinking rationally as humans do. Led by the strong feelings to JinSung she takes possession of HaeJu's body. But JinSung do not believe her. And that leaded her to her death. I don't know if SooHee's plan has always been to kill JinSung to be forever with her.I liked the acting the three main actresses where great. Just unlucky that the movie was the same year as A tale of two sisters with the awesome acting from Lim SooJung. Pak HanByeol was believable in her character. Song JiHyo too. And Jo An did a nice performance as mimicking HanByeol's SooHee. Excep the part where she really seems crazy. But that remind me of the scene in The Shining where Jack Nickleson break the door with an axe. It was that kind of crazyness that Jo An showed in her eyes. It might be exaggerated but it's one of my favorite scene in the movie. Oh and Pak HanByeol is really really pretty ";

The plot for this movie is that there are two girls who fight for the first place in a ballet competition. One of the girls pushed the other down the stairs and the girl felt betrayed sad and committed suicide. This movie deals with a friendship triangle between three girls. The idea for this movie was just great the storyline is wonderful. The beginning was slow paced. Frightening scenes only come on the second half of the movie. There was time to provide enough character development between the characters for the first half of the movie. This movie is really entertaining and the idea of using the wishing stairs was just fantastic. This movie showed true friendship and betrayal among students. The idea used in this movie was so much better than whispering corridors which the idea was about a teacher who locked her student in the art room because of her superstition. This movie really shows what happens between friends in real life. This movie deals a little bit about Karma as well. I loved the ending of this movie.The idea that makes use of this stairs that would grant your wish was well done. The ending was really scary. The scene which showed So Hee climbing in from the window was terrifying and that scary scene was just very creatively made. However this movie gets a little complicating towards the end and requires one to think what is happening. Other than that this movie is highly recommended. If you like this type of movies that deals with wishes try out bedazzled. Score 8.510Wonderfully made".

This one is completely different in scope from MEMENTO MORI featuring a traditional Asian female ghost white face long dark hair popping up in all manner of unlikely situations. One of the main draws for me is that this film's set in a special art school where the students are all involved in artistic pursuits sculpture music and most predominantly ballet.Once again a love story takes centre stage and before long tragedy takes over. The central conceit in this film is the titular flight of stone steps which sometimes grants those who climb it their wish you can guess the results. The spectral shenanigans that ensue are highly clichd and not particularly shuddersome although there are a few choice moments to be found here and there for genre connoisseurs. The character of the overweight student who comes to rely on the stairs to fulfil her wishes is extremely creepy and An Jo does well in a difficult role.

	schema:reviewBody "After a tragic accident a young ballerina and her friends at an exclusive boarding school are tormented by a malicious spirit when one of the students discovers a legendary wishgranting staircase on campus.When this one really wanted to there was some good stuff here. One of the biggest points here is that the central premise to this is rather nice and appears to go much deeper than it seems at first glance. It appears to be a set of events unleashed by a wish gone wrong but the difference is the inclusion of the titular stairs acting as a catalyst rather than just having the ghost appear otherwise. It works in a nice explanatory backstory as well that gives it another distinctive flavor by mixing in the mythological with the rational and makes it effective. There's also some really nice haunting scenes mainly during the middle segments with the few short ghostly hauntings which are great at building suspense which include the one where real eyes appear in a clay model at art class or the ghost visits one in the bathroom by constantly changing which mirror they're shown in. That is thankfully madeup for with a longer later sequence that starts off nicely with a creepy bloody shower scene before showing the dorm losing lights amidst a sea of ghostly flashes twirling around while performing a ballet routine in perhaps the best sequence in the film. The main sequence where it goes after the danceclass members in the dorm is quite welldone as well and rather creepy as the atmosphere during most of these scenes makes this quite enjoyable and highly entertaining. Along with being another entry in the Asian ghost genre where this features the utterly creepy fully covered face and pale features and some rather impressive kills these here are what make the film enjoyable although there was a couple points about this one that managed to hold it down. Frankly the biggest problem with this one is the fact that there's so many different subplots going on that it really makes the film quite long and dull feeling at times due to the excessive amount of time spent on the various different subplots that aren't all that great. It's really not all that exciting to showcase the lesbian vibe here between the two leads as it's nothing more than a tease and the scenes featuring them aren't really all that interesting and the film's numerous scenes of them in dance class or at competitions aren't even close to be interesting or exciting which just drags the beginning of this out to the point that it's irritating waiting for it to get going and actually do something during these times as it doesn't really have much else going for it. Another big plot that doesn't do much is the storyline with the slightly overweight member as this is the definition of a go nowhere plot since it doesn't factor into the film's outcome at all is so obvious where it's heading the shock doesn't register and eats up valuable time during the period of time that's supposedly building up to the finale which could've been much better. The last flaw to this one is that the ending here is a little confusing as the encounter in the dance hall and resulting chase are built around one person while the revelation out at the stairs proves otherwise making it a little confusing. These here are what hold it down.Rated R Graphic Violence and Language.".

	schema:reviewBody "The third part of the loosely bound Yeogo goedam series is a mixture of the first and the second movie. It takes some suspense and horror elements from the first and best part of the series and the dramatic and romantic fragments of the much weaker second movie. What eventually comes out is a mostly dark well played and entertaining movie that still lacks of something to ultimately convince. I would say that I missed some really haunting frightening or intense scenes. I would also say that the third part adds nothing new to the series. Another negative point is that the end is not much surprising and I was expecting something deeper or darker on both an emotional and a suspenseful level.The main idea of this third strike is quite great. A legend goes that if you climb the twenty eight steps leading up to the women's art school dormitory where this movie takes place counting each step aloud and find a twenty ninth a spirit will appear and grant you a wish. Now you can imagine how school girls might abuse of this legend and you have a big scenario of jealousy mobbing treachery broken friendships and love stories in mind. Sadly the movie only scratches the surface of it and basically focuses on three or four personalities. The dynamics between these characters are only of a slight interest as there is only a strong connection between the two main actresses the one that created evil and the one that lived the evil. This relation is not enough to carry this movie on and make it be more than just an enjoyable and entertaining movie. It's a good movie to be watched once but I wouldn't give it another try as it didn't really impress touch or inspire me. I really feel that this movie should have gone further with its intriguing initial idea. This movie could have been more complex more human and more creepy and should have hit harder. The director and producers really missed a good occasion to push this movie on the same level as the popular first flick but the ultimately failed. The third strike is allover still slightly better than the second one that had gone nowhere. But the third part is even less memorable in its uniqueness as the previous one at some points and overall of an average quality. This movie is entertaining and has a couple of enjoyable drama suspense and romance moments but the part don't glue and fit together like a puzzle and you can feel many ups and downs of quality throughout the whole movie.I would only suggest watching this movie to the collectors and true fans of the series anybody else might be alright just watching the first flick. Nevertheless I am heading out for the fourth part that got some good critics very soon in the hope that this one equals the first part.".

Other than the setting of the film an allgirl's school in Korea it has very little to do with the other films in the series. In this one there is a staircase on the school grounds that the students believe is magical. The staircase has 28 steps. When you reach the top if a 29th step appears it will grant your wish. When one of the girls is killed in a fall another of the girls uses the magical staircase to wish her friend back to life. But she gets more than she bargained for.As with the other films in the series Wishing Stairs is very well made. The directors of this film are able to get some very nice performances out of the mostly unknown and unexperienced cast. Technically the film is very sound with some nice cinematography as the highlight. The special effects are well done and help create some very creepy moments. Overall it's a nice installment to the series.But I haven't rated Wishing Stairs as high as I did the previous two films. Why? It's a little too formalistic and unoriginal. One of the elements that made Wishing Corridors and Memento Mori memorable is the subtle use of horror. In contrast the horror is more obvious in Wishing Stairs. At times it seems like one set piece after the next with nothing of substance pushing the plot along. As for unoriginal if you've seen Ringu you've seen one of the big moments in this movie. Wishing Stairs has a very pale girl with long black hair crawling in jerky motions through a window. Sound familiar?".

Each feature different characters and different locations though the setting is always at a school and features a similar sort of premise. It is obvious that this movie tried to be like the second entry out of the series using a similar sort of build up and approach to the story but it's definitely not as good or effective with it.Problem is that the movie just never becomes really that interesting to watch. It really isn't a very involving movie which is due to its lacking characters and directing approach by Jaeyeon Yun.The movie is obviously deliberately picking a slow approach to build up its tension. It however feels far too stretched out which again is really due to the fact that the movie never really becomes an interesting or involving one. The long shots of people staring got old and annoying pretty fast especially when nothing is really happening in the movie. It takes an hour or so to finally pick up some pace and for the movie to become a real horror movie. Far too late and it besides feels too much out of tone with the overall atmosphere and approach of the first hour of the movie. In that regard this movie is also being a lot like the first movie out of its long running series.So yes besides not being that interesting to watch the movie is also really a lackluster. Lovers of Asian horror cinema can also definitely pass on this movie. There really is not all that much to enjoy for the fans of horror. No tension no scares no good mystery. No this movie is definitely a failed attempt to try to recreate the success formula of the second movie.The story itself features too many sidetracks that don't really get developed properly enough. Seems to me that the writer was having some difficulties coming up with a story for a full length movie and therefore came up with all kinds of thin plot lines and characters that really don't add any real depth and surely don't make the movie any more interesting to follow. It's often a bad sign when a movie has lots of writers involved but in this case it probably wouldn't had harmed the script if it had received some help from some more and other writers or some rewrites by better and more experienced people.It really isn't a very well made movie.It never finds the right approach and pace for its story and also never becomes effective with its build up and pay off. It's all lacking a true horror film director's touch.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is the third in the girl's high school ghost stories film series from Corea following Whispering Corridors and Memento Mori. All the films share two common traits the setting is an all girl's school and there is some sort of supernatural terror visiting the girls but as far as I can tell the stories each tries to tell are different.Wishing Stairs is built around the concept of a set of stairs leading to a dormitory that can grant a student's wishes should they desire it enough. Of course since this is a horror movie the stairs do grant the wish but not exactly in the way that the wishing students expect. I do like the themes of competition and friendship present in this film but I think the whole breaks down especially in the weak third act.I suppose I should start with some of the problemsalthough the actress does a decent job with the role the fat girl in the story is drawn a little too offkilter for my taste. I would've rather had her be either a little kooky or just fat and have to deal with just one of the problems but when compounded the character comes across as an exaggeration a caricature rather than a well developed character and the fat suit being so obvious doesn't help. The themes of competition and how it affects friendship are actually really strong and the story had a lot of potential but again the third act blows it all away.As the competition between two close friends boils to a head one of them makes a wish that they will soon regret. Some of the best points of this film show how much backstabbing can go on in such an environment and how breakout stars are often hated. It's actually a tragic story that hits a real high point in the middle of the film. Unfortunately guilt isn't given enough time to be explored from then on and the drama between the students starts to take a back seat to the spooky goingson. And the fat kid gets crazier.Towards the end of the film humongous leaps in logic take place and the story seems to progress arbitrarily without much sense or reason. I think what frustrated me most though was that the story had real potential to become an interesting exploration of delusion and the lengths we would go to get everything we want via the main character and even closer to the end I was still hoping that all the spooky goingson were the result of a guilty conscience. You could still read it that way but I feel like this film is just way too attached to generic conventions to really break out like that.Firsttime director and leads do a decent enough job given the material. The film has high technical proficiency so it won't be ugly to look at. It's just that the story was such a let down from the potential that it had. Ultimately the film is had a lot of potential and the first twothirds of the film are pretty decent. The weak third act breaks down the potential making this just another ghost story. It's okayif you love the subgenre you might enjoy this for what it is but it's sort of a let down considering the other films in the series. 610.".

I have asked myself this question while watching it for the Nth time and while asking myself why most Hollywood 'comedies' made today are not funny at all. I believe that the answer is that the basis of all comedy is to make fun of someone. Here fun is made of sexual stereotypes of the British of the French and most of all of the Germans Nazis in this case. Hollywood has become so politicallycorrect that it now only dares make fun of a WASP male in a business suit and of no one else. Take the case of 'The Birdcage' a remake of the French comedy 'La cage aux folles' made some 20 years earlier. Being bilingual I can testify that the original version is immensely more funny than the Hollywood remake. That is because the Hollywood beancounters who like to pass themselves off as artistic decisionmakers toned down most of the fun that had been made of homosexuals in the original movie. Ask Shakespeare or Moliere the play or movie will be funny only if it pokes cruel fun at someone provided it is not at you. Sorry for the politicallyincorrect opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "In France but also in the neighboring countries like Belgium where yours truly lives La Grande Vadrouille is more than just a cinematic classic It's a cultural monument and even national heritage! I certainly don't intend to sound pretentious but I doubt if such a movie could ever exist in the United States. Why? Because this film is patriotic and satirical at the same time the script is chockfull of clichs and stereotypes whilst the humor doesn't necessarily rely on clichs and stereotypes and although the subject matter deals with the depressing events of World War II  forever one of the darkest pages in the world's history  the tone of the film remains courteous and innocent at all times. The Nazis in this film are naturally the bad guys but for once they aren't depicted as inhuman monsters which is probably the main reason why La Grande Vadrouille is also enormously successful in Germany! And last but not least the script respects the language differences per country! The French simply speak French  or English with extremely heavy accents  while the English speak English and the Germans speak German! I don't see that happening in Hollywood to be honest. The film received the funny but rather hokey sounding English title Don't Look Now We're being shot at but actually La Grande Vadrouille simply means something like The Big Stroll or The Giant Walk. As you can derive from the above paragraph the film takes place in during the WWII Nazi occupation of France. The story already starts out hilariously when the pilot of a British bomber plane asks his fellow passengers what their location is. They claim the plain is more or less above Calais but when the clouds clear up they are surprised to see the Eiffel Tower directly beneath them. The plane is shot down by German ground troops and each of the three British soldiers wanders off towards a different part of Paris with their parachutes. The British pilots receive help from two typical yet entirely opposite French citizens namely the simple but hard working painter Augustin Bouvet and the snobbish orchestra leader Stanislas Lefort. Both men along with the help of various other French citizens take several risks in order to reunite the British team which of course makes them enemies of the Third Reich as well. The whole group has to flee towards the South of France but naturally the journey is full of obstacles and dangers. Many and I do mean MANY sequences in La Grande Vadrouille have become immortal cinematic highlights over the years and it's almost impossible to list them. The mixup with the room numbers in the hotel for example is very famous and still as incredibly funny by today's standards as it must have been back in 1966. Other unforgettable highlights include the rendezvous in the Turkish bath house and the pumpkin counterattack. In fact every single interaction between the legendary French actorscomedians Bourvil and Louis de Funs qualifies as classic comedy cinema. Both geniuses where at the absolute heights of their careers at this point but Bourvil sadly passed away far too young a couple of years later at age 53. Louis de Funs continued to make several more French comedy classics until his death in the early 1980s including the sequels in the successful Les Gendarmes de SaintTropez franchise Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob and La Soupe aux Choux. De Funs truly was without any exaggeration one of the funniest people who ever lived. His looks and his energetic facial expressions were his main trademarks. He wasn't very tall and his almost naturally cantankerous apparition in combination with his distinct voice and habit of talking really fast made him the ideal hotheadcharacter. La Grande Vadrouille is a brilliant film with a brilliant cast and a brilliant director as well as brilliant music courtesy of Georges Auric and brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir. It's warmly recommended to all admirers of genuinely funny comedies and fundamental viewing for everyone living in Europe.".

	onyx:emotionText "In France but also in the neighboring countries like Belgium where yours truly lives La Grande Vadrouille is more than just a cinematic classic It's a cultural monument and even national heritage! I certainly don't intend to sound pretentious but I doubt if such a movie could ever exist in the United States. Why? Because this film is patriotic and satirical at the same time the script is chockfull of clichs and stereotypes whilst the humor doesn't necessarily rely on clichs and stereotypes and although the subject matter deals with the depressing events of World War II  forever one of the darkest pages in the world's history  the tone of the film remains courteous and innocent at all times. The Nazis in this film are naturally the bad guys but for once they aren't depicted as inhuman monsters which is probably the main reason why La Grande Vadrouille is also enormously successful in Germany! And last but not least the script respects the language differences per country! The French simply speak French  or English with extremely heavy accents  while the English speak English and the Germans speak German! I don't see that happening in Hollywood to be honest. The film received the funny but rather hokey sounding English title Don't Look Now We're being shot at but actually La Grande Vadrouille simply means something like The Big Stroll or The Giant Walk. As you can derive from the above paragraph the film takes place in during the WWII Nazi occupation of France. The story already starts out hilariously when the pilot of a British bomber plane asks his fellow passengers what their location is. They claim the plain is more or less above Calais but when the clouds clear up they are surprised to see the Eiffel Tower directly beneath them. The plane is shot down by German ground troops and each of the three British soldiers wanders off towards a different part of Paris with their parachutes. The British pilots receive help from two typical yet entirely opposite French citizens namely the simple but hard working painter Augustin Bouvet and the snobbish orchestra leader Stanislas Lefort. Both men along with the help of various other French citizens take several risks in order to reunite the British team which of course makes them enemies of the Third Reich as well. The whole group has to flee towards the South of France but naturally the journey is full of obstacles and dangers. Many and I do mean MANY sequences in La Grande Vadrouille have become immortal cinematic highlights over the years and it's almost impossible to list them. The mixup with the room numbers in the hotel for example is very famous and still as incredibly funny by today's standards as it must have been back in 1966. Other unforgettable highlights include the rendezvous in the Turkish bath house and the pumpkin counterattack. In fact every single interaction between the legendary French actorscomedians Bourvil and Louis de Funs qualifies as classic comedy cinema. Both geniuses where at the absolute heights of their careers at this point but Bourvil sadly passed away far too young a couple of years later at age 53. Louis de Funs continued to make several more French comedy classics until his death in the early 1980s including the sequels in the successful Les Gendarmes de SaintTropez franchise Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob and La Soupe aux Choux. De Funs truly was without any exaggeration one of the funniest people who ever lived. His looks and his energetic facial expressions were his main trademarks. He wasn't very tall and his almost naturally cantankerous apparition in combination with his distinct voice and habit of talking really fast made him the ideal hotheadcharacter. La Grande Vadrouille is a brilliant film with a brilliant cast and a brilliant director as well as brilliant music courtesy of Georges Auric and brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir. It's warmly recommended to all admirers of genuinely funny comedies and fundamental viewing for everyone living in Europe.";

The hotel owner and a young woman pretend that Bourvil and De Funes are their husbands and give them a dressing down for being late for their chores. But the German General says that women should not wear the pants and he invites them to join his party. Bourvil and De Funes exhausted from their day long trek through the French countryside must join in a chair dance where all the German soldiers play horsie on their chairs in single file around the tables.

I would think that 20 years after being occupied by Germany it might not be something you would crack jokes about. Surely many citizens would still have awful memories of the time. And yet this film exists and was allegedly the highestgrossing film in France for a long long time.And you know what? It is pretty darn funny.

	schema:reviewBody "The undeniability of The Great Stroll as the greatest French comedy has somewhat been shaken by the passing of half a century and a few trivia facts. The film held the record of the highestgrossing French movie for fortytwo years before being dethroned by Welcome to the Chti's and Intouchables. And since humor is a very fluctuating element of human perception I suspect a larger portion of French population wouldn't call The Great Stroll the greatest French comedy of all time. But they couldn't be more wrong. Indeed The Great Stroll is to French Cinema what Some Like it Hot is to Hollywood kids might laugh at Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill their parents might miss the National Lampoon or Jim Carrey's movies and their grandparents some Lewis and Martin or Abbott and Costello films but Billy Wilder's classic is the one to reconcile all generations. That's The Great Stroll effect there's something just timeless about this film maybe because it is set in world war II a page of History that still fascinates the younger generation or because it reunites two immortal comedic icons directed by a man who had a flair for good comedy or just because it is one of these instances where you got the right cast with the right story and the right timing it just can't fail even if it tried to.And it sure didn't 17 million viewers is still an honorable score by today's standards especially at a time where French population was onefourth smaller and when there was no Internet not even TV publicity to create the buzz. But The Great Stroll was beyond these needs it was reliant on the popularity of two great comedians and only their talent ensured a positive wordofmouth that and the success of their previous pairing in The Sucker. No one knew how it was going to work their acting styles were as opposite as their body frames but they completed each other as if they've been a duo for years. The Sucker met with success although Bourvil and De Funs were seldom on the same scene but the test was conclusive and proved Oury that time had come for these two 'messieurs' to share the screen a little longer than that.The Great Stroll didn't miss that opportunity and as soon as the two men are put together it's the beginning of a great buddymovie through France in the midst of the German Occupation. But Oury isn't in a rush it takes almost half an hour before the two leads meet because the priority is to tell a story gags will flood naturally. So we have three English paratroopers escaping from German antiaircraft defense to find themselves flying over Paris the commander spotting a generous mustache orders everyone to leave the plane and meet in the Turkish bath their code is Tea for Two. The man lands on the famous Vincennes' Zoo the two others cross the paths of municipal painter Augustin Bouvet Bourvil and hottempered opera conductor Stanislas Lefort Louis de Funs. Despite their initial reluctance they help the British aviators and go to the rendezvous in the' hammam which leads to the first classic scene when both men whistle Tea for Two making eyes with the one big mustached man wondering what on earth is going on. Finally the historical encounter happens through a hilarious exchange of involuntary homoerotic subtext. Bourvil and De Funs stare at each other with a weird glee on their eyes and say  are you? you are. At that moment the story takes off driven by the eternal contrast between the bluecollar simpleton and the pedant educated man. De Funs is so odious and bossy that poor Bourvil can't help but obey such orders as giving his shoe his bike and his shoulders his awkward walking with tight shoes and his pathetic protests became the most defining traits of his 'lovable loser' character. The Great Stroll doesn't overstuff the film with gags but narrates a genuinely touching adventure of two Frenchmen who overcome their weaknesses and act with bravura and humanity. And what a lesson for today's advocates of political correctness that people who lived during the war much more Oury a Jewish director had no problem ridiculing the Nazis and even showing them playing musical chairs in one of the film's most defining sequences. Indeed this is a comedy that is not trying to make a political statement whatsoever it has no other intent than making you laugh. But as a way to acknowledge the gravity of the context there are two dramatic moments where each of the two men save one's life from a German patrol and gets a thank you. Drama isn't gratuitous as it allows the bond between the two men to grow into friendship. And on their own each one gives his personal little touch Bourvil is in love with the beautiful Marie Dubois and provides that bit of tenderness while De Funs' struggle with his wig or the snoring of an overweight Nazi officer provides the slapstick. The film works on many levels it has action tenderness screwball comedy and instinct. Indeed the most memorable sequences was adlibbed. Instead of falling on Bourvil's shoulders and then on the ground De Funs simply stays on the shoulders and lets Bourvil carry him. It is not just the most defining moment of the film but of French cinema the two giants writing a page of French cinema's history. And The Great Stroll is carried by the two performances as confidently as Bourvil carried De Funs' on his shoulders without letting him fall. Oury would write the Delusion of Grandeur with the two men in mind but Bourvil's passing in 1970 deprived French cinema from what could have been a great trilogy. We'd have to 'content' ourselves with The Great Stroll which is simply French comedy's finest hour.".

Taking distance and starting to allow ridicule replace at least in part hate and contempt for the German former enemies was not a completely new thing I can remember ChristianJaque's Babette Goes to War which preceded it with seven years. Yet in this story about three British airmen parachuted in occupied Paris and saved by a band of French civilians including a famous music conductor Louis de Funs a humble paintman Bourvil and a blueeyed blonde puppeteer Marie Dubois the enemies are still all bad and stupid. It will take a time for the 'good German' to show up in war movies and even more time for the cinematographic acknowledgment of the collaboration with the occupiers. Meantime all French are good guys. Or good girls. Or good nuns.The film enjoyed huge success it was actually from its release until 2008 the most successful French film of all times. I remember having seen it in the late 60s in Romania and I read about film fans from China for example enjoying it as a huge success after the end of the Cultural Revolution. To a large extent the success is due to the presence on screen of the two greatest comedy actors of the French cinema at that time  Louis de Funs and Bourvil. Both were huge stars and Grard Oury had brought them together on screen in a previous film and now wrote the scenario of La Grande Vadrouille especially for them. Most of the time they are together on screen and the comic qualities of the two enhance each other the chemistry between them is obvious and so is the pleasure of acting. Years have passed and I did not fall under the chair any longer laughs turned into smiles and nostalgia and I can also see the naivety of the script and the schematic story line  but it's certainly mostly me. The two are again together in my mind at least for the next 50 years.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start with a warning If you're looking to see this for Steven Seagal then rent it or borrow it do not buy it because you will be majorly disappointed. Seagal is on screen for maybe ten minutes if you include all of the shots of him on TV monitors. If you don't count the monitors its a couple of minutes less and its a not very good fight scene.The real star of the movie is Dongjun Lee who is a karate champion who lost in a rigged match which I think was against Seagal. The match occurred as his wifegirlfriend went into labor and gave birth to their daughter. The wifegirlfriend dies on the delivery table and the girl was put into an orphanage from which Lee retrieves her. Years pass and Lee becomes a cop. After he breaks heads while making a bust he is forced to retire from the force and turns to cage fighting to pay off his debts to the people who's heads he broke. He's such a good fighter yea right that the mob wants him to fight the world champion Steven Seagal. However in between all of that is a great deal of soap opera as the mother is found not to be dead and wants to get her little girl back or some such nonsense.Its awful.In between hitting the fast forward to get to something interesting and watching badly acted scenes at normal speed I sat there slack jawed at just how incredibly stupid this movie is. What kind of movie is it? Comedy? Family Drama? Its not really an action film. What is Seagal doing in this movie? If he did it for a paycheck he got all of the money. My guess is that this was suppose to be a family drama of some sort and somehow Seagal got roped in to doing a days shooting. The producers were happy because they now had a film that they could market as a Steven Seagal flick. Since there is no real release outside of Asia my guess is that anyone looking to release this saw it for what it was and dropped it. You will not be seeing this any time soon playing on American TV or any other TV for that matter.Avoid this one. Its just not worth it. Yes it has a few good moments hence a 2 out of 10 rating but its just a mess of a movie thats not even good enough to make fun of.NBIf you must see Seagals scenes fast forward to one hour and twenty three minutes in".

However in between all of that is a great deal of soap opera as the mother is found not to be dead and wants to get her little girl back or some such nonsense.Its awful.In between hitting the fast forward to get to something interesting and watching badly acted scenes at normal speed I sat there slack jawed at just how incredibly stupid this movie is. What kind of movie is it? Comedy? Family Drama? Its not really an action film. What is Seagal doing in this movie? If he did it for a paycheck he got all of the money. My guess is that this was suppose to be a family drama of some sort and somehow Seagal got roped in to doing a days shooting. The producers were happy because they now had a film that they could market as a Steven Seagal flick. Since there is no real release outside of Asia my guess is that anyone looking to release this saw it for what it was and dropped it. You will not be seeing this any time soon playing on American TV or any other TV for that matter.Avoid this one. Its just not worth it. Yes it has a few good moments hence a 2 out of 10 rating but its just a mess of a movie thats not even good enough to make fun of.NBIf you must see Seagals scenes fast forward to one hour and twenty three minutes in";

The fight scenes are decenthowever one can clearly see that it is not Seagal in the cage when the camera is shooting from a farther distance.

Typically these are the 3 or 4 best days of each year for me.Where should I start? As you may have read already Seagal makes a bold career transition on par with Robin Wiliams giving up on Mork to go Dead Poet or like Cruise dumping Ethan Hunt for his badguy role in Collateral. Seagal unveils his dark side as he plays Jack Miller the undefeated fighting champion in this South Korean movie. But there is so much more there is drama a rekindled romance actionpacked fight sequences bad subtitles bad sunglasses and a throwdown annoying kid who says Momma nonstop for the last 15 minutes of this film.I am undeserving of bearing witness to the genius that we know as Steven Seagal. I had this movie for 3 nights and me and all the fellas from the license plate shop watched this all three nights. What a pleasant way to top off an evening after our institutional evening meal has been served.Seagal's character is not prominent in the film until the conclusion. If you are on your deathbed and need to finish this quickly fast forward to 1hr 20min and you'll have your payday. For the rest of us that have the time to watch the story unravel grab your partner and set aside 1 hr and 40 minutes to be entertained in a way that Rob Schneider could only accomplish if he made a movie of himself swimming with hungry great white sharks.Seagal is the genius of our generation. The night after I first watched this I logged onto MENSA.org and made a 25 donation in Steven's name. After watching a movie with the pedigree of Clementine I felt obligated to give something back even if it meant I was donating  from somebody else's account.SPOILER ALERT For the first time I can recall Seagal owns a WWEstyle World Championship Belt in this film. It was probably designed for a smallish South Korean. Incidentally Seagal is billed by the movie ring announcer as 6'4 and 225 pounds. I guess he's back on the Grapefruit Diet.".

Just noticed I need to write 10 lines so here are some arguments to explain my vote The acting is pretty OK for an Asian movie of this style. That's why I voted it 3 out of 10. The problem is that the movie is lacking all the important parts. It is not funny. The script really has only one way to go from the start. I fast forwarded some parts of the film and didn't lose ANY context. And most importantly the film isn't exciting. There isn't a single moment where you hold your breath. Every action fan could forgive those points I mean be honest most martial arts films are lacking on these points... if only he were repaid with some spectacular fight moves. But this is really the killing blow. 2 of the fight scenes with Kim as a cop could be straight out of Maimi Vice and the rest are also just basic brawls. No cool kicks no acrobatics no grace no nothing. There I said it.".

One point of interest that comes out of this arrangement is wondering if Seagal playing the seemingly invincible reigning cagefighting champion will agree to lose or to use a prowrestling term job cleanly to the hero as it would happen in nearly every other story of this type. But the fighting is by no means the focal point of Clementine there are essentially 2 long fight scenes a 5person freeforall inside the cage and the climactic match between Lee and Seagal. Both are pretty messy and lacking in flow and in the last match there are plenty of long shots from outside the cage where you can clearly see Seagal's stunt double. No Clementine is basically a family melodrama and I have to admit I found it quite moving at times. The characters are essentially good people trying to do the best but not always knowing how or even what it is and the acting is genuine and heartfelt. Lee is definitely an aboveaverage actor for a martial arts lead the little girl is irresistible and her mother is very beautiful. The story does depend on a very big coincidence the daughter literally crashing into her thoughtdead mother in a supermarket! but if you can accept that the actors and the music score make it work. To sum up this is a martial arts tearjerker more suitable for fans of the latter genre. 12".

And everything comes to a head when gangsters kidnap the young child in order to force kim to lose the fight against miller. And it's a race against time to find the girl before kim loses more than his title.Whilst not on the artistic and emotional level as a TAKESHI KITANO the movie has it's aspirations and it's plot is a little similar to HANABI and as mentioned the young actress playing the daughter is a joy to behold carefuly balancing sweetness with an adultlike attitude and she certainly knows how to belt out the tears quite convincingly! but the movie itself is falsely advertised as an 'action' movie....it is not. Imagine a Korean 'KRAMER VS KRAMER' with medium level violence and you're on the right track. SEAGAL when he arrives gives a pretty confident performance for all of about 8 minutes! and even though a lot of the long takes look doubled he still has amazing hand speed. But i think his appearance was more of a favour to the director. There's nothing wrong with SEAGAL taking a different role but he does need to put more of an input in different movies like this one a bit of extra background material on his character would be helpfullAll in all though CLEMENTINE is a good movie different to most Korean action movies and the young girls outtake at the end of the movie she proclaims her love for SEAGAL! is the icing on a very 'different' kind of cake.More SEAGAL would have helped but nevertheless a solid 7 out of 10".

It did make me laugh hard... so I got my money's worth on this one.";

	schema:headline " Advertised as a fighting movie which it simply isn't";
	schema:reviewBody "I was looking for an action movie. I saw this title with Seagals face on the cover with his name on it with screen shots from the fighting scenes on the back cover the description read as if this was some good action movie. But none of this holds true. Instead what we get is some kind of a melodrama about a single father and his little daughter.The dubbing of this movie is awful. Seems like they got the worst of the worst voice actors for this movie so I really advise you to watch this in original language with subtitles. It can only make the movie better! The story is very confusing as there are big plot holes. The father Lee DongJun is fighting for the world champion title in Taekwondo but after a wrong decision from the ref he loses the fight. At the same time his wife is giving birth to their child. The mother dies.Years later the daughter runs into a woman in a supermarket they both get to know each other. And it turns out that this woman is the thoughttobedead mother of the little girl. Oh wow what a plot twist. How on earth can such a mistake happen? She was in a hospital. They declared her dead even though she really wasn't? And why didn't the mother try to contact her daughter or her husband? Or maybe it even was explained during the movie but it was so boring remember I expected an action movie! that I simply must have missed this plot twist. But even if there's a plot twist there What where the reasons for the mother to leave the family? And if she wasn't dead and did have her reasons to leave them... why doesn't she just move along after she discovers who the father of this little girl is? And what exactly where the reasons to kidnap the little girl only for this show match to take place? Oh yeah and who thought it would be funny to advertise this movie with Seagal if he only appears for like 6 minutes in it? Conclusion If you are into Korean movies you might want to take a look at this. Camera work is OK most of the time some of the fight scenes that happen at the beginning of the movie are OK as well the 5 against 5 cage match and the final battle are poorly cut and there's no real flow to the fights. All the others just stay the hell away from this.".

You don't see Steven Seagal everyday in some martial arts drama just like this one. But that doesn't mean that the movie is good it was pretty irritating. The fight scenes were solid and that's the only thing I like here Steven did a good job for being on a screen for about 58 minutes... when it comes to the martial arts but when it comes to acting... no luck. It was hard to understand all those Korean actors while talking in English why didn't someone found some speech trainer to teach them to speak a little bit clearer. Don't get me wrong when you are making a film please teach them to speak other language more understandable! Jeez when they are talking Korean I understood them everything. There's nothing much special to say about this film it is a really boring and irritating ordeal. You definitely have something better to do...And... has anyone else saw Raze from Underworld 2003?".

I knew that Seagal only had a little more than a cameo... but the problem is this role dosen't fit him at all. He is not the type of guy to put into a cage match in a movie. His martial art style dosen't fit at all for that. And the shot from far away mixed with close shot where you don't even see Seagal made a very poor last fight. You need to put the kind of guy like Michael Jay White or Van Damme for these. When i watch a movie with Seagal i know he is gonna beat 5 guys at the same type not being touch once and making joke doing it and thats what i love stunt double or not... BUT for this role... nah...Then for the rest of the movie it tried to be super emotional but i had a lot of trouble getting into it the main character role seem a bit weird. He is some kind of super right cops then he work for them... money owned or not i don't know it felt weird... There is a couple fight scene at the beginning then its all drama.... which is not bad usually but not that style... more easy going and more action between. I dunno i felt this movie first wanted to be an action movie then a drama then back to action... Anyway... not bad but thats it. Im glad i saw it i doubt i will ever watch it again...

The film itself seemed do not know what it wanted to be.It starts like some gangstercop action drama. The protagonist as an exfighter and martial artist takes out punch of criminals in illegal casino. He retires from police and we see heartwarming relationship between him and his adorable daughter. Then the gangsters force the protagonist to fight again. Then we see one poorly directed and edited cage fight scene. The daughter cries. Then comes some woman who appears to be the biological mother of the girl. More drama follows and the girl cries again. The daughter gets kidnapped just to force the father to fight one more time but this time his opponent is unbeatable cage fight master Steven Seagal. Another fight scene. The girl cries again it becomes annoying. Then comes Steven Seagal and says something meaningful. The girl stops crying finally. Happy end!Steven Seagal's part is quite brief and we can't see him much in the final fight either. The drama parts between the Korean actors were played out pretty well and the story around the girl was rather interesting and quite enjoyable.It would have been much better movie as a simple drama without those poor action sequences. And maybe if the father would have been played by Steven Seagal. The premise An American Taekwondo champion living in Korea with his seven year old daughter and then the supposedly dead mother comes up. That would have been cool!".

	schema:reviewBody "It was with some trepidation that I watched Clementine the other day because I had heard nothing but a relentless stream of terrible things about it. I was surprised to see that it's a Korean film in every way given Seagal's background in Japanese martial arts and the fact that he speaks fluent Japanese. But make no mistake Clementine is not a Seagal movie it's an action comedy that's heavy on the comedy and cheap drama for some reason and light on the action. The only problem is that the comedy is spotty at best and Seagal's presence on the cover box serves only to make us wonder where he is for the whole movie.The story is about Kim a fallen Korean Taekwondo champion who leaves his country when a bad referee call costs him the championship title. He moves to Los Angeles and becomes a cop and never goes back to Korea although he must live in Korea tow because he and he speaks nothing but Korean as do his colleagues and his daughter. Having lost his fighting career he decides to concentrate on a career in law enforcement and taking care of his daughter. A fight promoter is trying to get him back in the ring but Kim doesn't want to get back into fighting.Kim's daughter is impossibly cute and takes after her father. When Kim gets called in to talk to the principal because his daughter beat up some kid that was teasing her Kim scowls at the kid and says Well you got what you deserved didn't you! Unfortunately there is a stupid subplot involving the girl's mother that serves to do nothing but make a light hearted halfwitted comedy pretty thoroughly depressing. The little girl who plays Kin's daughter has some great scenes but it seems like she was just screaming and crying for about the last 30 minutes or so of the film. Oh and remember that huge black guy in Underworld? The one that did that weird thing where he's trying to make his voice so deep that it just calls attention to his crappy acting? That guy is in this movie and he's still doing that stupid thing with his voice. Maybe someone forgot to tell him that he's not in a vampire movie anymore. But it's pretty much in tune with the rest of the awful acting in the movie although Dongjung Lee who plays the main character does have some pretty funny moments especially in the first half of the film which is the best part of the movie and I would argue that it's even pretty entertaining and fun.It's revealing about the rest of the movie that the formidable talent of Seagal himself is completely wasted. He has nothing to do in the entire movie except do what he does worst in all his other movies  show up at the end and make some goofy speech and then wander off screen in slow motion. Yawn. But this is not a Seagal movie it's a Korean martial arts comedy where he makes a brief appearance at the end in one of the film's only English scenes. If they had kept up the almost family comedy sitcom story of the first half of the movie it could have been fun lighthearted fare but trying to give us this dramatic social situation involving the little girl and her missing mother and the whole thing with Seagal just turned it into a muddled mess.".

Austin's slang has worked its way into the lexicon and everything from the redhot video to the Austin Powers Penis Enlarger is on sale and raking in meeeeeelions. When news of a sequel hit the streets fans freaked. It's safe to say that AP2 is rivaled only by The Phantom Menace as 1999's must see.The wait is over.The secondmost anticipated movie of 1999 finally comes to theaters. We're ecstatic to report that AP is a friggin' laugh riot as Myers and crew have strung together another brilliant collection of oneliners and over the top sometimes horribly disgusting sight gags. The followup to 1997's video hit has Austin heading back to the 60s to track down his mojo stolen by one of Dr. Evil's comically evil hapless henchmen. What's mojo? A multicolored stringy looking mess that makes Austin irresistible to the ladies. But the plot isn't so important. This is the Austin you know and love only this time he's even more raw and hardcore.It's clear that Myers was given a much larger budget to bring his vision to the screen after the runaway success of Austin Powers on video. The sets in Spy are much more vibrant and huge the effects yes effects are topnotch and the pacing is completely nonstop. I had a permagrin stuck on my face through the whole thing and will need to see it again just because the audience drowned out some lines with laughter.Here Kitty Kitty Kitty Spy picks up with Austin taking a trip in a time machine back to the smashing 60s where as we all know he is a sexual dynamo. The time travel bits can get confusing but as Basil Exposition of British Intelligence says Just sit back and enjoy yourself. Back in the 60s Austin quickly draws the attention of his nemesis Dr. Evil. The hilarity begins as a patchwork parade of moronic henchmen attempt to wipe out Austin.Still the best reason to shell out your cash is that AP2 is clearly Dr. Evil's movie. If he's your favorite you're in luck. Most important we see him get some.The film does lean a bit too heavily on gags from the first flick and some of the Yeah baby schtick grows old fast. When your Mammy starts saying Yeah baby it's clearly tired right? Still fans of the original will feel right at home with the budget destructo devices the horrid teeth and the clumsy bumblings of Austin himself. In a summer full of high concepts and big budget AP2 is just the ticket.".

	schema:headline " Slightly better than the first";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe that the general consensus is that the first Austin Powers movie is the best of the bunch. I happen to disagree as you can probably tell from my onelinesummary. I feel that the second film actually improves on the first film by adding a few new characters and generally cutting loose on the humor making it even more bizarre and funny than in the first film. I don't expect people to agree but at least hear me out as to why I think the second film is better.As I said a few new characters have been added to the roster and we get to see some older characters in new and exiting ways. The best addition to the character rooster is MiniMe Doctor Evil's clone played brilliantly by Verne Troyer. Not only is he hilariously funny but he also brings out a different side to Doctor Evil which I found to be extremely funny. On a related note I found Doctor Evil to be much more interesting as a character in the second film than in the first. Probably because the Austin character had to be established in the first film. Second there is the addition of Fat Bastard played by Myers himself. A lot of people have responded negatively to Fat Bastard but I found him quite funny in a very weird way. Mike Myers definitely took a step up the weird ladder when he came up with him. Elizabeth Hurley is written out of the script very early in the film and instead Heather Graham is introduced as Felicity Shagwell. Heather Graham is not as strong as Hurley was as Austin's love interest but she remains nice as eyecandy and what can you expect more than that. Seth Green pretty much reprises his role from the first film. Nothing much to come after there. The supporting cast is pretty much the same as in the first film except this time we get to see Number Two in a young version played by Rob Lowe who does an uncanny imitation of Robert Wagner. Mindy Sterling and Michael York returns in their respective parts as well. There are also quite a few cameos in the film. Including Tim Robbins Woody Harrelson Rebecca RomijnStamos and many more.The film still spoofs Bond obviously and the title in itself is of course a reference to The Spy Who Loved Me and once again I find that noone does it better than Myers. After the success of the first I think they gave Myers free reigns because a lot of the stuff in this film is pretty far out. An example could be the hilarious fight between Austin and MiniMe and an equally funny scene in a tent. I won't reveal any more than that. Another thing is that the overall effects seem much more polished this time around which is probably also caused by the success of the previous film.The story is pretty much nonexistent which I found to be an improvement over the previous film which actually attempted to incorporate a story rather than just be all out fun.All in all I think it is a matter of taste. Either you prefer the first or you prefer the second but you should definitely give this film a try just for the heck of it.All in all 710".

Some think there should be a large series of AUSTIN POWERS movies like the infamous Bond movies. Trust me I'm kinda sick of everyone doing impressions of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil and I do one fine Dr. Evil if I do say so myself even though both are easy to impersonate but I thought AUSTIN POWERS THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME was even better than the first one. So if you asked me if there should be a series of AUSTIN POWERS movies and I wasn't so sick of all those impersonations I might say Yeah baby!Austin Powers Mike Myers is sent back to 1969 by Basil Exposition Michael York to stop Dr. Evil Mike Myers who has stolen Austin Powers' mojo and plans to build a giant laser on the movie and destroy all major cities on Earth. In the sixties Austin Powers meets Felicity Shagwell Heather Graham who is just as sexy and hip as Austin is. Scott Evil Seth Green is still trying to work out things with his father even though Dr. Evil has turned his attention to his clone in 110 size MiniMe Verne Troyer. Number Two Robert Wagner then Rob Lowe Frau Farbissina Mindy Sterling and Mustafa Will Ferrell all return to help Dr. Evil in addition to Fat Bastard Mike Myers the disgusting overweight Scottish henchman.Let's face is Austin Powers has never been about plot. Considering that this movie is basically a spoof of OUR MAN FLINT and the JAMES BOND movies the plot is pretty entertaining and funny. The giant laser on the moon was great obviously spoofing MOONRAKER in addition to many other movies of its type.The acting in this movie is all very good. Mike Myers does a great job playing three very different characters. Heather Graham beats the crap out of Elizabeth Hurley not literally in this movie but how cool would that be and is way sexier in my book. Seth Green and Mindy Sterling are great especially when together. Will Ferrell was one of my favorite performers and characters in this movie. Robert Wagner is good but his role is taken over by Rob Lowe after they go back in time. Lowe does an unbelievable job and is almost exactly like Wagner was as the character. Michael York does a fairly good job too. There are some great cameos by names like Clint Howard Tim Robbins Rebecca RomijnStamos Kristen Johnston and Jerry Springer.Unlike in AUSTIN POWERS INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY there is great character development. This first AUSTIN POWERS movie did a good job laying a foundation for these characters but this movie really set them off. Dr. Evil stole the show which is great because he is obviously the best character. Austin Powers Number Two and Basil are about the same as in the first one. Felicity is way more interesting and sexier than Hurley was. Frau is much more interesting in this movie as is Scott who is still saying Why don't you just kill them? to his father. Mustafa who you might not even remember from the first one is hilarious in this movie. MiniMe was fun but in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie it shouldn't revolve around him as much. Fat Bastard is my least favorite character and I hope he isn't in the next AUSTIN POWERS movie.Go see this one you won't regret it. It sure won't win any Oscars but it's one of the funniest movies of the year. Turn your brain off and enjoy it!".

Jay Roach returns to direct this oneand heas usualis near transparent in allowing Myersnot only star and coproducer but also screenwriterto pretty much take this film as highlowfarcloseloudsoft and whatever as he fancies. While the original's flavor seems to be getting steadily diluted by the franchise effect of sequelsin other wordsthe effect that kind of makes a movie more of a product than a piece of entertainmentit still has the same sasscheeky humor and fun to keep it quite enjoyable.";

Maybe I was just in a good mood or something but I was a little surprised by the rating of just 6.5 because I knew a lot of people who enjoyed the movie as well as I did.We have Austin Powers and he's back and funnier and nakeder than ever! Despite some recycled jokes they still get a laugh when he's walking through the hotel butt naked and only certain objects cover him. When Dr. Evil escapes the giant dummy in space and heads back to Earth Austin alone must go on his mission alone since we find out Venessa was a fembot. We have a new addition to the family with a miniature replica that is 18 the size of Dr. Evil he calls Mini Me. Mini Me is just so cute and he wants to kill Scott. Scott and Mini Me just steal the movie from this point on. Dr.Evil decides to go back into the 60's and take over the world by aiming a lazer at the moon.Austin must now go back in time back to the 60's and finds his sexy assistant Felicity played by a very beautiful but pretty bad actress Heather Grahm. Together they must find and fight Dr. Evil before he makes over a trillion... oops! I mean a billion dollars! There is another addition of a villain Fat Bastard despite most of his gross jokes you except him into the Austin family.Like I said there are recycled jokes but that doesn't keep you from laughing and having a good time. Just let go and learn to have fun with the movie. Come on you have got to admit that 2's death was just great and so funny! Let's get the rating up it deserves better than a 6.5! I think Austin fans will enjoy this shagadelic movie! 910".

There is virtually no end to the plot holes inconsistencies and various irregularities but that is often a big part of the humor of the Austin Powers movies  making direct fun of the spy genre as well as themselves.And on a personal note Heather Graham is by far more attractive than Liz Hurley and she flaunts it with great respect for us the juvenile minded male audience.

The Spy Who Shagged Me was a lot more commercially advertised and hyped about.OK I'll admit the first time I saw this film I thought it was very funny but it's only after watching it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK but Heather Graham cannot act. Her performance didn't seem very convincing and she wasn't near as good as Liz Hurley was in the first one. Those characters who bloomed in the first one Scott Evil Number 2 etc. are thrown into the background hear and don't get many standalone scenes. The film is simply overrun with cameos.In particular I hated the way they totally disregarded some of the scenes in IMOM. When they killed off Vanessa at the start and had Basil sat that he knew she was a fembot all along. What was the point of that? They killed off Number 2 in the first one and now they bring him back with no explanation whatsoever. This is supposed to be a spyspoof I don't think any of the characters even hold a gun in the film. It just goes on a trail further and further away from the point.The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole MiniMe make fun of my size' joke gets old very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for grossout humour. In total there's about two or three good jokes. The rest are either tasteless or rehashed from IMOM.If this were the first movie of the series then I'd probably be easier on it. But the series started on a note of dry wit and then plummeted down to a level of gross out humour.

Sure I liked the first Wayne's World movie but after a second viewing I found the only two times I laughed were at Dana Carvey as Garth.The first Austin Powers was a comedic improvement giving us a close enough funny sendup of British spy movies not Bond exactly of the 60s. He even made the 60s hip again! Sort of.But while that was clever sort of he takes all the jokes and puts them in this rehash sequel. He tries to add new things to laugh at but can only come up with the snorecausing joke of Fat Bastard using his old SO I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER Scottish accent slightly better than his English one and MiniMe the best part of the whole movie. But MiniMe is like the personification of one joke. He's a sight gag.Director Jay Roach takes too much advice from Myers and keeps onandongoing jokes in his movie that make you want to strangle somone preferably Will Ferrel in a tedious skit that lasts longer and grows more stale than his burningbody bit in the first one. The jokes try to challenge SOUTH PARK and the Farrelley Bros. in grossing out but it misses what the other two don't. Brains. Wit. And ultimately laughs. I'm sure some of the kiddies will enjoy this dreck but they also enjoy ERNEST GOES TO CAMP for God's sake. And hardcore fans will probably dismiss the whole thing as fun just to have the unneccessary franchise around.I dont even want to mention poor Heather Graham who hasn't really acted since SWINGERS TWO GUYS  A GIRL and her breakthrough BOOGIE NIGHTS wasting her time in the middle of this mess. She plays a bimbo blond whose only interest is apparently to have sex with godawful ugly men. Her IQ is right at the level with the rest of the movie. It's a shame too because at least the first one had Elizabeth Hurley who gets snubbed here pointing out how sexist and dated that is in the 90s. Apparently the cliche is back in effect again. They might as well have evil Russians and dimwitted Chinese characters here also.The first one was at least a hitandmiss but this thing whatever you want to call it is a missandmiss unless of course the target is its foot.".

Many people may think they glorifying the hedonism of the period and maybe that's the case but find it more of a satire and see it that way.What I don't like however is the rating of this film and the others as PG13. How typical of sick Hollywood pandering these and the other Powers movies to the teen crowd. They are filled with nothing but sex sex and more sex. Even the term shag is British for fk. I mean they don't even try to be subtle anymore. Rate it R stick to it and let the adults have fun with all the innuendos puns cleavage penis jokes and general pagan lifestyles of the 1960s.Mike Myers does a good job playing several overthetop roles. Sometimes he's better off saying nothing just opening up his mouth with that stupid grin and horrible teeth. That usually gets a laugh. The other two Powers were better because this was too meanedged and too profane.I would imagine that Myers and the Austin Powers films in general were either loved or hated by whomever is viewing it. I get a lot of humor out of these because I don't take them seriously and look at it more as making fun of the moronic attitudes of the late '60s more than anything else. Great fun....for adults.".

Almost every joke is predictable and flogged to death. read that they might have been improved with more aggressive editing  The only moment the movie produced a good laugh for me was when they did the cut to sequence where various people are spotting Dr. Evil's rocket in the sky. but even that was just a old joke dusted off but done well Of course to stay true to form of beating a dead horse they had to DO IT AGAIN at the end of the film. sighOne of the few good moments of the film are the few where Rob Lowe is doing his Robert Wagner impersonation but that is hardly reason enough to view this film.If you want a reason to watch this film consider it a good lesson in bad editing comedy timing and over merchandising. The blatant product placement and plugs may have been a poke at the Bond films but it smelled more like the real thing than parody.I would ONLY suggest you watch this AP entry if you like to study bad films like I do.survivor.ps It scares me to think of the box office this film did only because it will no doubt inspire others to produce more crap like this.

If you have all that then you got a great comedic movie on your hands.A main thing you need is slapstick humor. In a scene from the movie Austin and his trusty sidekick Felicity Shagwell are in a tent being watched by Dr. Evil's guards. Austen is down on his hands and knees doing exercises while Felicity  is checking their inventory. Since there is a light in the tent it sends their shadows to the outside of the tent where it looks to Dr. Evil's guards that Felicity is reaching in and taking things out of Austin's derriere. The funniest part is when accidently sets of a smoke bomb if you understand what they were trying to show. Meanwhile any scene with Fat Bd is a laugh riot. Especially the scene where he explains that babies are the other other white meat.Another good aspect to a great comedy is a cast of crazy characters. Mike Meyers is great as the swingin' Austin Powers The maniacal Dr. Evil and as Fat Bd the one metric ton Scotsman. Other great characters in the movie include the pintsized maniacal MiniMe Dr. Evil's 18 sized clone and Scott Evil the punk son of Dr. Evil. They all are incredibly cartoonish players who are great when they interact with each other.From this Frickin' rotating chair that I sit in I can definatly approve of this movie. They have fantastically funny jokes that leave you rolling in the aisles. Along with sidesplitting offthewall characters. This movie has everything you could ever ask for. It's sp funny that you will want to see it as many times as you probobly saw Titanic.by A.J SRHigh".

Michael York would be better off working the midnight shift at the 711 selling pencils on the corner or holding a Will work for food sign it's more dignified than trying to inject any talent or class into this cesspool of a movie. Mike Myers please use your considerable talent in something other than this crap. You've been great in Wayne's World and Shrek. Mike will do anything for a laugh whether he gets one or not and here he gets none. The brainless obvious dirty and disgusting puns are matched only by the scene in which Powers drinks liquid sewage. That pretty much describes the whole sorry mess. How did this excrement make money? It gets one star but should really get zero.".

I did not see the first movie but loved the commercials etc..The sex jokes in this flick OK I realize now that IS the movie were in such bad taste I couldn't stand it and walked out 10 minutes before the end. This is the very first time I have ever done this. The potty humor and sexual innuendoes did not strike me as funny.I have enjoyed other dumb comedies Dumb and Dumber come to mind but the endless sexual jokes got old in a hurry. How anyone could get a laugh at someone drinking feces is beyond me. I also could not believe this movie was rated PG13. There is no way I would let my 12 to 14 year old see this movie. The scene in the tent was the last straw for me.I usually don't take the time to comment but I had to. I have nothing against Mike Myers. I enjoyed him even before SNL but I certainly am NOT looking forward to the third installment.I know I should have gone to Star Wars for the second time. Oh well....".
