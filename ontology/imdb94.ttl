Meanwhile Deveraux and surviving UniSol Andrew Scott are preparing to battle anarchy and build a new order ruled by Unisols without government oversight. They are weeding out the weak and constantly testing their strongest warriors in brutal lifeanddeath combat. Luc has emerged operating the Unisol Church of Eventualism taking in wayward Unisols whom the government has been secretly operating as remotecontrolled sleeper agents.

	schema:reviewBody "The new Unisol film is a surprisingly fresh take on an old franchise. The tone of the movie is completely different from the previous entries that it's hard to compare to its predecessors.Our hero john Scott Adkins awakes to find intruders in his home who kill his wife and daughter. After spending several months in a coma John awakes with a memory loss only remembering the man who murdered his family Luc Devreux Van Damme. The storyline then becomes less comprehensive as we tag along John as he tries to piece everything. The main problem is that nothing is answered the back story remains hidden and the characters motivations are left unexplained. The movie also suffers from bad pacing the first half being painstakingly slow with no action happening for the first half of the movie.The good news are that the second half features some badass action sequences and the R rating is used fully it's a gory movie as it should be. Even though the frequent use of slomo is tiring it doesn't ruin the experience. Too bad all of it is packed in the final scenes of the movie. The movie draws inspiration from different places from video games to horror movies to Apocalypse Now you won't miss it the unique style sets this movie apart from the others but it doesn't help the thin plot or anemic characters.Universal Soldier 4 Day of Reckoning is unique and fresh and I applaud the director for taking a different approach. Adkins does a great job and proves his more than a stuntman. JVCD and Lundgren's roles are smaller than you would expect but it's a treat to see them on screen again. The lack of a comprehensive plot and or continuity to other films of the series is what hinders this movie from getting a higher rating.Final score 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Just the basic story Scott Adkins awakes in hospital after he dreams about JCVD and some guys in black uniforms kill his wife and daughter. He is then approached by some sort of government agent and starts to search for the killer of his family but it is more difficult than it seems.To be completely honest I don't think I got the story completely. It includes clones implanted memories and some twists you wouldn't really expect from a movie like this. This isn't really like the first Universal Soldier funny this is actually pretty grim and dry and compared to Regeneration it has a way more complex story and clear lead actor this time Scott Adkins. The first scene is actually a firstperson one take like in an ego shooter. It's a gimmick and I'm not really a fan of this but it isn't bad at all. It's also raw and brutal as Scott gets beat up by a crowbar and then his wife is killed by a head shot with lots of blood splattering around The death of his daughter isn't shown. The Eastern block industrial feeling is gone this is rural America  and it's for the better. Of course there aren't any big sets like in The Expendables. This time there's also nudity. A brothel for the Universal Soldiers where Andrei Arlovski is wrecking some havoc and a strip club. All this is told with various experimental techniques. Strange sounds flashbacks in which for example his daughter appears or his mirror image turns into Van Damme and so on. It's a little bit TOO ambitious for a movie like this. It wants to be deep David Lynchlike and while I appreciate the intention of going away from the simple story of Regeneration the arthouse approach doesn't really fit. Scott Adkins also simply isn't a good actor to pull that off. And he still lacks the presence of the old action heroes.Well yes the actors. They are horrible. With the exception of Van Damme whose performance as the leader of the rogue Universal Soldier is pretty good and is mysterious presence is definitely something. Dolph finally channels the Andrew Scott from the first movie again at least a little bit and he actually has the only funny line in the movie  That's the spirit soldier. What he says when he gets a machete into his arm. You could pretty much picture that in the first movie. Yes in the movie is serious. No funny oneliners. The only funny thing are the splatter scenes. The movie has lots of it. Adkins loses his fingers Arlovski half of his foot. Lots of head shots even an old grandmother gets one the brothel whores are mercilessly slaughtered.And now to the good things. I mean the really good things. The action scenes. While I admit it the first part of the movie is a little bit slow and tries to tell the story as mysterious as possible it is from time to time pushed by some little action scenes. These are really wellshot without fast cuts quite the opposite slowmo is used. For what they are small scale scenes in a movie with a low budget they are really topnotch. They don't have large set pieces but that is compensates by the violence. Then there is a car chase which is the only action scene that I found a little bit average. It's really nothing special the one in Regeneration was much better. But of course the whole scene leads right into a nice battle between Adkins and Arlovski where the beat each other with baseball bats dumbbells and whatever.Still all this doesn't make up for the lengths in the beginning. To be honest if the movie would have went on like that I would have been a little bit disappointed. But then it comes. The showdown is better than anything seen in THE EXPENDABLES I or II and whatever. Really. I cannot think of many action movies that have such an awesome final act where everything just gets bigger and bigger and culminates into two boss battles. The whole things begins with a minutelong one take where Adkins wrecks havoc and kills UniSols left and there without the movie having a cut.After the disappointing Dragon Eyes John Hyams redeems himself and showed that the great action from Regeneration wasn't just a lucky punch. He can also write although perhaps next time he should get some help. I hope that in the near future he can at least rise enough to take charge of a movie with Jason Statham and his typical production values.I've decided to give this movie a 810 because of the great climax.".

Not long in to the film I was shocked at how good it all looked from a film structure point its not a Alien or Godfarther standard but its far above straight to DVD movies its far better than most big screen films. The only thing that reminds you that this is a small screen film is the cast and their acting ability's Scott does a good job where he can but then again if you rented this film you would not be expecting any Oscars but when it comes to the action side they do a very good job its very upfront and bloody. The film sits around the 710 area most of these films would normally hit a 510 but this one picks up points for the effort that has gone in to making something more than a cheap straight to DVD film. I hope that the same guys who put this together get a bigger film with a upgrade in actors if they can make a film that looks this good with a low budget I would like to see what happens with a few more million thrown in.".

Even tho they were super human this made the combat feel realistic and solid in a visceral and disturbing way As someone who hasn't seen a Universal Soldier movie since i was a kid i found the plot a little slow yet slightly confusing like i was missing some important information which actually kept me interested enough to care about what was going on even tho it ended up the only way it could have. No one goes into a movie like this expecting to have there mind blown away by the story anyway so it cant be faulted here.

	schema:reviewBody "In my mind there are only two Universal Soldier movies and if you watch Universal Soldier 1992 and Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 you will have a complete unspoiled Universal Soldier experience. Give everything else with the UniSol name attached to it a miss it just spoils it!Universal Soldier 1992 is a classic of its time and genre. It was destroyed with two unofficial sequels that I have never seen and never care to.Then came the official sequel Universal Soldier The Return 1999. JCVD was back which gave the movie some cred but it deviated too far from what made Universal Soldier 1992 good. The Return was didn't have the same feel. It was too shiny too clean just too Hollywood.When I got word of another Universal Soldier sequel I avoided it like the plague! I wasn't going to fall into temptation but it was the reviews here on IMDb that finally turned me. I finally buckled due to the overwhelming praise of Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009.Regeneration really is SO good for its budget. It took the UniSol series from the classic for its time bracket and thrust it into gritty reality. A worthy and brilliant sequel that thankfully ignores the events of The Return and still doesn't get the praise it deserves. WATCH THIS FILM!Regeneration leaves room for a direct sequel which if made in the same tone would have been brilliant! But Day of Reckoning ignores the lot of it and goes in a completely different direction again! I have no idea why or what they were thinking after the acclaim of Regeneration. Everyone involved should be fired and never be allowed to work again!This film does not star JCVD or DL. They are extras at most. This film follows a new character and his story which intertwines into a re imagined UniSol universe almost completely unrelated to anything before it.JCVD and DL look extremely old even more so than in Regeneration where they just got away with it!This film shouldn't have been made. They had all the ingredients to run with a better sequel after the events of Regeneration.I am in fact a little angry that I have seen DOR. It has left a foul taste in my mouth again just like I felt after I watched The Return.In a way I hope they still do another one because their track record suggests their next one will be good again. On the other hand JCVD and DL are far too old.It will take several sittings of the original and Regeneration to erase this movie from memory. And just like how I believe there are only three Star Wars films only three Indiana Jones films and Joel Schumacher never made a Batman film  there are only two UniSol film the original and Regeneration. Watch these two films again and again if you have to just give this one and any others a miss.Thank me later.2 stars for some pretty reasonable and gritty action and fight scenes for its budget  only good part of the film.".

Not helping the already volatile and complex situation is an outofcontrol maniac on the rampage named Magnus Orlovski who was so unforgettable as The Freak in the previous installment of this series who is tracking John's every move. Meanwhile our old buddy Andrew Scott Lundgren has assembled an army of disaffected former UniSols and is acting as their leader. Their aim is to form a militiastyle separatist group in an attempt to be free from their former masters the government. this was a genius plot development as a potential direction to take the series in our opinion. But that's just the beginning as John travels through the treacherous world in his quest for answers he won't just have to fight for his life he'll have to question the very nature of reality itself. Now that's a concept for an action movie. Will Luc or Andrew finally face their DAY OF RECKONING? Or will it be John? Find out today! There are many praiseworthy things about Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning. Probably the most obvious is that it is an action movie with a difference. Its weird and somewhat nonlinear structure sets it miles apart from the more pedestrian beatemups all too prevalent in the market today. The unorthodox style is highly effective  truly ANYTHING can happen and the viewer is excited and thrilled to see what's coming next. This dare to be different approach scored big with us which brings us to another reason why we praise this movie it appears to be by fans for fans or BFFF as our new clothing line will be called. In other words it would seem the film is tailor made for hardcore action movie fans who have seen thousands of them in their lifetime and crave something different that will throw them for a loop. It seems unlikely that a nonaction movie fan would like or even understand this movie.Truly John Hyams is keeping the current state of action afloat singlehandedly. US DOR is beautifully shot and directed and he's clearly not afraid to take chances. Just about all of his gambits worked as the movie fires on all cylinders and is frankly riveting. And while a lot can be made about the film's violence or ultraviolence which is a more appropriate term violence for its own sake means nothing and is very boring without solid ideas behind them. Thankfully US DOR has the brains and the brawn to make a satisfying spectacle. While Hyams' Universal Soldier Regeneration 2009 is a truly excellent piece of work and to date Hyams' masterpiece Day of Reckoning we felt was superior to his Dragon Eyes 2012. But at least he's keeping Van Damme employed...seemingly also singlehandedly.Van Damme appears to be on a winning streak of late and his career we say tentatively is back on form. JCVD has a small but pivotal role here not unlike his turn in the aforementioned Dragon Eyes. Personal hero Dolph Lundgren is typically great but the movie is all about Scott Adkins in one of his best roles to date. Add to that some awesome fights and a standout car chase all done daringly without music and you have another potent piece of work from Mr. Hyams. If you happen to be reading this we just want to say to you more please! Make sure you get the movie on iTunes as this is the unrated director's cut not found elsewhere. Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning is like manna from heaven for true action fans and we recommend it highly.".

I can't believe Hyams can churn out these movies with such small budgets. The slow burn that lead to all the action scenes was perfect for the tone of the film. Once the action starts we are treated to INSANELY VIOLENT and BRUTAL fight pieces which are masterfully executed. My main flaw was the overuse of slow mo in the climax tracking shots. It was still bad ass but it would have packed a bigger punch without it. I knew not to expect a traditional Unisol movie so that aspect didn't ruin anything for me...and honestly I like Hyams trying new things instead of just making the same movie over and over again like most big Hollywood directors do. He knew he only had a little money to use and he wanted to create something really special with it...and I think he succeeded admirably. The first Unisol will always be my favorite but DOR slightly edges out Regeneration for me because of the unsettling HorrorNoir atmosphere. Just as how Regeneration was my favorite action movie of the 2010 I think DOR will me my favorite of 2012...and both movies came out the same year as an Expendables movie and destroyed them both. 4.255".

The first Unisol will always be my favorite but DOR slightly edges out Regeneration for me because of the unsettling HorrorNoir atmosphere. Just as how Regeneration was my favorite action movie of the 2010 I think DOR will me my favorite of 2012...and both movies came out the same year as an Expendables movie and destroyed them both. 4.255";

Very confused throughout...the story did reveal itself in the end but that was definitely one aspect I didn't enjoy.This movie is definitely worth a watch with seemingly invincible soldiers with superhuman strength VanDamme Dolph and Adkins should be enough to persuade you  610 and too much flashing!".

Scott is a created soldier given a memory of a family which is then killed so that he develops a rage why? don't know who made him some government wing why they are against JCVD no idea what does Dolph do I wish I had an answer why were JCVD and Lundgren in my movie? You tell me! This is no way related to the Universal Soldier series even the later ones featuring Goldberg and Kiana Tom were much better. Scott as the Russian was likable in those kick boxing movie series forgetting the name well he cant act for sure and he he was just horrible. Just watch the first Universal Soldier movie and enjoy Dolph going all psycho avoid this at all cost. 2 stars just because it had some nice martial arts actors thats all".

While John tries to piece his life back together things get more complicated when he is pursued by a relentless UniSol named Magnus. Deveraux and surviving UniSol Andrew Scott are preparing to build a new order ruled by Unisols without government oversight. They are weeding out the weak and constantly testing their strongest warriors in brutal lifeanddeath combat. Luc takes in wayward Unisols whom the government has been secretly operating as remotecontrolled sleeper agents. As John gets closer to Deveraux and the rogue army of genetically enhanced warriors he discovers more about himself and begins to call into question everything he believed to be true......If you are thinking of something along the line sod the original film this is as farther from that film as you could expect. It's as if Herzog Lynch and Cronenberg have taken the franchise and mutated it.The film begins in a very disturbing way and sets the whole tone of the film dark and grim and unsettling. Adkins proves himself as a bonafide action star in this and stands well against Van Damme and Lundgren........and this is the major problem with the film.The stars are hardly in it. Lundgren is in a total of three scenes lasting around eight minutes and Van Damme is in it a little more but has nothing to do until the last ten minutes of the film so if you are after them in a film this is very deceptive.Another problem I had with the film was the strobe lights in a couple of scenes I literally had to come back to the film later as it made me feel nauseous. It takes a while to get going and after one gruesome scene at a 'parlour' the action really gets going. We have a great car chase and then a mental fight in a sports shop.After the confusing plot comes to a head we have the final third which contains an almost one shot edit of Adkins going on a killing spree before finally meeting Van Damme.So all in all it's a very big risk for a Universal Soldier movie as it will divide fans. But it works and it really gets exciting after the fifty minute mark.".

Just know that this film is not really an action film. Yes there is plenty of action sequences in the film but the films tone and pace are that of a suspenseful thrillerhorror film. So for fans of the franchise looking for the type of action and pace set by previous installments this film could be and by many accounts has been very disappointing.Taking into account the new genre the film is actually quite good for what it is the suspense is everpresent in the film starting with the very first scene which is very disturbing by the way. The story of this film follows the main character John as he tries to piece together his life after a horrible incident that lands him in a coma only to awaken to a world where he continuously finds evidence that he has been actively creating a lot of trouble while he was presumably unconscious. This ultimately leads him to some startling revelations and to numerous encounters with several undercover universal soldiers.Compared to previous Universal Soldier films this installation of the series is much darker much slower paced and much more psychological than the other installations. It may serve as an experiment to see what can happen when a film changes its traditional genre as well as the lead character role switch from JeanClaude Van Damn's Luc Devereaux to Scott Adkin's John. Perhaps the film could be considered more of a spinoff in these regards. Ultimately as a stand alone movie this is a great suspenseful thrilling horror film that is very well made. I hope this helps and helps to explain why there is such a difference of opinion with regards to this film.".

This time around the film revolves around a younger star Adkins. The story begins with Adkins' character witnessing the execution of his family and then waking from a coma with only this memory. The film progresses from this point and the viewer is engaged by John learning about the events that lead to his family's death. What could have been another formulaic rehash of a wellworn movie format is actually a very engaging modern rendition using the original story as a launching point for an intriguing new narrative. I was surprised by the production quality of this film from the outset. The pacing the way shots are framed the slow and deliberate way the scenes are put together is reminiscent of some of the best moments of the Terminator series. Great action sequences but its the artful way its all shot that actually makes for really quality viewing. I was impressed by Adkins performance. This is a fullyfledged action guy who can pull off some pretty convincing character portrayal. In all respects I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If you're a fan of the original or liked the Terminator series you will probably appreciate what's been done here. This is by far the best action flick I have seen in a very long time.".

Not so JVC was ridiculous in whiteblack bald head makeup the plot was confusing at the bestadd bad sequencing and some below average acting  this was 102 minutes wasted. And this bloody strobe effects it was driving me nuts same goes for antiquated psychedelic sound effects which remind me of early scifi flix like Barbarella. For JVC's fans  this is a rather bad effort see Expendables 2 or even 6 Bullets to get your JVC fix.".

It doesn't take long for this act of petty vandalism to start a fire which starts a chain reaction that causes massive explosions at the refinery destroying it and spreading a mushroomcloud of flame that soon engulfs the entire metropolis!

And passing again the City of Montreal as a Midwest city with a big oil field next to it...Bring on some big stars some washed up others who still has it and some second rates then throw this scenario like The Towering Inferno with soaplike intrigue with the center subject the opening of a brand new hospital...The result a boring too slow and predictable movie with lowrated special effects and the worst cinematography ever for a movie. And noticing for the climatic scenes that it remained in one city street set build on an old quarry in East End Montreal. And to think of it looking closely all cardboard...Sad that the genre was washedup at the time.Acting was soso. Thank God Mr.Fonda did won an Academy Award two years later in a better film On Golden Pond but I believe he should have passed this one...And to listen to the French Dubbing made in Paris... Wondering who dubbed this crap... Unbearable !Maybe this film should be redone one day...

And passing again the City of Montreal as a Midwest city with a big oil field next to it...Bring on some big stars some washed up others who still has it and some second rates then throw this scenario like The Towering Inferno with soaplike intrigue with the center subject the opening of a brand new hospital...The result a boring too slow and predictable movie with lowrated special effects and the worst cinematography ever for a movie. And noticing for the climatic scenes that it remained in one city street set build on an old quarry in East End Montreal. And to think of it looking closely all cardboard...Sad that the genre was washedup at the time.Acting was soso. Thank God Mr.Fonda did won an Academy Award two years later in a better film On Golden Pond but I believe he should have passed this one...And to listen to the French Dubbing made in Paris... Wondering who dubbed this crap... Unbearable !Maybe this film should be redone one day... But hey aren't we tired of seeing those artificial catastrophes when real ones occurred recently ?A movie to forget... Despite its allstar cast...";

At the end of the 1970's and pretty much at the end of the disaster movie's original box office trend came City On Fire a film that fizzled fast but featuring a certain player out of a certain earlier disaster movie can you guess???? It's Ava Gardner having survived Earthquake and The Cassandra Crossing City On Fire would be her final disaster movie although it's true in this film she isn't given much to do she does add a comic twist to a film that shouldn't really be funny in the first place.City On Fire tells the story of a modern day large American city in reality that large American city was actually Montreal in Canada this city which is never named has a rather large looming dangerous feature an oil refinery starting to get an idea of what might happen in this film? Yes if you have fired up your imagination you may have already guessed that it is this oil refinery and one annoyed employee who is passed over for promotion who sets off a change of events that leads to a series of explosions at the plant and across the city buildings burst into flames people run around screaming cars are thrown into the air TV presenters swear and walls fall down revealing men on the toilet.As the heat is turned up and city starts to burn people at the brand new hospital are trapped in a potential firestorm this would mean that all the oxygen within the hospital would be burnt out along with everything else in the surrounding area. A rescue attempt is set in motion for the trapped people and patients.The film has long been given a rough ride true it isn't an amazing piece of cinema and it does rely to heavily on stock footage of fires but among that is this fairly interesting and exciting story of the rescue attempt watched under by the supervision of fire chief Henry Fonda and local television presenter Ava Gardner Shelley Winters is also thrown in for good measure having gone belly up in the Poseidon Adventure here she gets all hot under the collar as a caring but tough talking nurse. These three Hollywood legends are joined by funny man Leslie Neilsen who believe it or not is mayor of doomed city and only a few years away from his role in disaster movie spoof Airplane and a bunch of lesser names such as Barry Newman and Susan Clark in lead roles as chief doctor and rich widow whose money was burning a hole in her pocket.Not a great film but it's Luke warm build up means the film fizzles out before it's big bang finish.".

It features a stellar cast that includes Ava Gardner Henry Fonda Barry Newman and Leslie Neilsen but most of them seem bored by the material and just hover around in front of the fire spouting bad dialogue and wondering aloud how much worse it will get and how many more victims it will claim. The fire is started by a disgruntled employee at a power station. Within an hour it has spread beyond the power station to the whole city and the film focuses in particular on the hospital which is fast becoming an unsurvivable inferno. The scenes of patients and doctors running drenched in water through the burning streets are pretty exciting but come so late in the film that many viewers will have switched off by then. Barry Newman is the best actor in it given a rare leading role and making the most of it. The others as I've mentioned. don't seem at all bothered. The production is certainly not cheap. It looks very real amid the fire and death and to have assembled such a good cast obviously took considerable money. Unfortunately the film is bad though. It takes too long to get going and doesn't try any new things compared with all the disaster movies that have been made before. I'd give this one a miss I were you unless you're a pyromaniac or hooked on the disaster genre.".

There was no attempt to build up to an actual motive. The writers thought that CPR was the only action to take in an emergency and that old men using a bedpan was necessary for the audience to see. This movie was made purely to burn some gasoline for the big fire scenes and so that stunt men could be lit on fire. 1 out of 10 is generous.".

Having just watched CITY ON FIRE I found it a thoroughly absorbing movie and certainly nowhere near as bad as some claim. It's not up to the standard of THE TOWERING INFERNO  few films are  but it's certainly a film comparable to EARTHQUAKE for instance.The story is straightforward. A messedup arsonist the intensely unlikeable Jonathan Welsh decides to burn down an oil refinery that just had him sacked. The whole city is soon aflame with a hospital providing a focus point for the climactic action. An ensemble cast go through the motions and you just know some of them won't make the end credits. Leslie Nielsen's the mayor Barry Newman a doctor Shelley Winters a nurse Henry Fonda the fire chief.There's very little to dislike about this film. The budget is surprisingly high and the disaster scenes have an authentic ring to them with plenty of death and destruction to keep you on your toes. The script is a bit cheesy but this is normal for the era. The '70s ambiance is just right and the film has a relatively brief running time which means the action is short and snappy. The whole street gauntlet climax is wellstaged with a maximum of excitement. I thought CITY ON FIRE as a whole was very good so ignore the naysayers.".

When a frustrated employee of the refinery sabotages some of the installations and causes fuels to leak into the city sewers it doesn't take long for a gigantic fire to burst out and spread itself throughout the entire metropolis. Pretty soon the new hospital is overrun with casualties but given its location the hospital itself is guaranteed to be destroyed by the unstoppable inferno. Never mind all the harsh and downright negative reviews around here and the fact that City on Fire got parodied in MST3K because this is one helluva entertaining motion picture!

Look like a porno prop to meLeslie Nielsen was doing comedy even when he was doing serious drama.  This movie is right out of the Naked Gun series.  only problem is the actors take it all seriously.Susan Clark aka Websters mum plays the rich trampy heroine love interest for Barry Newman who is this guy?  what a chick magnet really?I think my impression of the movie is coming through loud and clear.  I love disaster movies usually but god were all of the 1970's movies this bad?? Surely not....If you need a laugh watch this tripe if only to appreciate good movies when you watch them.".

As for the rest of the cast are weak and wooden especially the actor who played carter maybe needed a few lessons at acting school before making at an actor his wooden as a plank of wood but that can be said of the over actors who frankly don't even try and bring some life into this tepid material that would frankly suit an Steven seagal action flick .

They're loud cocky and vicious and if the cases we're shown are anything to go by very very bad at their job.Regan Winston is head man and a law unto himself his sidekick Carter Drew and the rest of his special ops team are housed in a swish crow's nest of Scotland Yard with all mod cons. While Winston and Drew have an unmistakable chemistry on screen they really didn't have much to work with. Drew delivers his lines painfully slow as if inebriated but you have to give it to the guy he's not bad when it comes to fisticuffs. The gung ho ways and abysmal record of their squad attracts the attention of Internal Affairs who are just waiting for a reason to shut them down. The wait isn't very long.England's capital is largely deserted for the duration which again beggars belief. There's a monumental hot pursuit and shoot out on an almost empty Trafalgar Square with just enough passers by to be pushed violently to the ground by both the fleeing criminals and the cops themselves by the third time it was comically so. It would appear that The Sweeney have been trained at the Storm Trooper Shooting Range as London town is shot up in relentless gunfire but not one bullet reaches its target. Think Hot Fuzz not Miami Vice.The plot is convoluted the cases needlessly complicated and for the life of me I couldn't get excited about a Serbian Georgie Burgess as the bad guy. While Nick Love is renowned for his cockney gangster offerings unfortunately this time round he didn't think to bring either a decent story or a coherent script to the table.The Sweeney is somewhat enjoyable but it borders on parody far too often. It's outdated and overplayed with enough product placement have an accompanying catalog. It would have made a decent TV special but for a big screen outing it's a meh from me.".

If you've ever seen The Shield or Life on Mars you have an idea of the kind of show it show it was.What the makers thought they were getting from this show I do not know. The title is the only thing this movie has in common with the original. This is a very slickly affair with cinematography befitting a sicfi movie. The musical score is straight from Nolan's Batman and most of the action seems to happen in country lanes and yacht docks when it should have been happening on the streets of London. The scenes that do happen on the streets of London show a bizarre deserted version of London I've never seen not even at 3 in the morning. The story and the acting are not worth mentioning.The plot to the movie is straight out of an American action movie which is a real shame. If you've never seen the original or even heard of it then you probably think it's a passable action movie. However as there was such an opportunity to do something uniquely British and original here it is a huge disappointment. It just goes to show that Hollywood are not the only ones that produce hackneyed crap.".

When you think of the much loved 70's TV series there was always a good thread of humour running through every episode and they were always shabbily dressed and living in run down flats or houses which showed that the job came before their personal comfort. This truly awful film has none of that. Zero humour they all look like catalogue models wearing the latest street gear and live in places that even investment bankers would struggle to afford the rent on. Not one of them can shoot straight and the plot correction what plot must have been dreamt up after a good night out by an illiterate chimpanzee. Even Damian Lewis looks embarrassed to be there. As has been said on a few other reviews when they are being shot at with fully automatic assault rifles they hide behind doors  don't get hit! The car chases are below average even compared to the 70's series which had much less money to play with. Ben Drew looks like he was reciting his parts of the script if there was a script by autocue  as for the rest of the cast you actually wished that the bad guys would polish them all off because they are less than one dimensional and you certainly don't care a jot about any of them. The one homage they did pay to the 70's was the revolting sexism towards women. All the female cast members were there to look good only  as for having Hayley Atwell cavorting naked with Ray Winstone I thought it was laughable and more than slightly sickening. In short don't waste your life even picking up the case of this when it gets to DVD  avoid it like a rotting corpse.".

And of course people hid behind cars  furniture during shootouts and naturally were completely unharmed.The only good things in it were Ben Drew playing himself as usual and Hayley Atwell although she should have known better than to take this part. Even Damian Lewis obviously just needed to pay the Gas Bill as he was utterly anonymous as Haskins.Please avoid this utter piece of total horse manure. Watch an episode or two of the original TV series with Thaw  Waterman on ITV4. It will be a far better way to spend 2 hours.";

The interpretation of Detective Chief Inspector Frank Haskins isn't as robust as it should have been and doesn't get much screen time. Instead a completely new character is introduced and appearing to have more emphasis than the Haskins character. One thing the makers of the movie did was capture bird's eye views of London which one could argue was a bit unnecessary. Even though a lot of movies have it and I personally don't get offended by it at all a lot of the profanity in the dialogue was also on the unnecessary side.I like the original television series but I'm a much bigger fan of movies particularly action movies which is why I enjoyed it.

Of course there's very little danger of Nick Love ever making a movie masterpiece  he's not Godard or Wyler or Welles or even Danny Boyle but as someone who makes movies for British lads he's more than competent . Indeed there's a bizarre irony that this might qualify him as an autuer of sorts . Who better then to bring a classic Brit TV show to the screen ? Well THE SWEENEY was and remains one of the greatest TV shows Britain has ever produced . Unfortunately despite having protagonists called Regan  Carter and Haskins who work for  Sweeney Todd  The Flying Squad they're not really the people we know from the TV series . Regan and Carter are a couple of detectives who are rough diamondswho bend the rules but the incisive blackly comical aspects to their characters is conspicous by its absence . They're not the same people and it's not just down to their not being played by John Thaw and Dennis Waterman That said the film is carried by the cast . Ray Winstone has made a career of playing the same cockney hardman for over 30 years and who better to play a violent anti hero than Winstone ? There's even a post modernist scene where he puts a bunch of battaries in to a sock mirroring his breakthrough role in SCUM . Ben Drew effectively resurrects his role from HARRY BROWN except this time he's working for the law and he's very good as Winstone's sidekick . Somewhat disappointing is Damien Lewis as Frank Haskins because he's given very little to do but since Lewis is a relatively big name in American television you can understand he's cast as a selling point to a US market If there's a serious problem to the movie then it's to do with plot holes . Several times you'll be falling out of your chair saying  Wait a minute don't criminals have access to lawyers ?  or  Don't you appear before a judge if you're remanded in custody ?  but in fairness to Love you don't really notice these deficences as the director ratches up the action and violence .

The story follows the arc of their relationship and his interaction with her family. Told in flashback form initially Hauer is seen as a libertine lothario collector taking trophies from his sexual conquests and pasting them in a book. He sees a sculpture he made of his lost lover and goes into a flashback of his relationship with his wife. He meets the girl falls in love withmarries her and we meet her parents a charming well meaning bumbling father and his shrew of a wife who's convinced Hauer's too much of a bohemian to make a good mate for her daughter. Eventually the petty jealousies the sexual hijinks and the climactic vomit scene prove too much for the marriage and sculptor and his lady fair separate. Flash forward several months and Hauer finds the girl back...";

	schema:reviewBody "Few days ago I watched the documentary Z Channel A Magnificent Obsession 2004 about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s  80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch very erotic  in the raw brutal twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching Z Channel... I was happy to instantly recognize Turks fruit 1973 aka Turkish Delight made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix the movie was available I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well  Verhoeven's early film is as naturalistic earthy brutal erotic humorous poetic poignant and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker Turkish Delight stars young hot very sexy and I mean it  VERY SEXY Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga childlike yet as sensual as Eric was the light of his life the fire of his loins. The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a 75 masterpiece.There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven of his Dutch period especially. Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work fiery temperament and aggressive moviemaking. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him The guy is like his movies brilliant mercurial very daring perverse a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions... The Turkish Delight is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality more than one disgusting and revolting scenes but they had to be in the movie and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers. Be prepared Turkish Delight is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch.810".

	schema:headline " Life and Love As Interpreted by Paul Verhoeven";
	schema:reviewBody "There are many ways in which love and passion can be manifested in a relationship but if it is to prevail it is essential that both sides complement one another physically emotionally and psychologically the feelings borne on the wings of romance must above all else be mutual and deeply instilled on both sides.  When they are not the end result must necessarily be estrangement it is a law not of man but of nature.  In Turkish Delight' director Paul Verhoeven dissects a relationship born of passion examines the ramifications of the attitudes and actions of the individuals involved as well as the couple they become and offers the results to his audience for consideration.  Is it though a story of love and passion?  Yes.  But it comes via a route more analogous to the sensibilities of David Cronenberg than Ang Lee it is decidedly more Craven than Capra.  So don't come to this film expecting tender moments instead prepare yourself for an offering that is provocative that is sexually explicit and finally graphic in it's more violent moments.  This is a film for neither the fainthearted nor the modest but for the discerning viewer only.In the first few minutes of this film we are introduced to Eric Vonk Rutger Hauer an artist with a passion for his work but even more so for experiences that lean more toward the wanton and carnal in aspect.  We instantly become voyeurs as he proceeds to overindulge in a series of lusty encounters an extreme display of irresponsible debauchery that cannot but impel a most unpropitious and subjective first impression on behalf of the viewer who is forced to bear witness to a man of obvious and insatiable appetites and a tentative moral code.  Or so it would seem initially.As the story unfolds however we begin to understand Eric and what it is that compels him thus and it begins with a photograph of a beautiful young woman named Olga Monique van de Ven the woman with whom Eric once shared his life love passion and yes his lust.  It is obvious from the outset that she is no longer with him which evokes the question that has to be asked  Why?'  And from that inauspicious beginning a picture emerges that may not be pretty and is in fact fairly disconcerting.  By the end of the film though all questions pertaining to Eric Vonk and the mysterious Olga have been answered.  The screen grows dark then but the images to which the viewer has just been made privy are ones that are going to remain in the mind's eye for some time afterwards.Working from a screenplay by Gerard Soeteman adapted from the novel by Jan Wolkers Verhoeven establishes himself as the antithesis of Nora Ephron presenting his love' story in terms that are decidedly raw and primitive. Though he does manage to establish the fact that Eric does have deep love for Olga it is lust that seemingly dominates the picture and though there is a dramatic twist to the story it all comes across more like a twisted fairy tale than anything else.  Verhoeven uses violence to express the same sentiments Ephron for example does through compassion and empathy.  But that is his style.  It's his prerogative it's his turf it's his film.  And Verhoeven as much as says to his audience that if you don't like it you can leave.  It's not as if he doesn't have respect for his viewer though rather it seems as if it's something he simply has not considered. If you can get past the baggage with which Verhoeven inexplicably saddles his own film there is an interesting if not riveting story to be found. But like Cronenberg's affinity for slime and things that ooze Verhoeven apparently cannot escape his affinity for violence even when it works to his detriment.  In the case of this film it results in certain scenes that are too avantgarde to be effective within the context of the overall film. These are scenes in which Eric is hallucinating or day dreaming about particular aspects of his relationship with Olga.  They are abrupt insertions into the narrative that simply do not mesh with the flow of the film.  The seam left by the weave as it were is just too apparent.  Beyond the shock value which is minimum it just doesn't work.On the positive side Verhoeven does extract worthy performances from his stars Hauer and van de Ven.  Hauer in his feature film debut and at this point some eight years away from his American film debut in Nighthawks' displays a natural ability in front of the camera and seems comfortably uninhibited which enables him to use his rugged good looks to the best advantage.  Eric is a complex character of single minded intent which Hauer conveys quite ably in his performance.  Van de Ven also makes her motion picture debut here and beyond her obvious beauty there is a definite indication of the talent that would soon bring her international acclaim though her star has yet to rise above the American landscape.  Her portrayal of Olga is convincing and her myriad charms are neither misplaced nor misused by Verhoeven here.  And commendably she manages to transcend the mere use of her physical attributes and create a memorable character with a truly affecting performance. The supporting cast includes Tonny Huurdeman Moeder Wim van den Brink Vader and Dolf de Vries Paul.  This film is definitely not for everyone it fails as entertainment but succeeds as an examination of the extremes to which we as humans are susceptible.  Turkish Delight' then will be received in any number of different ways.  Some will be shocked and appalled by what they see on the screen others will be offended.  And still others will understand that what is depicted here is a very real reflection of things that go on in a very real world as interpreted by Paul Verhoeven. 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "Turks fruit has been voted best Dutch movie recently. I can see why Turks fruit is a delicious treat and perfectly mixes an heavy love story with dramatic and realistic moments life is filled with.Turks fruit is fine example of good storytelling. The movie is carried by the characters that are very realistically portrayed. Rutger Hauer Monique van de Ven and Dolf de Vries really are some fine actors. Paul Verhoeven shows with this movie that he also is a great actor director. This movie marked the first real big movierole breakthrough for both Hauer and van de Ven and also for Verhoeven himself.The movie is filled with some typical and subtle Dutch humor which I really enjoyed in this movie. Some of the characters might seem a bit odd but I can assure you that all of the characters are very realistic and are nothing uncommon here in the Netherlands.The movie is really daring especially for its time and is not afraid to show some 'skin' and some explicit scene's. But all of it is done with lots of style so the movie never becomes offensive. The movie is also filled with what later become some typical trademark Verhoeven gore. But all of it serves a purpose in the movie so it never feels forced like its deliberately put in the movie to shock the viewers. Verhoeven is a master in this. This is the first Verhoeven movie were he uses the same style which he still puts in his movies these days. The first typically recognizable Verhoeven movie you can say.The nice little soundtrack is composed by Rogier van Otterloo who later also worked on Soldaat van Oranje and Keetje Tippel with Verhoeven again. The harmonica solo's are recognizably done by Toots Thielemans who might very well be the best harmonica player of all time. The cinematography is done by Jan de Bont and gives an at times nice and realistic view of the Netherlands in the '70's. Not THE best Dutch movie of all time in my opinion that still is Soldaat van Oranje but this movie absolutely most certainly is a romanticdramatic masterpiece with lots of symbolism and unforgettable and powerful moments in it that perfectly shows the early talent of Verhoeven Hauer and van de Ven.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In every frame of every second it is apparent that its makers live in a society where such big issues that have America in an uproar like birth control homosexuality and sexuality in general are no big deal. Of course there are also some parts in this film that make me ask what the ! is wrong with Dutch people?. I'll deal with those parts of the film first this next section may ruin the film for those who have not seen it.1 The scene with Rutger Hauer looking in the toilet before flushing it. Funnily referenced in Basic Instinct twenty years later this was a truly revolting scene that made me really apprehensive about watching the rest of the film. Thankfully it gets a little less revolting as time marches on.2 The scene with Rutger Hauer vomiting on everyone present at the dinner party. This was truly disgusting to watch but also damned funny because the burgeois society people that Hauer is dining with are so repulsive that they really do make a man feel like throwing up. It is however quite repulsive how we are just shown vomit all over everyone.The plusses for this film far outweigh the negatives however. Seeing how the love between our main characters defies everything from societal boundaries to mortality makes this film a mustsee. I just don't recommend attempting to eat anything while you're watching it.".

	schema:headline " A Truly Sincere Love Story Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Turkish Delight is one of those films that is a rare gem. In my opinion this is Paul Verhoven's finest piece of work. I can rarely say that a film deeply touches my life but this is one of those cases. It's power just overwhelmed me. Eric Vonk is a somewhat carefree and rebellious young artist that finds true and undying love in the arms of young Olga an equally as free spirited young redhead. Though their relationship is very sexually dynamic it is also filled with sincere tenderness and honest devotion. Unfortunately Eric is left with the harsh reality of adulthood and heartbreak when Olga leaves him for very questionable reasons. Eric learns that sometimes love is so strong that nothing can extinguish it. The power of the film lies in its gritty realism. This isn't a film that tries to leave out the gorey details of life. As a matter of fact Paul Verhoven is very in your face. He wants his audience to experience a range of emotions and even feel the need to turn away here and there. One scene that immediately springs to mind involves a toilet... However in the end I could't help but be overwhelmed by the beauty of the love story. It is the most powerful film of its kind in my opinion. Unfortunately the film is not that well know in the US. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1974 but it seems to have somewhat disappeared after that. The film is ranked the best Dutch Film of the Century and certainly one of its most popular. The novel written by famed Dutch author Jan Wolkers is read in many Dutch schools. It continues to sell many copies to this day. However it went out of print in the US in 1983. While copies are available from used online book sources the price tag is usually a bit steep. Jan Wolkers' novel is truly a masterpiece. Like the film it uses gritty and sometimes obscene language but it never fails to ooze with passion and love. The reader cannot help but feel Wolkers' love for the young redheaded creature. A musical version of the story is opening in Amsterdam however I am not sure that anything can compete with the work of art that Verhoven created. The 1974 film will always be the one and only in my heart.".

The couple's raw youth is magnetic there are a number of stunts patently performed without doubles but their irreverence can occasionally be as awkward as it is entertaining. Similarly the outwardly stuffy parents and their coterie have a characteristically Dutch tolerance for the brash carefree couple. The heartrending close to the film comes not by cause of intractable opposition between the groups but as an example of their ultimate similarity despite it.Verhoeven uses Speed director Jan de Bont as his DoP. Their collaboration is a feast of meticulously framed perpetual motion and zest the very equal of Hauer's reeling idboy. But it's not just a document of raucous youth getting it on.

However Turks Fruit is nothing more than the Dutch Love Story as moody artist Eric Hauer falls in love with Olga Monique van de Ven after the young lady pick him up from the side of a motorway.  The film is littered with so much bawdy humour I'm sure Benny Hill was kicking himself somewhere for not thinking of it in one particular cringe inducing scene Eric gets himself caught in the zip of his pants the couple then has to drive around franticly to find a set of pliers.  I'm sure this kind of schoolboy theatrics played well to the Dutch poloneck brigade but as the film shifts into more serious territory the humour only deflates any building melodrama that Verhoeven was probably shooting for.Another problem with the film is Hauer's character Eric he's too much of a chauvinist and bully not only towards Olga but even more so to the numerous women he sleeps with after she has left You're fat is just one example of his pillow talk.  We never feel anything for him not that Hauer isn't good in the role he plays it very well but playing butch carefree characters has never been too much of a stretch for him.  Van de Ven is impressive as the liberated Olga and she would go on to give another fine performance in Keetje Tippel but she is used too much like an object and never really becomes likable enough.  Definitely a product of its time the sexual revolution was noticeably in full swing as Eric goes from woman to woman without a seconds though about the consequences.  It's this dating that also detracts from the film.  Whatever Verhoeven was trying to say about relationships and the constant power play between men and women he just doesn't get the balance right.  All in all Turks Fruit is an impressive early feature that tries to belie it's exploitation roots and to become series storytelling just a little too late in the game. 610".

The plot is located in the early 70ies in Amsterdam and features Monique van de Ven and Rutger Hauer who give a really great performance. The supporting actors are also very well chosen and there are no lengthy parts in the story that can make you laugh and cry at the same time.There are few movies that are able to create an atmosphere that intense. But be warned  this movie polarizes  either you love it or you hate it.I'll rate it a 9 out of 10.".

He's so likable and funny one dining room scene that has him nearly about to eat a horse's eye where he stands up and complains is memorably funny as sex driven and independent Eric who likes to use woman's pubic hair as moustache's part of his art or who isn't afraid to jump in the back of beautiful chick's convertibles while at traffic lights.

Basically Eric Vonk Rutger Hauer is a highly talented sculptor and he has a habit for picking up random women from the streets and having sex with them at his studio but it is clear that he is only doing this to try and get over the breakup from Olga Stapels Monique Van De Ven and through flashback we see him recall his relationship with her. Eric was trying to hitch a ride and Olga picked him up as a hitchhiker and immediately they connect sexually and spiritually and after somewhat of a short time they start living together and marry this relationship is strongly disapproved by Olga's mother Tonny Huurdeman because she does not like his sculpting bringing in only occasional commission. The couple still get married despite these opinions and he is accepting by her family but after having many adventures together she is starting to act strangely and she is seen at a family party with a businessman flirting so the couple have strong argument until he slaps her and she leaves him. Eric in anger trashes his studio ruining anything that reminds him of Olga and this is when the film comes out of flashback to present day he still obsesses about his wife but they do occasionally see each other each time with her acting more and more outrageously often hanging around with other men and the family are not allowing him to visit her until he will agree to end the marriage and divorce her. Eventually he does confirm the divorce and she quickly marries an American businessman but this relationship does not last that long as it fast goes wrong and he returns to Holland and she is once again becoming flamboyant with her dress sense but she is losing logic. Eric meets her they talk a little and she collapses and is taken to hospital she is diagnosed with a brain tumour which means that she is to go into surgery but unfortunately not all of the intervention could remove the fatal problem so she will definitely die. All Eric can do for Olga is spend whatever time they have left together caring for her and having refused for some time to eat he one day brings her some Turkish delight this becomes the only thing she will eat as she worries her teeth will be broken by harder food and in the end she does indeed tragically die. Also starring Wim Van Den Brink as Olga's father Hans Boskamp as Winkelchef Dolf De Vries as Paul and Manfred De Graaf as Henny. Hauer before becoming well known for dark and villainous roles proves a good choice as the man with an obsession for sex and his art and Van De Ven is also suitable as the beautiful who shares a passionate connection on and off with him the film does mostly consist of the voyeuristic nudity and sensual sex scenes in many situations including bizarre and shocking moments during but unlike Showgirls they work as part of the love story and are very interesting to watch unfold it adds up to a marvellously inventive erotic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!".

His framing here is also different to his other films the director adopting a highly freeform style of shooting lots of handheld camera work no storyboarding little rehearsal and a preference for early takes all in an attempt to captures raw and spontaneous natural performances.The film's plot is really insignificant. It's the tale of an artist Rutger Hauer who has trouble dealing with his wife's Monique van de Ven selfish mother. This friction leads to an intense courting and marital relationship. Eventually husband and wife grow apart only to be brought back together by the realisation that Monique has cancer. When his wife dies Rutger Hauer walks sadly off into the sunset. It's an R rated take on Arthur Hiller's Love Story.It's a trite story but Verhoeven inserts some simple visual metaphors to elevate things. Artwork is compared to the passion of romance whilst decay and maggots crop up again and again to highlight the cancerous way the couple's relationship gradually collapses. The film is constantly switching between two aesthetics a colourful pleasing palette good times and a really nasty griminess bad times. 7.910 Worth watching once for its style bombastic pace catchy musical score and some beautiful Dutch women. Rutger Hauer comes across as a sex starved brute until the final act in which Verhoeven lingers on his sculptors and artwork all of which feature pregnant women and babies.

This is more adult and you do follow the story of a gifted artist and his wanton lover  in the early 70's.I too had to laugh at the vomit scene  you'd never see that in American Cinema back then for such a love tale and how 'bohemian' the female was  not the male. This was liberating for women during the women's liberation movement kinda thing. Rutger Hauer played his character of a gifted struggling 70's artist well  knowing what he wanted and how uncompromising he was to his art  but on the other hand would do what it took to support he and his wife.I had to find this film to remember it  it was shown on the Los Angeles based Z channel but I didn't remember seeing it.

What really happened to her in America? There's a scene with Olga getting examined and she says something like He hurt me and the technician replies I know. Makes me think there was more to this  or was Olga just responding to the exam? Funny thing though  I never knew the name of the candy I loved so much as a child  until this movie and so this did have quite an emotional impact for me as tragedy struck these two.

Next to that we can sometimes get a glimpse of the impact the end of the movie has on him and how his life goes the same way as hers mentally in the end.Most of the movie is quite light and fun without to much heavy emotionsnext to extreme love.

	schema:reviewBody "Brad Pitt fans please note that this Yugoslavian film was first made in 1988 and edited for rerelease in 1997 due to Brad Pitt's popularity.This film I feel would fall into that sobadit'sgood category. The acting from Guy Boyd as the father is nothing less than terrible and Cheryl Pollak although an attractive presence could have done slightly better too. There are also strange surreal scenes which really do not fit it and distract from the poignancy of one boy's story eg a scene with an old man stamping on condoms don't ask and a long scene of Pollak singing to Pitt's dad! Apart from these faults it is actually a very enjoyable piece of tosh.Brad Pitt's performance can not be faulted as a young man who has been forced to live his entire life inside a leather shell with only two tiny holes for his eyes and one for his mouth. No mention was made about how he goes to toilet or bathes come to that!. Pitt put across well to the viewer the internal emotional torture that his character felt by not being able to go out in the world and do normal young man things and showed that although he was wearing the suit to stop the external torture of the sun blistering his body his inner feelings which are actually more important in a lot of ways were constantly hurting. On doing some research after the film I found that the skin disease isn't actually medically right but it seemed real and I am sure there must be similar conditions.Pitt's character falls in love with Pollak's character in the story so decided to take off the suit and live a few days of happiness with her out in the sun despite it meaning the end of his life. He then gets hurt even more when he tries to kiss her and she turns away realizing that she only fancies him back when he is in the suit. So it is more the air of mystery and the fascination on her part which makes her like him not him as a person. She actually asks him where his masked friend is.When Pitt comes along in the mask she decides to allow him to make love to her but of course this has to be done in the dark. She doesn't realize who he is until he leaves a locket behind for her to see. The ending is then extremely poignant but I will say no more in case you do ever get to see it.In summary I would definitely recommend that all Pitt fans and even males who are just interested in rare movies lol give this a go!".

	schema:reviewBody "This obscure film from Yugoslavia would probably be even more obscure if it didn't star the thenunknown actor Brad Pitt. And undeservedly neglected as Dark side of the Sun is quite a beautiful and utterly surreal piece of filmmaking. The young Rick suffers from a rare skin disease if he is exposed to sunlight or any bright light his skin will quickly deteriorate and he will die in just a matter of days or weeks. because of this Rick must wear a bizarre SM style leather body suit and matching black leather mask all the time! Nobody can see his face and he rides a motorcycle so as not to appear too strange in his leather suit. A chance encounter with a beautiful American girl Rick is also American but lives in Yugoslavia forces Rick to reevaluate his own existence. He decides that a week living life as a normal kid is worth a lifetime of living separated from the World. This film has a lot going for it such as the beautiful Yugoslavian scenery and glimpse into their culture. Filmed just before war broke out in this land the film provides an opportunity to see how wonderful and peaceful Yugoslavia was before the late 1980's. The story is unabashedly romantic and tragic and possesses a rare innocent quality to it. The director wisely decides to score the film with beautiful classical music which adds much intensity to the already emotional tale. Filmed mostly in a gorgeous mansion by the sea Dark side of the Sun has a distinctly foreign film style to it which i wasn't expecting. American films from this period usually have a very dated look to them but this movie has aged well. I believe director Bozidar Nikolic cast a physically beautiful actor in the main role intentionally making the fact that he must live wearing a mask that much more tragic and sad. Dark side of the Sun possesses a surreal quality. It plays out much like a Greek tragedy or some bizarre fairy tale and it's conclusion is not exactly a happy one but considering it's a story of a young person living out their dream you don't feel depressed at the films end. Although it is difficult to see Rick's physical beauty destroyed. Not surprisingly this movie did not score too high here it is strange and not for all tastes. Recommended though for fans of foreign film or just bizarre and unique cinema.".

	schema:headline " A movie where 80 of the cast has names that end in 'VIC'!";
	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in and around Yugoslavia Dark Side of the Sun is quite a nice little film. Brad Pitt plays Rick a young man born with a serious skin condition which forces him to shield himself from any sort of lighting. He lives in the dark and travels in the daytime in a 'Blackout New' kind of leather face mask. At home he can only remove the protection so long as he remains in absolute darkness. Rick is tired of this and humors his father who travels with him around the world in search of medical specialists that may be able to provide his son a cure. But Rick soon decides that enough is enough and decides that he doesn't care about the consequences if in fact the potential extent of damage done by his exposure to the sun is even a reality given how rare his disease is. He gets rid of the mask and get's to experience so many things in a different way even interacting with people he may not have before. Rick experiences a rejuvination.In doing so he meets a young American actress who was staying with a group that was performing in the town square festivities. And he falls in love with her. But she adores Rick as a friend while she is keen on the 'dark masked rider' she happened to meet at a party one evening. And that is who she is in love with not knowing that Rick is the same person. Rick plays something of a double life like Cyrano de Bergnac style but as one person. Rick doesn't tellt he girl that he and the masked rider are the same person. He just seems to enjoy her company and I suppose doesn't want her to feel pity for him and ruin everything if she were to know that his exposure to the sun would mean imminent death. He doesn't want to spoil how great he feels about everything. Dark Side of the Sun turned out to be a very good movie though it is a sad story. There is some minor flaws in the film. As one viewer previously mentioned if they were to get rid of the leather suit to live again they wouldn't put it on just to play a double life to charm a girl. I would definitely agree. He didn't seem to detest the suit much so long as he could be with the girl. But I would think that his convictions for living again would be so strong as they are throughout the movie that he wouldn't even want to lie to the girl. But like I said it was probably also a matter of his not wanting her to consistingly look upon him with guilt or pity.Also for a young man who spent so much time in a full leather mask I would expect that he would not only be pale and thin but probably have very thin hair or little hair at all. It is very uncharacteristic of Brad Pitt films nowadays but in this as young Rick he's a natural about it. Everyone else is good too. And the setting what little you get to see of Yugoslavia is gorgeous. It seemed like it would have been better however had it been a foreign picture and you even get this impression from the beginning with the folk music introduction and relatively old looking titles. But it's definitely worth seeing.".

The locales are beautiful the light is that Adriatic sunlight that is so marvelous that the movie is great to see just from a cinematographic aspect. And Mr. Pitt actually did some much more than just getting bydecent acting in this one one of the hardest things to do in the profession is to be the object of a tearjerker and he successfully pulls it off. It is a shame he was just compensated some 10k12k for this picture and in some recent ones so much for so littlebut then he has had his distractions so I shouldn't carp. Excellent performances by the father and love interest characters round it out.The faithhealer aspect was a bit jarring as I was not aware that this had been a YugoslavianSerboCroatian tradition and it seemed a bit NewAgey to me though I have since been shown an Ivo Andric story where it was mentioned in that region in an 1890s setting so it is presumably legitimate background. The other elementssound direction etc. were up to highquality low budget studio production in the States and better than most of those. The dialogue flows well and the original language is clearly English this is not a dubbed movie. I am surprised it went to video directly I feel it could have easily gone to a successful theatrical release. Much much worse has done so and profited greatly. It deserves a looksee.".

The storyline was definately there a young man whom throughout his whole life has had to live in darkness because of a skin disease longs for the intimacy that he could never have. So because of his skin disease the only way that he could live life was if a the windows in his home were all shut tight and b if he traveled around on a motorcycle with a leather suit that showed no skin. Not that the movie's heart was in the wrong place I mean it shows that whole angstylonging we have as we grow from teens to adults. We all want something that we probably can never have. And it kills us to know that. And it also brought up a very interesting skin disease that most people or myself didn't know about. So it educated the viewer as well.The main problem with the movie? Just the acting. It was horrible. Not that I could do a better job but my goodness. Brad Pitt was definitely good can't really deny that sparkly smile and bright baby blues but as for some of the other costars that I won't mention it just made some of the dialogue a little hokey. Particularly one scene which was just awful. I laughed instead of I guess cried it was a weepy moment. But for some reason...I stuck it through. I watched this movie even though it was difficult.

As I am a male senior citizen I don't get palpitations at the sight of Brad Pitt but I do like and respect him and have enjoyed most of his movies. Some of the acting and parts of the script leave a great deal to be desired. However this movie has a very Film Festival European feel to it and in my view is a bit too deep for most North American film fans insult intended. The scene of him frolicking in the ocean with the dolphins and his description of the most wonderful day that he had ever spent moved me tremendously. Life is made up of choices and the choice for the hero was one day of great happiness and joy or a lifetime of imprisonment.".

It's true the magic 3 day period was over but it couldn't have happened all so suddenly.Then his skin and hair looking so perfect considering he had spent all his life trapped in that suffocating leather costume...The fight scene totally bad when his father knocks three guys down with a slap...And a scene with a topless bimbo disgusting and out of place.But if able to ignore some cheesy scenes and concentrate on Brad Pitt's performance the film is not bad after all.

I had no idea I was watching Brad Pitt who is usually miscast in movies he doesn't belong in such as 'Cool World' and 'Se7en' and was intrigued by the chemistry between his character and the father. I really liked the scene where the father went back to the bar looking for the Americans even though the fighting was unconvincing and loved it when he popped the barkeep in the forehead heheh. I was so charmed by the woman that I wished I was dating her myself. Interesting and disappointing that there are no pictures of her on google. The ending was unique in that it ended abruptly with it's point having been made and went straight to credits while you were still thinking about the finality of it. An American film would have drawn the ending out laboriously with plenty of 'tragic' sounding music to try to look deep.

The role was played by Brad Pitt  he also has in this film trouble in his family as his mother is completely bad ridden form a long time and she cant even speak properly while his father being a very caring person for both his spouse and offspring can do nothing to save his son. Because of his skin being so much fragile Brad cant even stay under the light inside of his own home  then he met an attractive  charming lady singer he immediately falls for her and she is also impressed by man in black cover that makes him anonymous to her. What Brad Pitt can do is to just make a very tough decision  to expose himself to light completely that could kill him by the passage of time but he can also his moments of his life time finding eternal love before he has to die whether now or a few years in darkness. I was very impressed by the script of the movie but the execution and finishing disappointed me.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie 45 years ago because of reading its plot about a young man who has a very rare mysterious skin disease but highly dangerous to live with and must be covered from head to toe in a leather suite. The role was played by Brad Pitt  he also has in this film trouble in his family as his mother is completely bad ridden form a long time and she cant even speak properly while his father being a very caring person for both his spouse and offspring can do nothing to save his son. Because of his skin being so much fragile Brad cant even stay under the light inside of his own home  then he met an attractive  charming lady singer he immediately falls for her and she is also impressed by man in black cover that makes him anonymous to her. What Brad Pitt can do is to just make a very tough decision  to expose himself to light completely that could kill him by the passage of time but he can also his moments of his life time finding eternal love before he has to die whether now or a few years in darkness. I was very impressed by the script of the movie but the execution and finishing disappointed me. I believe the acting  production  screenplay and direction was quite below the expectation of such stories.The performance of Yugoslav artist was sub standard  only i think Brad Pitt and his story line father Guy Boyd saved the moments of this film.

I didn't get to watch it from the beginning but decided to check it out when I saw a person with a black leather suit who sounded a lot like Brad Pitt.  I was saying to myself 'What would Brad Pitt be doing in this low budget movie?'.  To my surprise it was Brad Pitt who played the man with a rare skin disease.Although it wasn't until a year or two ago when this movie got aired I knew right away that 'Dard Side of the Sun' came out many years ago.  Brad Pitt seemed really young even younger than when he was in 'Across the Tracks' which came out in '91.  I really liked the background scenes on this movie.  And when you mix the beautiful scenery with motorcycling to me it is really a nice treat since I'm into motorcycling myself.  The whole plot of the movie isn't all that deep.  The man has a disease the man falls in love the man makes sacrifice so he can be with the loved one. I like movies that are simple but fun.  There isn't a lot of effort or at least doesn't look like was put into making this film.  Nonetheless it was entertaining.  If you are a fan of Brad Pitt you should definitely check this one out.".

It occupies such special place becauseIt sparked my passion for learning English as I wanted to understand everything when I would watch the film in the original. Eventually my linguistic skills determined my career path.It gave me the sweet feeling of being truly in love for the first time.It cured my fear of sleeping in the dark.It broadened my horizons for example it made me interested in works by Tennessee Williams.I understand that other people can react to this film differently so I won't urge anyone to watch it.

Pitt or his double plays Rick a teenager who spends most of the film hidden behind a leather mask. This does not give him a lot of scope to convey the tragic nature of his character except through the nontoo brilliant dialogue. Cheryl Pollak is attractive and personable where the role calls for someone truly charismatic. It doesn't help that when he finally removes the mask Pitt is much prettier than she is. On the plus side Guy Boyd lifts the film with an excellent portrayal of Rick's father. It's probably unfair to judge this 1980s film by today's standards but even allowing for that I can't see this as anything more than the kind of movie that passes the time while your lying on the sofa recovering from a bout of the flu.".

They even have characters singing songs such as 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall Rockabyebaby and KnickKnack PaddyWhack  oh so American. Then there's that Beach Blanket Bingo sorta scene with motorcycles on the beach.

Why isn't his skin showing signs of the disease after HOURS of exposure to the sun?? It's only in the final scene that within minutes his skin shows changes.

For example the movie is supposed to take place in Mexico but it took my wife 5 seconds to recognize that it was shot in Yugoslavia. It took me a little longer but I believed her when the first Mexican spoke in a Slavic accent so thick I smelled borscht in the room.Another goof is when the father goes to pray in a church and does it in front of an Orthodox icon. Mexicans are mostly Catholic and Catholics have statues not icons in their churches. Brad Pitt removes his head gear and doesn't have a sign of helmet head. And how about those moles on Cheryl Pollack's neck that appear and disappear depending on whether the makeup girl showed up for work.I could go on but in summary the acting is wooden the story is mediocre and Cheryl Pollack's singing is terrible. Nine years to release a movie and it didn't get better with age.".

For example the movie is supposed to take place in Mexico but it took my wife 5 seconds to recognize that it was shot in Yugoslavia. It took me a little longer but I believed her when the first Mexican spoke in a Slavic accent so thick I smelled borscht in the room.Another goof is when the father goes to pray in a church and does it in front of an Orthodox icon. Mexicans are mostly Catholic and Catholics have statues not icons in their churches. Brad Pitt removes his head gear and doesn't have a sign of helmet head. And how about those moles on Cheryl Pollack's neck that appear and disappear depending on whether the makeup girl showed up for work.I could go on but in summary the acting is wooden the story is mediocre and Cheryl Pollack's singing is terrible. Nine years to release a movie and it didn't get better with age.";

	schema:headline " Taut and well acted but with a nearly unforgivable ending";
	schema:reviewBody "Seven. Yes seven. No I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller nor am I referring to Samurai Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.Particular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory shocker ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably but chiefly my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.Samuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loudmouthed antihero category Pulp Fiction Die Hard with a Vengeance Snakes on a Plane and on the other his more nuanced as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be roles. Black Snake Moan Resurrecting the Champ Coach Carter Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia Regine Nehy and Son Marcus Jaishon Fisher on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds as he is not so much a faceless villain but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire things are routine on Lakeview Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris Patrick Wilson wife Lisa Keri Washington are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt and when his children witness a latenight skinny dip by these two newlyweds the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.Fashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice as per the television advertisements indicate what are they going to do and who are the authorities going to believe who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high you don't even need a knife to cut it and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute truthfully makes few mistakes he allows for character development and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa lets the story develop at a slow burning pace with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace which brings me to the ending.Few endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face but a swift hard kick to the groin.Read all my reviews at Simon Says Movies httpsimonsaysmovies.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Seven. Yes seven. No I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller nor am I referring to Samurai Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.Particular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory shocker ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably but chiefly my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.Samuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loudmouthed antihero category Pulp Fiction Die Hard with a Vengeance Snakes on a Plane and on the other his more nuanced as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be roles. Black Snake Moan Resurrecting the Champ Coach Carter Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia Regine Nehy and Son Marcus Jaishon Fisher on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds as he is not so much a faceless villain but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire things are routine on Lakeview Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris Patrick Wilson wife Lisa Keri Washington are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt and when his children witness a latenight skinny dip by these two newlyweds the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.Fashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice as per the television advertisements indicate what are they going to do and who are the authorities going to believe who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high you don't even need a knife to cut it and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute truthfully makes few mistakes he allows for character development and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa lets the story develop at a slow burning pace with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace which brings me to the ending.Few endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face but a swift hard kick to the groin.Read all my reviews at Simon Says Movies httpsimonsaysmovies.blogspot.com";

	schema:headline " Probably the first movie about racism that doesn't just spout tired clichs.";
	schema:reviewBody "We've all heard the racism is evil! thing preached preached again and then preached again. We get it racism is bad. I'm not racist. I don't know anyone who is racist. Why does every single movie have to remind us of something we teach our children before they're old enough to talk? After I watched Hairspray and Be Kind Rewind in the past year alone I officially had enough. And not only me. At the time my best friend who was born and raised in Africa then moved to the US said the same thing why can't movies just stop beating a pointless dead blood horse? If someone is racist I doubt a movie is going to change their mind. Then out of nowhere Lakeview Terrace comes along and defies every clich you thought you knew about racism movies. And that is really all I have to say about the topic thank God that someone anyone in Hollywood gets that we're sick of being forcefed clichs. Why is Lakeview Terrace clichdefying? It focuses on the gray aria of racism not blackandwhite. It focuses on racism held by blacks not by whites. It veers so far from the racism is evil! standpoint and makes you make up your own mind about the overthetop plot and who was right who was wrong. It's been so long since Hollywood actually let the audience make up their own mind this is like a breath of fresh air.Lakeview Terrace is labeled as a thriller which is half true. The first half builds up the social boundaries of real life testing them and then building them up stronger. It doesn't jump straight to action but soaks you in reality before plunging into the overthetop ending. When the action starts near the ending it is really worth the weight because it has you in a state of social tension. Anyone who says this isn't realistic doesn't understand realistic human behavior. Even in the most outrageous parts of the film there was not a single thing done by anyone that was hard for me to believe could happen in real life. Maybe that's because I have a lot of cops in my family or maybe it's because I'm just more tuned into reality than the optimistichappyHumans are perfect! people that are reviewing this film and calling it unrealistic.The directing writing and technical details are all fine. They're not artistic or find cinema but they're done in a way that makes the film work. The acting from Samuel L. Jackson is flawless. The casting from certain other characters is a little off but it works out in the end.Overall I liked Lakeview Terrace a lot. I'm the kind of person who loves thrillers but as I said this really isn't a thriller as much as a drama with a thrillerlike ending and some thrillerlike scenes scattered throughout. It's a nice break from the unintelligent mess that has become an antiracism subgenre and a nice break from the intense hardcore horror and action movies I enjoy watching. With that said it didn't bore me which really surprised me. Lakeview Terrace isn't perfect it's not a work of art but it's intelligent. I found it very much worth watching.610".

	schema:reviewBody "If you wanted to see a face of shock you should have seen me when I found out the new Samuel L. Jackson vehicle Lakeview Terrace was directed by Neil LaBute. When I think of the man I can only conjure images of the fantastic Shape of Things and In the Company of Men and I haven't even seen that one yet. To watch the trailer for this seemingly generic racially motivated clash between neighbors just made me shake my head in shame. If it weren't for the castor the free screening passI probably would have completely passed the film up without a second thought. So there I was sitting in a packed theatre in a somewhat foul mood as security made us check our phones at the door taking mine despite the fact it has no camera waiting past the advertised start time. And then came Jackson on screen waking up from sleep fixing a photo on the nightstand of he and his wife slowly moving downstairs to meet his children. This is a parent of morals and intelligence telling his son to remove a Kobe Bryant jersey because of what the man stands for and constantly correcting his daughter's English so as not to have her sound like an ignorant girl from the streets. Watching him fold laundry on the couch next definitely woke me up maybe I wasn't going to get what I thought I would after all.We are introduced to this man Abel Turner a cop and single father trying to raise his children right. A man who worked double shifts and extra security jobs in order to move his family outside of the South Central neighborhood he grew up in. Sure he is rough around the edges but he is a man of principle and it seems one that loves his children and would do anything to protect them. This buildup puts an entirely different spin on how he reacts to the moving in of Lisa and Chris Mattson Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson respectively an interracial couple buying their first house. Where the trailer just shows racial tension and disgust the actual film shows someone trying his hardest to get along but truthfully not being shown very much in the way of friendly neighbor from the newcomers. Between making love in their pool within eyesight of Jackson's house and the children looking out the window Wilson throwing his cigarette butts into his yard so as to fool his wife and a little hostility early on one might see where Turner had a point. Is the man a little wrong in the head though? For sure. His intimidating demeanor is not helped by the little tests he performs including pretending to hold Wilson up in his car with a flashlight.There really isn't much to the story besides the escalating tensions mounting between the Mattsons and Turner. What at first can be construed as getting off on the wrong foot soon grows to borderline hatred with a touch of malicious intent. The threats fly and retribution is begunyou shine a flood light into my bedroom I'll do the same. Not too long after do the children become involved acting out against their father wanting to get to know the neighbors while he tries to shield them away. While I did not anticipate the high jump Jackson's games take towards the end stopping any fun that might have been mixed with the not so subtle hints for the newly weds to move going straight into thug territory I was not surprised. The introduction of a character early on has no relevance if the story didn't evolve to the point it does at the end and it's convenient events like this that threaten to ruin what is working. The story is very neatly and meticulously put together but maybe a bit too well done. An obstacle looming heavy over the whole film is the forest fire slowly eating its way closer and closer to the street that the action takes place on. Having such a backdrop always in mind screams artifice and truthfully does take you out of the movie a bit. Yes they are in California but instead of introducing the fire so early on I believe it's the first thing we hear on Jackson's alarm clock radio they could have made it a problem with subtlety. We know the dangers of the area and would believe a fire starting we don't need to be handheld through the ordeal. Also there is an underlying duplicity that crops up often. Jackson's partner is living with decisions on whether to try for a promotion and move his family to a safer neighborhood thus allowing us to find out Abel Turner's similar predicament twenty years earlier. There is also the story of what happened to his wife a tale whose explanation is revelatory to his feelings towards the Mattsons I won't say more but you will see the mirroring for yourself when viewing.When you do look at Lakeview Terrace from afar you will see some very intriguing instances of race social status and other barriers coming to the forefront as catalysts for the strained relationships cropping up. These are the kind of issues you expect LaBute to grasp ahold of and do something inventive and provocative. There are moments don't get me wrong but in the end this is a studio picture and I'm sure his hands were tied just enough to keep it all reined in. However there is that edge to it sometimes more pronounced than others along with a great performance from Jackson as well as the others. With a fitting conclusion and overall entertaining suspense I'd say LaBute has found a happy medium between Hollywoodfare and his indiestage sensibilities. I just hope he goes full indie next time because that is where he truly excels.".

The problem comes in the film's final act as the story culminates in forced cacophony that pushes the boundary of believability over the edge.

	schema:headline " A surprisingly good film! Just not a work of art..";
	schema:reviewBody "So I have to be brutally honest here I was mainly looking forward to see Lakeview Terrace because I really thought it was going to be awful. And it did look that way to me by the trailers. So I went to laugh at it but when it started to keep getting better and better I couldn't really laugh at it anymore. Now not saying that this movie does not have flaws because IT DOES. But it surprised me with its thematic elements and really suspenseful scenes. But the cons are that it is a really heavy PG13 film and I personally thought they could have made it 10 times better if they had crossed the line into 'R'which wouldn't have taken much more and really fleshed out some things that are just hinted at because of their content. And the main con to the film for me was that there was no message at the end of the movie. It just ended no theme or statement about the story. Just ended without saying Now the moral of the story is... So overall I'd recommend this movie to you. The good outweighs the bad and its really a lot of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lakeview Terrace what could have been a great thriller turned into a complete and total mess. I'm honestly surprised that this movie has the rating that it does I'm trying not to insult anyone just honestly how could you take this seriously? It was so horribly written and I was actually looking forward to this film. My major problem was that the character development there wasn't any you go on this roller coaster ride where you think you might understand why Samuel L. Jackson's character is the way he is but instead they go back into making you just brutally hate this guy. This is how beyond insane this movie is... Samuel L. Jackson goes from this stern uptight guy to a bully to a chainsaw maniac killer to just plain psychotic and honestly this guy is never given a solid reason why he turns this way you're just left with five million questions and on of the worst endings I've ever seen.Chris and Lisa an interracial couple the nicest couple you will ever meet the couple you would love to be friends with finally got a home of their own in what seems like a very nice neighborhood... well that is until they meet Able their black widowed neighbor who also happens to be a police officer... who also happens to not approve of their relationship. From the get go Able is pretty much a rabid dog who threatens Chris off the bat saying to leave the neighborhood and that he doesn't like them. He just cannot be reasoned with when Chris and Lisa have an unexpected surprise they were not ready for that gives their marriage a shake Able isn't helping when he goes as far as to threatened their lives.Honestly this is one of the worst films I have seen this fall season it was beyond unrealistic and you have no compassion for some of the characters. Not to mention there is a constant rubbing in your face of the race issues it's not just Samuel L. Jackson that doesn't approve of this relationship all of the family and friends make some kind of disrespectful comment on it I personally know 3 interracial couples and they don't receive that much hate or disapproval it was hurtful on that level. I recommend you stay away from this movie it's slow paced and the thrills are a let down. The story doesn't make much sense and I just found it to be pointless.210".

Abel Turner brings back those memories of being helpless against those that are meant to help us the public.So with that in mind I should have enjoyed this movie by cheering on Chris and Lisa against Abel.

There was far too much superficial gloss to this film. The racist issues were also daubed onto the palate of the film in big heavy lumps by the director Neil Labute. There is nothing subtle about this film.Are there plus points to this film ? In my view they are limited. Labute keeps the tension going well at the start of the film as Abel cranks up the anti against his mixed race neighbours which pays off well as Chris and Lisa having had their tyres slashed are greeted with the message 'You're lucky to have a cop live next door.' But Labute kills his highs with too many lows. Abel is just a racist bigot and overbearing authoritarian. End of really. But Labute juggles with too many story threads to keep the real tension running at a high level. Maybe there is more of the film's real structure in the editing suite. But at 110 minutes in length this film is hardly lean. Labute should have done his trimming before starting to film this disappointment.510 which is a shame as I was really looking forward to this.".

The movie starts off slow and then in the middle it started to get interesting because Jackson's character starts to act like a lunatic and that's what so creepy about his character he's very creepy and crazy. He wants the interracial couple movers play by Wilson  Washington to move out of his neighborhood and they don't want to because they want it to start a nice life and try to give it a few days so that they could work out their plans and have kids but Abel Turner Jackson had other ideas. He has two kids and want to raise them to be good kids and get respect the way he did in his childhood. Suddenly they both were looking at the couple making out in the swimming pool and once Jackson's character sees that he starts to get crazy and wild!! All hell breaks loose from there!! It was a pretty good movie the performances were good the plot was interesting and is very entertaining!! It's well worth your 2 hours go and see it!!!".

It's an old fashioned sort of thriller in the vein of films like Pacific Heights with Michael Keaton or Single White Female that of the warped stranger who starts to interfere psychotically with the lead characters. Blissfully free of any modern fast cuts or flashy editing it takes you back to a time when thrillers had a dash of inspiration and flair.As the man carrying the film Samuel L. Jackson turns in an excellent performance as the protagonist of the tale constantly giving his victims flourishes of false hope then unnervingly reverting back to his unpleasantness and conceitedness. This may not make it the most pleasant of films to watch but the film never lets up on the suspense and keeps you hooked till the end eager for a revelation of what motivates Jackson's hatred and how it will impact on his victims and what it will drive them to do.

Sure enough the first 3045 minutes of the film deliver the level of uncomfortableness that LaBute was after.

Jackson's menacing looks and words and his ability to flash a badge make for quite a nightmare for the two love birds.The film starts out seeming to test our beliefs and opinions on race but then spins off the axis and winds up being almost as ridiculous as The Wicker Man ... I said ALMOST! The last 45 minutes I pretty much just kept thinking to myself ... are you kidding. The ending certainly could have been handled much better given the few moments of brilliance throughout the movie. Quite the copout pun intended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Samuel L. Jackson has been in over 100 movies and proved himself as an entertainment icon. He has played both heroes and villains with charismatic gusto and rampant enthusiasm. In Lakeview Terrace he portrays the primary antagonist Abel Turner with a truly gleeful menace but unfortunately the screenwriters have allotted such an elaborate backstory and copious amounts of piteous moments to this vicious manipulator that it's very evident the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. Herein lies the problem as Turner's descent into madness becomes so psychotic that such empathy is quickly lost.When interracial couple Chris Patrick Wilson and Lisa Mattson Kerry Washington move to an idyllic suburban neighborhood they hope for peace quiet and a fresh start on building a family. What they don't expect to find is their racist sarcastic condescending ruthless grammatically correct and politically incorrect next door neighbor Abel Turner Samuel L. Jackson  who also happens to be a cop. With the law on his side and a sadistic grudge in his heart Turner sets about antagonizing the Mattsons with increasingly violent tactics. Having nowhere to turn and an understandable obstinacy Chris and Lisa fight back with mind games and diversionary methods but little do they know the monster they've unleashed inside the unstable police officerSometimes it's hard to root for the good guy. It's even harder when the antagonist is portrayed in such a way that the audience is supposed to sympathize with him. Lakeview Terrace does just that by offering us the full spectrum of disgruntled police officer Abel Turner's life complete with two children and the stresses of his day job. We're given such an involving examination of his daily predicaments and hardships that we feel obligated to provide our empathy. Too bad he's a complete psycho and his ability to think rationally is rapidly disappearing. As the story veers towards its inevitable conclusion the full weight of the situation dawns on us but the film conveniently ends before the real tragedy surfaces leaving the audience to ponder who if anyone actually triumphed from the whole calamitous confrontation.While Samuel L. Jackson is entertaining in just about everything he's in entertaining not exceptional Lakeview Terrace runs dry with both its lengthy duration and the fact that its storyline is almost identical to 1992's Unlawful Entry. It's a mortifying thought to be unable to turn to the police for help  unfortunately we've already been through that fear with Kurt Russell and an equally impressive Ray Liotta in Jackson's role. Granted that Unlawful Entry is relatively obscure but originality points still can't be rewarded. Additionally the film includes so many unnecessary subplots that the audience practically begs for the drawnout conclusion  repeatedly pounding themes into the viewer's mind accounts for frustration not character development. Plus many of the subplots are left unresolved or purposely forgotten in the hopes that the audience will focus squarely on the crisis at hand but they still linger after both the expected conclusion and the rolling credits. Lakeview Terrace does provide thrilling moments and a villain who loves his merciless taunts but contemplate the real value of the lessons learned and you might negate the fun you've had.The Massie Twins".

	schema:headline " Samuel L. Jackson's Performance Is Terrific But This Suburban Crime Drama Stinks!";
	schema:reviewBody "Samuel L. Jackson doesn't know how to give a bad performance but his choice of movies raises some questions. Wicker Man director Neil LeBute's suburban crime thriller Lakeview Terrace qualifies as a predictable PGrated melodrama that draws its inspiration from a reallife case of racism where an AfricanAmerican cop harassed interracial couples in Los Angeles. This disposabledepressing onedimensional character study in villainy casts Jackson as a 28year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department who doesn't cotton to his new next door neighbors a twentysomething interracial couple without a clue. For the record Hancock star Will Smith sank some of his dough into this heavyhanded hokum.Chris Patrick Wilson of Hard Candy and Lisa Mattson Kerry Washington of Ray have just bought their first house. Chris manages a grocery store and Lisa sits around the house drawing pictures when she isn't forgetting to take her birth control pills. She wants a child to mellow out her racist father Harold Perreau Ron Glass of Barney Miller who didn't approve of her daughter's decision to marry a white bread yuppie. Movies have come a long way since the 1967 classic Guess Who's Coming to Dinner where Sidney Poitier married a white girl. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac appeared in the abysmal remake Guess Who that reversed everything so that white guy Kutcher could wed black girl Zoe Saldana. Everybody got along in these classic as well as lessthanclassic movies. No sooner have Chris and Lisa moved in than they aggravate singleparent cop Abel Turner Samuel L. Jackson of Pulp Fiction who doesn't take kindly to their liberalminded antics.Abel raises teenager daughter Celia Regine Nehy of Pride and young son Marcus TV actor Jasihon Fisher without the benefit of a mother. Abel reveals later to Chris that his wife died in a traffic accident under suspicious circumstances that he hasn't quite reconciled himself to three years later. Abel rules his kids like a tyrant. Not only does he correct Celia's slangridden grammar at the breakfast table but he also reprimands her for wearing her iPod every waking moment. Similarly he doesn't cut Marcus any slack. Not surprisingly both Celia and Marcus are overjoyed when they get a break from dad to spend time with a relative. Meanwhile Abel explains to his green Hispanic partner Javier Villareal Jay Hernandez of the Hostel horror flicks that he moved his family out of the troubled ghettos where he grew up so that they would have a better life. Abel keeps a tight lid on his patrol area just as most cops in crime movies do playing criminals off against other to maintain law and order. Abel has an obese white drug dealer Clarence Keith Loneker of Leatherheads under his thumb and protects Clarence because he serves as an informant.Abel and the Mattson's get off on the wrong foot. Abel welcomes Chris by pulling a fake carjacking while our protagonist sits in his parked car in his own driveway listening to hiphop music. Afterward Abel advises Chris that no matter how loud or how long he plays hiphop it will never made him black. Chris smokes secretly in his car because Lisa won't let him smoke in their house. He aggravates things when he thumps his cigarette butts on Abel's lawn. Abel's blinding security home lights keep the Mattsons from sleeping since they don't have curtains. Chris talks to Abel but gets nowhere. Things really derail because the Mattson's have a backyard swimming pool that Celia and Marcus would die to swim in but Abel doesn't want them hobnobbing with the neighbors. Anyway the Abel's kids play peeping toms one evening when Chris and Lisa have sex in their swimming pool. Abel objects to this behavior and the incidents intensify. Our heroes awaken to their car alarm rush down to their garage and discover the tires on their sedan have been slashed. Abel discusses the situation with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Deputies who responded to the Mattson's call and a Sheriff's Deputy remarks that they are lucky because they live next door to a cop.Lakeview Terrace shares a lot in common with the paranoid Michael Keaton thriller Pacific Heights. No matter what our heroes do Abel beats them to the punch until his own peopleLAPD Internal Affairsgive him the third degree for roughing up a young AfricanAmerican male Damon Richards Jada Pinkett Smith's younger brother Caleeb Pinkett of Charmed who tried to blast Abel with a pump action shotgun during a domestic disturbance at an apartment complex. Internal Affairs investigator Lieutenant Morgada Eva La Rue of CBSTV's C.S.I. Miami and her colleague warn Abel that they are watching him.Jackson smolders with rage in this combustible movie because he doesn't approve of a white guy playing house with a black girl. Jackson's performance is about the only thing worth watching because his costars barely make an impression as a sympathetic couple that have to contend with his cruel shenanigans. Indeed the sympathetic couple are pretty boring. Since the bad cop doesn't have a moral leg to stand on it is just a matter of time until he makes his fatal mistake. In other words the shortsighted David Loughery and Howard Korder's screenplay boasts few surprises. Loughery's lessthanimpressive writing credits include Money Train and Star Trek V The Final Frontier while Howard Korder has penned the TV movie Stealing Sinatra and The Passion of Ayn Rand. None of their screenplays have amounted to much so it's no surprise that Lakeview Terrace is such a woofer. Basically neither director Neil LeBute nor his scenarists have brought a shred of imagination to a potentially explosive but superficial saga. If you've seen the trailer for Lakeview Terrace you've seen more than enough to know that this objectionable opus is worth neither your time nor your money.".

	schema:headline " Sam Jackson returns for Jungle Fever 2008...I mean Lake View Terrace";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching the trailer for Lakeview Terrace I had no idea the film was about racism. The trailer shows an interracial couple moving next door to a black cop and then being terrorized by him. But the motive for his actions isn't mentioned. Only in doing research did I learn that he's against the idea of an interracial couple. Why was it so hard to mention that? Maybe the studio thought too many people would be turned away by a movie about race which makes me wonder why they made the movie in the first place.Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington play Chris and Lisa Mattson an interracial couple who have just into a nice house in Lakeview Terrace a beautiful Californian suburb. Samuel Jackson plays Abel Turner an LAPD cop who's a strict father and menacing cop and a complete racist. Only minutes into the film we learn of his distaste for Kobe Bryant when his son puts on his jersey. I wonder why? He tells him to put on Shaq's jersey instead as if Shaq is any better role model.The movie starts off well. Turner has a good reason for disliking them in the beginning. Chris and Lisa have a public make out session in their pool while his kids watch from an upstairs window.How does Turner handle it? He disables their air conditioner. At that point it becomes clear that Turner is far beyond a typical racist he's complete psycho. And that's when Lakeview Terrace looses all its credibility.Turner is supposed to be a dedicated father whose sole purpose is to protect his kids. That gives him humanity. That makes him a believable character. But half way through the movie his kids are sent away so Abel can do things completely out of character like hosting a bachelor party at three in the morning.I can't blame Samuel Jackson for creating such ludicrous character. His performance is decent but certainly not his best work when it comes to yelling and acting crazy. Blame the writers. I imagine that at one point Lakeview Terrace was intended to be a realistic film about a real people in a real situation an interracial couple moves next door to a bitter racist. But I'm sure that was changed to make the movie more exciting. The bitter racist was transformed into a bitter psycho racist who does things that no human being would ever do.I sure hope no one saw this movie expecting just a routine thriller. Films about race can be hard to stomach at times I hope the people that saw this movie knew what they were getting. But despite themes of race this movie has nothing to say about race. It's a silly movie that just uses racism as an easy motivation for one character to terrorize another.There are several opportunities where the film makers had a chance to say something about race. Turner's daughter wonders what it would be like to date a white boy that she likes. Well as interesting as that would be it never happens. What a waste.Chris and Lisa mention children numerous times. And it becomes clear that bringing an interracial child into the world is an issue in this movie but that sub plot has no pay off at all. What would Turner think of a mixed race child living next door? Well he never knows about it so what's the point? Despite my grievances with this film I must admit it is quite exciting. You never know what Turner is going to do next and creates genuine suspense. But that suspense isn't strong enough to cover the foul stench this film leaves behind when it ends. Not one minute of it is believable and each scene gets more ridiculous then the one before it. Lakeview Terrace seems to be a nice place to live but the movie isn't worth the time.My grade D".

	onyx:emotionText "After watching the trailer for Lakeview Terrace I had no idea the film was about racism. The trailer shows an interracial couple moving next door to a black cop and then being terrorized by him. But the motive for his actions isn't mentioned. Only in doing research did I learn that he's against the idea of an interracial couple. Why was it so hard to mention that? Maybe the studio thought too many people would be turned away by a movie about race which makes me wonder why they made the movie in the first place.Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington play Chris and Lisa Mattson an interracial couple who have just into a nice house in Lakeview Terrace a beautiful Californian suburb. Samuel Jackson plays Abel Turner an LAPD cop who's a strict father and menacing cop and a complete racist. Only minutes into the film we learn of his distaste for Kobe Bryant when his son puts on his jersey. I wonder why? He tells him to put on Shaq's jersey instead as if Shaq is any better role model.The movie starts off well. Turner has a good reason for disliking them in the beginning. Chris and Lisa have a public make out session in their pool while his kids watch from an upstairs window.How does Turner handle it? He disables their air conditioner. At that point it becomes clear that Turner is far beyond a typical racist he's complete psycho. And that's when Lakeview Terrace looses all its credibility.Turner is supposed to be a dedicated father whose sole purpose is to protect his kids. That gives him humanity. That makes him a believable character. But half way through the movie his kids are sent away so Abel can do things completely out of character like hosting a bachelor party at three in the morning.I can't blame Samuel Jackson for creating such ludicrous character. His performance is decent but certainly not his best work when it comes to yelling and acting crazy. Blame the writers. I imagine that at one point Lakeview Terrace was intended to be a realistic film about a real people in a real situation an interracial couple moves next door to a bitter racist. But I'm sure that was changed to make the movie more exciting. The bitter racist was transformed into a bitter psycho racist who does things that no human being would ever do.I sure hope no one saw this movie expecting just a routine thriller. Films about race can be hard to stomach at times I hope the people that saw this movie knew what they were getting. But despite themes of race this movie has nothing to say about race. It's a silly movie that just uses racism as an easy motivation for one character to terrorize another.There are several opportunities where the film makers had a chance to say something about race. Turner's daughter wonders what it would be like to date a white boy that she likes. Well as interesting as that would be it never happens. What a waste.Chris and Lisa mention children numerous times. And it becomes clear that bringing an interracial child into the world is an issue in this movie but that sub plot has no pay off at all. What would Turner think of a mixed race child living next door? Well he never knows about it so what's the point? Despite my grievances with this film I must admit it is quite exciting. You never know what Turner is going to do next and creates genuine suspense. But that suspense isn't strong enough to cover the foul stench this film leaves behind when it ends. Not one minute of it is believable and each scene gets more ridiculous then the one before it. Lakeview Terrace seems to be a nice place to live but the movie isn't worth the time.My grade D";

This movie teaches me to never move next door to a cop no matter how friendly they appear to be. But Lakeview Terrace is a bit extreme with the cop next door type of deal. Not only that the Mattsons had to deal with a cop living next door but he's a racist. Able abused his power as a police office by spying on the Mattsons and acting upon it. I know somehow that's illegal to snoop into people's privacy. This is one of the best parts Samuel Jackson played in a movie next to Pulp Fiction and Shaft 2000. Kerry Washington was excellent as the Ms. Lisa MattonKerry is versatile. Overall Lakeview Terrace is a interesting movie that build ups to a powerful climaxing ending. Recommend anyone to watch it with a family or friend.".

Other times he just lets the screenwriters do it for him and it turns out far less fascinating or really disturbing as it could have been. Early on the story speaks its promise a conservative LA cop yes conservative first and foremost as one notes the character's disdain for democrats or just liberalism in general played by Sam Jackson sees a white guy Patrick Wilson and black woman Kerry Washington move in. From the getgo there's hostility if at first more subtle and just annoying. And there's some possible questions that could be raised in the course of the running time of the picture if just as possibilities.But the problem very soon to see is that everything that motivates Jackson's character to act the way he does becomes twisted around a plot contrivance. I won't spoil it not to really shield you from it just because it's not worth it if you intend on seeing it but something from Abel's history that shouldn't be so blatant and be more ambiguous or allow Jackson as an actor some room for subtlety or room for interpretation is shoved down our collective gullets. One might wish that there would be more room for threedimensionality in general but at best we get just 2D and at worst it's basically one continuous drumming beat until we almost kind of dread Jackson's character coming in on Wilson and Washingtons' scenes not so much because he's supposed to be menacing but because it throws off the flow of the story. It's not even that Jackson is bad in the performance on the contrary he does the best he can and sometimes does bring that flash or just flinch of the face that reminds us how good an actor he can be.LaBute can't figure out entirely how to proceed with a highly charged drama however without a heavyhanded metaphorical device. It is a fact that the Southern California has been a hotbed of wildfires spreading all about destroying lots of pricey property and leveling to waste millions maybe billions of dollars of revenue. The tactic here in Lakeview Terrace is to take that symbol of fire burning down a city and transplant it into the burning down of racial bonding and peace and yada yada and it's not really a metaphorsymbolwhatever that hits right away  but when it does yikes is it an overbearing claptrap made especially for the climax I was almost pining for that also hackneyed Haggis formula of crashes in Crash.And again motivation and really welldefined characters end up sinking this after the promising first act as soon as Abel's agitation turns to practically psychotic behavior it's hard to actually connect with this past something out of a horror movie. And I don't mean that as something for a cathartic reaction or other. Wilson and Washingtons' characters don't help much either as we're privy to a contrived subplot involving an unintentional pregnancy not to mention Jackson's own semiinteresting subplot with him screwing up on the force.

	schema:reviewBody "Lakeview Terrance is a bizarre film from director Neil Labute. The plot? An interracial couple  Chris and Lisa  enter an affluent suburb and move into a new house. Chris is a caricature of your typical limousine liberal. He's vanilla white drives a Toyota Prius is a wannabe environmentalist went to UC Berkeley listens to gangster rap and marries a black woman. Lisa's father a successful black lawyer despises Chris. Surely his daughter could do better. Lisa is confused her husband's a saint.Unfortunately for the couple Samuel motherfg Jackson lives next door. Jackson plays Abel a bigoted cop and psycho authoritarian who detests Chris. He hates interracial couples despises whites culture mixing and white privilege. As such Abel wages an increasingly violent war on his neighbours. This war has led to many declaring the film offensive postracial nonsense. A film about an ultra conservative black man in a position of power and authority who bullies whites and uses his social position to victimise white men? Surely this is a mindboggling contortion of contemporary racism? Surely it is precisely the opposite which is of priority in the real world? To make matters even more odd Labute sets his film in Lakeview Terrace the neighbourhood where Rodney King was beaten up by white cops an incident which led to huge race riots. What the hell? Labute loves to taunt audiences but his intentions with Jackson's character seem unclear. The name Abel of course refers to humanity's first victim the character out of the Bible who is betrayed by his brother and becomes the first murdered man. But are we supposed to view Jackson as a victim? Does the film support this? Or is his name one big joke? Regardless Jackson is emblematic of a very specific postracial stance. The idea that benevolent racism is okay that everyone is equal and that the portrayal of a bigoted black man is itself a form of equality and not inherently a racial statement. This is the kind of society in which everyone has the right to everyone else's cultural goods and everyone should be proud that they're advanced enough to accept black people not only as homeowners cops and presidents but racists as well.Late in the film Jackson injects into Chris a little liberal guilt. He tells Chris that he hates the fact that as a white man Chris can arrogantly have whatever or whomever he wants including black women without pause without concern without having to ask or worry how he might be received by the rest of the world. The issue of Chris having it all is then mirrored to Jackson literally getting to be the white guy. The problem is he loses his wife and gets shot to death. Even as a white guy black boy's whipped.The film isn't only about reverse racism it's reversed all over the place. Consider its Mexican stand off climax which reverses typical action movie hail of bullets climaxes or scenes elsewhere in which Jackson is reprimanded by superiors for being too violent with a thug when in actuality he was trying to help the kid out. Would a white cop have gotten away with this? Do Jackson's ravings and moral judgements throughout the film have a point at all? Should we be more sensitive and discerning as to what we coopt? Lakeview's first hour is hilarious and features a nice battle between emasculated macho men but the film then quickly turns into a routine domestic thriller. The film ignores the historical roots of Jackson's rage  this is a guy old enough to remember forced segregation  and instead opts to paint Jackson as a crazy guy who's fury seemingly stems from nowhere. Does the film further a trend of stigmatising certain people as madmen thereby only further pushing them out by exclusion or is it parodying a trend? Does Labute intend the picture to be a giant prank on the audience which he's done before so who knows?? It's always very hard to get a reading on Labute. You're never quite sure if he's being deadpan satirical or is genuinely an uber uptight Mormon.6.910  Worth one viewing.".

The part he disapproves of is that they are interracial. He also disapproves of some of their actions such as a skinny dipping scene and when the wife allows his daughter to come over for a swim. You will never forget that scene or the scene where he reveals to the husband how his wife died. My other favorite scenes included the bachelor party and the finale. Jackson gives a terrific performance as a man about to go over the edge as you know he is tight on security with things like the flood lights and the way he always talks down to the kids and neighbors and the villains in a couple street scenes. He is one tough and borderline psychotic hombre. It is somewhat formulaic but it is not a bad formula. I liked the movie and you might like it too. The couple is right to fight back.

If you haven't seen The Counterfeiters go see it. Here's why.The acting is outstanding all the way through. You will learn more about counterfeiting efforts by the Nazis to undermine the British and Americans. This movie has numerous layers to it and avoids the typical clichs that all Germans acted one way and all Jews acted another way. You learn the subtle ways that control over other people is used to manipulate them. Do you put aside your beliefs in order to survive? If so are you being true to those beliefs? Is it better to be a dead morally right person or a live less moral one? These are central themes. Finally does how we make our wealth matter? These aren't ideas unique to cinema but the way the movie presents them is.".

If you haven't seen The Counterfeiters go see it. Here's why.The acting is outstanding all the way through. You will learn more about counterfeiting efforts by the Nazis to undermine the British and Americans. This movie has numerous layers to it and avoids the typical clichs that all Germans acted one way and all Jews acted another way. You learn the subtle ways that control over other people is used to manipulate them. Do you put aside your beliefs in order to survive? If so are you being true to those beliefs? Is it better to be a dead morally right person or a live less moral one? These are central themes. Finally does how we make our wealth matter? These aren't ideas unique to cinema but the way the movie presents them is.";

He witnesses the horrors of camp life fellow prisoners are beaten shot and starved but Sally determined to survive looks out for himself and uses his skills as an artist to secure a more comfortable lifestyle during his incarceration. After taking advantage of his talents his superiors transfer him to Sachsenhausen where he is to oversee the largest counterfeiting operation in history.Here Sally is provided with all the men and equipment he needs to crack the pound and the dollar his criminal enterprises are now government funded. The price of failure is made clear but the counterfeiters are also wary of the price of success as once the currencies have been cracked they will be surplus to requirements their lives depend not only on their successes but also their failures.This is where Burger Diehl the film's moral centre comes into play. Unlike Sally he sees the bigger picture struggling to come to terms with the fact that while his work keeps him alive it helps the Nazi war effort. Neither can he reconcile himself with the fact that while he lives in relative comfort other detainees including his wife and children live in squalor.These moral dilemmas form the basis of the film and in the face of the horrors of camp life Sally tries to shrug them off with De Niro squints and smiles the maxim that one must look after oneself is one repeated throughout the film. It's a very interesting idea and it's one that is presented very well both in terms of style and performance. The camerawork captures the bleak setting effectively and the lead performances are uniformly excellent but the use of tango for the score is inspired. The contrast between the music and the images adeptly complement the film's complicated moral tone. There is also a surprising amount of humour while the bigger picture is indeed bleak there are moments of comedy and even if it is laughter in the dark it is welcome and helps not only to carry the film along but humanise it and its characters.The Counterfeiters is a very enjoyable film which isn't something that can be said for many World War II true stories. Its interesting exploration of adaptation and survival under extreme circumstances makes for an engaging story and one that is definitely worth seeking out.".

Die Flscher is a wellmade and touching movie about the Holocaust and a special division of Jews in a concentration camp that survived by counterfeiting money or pretending to do so for the Nazis. Karl Markovics is the shining light of the cast. Who thought that the guy who came to greater popularity by starring in Kommissar Rex would end up getting roles like this one and playing them to perfection? August Diehl is good too but he comes across as a bit too dramatic at times. The Nazis  and that's the only weakness of Stefan Ruzowitzky's movie  are the way they always are. Ruthless cruel craven and at the same time stupid pigs who do everything to humiliate the Jews at any time. Even though that is probably the way 99 of them really were it would have been more interesting to get a differentiated view on some of them.While Die Flscher may not reinvent the wheel it is a pretty great movie. And although it's typical that Hollywood would pick only a Holocauststory from Austria as an Oscar contender it is exciting as hell for a movie from this country to get a nomination. I really hope that Stefan Ruzowitzky will get the award because his movie deserves it and it could help the Austrian film industry to finally get momentum again.".

	schema:headline " But Is It True?";
	schema:reviewBody "Most Holocaust narratives involve cruel Nazis and virtuous victimized Jews. The Counterfeiters is at least a partial exception. The Nazis in the film are certainly cruel but their cruelty is based on the perverted ideals of their racist ideology and on their need to obey orders or be killed rather than on their being innately evil men. They are capable of decency when it's in their interest.The Jews in the special unit of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp depicted in The Counterfeiters are assembled because of their abilities in such skills as etching printing and in the case of Salomon Sorowitsch the film's protagonist counterfeiting. The triangles sewn into their uniforms are a mixture of green criminal red socialist or communist and in all cases yellow Jewish.Other reviewers have ably described the major theme of The Counterfeiters the conflict between as David Denby puts it in the March 3 2008 New Yorker the relative heroism of the morally intransigent man who refuses all compromise with evil or the trimmer who partly collaborates with an oppressor in the hope of keeping himself and others alive. It may be significant that the German title of the film Die Flscher can refer to falsifiers as well as counterfeiters.Because The Counterfeiters is repeatedly described by its publicists and others as a true story I want to focus on some of the variations between the postwar interrogation statement given by Salomon Smolianoff the reallife master counterfeiter portrayed in the film and the events depicted in the movie. A photocopy of Smolianoff's original interrogation statement can be found on www.lawrencemalkin.com the website of Lawrence Malkin the author of Kreuger's Men an account of counterfeiting operations during World War II.My purpose is not to expose fabrications. Rather it is to explore variations between life and art and to determine whether in a particular work these variations have a pattern that supports a consistent explanation. The Physical Setting In the interrogation statement Smolianoff describes being taken to a special barrack which was located in absolute isolation and surrounded by heavy barbwire. In the movie there are several occasions on which the relatively privileged participants in the counterfeiting operation are exposed to the screams of regular inmates who are being beaten and killed. Such witnessing would not have been possible with the degree of physical separation described by Smolianoff. Pounds and Dollars In Smolianoff's narrative he is transferred to Sachsenhausen after counterfeit British pound notes have been successfully produced in order to work on the more difficult forgery of American dollars. In the movie Sorowitsch is involved with counterfeiting both pounds and dollars. The Man in Charge In real life the German counterfeiting effort was called Operation Bernhard after Bernhard Krueger the SS man who headed it. In the movie a fictional Inspector Herzog arrests Sorowitsch in the mid thirties and coincidentally heads the counterfeiting project during the final months of World War II. Sabotage In the interrogation statement Smolianoff describes the decision to sabotage the counterfeiting operation as occurring when the lights go out during an American air raid We took this occasion to agree between us for the first time to sabotaze sic the whole work. We dealt our tasks and agreed that in the future every one of us should complain about the work of the other in order to gain time because the situation of the war promised to us an eventually sic escape from everything and a liberation by the approaching Allied troopswe fought each other really hard but they couldn't miss sic us because all the work depended on what we were producing.In the movie the sabotage is the result of continual discussion between Sorowitsch the partial collaborator who is concerned primarily with survival and Adolf Burger a printer and Communist activist who is willing to sacrifice his life along with the lives of his fellow prisoners in order to hamper the German war effort. This is the conflict that David Denby refers to and considers correctly in my opinion to be the film's central focus.Like Smolianoff Burger is a real person. He wrote memoirs about his experiences shortly after the war and revised and republished them under the title The Devil's Workshop in the 1970s. The introduction to an interview with Stefan Ryzowitzky the director of The Counterfeiters www.cineaste.comarticlesthecounterfeiters.htm states that Burger played a small but significant part in both establishing and sabotaging the process although in the film he is presented as the leader of the campaign to subvert the operation. I believe that these examples show that there are consistent and coherent explanations for the ways in which Ryzowitzky adapted source material for his film quite simply to tell a better story and to emphasize the difference between the perspectives of SmolianoffSorowitsch and Burger. Throughout history writers have adapted historical events to fit artistic purposes. Another more extreme cinematic example is in The Last King of Scotland where the Scottish doctor who befriends Idi Amin is entirely fictional.These alterations are not on the level of the deceptions of Binjamin Wilkomirski in Fragments or Misha Defonsece in Misha a Mmoire of the Holocaust Years. Although these books are presented as factual they have beyond any reasonably doubt been exposed as creatures of their writers' imaginations. They present both shortterm problems in that they give aid and comfort to those who wish to deny or minimize the Holocaust and more fundamental difficulties in that they lead readers to question the existence of historical truths at any level.In all of these situations they are simple solutions. Dramatic renditions of historical events should include explicit statements of what is and is not historically accurate. Fictional narratives should be published as fiction even if such honesty reduces their status as potential best sellers. In these respects filmmakers publishers and editors all share a responsibility with writers.".

He is soon promoted by Germans to a position of counterfeiting the dollars in the famous Project Bernhard. The trials and tribulations of Salomon's time in the prison are alarming and sad to watch. The movie ends by showing Salomon as a free man who lots of counterfeit money that he recklessly spends in casinos and poker games. For him  after living a life in concentration camp he knows what value the money has! The movie solely belongs to Karl Markovics who has acted magnificently as the counterfeiter. He adds his own style of projecting range of traumatic emotions and thoughts by just a twitch of his eye or lips. Fantastic performance! There are usual characters in the movie that support the protagonist  the fellow prisoners the brutal officer the paternal figure leader of prisoners a prisoner doctor etc.The Austrian Director Stephan Ruzowitzky maintains a tight narration very close to the script he has written. He also creates the brutal Nazi concentration camp feel  the clichd Nazi characters and starved prisoners.Some scenes are too stark and hard hitting that move your heart and make you cry.My only complain but a minor one is the hand held camera used that sometimes distracts us from the serious gravity of steady scene.On the whole a good movie.Stars 7 out of 10".

It's a good story and a tense one but it dos not sing and it will not change your life.One reason is that the Russianborn Salliehis story framed by inconclusive later episodes of his gambling after the war is such an unappealing figure. He is an ugly little hardfaced man expressionless at key moments and extremely difficult to care about. And nobody cares about him. When he gets syphoned off with some others from the direct path to concentration camp death at Mauthausen to work on the Nazi's mad secret project  he is the key to its success. There are bankers printers graphic designers lithographers  not evidently any other counterfeiters at all but we take it on faith that he is an ace at the trade worthy to head up any team aimed at creating banknotes foolproof enough to survive repeated scrutiny in massive quantities. The other men on the team bow to him because he alone can maintain quality control and make the project a success. But do they want to make it a success? Herein lies the obvious dilemma. For Sorowitsch survival is the priority. At the opposite extreme Adolf Burger August Diehl a collotype specialist whose printing experience was for leftist political purposes sabotaging the project is the only real option.All we know is that SS Chief Inspector Herzog David Striesow supervises this business and it was he who arrested Sorowitsch in the first place. Sorowitsch has managed to gain favor in the camp by putting himself forward as a gifted sketch artist who does portraits of officers families. Apparently this has gone on for years before the counterfeiting scheme began. The screenplay is a bit vague about the background of this effort who approved it who masterminded it obviously it is essential to the welfare of Herzog. But as the Nazis' situation becomes increasingly desperate and Berger's efforts to block the making of a perfect dollar keep succeeding Herzog himself is in trouble.There are other important characters that give the story life. The sweet young Russian boy Kolya Sebastian Urzendowsky is a purist living only for his individual style and his love of the classic Russian modernists. Unfortunately he has tuberculosis and no one can save him not the resident doctor Klinger August Zirner nor Sallie with his bargaining power over the increasingly desperate Herzog.All this definitely holds your attention in its rather terrible grip. The duel between Sallie and the idealistic Burger achieves a tormenting level of moral complexity. Sallie is selfish but in saving himself he is saving the whole team in wanting to become a martyr Burger is volunteering the others for martyrdom without their permission. in between there are drones and bankers who simply want to do a job and if possible somehow also stay alive. Outside the counterfeiting team's little compound where the beds have nice linen terrible things happen and sometimes the terror penetrates in to them too.The most powerful sequence is at war's end when the real concentration camp prisoners dirty bleeding and skeletal creep into the money makers barracks with guns unable to believe they are prisoners. This sets the experience in the context of nightmare horror and grasps a minute of the awesome poetry of Fateless' final moments when the fifteenyearold Gyrgy Kves wanders into Budapest and takes a tram wearing his prison stripes. Otherwise good acting and a compelling story still aren't enough to put this in the first rank of films of this genre.".

	schema:headline " A day is a dayThe Counterfeiters";
	schema:reviewBody "It is very interesting how it seems that every film about the Holocaust becomes a modern classic. The Counterfeiters is the latest attempt to breathe life into the subject by showing a true tale of how the Nazis bankrolled the end of the war with fake currency. The story itself is very intriguing and worth a history lesson but as far as a film what we really are given is one more concentration camp experience. There are the Nazis inflicting brutality on the Jewish prisoners the token general assuaging his guilt by helping those he can for personal gain the prisoners wanting to create a revolt and those that just want to survive. While the pretense of why everyone has been brought together is new and refreshing the total package is what we have seen over and over again.Even the gimmick of showing us our lead postwar at the start in order for him to remember the hardships that came before is a bit tired. Would him taking the fake money he made to Monte Carlo after the war scenes have been any different than him going there first us seeing him make it and then cutting back? Not really. What is intriguing is the comparison between Sally Sorowitsch preincarceration and him in the camp. A scoundrel as one character says in his bar before the war Sally is a cocky criminal and womanizer doing what he can to stay in affluence while also honing his craft to crack the American dollar. Once he is captured and able to con his way into a somewhat safe status among the Jewish prisoners we see his survival instincts take over. A selfish man before a selfish man he stays doing all he can to survive the war painting and creating portraiture for the Nazis and their cause. The first sign of life we see is his compassion for a fellow captive on his final transfer. A Russian art student like he once was they shared the same school and professor there Sally gives up his soup and finally shows the solidarity we would expect in that situation. You see amongst criminals it seems there is a code of honor to not give up one's mates. Every jail is the same he says you just have to know the angles and the playsSally is a professional at both.The relationship between this artist and his captor Herzog is a very interesting one. Being the man who arrested Sally before the war Herzog not only got promoted for it but also decides to enlist him to help his cause in the camp that he has started to control. They need each other to survive and that is one of the things that I love about WWII. These Germans are just as trapped in Hitler's regime as the Jews are figuratively yes I know the Jew's had it much worst. Everyone is expendable and must do their job to survive as a high official can even be shot by nothing more than a whim by his superior. I believe one of the best scenes here is Sally at Herzog's house meeting his wife and children and their utter inability to comprehend what is happening around them outside their mansion's bubble.Along with those two the rapport with Sally and Adolf Burger is fantastic as well. These two are kindred souls yet with one main difference. While Sorowitsch looks for his survival and that of those he can see Burger wants life for his people and the country being persecuted whether he is alive to see it or not. Their moral fortitude is the same however and while they may disagree they will never risk the other in order to do what they believe is right. Either way both men are key components in the fall of Germany doing exactly what's needed to be done at the exact right time even though they could have never known it. Sally's ability to get the forgeries made gave them the time for Burger to stall the manufacturing of American currency just long enough for the army to go bankrupt. It's good to see that Burger the man who's book the film is based on decided to not center the tale on himself only allowing one instance at the end to give himself the credit of being a hero. Instead he allows Sorowitsch to take the stage showing his leadership and unflappable calmness when confronted with the most dangerous consequences.When a movie like this relies mostly on the reactions of men at the deaths of their friends you can't usually say much because it's either believable or not. What makes this stand out in that regard is the fact that these men are so far gone that their emotions have been dulled. August Diehl as Burger is the best example of this showing the devastation of finding out what happened to his wife without the capacity to cry. Devid Striesow is great too as Herzog always being the good businessman using tough love while also utilizing a reward system to keep morale as high as possible. The way he plays those around him is effective. As our lead Sally Karl Markovics is perfect. Stoic and always thinking he portrays the man orchestrating everyone's survival with little movement. His blank stare is as emotive as anything else in the film especially when he flinches at gunshots that he knows have hit their targets. By not showing emotion he exudes his feelings even more. Mention should also be made for Sebastian Urzendowsky as Kolya the young art student that Sally takes under his wing. A broken man he is the most fragile and animated infusing some muchneeded life into an otherwise retold version of the same story we've seen before.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is film has proved to be the big International hit of the year so far and on watching it it is easy to see why.The basic narrative of the film is that of one of the world's greatest counterfeiters who just happens to be Jewish in Nazi Germany gets arrested manages to survive one concentration camp then gets sent to another camp where he is used to help produce counterfeit money pounds Stirling and dollars which the Nazis want to use to undermine the economies of their enemies. The fact that he survives is no big secret due to the way the film is structured with topping and tailing scenes at Monte Carlo which occur after the war.Within this narrative which is based on a true story arises the eternal question of whether the prisoners survive because of the triumph of the Human Spirit idealism  ie one certain camp member who does his best to sabotage the operation is he a hero or a person doing his selfish best to survive?  or just plain determinism not to allow the Nazis to get the better of them? The film offers no easy answers to these questions and it is up to us the viewer to make our own minds up. This also applies to just why the Nazis want such huge sums of money is it to undermine the economies as we are told or as is also implied to actually fund their war effort? As one would expect from a film set largely in a concentration camp there some disturbing images and moving moments  the moment when the real passports are delivered or a scene late on when a prisoner not one of those working on the counterfeit plan is seen wondering about like a zombie all Human feeling and responses removed from his body and mind. Such scenes as these are handled with dignity and care and the film treads a careful line between telling a alltoohuman story to which all right minded people can respond and being voyeuristic. Where the film derives its real power is by keeping the film personal. This is another film like 'The Kite Runner' which deals with huge political issues in such a way as to relate them to just a handful of main characters allowing the viewer to make up their minds about the wider political issues being dealt with.Yes there are faults some of the clichs especially of the German guards ie good cop bad cop etc and some of the handheld camera work takes a little getting used to but these are worth overlooking in order to see a film which has a heart and soul and something important to say about the Human Condition.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stefan Ruzowitzky and his cast have done an excellent job of making a film which there was no point in making in my opinion. How many hundreds of times have we seen the same Nazi concentration camp guards torturing and killing the inmates? OK so it is convincing and violent and we really experience the horror of it all. But what is new about this one? Although it portrays the counterfeiting operation of the Nazis carried out by their captive Jews this has been much better covered in television documentaries where the fate of all the money being dumped in the lake for instance is explained missing from this dramatization. I do not see the rationale behind the production. The lead counterfeiter does not do anything heroic in this film and the delays in the operation are caused instead by another inmate with whom he is at odds. So the dramatic premises are also flawed by this as we have a lead character who looks convincingly grim without accomplishing anything other than compliance. His only brave act is to insist on some medicine for an inmate suffering from TB. Otherwise there is no real justification for his being the lead apart from his being a master counterfeiter. The story would have been better to be restructured with the younger man as the hero to give it some dramatic point. The project was misconceived. Just because the Austrians have now proved that they can make a movie well does not mean that they have proved that they can make a movie which is worth making well. The end of the film rings as false as the counterfeit money and seems to me to have been a counterfeit emotion of simulated despair taking refuge in a convenient act of nihilism which is meant to have profundity but instead merely has pointlessness. This film is a pretence at concern not an expression of it. In other words it is 'just a movie' and that is a damning category for a film dealing with such an emotive subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was clear from the first few minutes of the film that the protagonist Solly survived his death camp experience. The scene is the immediate aftermath of WWII and Solly checks into a casino hotel in Monte Carlo along with a suitcase of US Currency. After a brief encounter with a woman he picked up in the casino the scene flashes back to pre WWII in Berlin where Solly is a successful counterfeiter eagerly sought after for his skills in forging identity documents for Jews seeking to flee Nazi Germany. Solly is also Jewish but feels he is clever enough to elude the coming storm. Eventually he is betrayed by a rival and ends up in a concentration camp. However his counterfeiting skills help him escape the gas chambers. The Nazis plan is to undermine US  British currency through a massive counterfeiting project  Solly among other fellow Jewish concentration camp inmates is recruited to lead the effort.The moral dilemma of the Jewish prisoner's ability to survive by helping the murderers of their fellow Jews weighs heavily with Solly and his associates. The movie does an excellent job of portraying the dynamics of the issue from the different perspectives namely the prisoners who want to survive by actively participating in the counterfeiting project and those who would rather die by sabotaging it.As the leader of the counterfeiters Solly needs to walk a fine line between following his own instincts to survive and respecting the imperatives of those who want to sabotage the project ensuring the death of the entire group. There are many films that touch on the narrative of the holocaust victim compromising one's own moral outlook in order to survive. The Pianist  Fateless are two recent critically acclaimed films that explored this territory. I would rate The Counterfeiter superior to both of these excellent films. This was an outstanding film and I recommend it highly.".

	schema:headline " An engaging thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "The Counterfeiters is an interesting film. I admire it for it's subject material too many films about the Holocaust depict the situation as hopeless but these Jews are survivors who change during their captivity. The Nazi regime plans to conduct financial warfare against the allies in the last days of the war ironically they turn to the help of Jews who have expertise in each of the areas needed to oversee the production of the false money. The leader is master counterfeiter 'Sally' Sorowitsch who is able to give the Nazis the results they want and in return he lives a life that many prisoners would envy. The proposal proposes a moral dilemma for the Jews they live by counterfeiting the money but they have to go on living with the fact that they are helping the Nazis kill their chance of freedom. This separates them and one of the counterfeiters named Adolf Burger can't live with the fact that he is financing the Nazis.Like the Polanski film The Pianist this is a story of survival. These men want to live and they know that tomorrows aren't a guaranteed luxury. I imagine they all feel as if they are selling their souls but they want to survive. Adolf Burger is probably the most correct and noble but I see where the other characters are coming from it's hard to be noble when death is everywhere. The Counterfeiters is unlike any other Holocaust film we see some disturbing scenes but much of the terror is implied. We see letters and remnants of Auschwitz in these men and they are in the middle of a hellish concentration camp themselves. They get treated well by their Nazi commander Herzog when they deliver what he wants. He remarks that his success is due to the fact that he doesn't treat people like dirt but he treats dirt like people. In one of the most suspenseful scenes he takes the Jews out of bed for an announcement he gives them a ping pong table to congratulate them on successfully counterfeiting the pound they are aghast because they feared Herzog was rounding them up to gas them. Many of the Jews think it is easier to ignore than to acknowledge. Burger when he challenges them on this horrible presumption. The Counterfeiters deals with questions and themes that are interesting and intriguing It asks the right questions and brings up the right points. The prisoners are put in a position I doubt anyone would know how to be in.Karl Markovics is amazing in the title role I think he should have been considered for a Best Actor nomination at our American Academy Awards.The Counterfeiters isn't a grand epic but it doesn't need to be. It is an effective thriller which brings the viewer in.".

The proposal proposes a moral dilemma for the Jews they live by counterfeiting the money but they have to go on living with the fact that they are helping the Nazis kill their chance of freedom. This separates them and one of the counterfeiters named Adolf Burger can't live with the fact that he is financing the Nazis.Like the Polanski film The Pianist this is a story of survival. These men want to live and they know that tomorrows aren't a guaranteed luxury. I imagine they all feel as if they are selling their souls but they want to survive. Adolf Burger is probably the most correct and noble but I see where the other characters are coming from it's hard to be noble when death is everywhere. The Counterfeiters is unlike any other Holocaust film we see some disturbing scenes but much of the terror is implied. We see letters and remnants of Auschwitz in these men and they are in the middle of a hellish concentration camp themselves. They get treated well by their Nazi commander Herzog when they deliver what he wants. He remarks that his success is due to the fact that he doesn't treat people like dirt but he treats dirt like people. In one of the most suspenseful scenes he takes the Jews out of bed for an announcement he gives them a ping pong table to congratulate them on successfully counterfeiting the pound they are aghast because they feared Herzog was rounding them up to gas them. Many of the Jews think it is easier to ignore than to acknowledge. Burger when he challenges them on this horrible presumption. The Counterfeiters deals with questions and themes that are interesting and intriguing It asks the right questions and brings up the right points. The prisoners are put in a position I doubt anyone would know how to be in.Karl Markovics is amazing in the title role I think he should have been considered for a Best Actor nomination at our American Academy Awards.The Counterfeiters isn't a grand epic but it doesn't need to be. It is an effective thriller which brings the viewer in.";

Amazing tale of endurance intelligence and sacrifice during one of the darkest periods in recent history. I am also a big fan of films that take the 'bookend' approach in this film it works well. A lot of power in the subtle silences of this film the look between the Protagonist and the French woman in the beginning and when the two different groups of Jewish holocaust survivors meet each other the suspicion that follows.A few small critiques of the film. I am not sure that we had enough information in order for the audience to identify with the Protagonist he starts out as a cocky criminal driven by the acquisition of more and more money. He is obviously gifted and these gifts are put towards criminal activities until capture. Fully understand the film follows his slow and steady transformation from a person motivated by money and selfindulgences. Perhaps to expand on his amazing ability to adapt to such a horrific environment and thus to further reveal his character I would have liked to see more scenesaction showing him winning favour with the German guards. The early interwar year sequences were rushed.Secondly there was a scene where the protagonist was assigned to clean the Latrines. As he is scrubbing away the German guard with an Axe to grind walks in and proceeds to urinate on him. Awful and revolting and it provokes a controlled but nonetheless angry reaction. My issue with this scene is that it was too obvious we could see it coming for miles. For a film that chose to take a more subtle approach than say other films about the horrors of WW II German concentration camps this scene is too 'over the top' when looking at the overall style of the film.Finally I wasn't sure what to make of the scene where our Protagonist confronts the Head of the Concentration camp for gifted Jewish workers the man who originally captured our Protagonist. If memory serves the Protagonist confronts the Warden and confirms the Warden is a desperate crook stealing to prepare a tidy life post WWII. The confrontation here is a battle between a gun and a sharp object. Is this part of the film true to history did this confrontation occur? If so did the prisoner overpower his captor with raw emotion and anger despite coming up against a revolver? I would be interested in other's thoughts on this. For me it was difficult to believe that such an incident could occur.On the other hand I can see how it could be perceived the Warden was a man driven only by advancement at whatever the cost of life. Thus he is unable to do his own dirty work preferring to delegate the delivery of punishment and executions. Therefore when he is confronted by a powerful personality acting on raw emotion he succumbs even with a superior weapon in hand...Very good film glad it took the Oscar.".

There is only a small ever diminishing Jewish community in Australia and only a tiny fraction of them are connected directly to the Holocaust at this point of history.

	schema:headline " Tense Drama of Survival";
	schema:reviewBody "True stories are indeed often stranger than fiction but they are also often a lot messier Here a true story has been tidied up for dramatic purposes but it retains plenty of its weirdness. The story of the Nazi attempts to counterfeit British and US currency to destabilize their economies during World War 2 using concentration camp inmates is based on the memoirs of Adolf Burger a Slovakian printer and one of the survivors. The other characters are composites including the central character a convicted forger who happens to be Jewish. This man Solly is acutely aware of his precarious situation and is prepared to advance the Nazi war effort if that means survival. On the other hand Burger a dedicated communist having lost his family in Auschtwitz is prepared to sabotage the Nazi counterfeiting scheme even though he might die a horrible death as a result.The resulting tussle is made more interesting in that Solly is not without a moral framework of his own which includes not grassing on a mate. Solly is brilliantly played by the Austrian actor Karl Markovitz who brings what might otherwise have been a dull and not very pleasant character fully alive. Although the circumstances were somewhat different Solly bears a resemblance to Colonel Nicholson the British officer in Bridge on the River Kwai who is prepared for his troops to build bridges on the Burma railway to demonstrate to their Japanese captors just what the British Army can do  professionalism run amok.The German Commandant Herzog as played by Devid Striesow is also an interesting character I'm no Nazi. He might be a middle manager in any organization obedient to the organisation's goals and preoccupied with motivating his workforce. While the iron fist is never far away he has a preference for distributing cigarettes and peptalks. He is no idiot and catches Solly out on several occasions but in the end like Colonel Klink in Hogan's Heros he is outsmarted by his prisoner.Stefan Ruzowitzki a director who does not have a long list of credits gives us a tight exciting and dramatic story which well deserves its 2008 Oscar for best foreign language film. He does not spare us the horrors of the concentration camps nor the brutishness of the guards. Primo Levy an Italian survivor of the holocaust pointed out that the environment of the camps meant that only the worst survived. It is pleasing to point out however that the idealistic Adolf Burger who looked earmarked for martyrdom in the camp not only got out alive and wrote his memoir but even attended at the age of 90 the premiere of this film.I do wonder if the German plan to debauch the Allies' currencies would have been all that effective even if they had solved the distribution problem. By 1940 the note issue in Britain and the US represented a small proportion of the total money supply even as narrowly defined. According to my trusty 2006 World Almanac in 1940 US currency note circulation was 7.845 billion while US commercial banks had total deposits of 67 billion. It seems that the main victims of the forgeries were suppliers to Germany in the latter part of the war who were often paid in forged notes. Serves them right I guess.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ann Hui's A Simple Life is a poignant and melancholic film about the relationship between an old servant and her companion a successful film producer to whose family the servant had been in service with. It is a beautiful touching and more importantly human film. It lives and breathes its own life with the help of the cast and crew involved.The performances by Andy Lau as Roger the man and especially Deannie Yip as Ah Tao complement the movie's atmosphere as a whole. It is a warm homely and crystalclear one  subtly quiet slightly louder when there's more people around. This film's screenplay relies more on the look on the actors' faces rather than relying on dialogue. This is a good thing. It allows the audience to focus on the performances in rapt attention. Relying on dialoguesubtitles more than often will distract from the movie. This is one movie which follows my rule for any great movie subtlety is key. In many dramatic Chinese movies the piano is a must for every music score and it is overdone cheesily at many times. For this movie however composer Law WingFai knows crucial music timing  the music is not overdone yet not too minimal and it knows when to appear at the right time. Correct.Hui's focused yet calm serene direction basically drives Susan Chan's screenplay right at home. Hui seems to have learned a thing or two about human drama from greats like Yasujiro Ozu and Akira Kurosawa  it is put into terrific use here. But Yip's performance as the altruistic Ah Tao is simply wonderful her face and body language speak more than herself her vocal qualities ranging from sharp balking to solemn calm. She is the heart of the movie alive beating and like her moving quietly along as her life goes by. Lau is also very good here being more stoic than usual but hiding uneasiness within his eyes.There is no great story without good characters and A Simple Life has two great characters that drives the movie. Roger is a successful film producer his whole family has migrated to America and he's seemingly living the high life with his wealthy friends featuring many non intrusive cameos by Chinese celebrities including humorous ones by Sammo Hung Tsui Hark and Anthony Wong and yet he is more concerned with Ah Tao than everyone else. Ah Tao is an orphan since World War II and has since been serving Roger's family for four generations without expecting any sort of compensation in return. Roger doesn't mind taking care of Ah Tao as everyone else progresses around him  the same way Ah Tao doesn't mind living her life on her own at an old folks' home without Roger to help her around after a stroke attack  she feels guilty if he did that. The two characters are bonded play with even depend on each other as if they're the only two people who understand each other. A sort of motherson love but more powerful. Compare with later scenes with Roger and his real mother and you'll see the difference. I'm not implying Roger's real mother is a morally bad character far from it. The relationship between them is more real and human than I had expected.Some will call this tedious and pretentious others will call it pointless. I'm not sure but I'd love to see movies like this where the characters unwrap the story around them as life progresses with its ups and downs. Sure there are a few bits and pieces that did not really relate to the main character's story  but they make up the story and the characters as a whole  shaping this narrative up. It is a thing of beauty. So is life. So is this film  one of the year's best.Overall rating 88".

I'm not sure but I'd love to see movies like this where the characters unwrap the story around them as life progresses with its ups and downs. Sure there are a few bits and pieces that did not really relate to the main character's story  but they make up the story and the characters as a whole  shaping this narrative up. It is a thing of beauty. So is life. So is this film  one of the year's best.Overall rating 88";

This is a film about our connections to those we love those we hardly know and to ourselves. It is a sublimely graceful work and truly seamless. Deannie Yip plays a maid who has worked for a family for many many years. When she falls ill she moves to a long term care facility. Her struggle to move into her new role as an ill person is completely in keeping with what we know about her character. Great acting! The relationships she shares with the family members she's worked for are studies in the nuances of intimacy. Directed by Ann Hui....it's no wonder she's said to be Asia's most important female director.".

	schema:reviewBody "I seriously do not know why it took this movie so long to be in the cinemas. It is one of the defining works of the year and essentially a simple movie about simple and unexplored characters of Hong Kong people. Ms Ann Hui is truly at her very best once again. After winning awards for The Way We Were Hui strikes the cord to the highest potential by casting Andy Lau and former box office queen of 80s Deanie Ip whose chemistry dates back to almost 23 years old in their last corroboration. It is truly a delight to sit through a movie like this and while this being one Hui's most accepted work to the general public she never strays away from her principles and values. At its core it is a film about human interactions feelings relationships and old age. One day we will die and old age is a burning topic for the baby boomer's generation.Deanie Ip puts in a career defining performance and as she puts it acting as an old lady is not difficult at all as she is just playing herself. The manner she manages to make the audience enjoy her character the Chinese servant of Hong Kong family for 3 generations is impressive to say the least. Life is never easy and sometimes we just tend to forget those people who work their life within behind the scene with heart soul and pure dedication. These are people who gave up on having a family of their own and instead spend their whole life raising other people's families. Nowadays the loyalty and the servant and master relationships are a lot more different. As mentioned before Ip's characters work so well because there is an underlying chemistry between Andy Lau and her. Lau puts in an underrated performance that doesn't allow him to overshadow the main character. It is a compliment that it is because of the understated manner Lau manages to approach his character that allows Deanie Ip's the spotlight and attention.A Simple Life has already won a lot of awards and not to mention plenty of admiration from a new league of fans young and old. Hui has been around a long time and has never strayed from the commercialism of Hong Kong cinema. To finally witness an Ann Hui film making splash at the box office is really as a good a feeling as watching a fine piece of cinema. In many ways this is a true and realistic look at simple aspects of life characters and old age. It is this simplistic that makes Hui's films so different enjoyable and ultimately touching. All in all A Simple Life is a Hong Kong movie and more importantly a movie that takes us along the ride respects those around us and allows the audience to reflect upon their own lives. Movies like these only comes along once in a generation and while this may not be Hui's best work but in terms of balancing the needs of the Hong Kong people and her own vision it is certainly the most accessible of her works. A fine piece of cinematic experienceNeo rates it 910www.thehkneo.com".

Carefully filmed very nearby the two main characters. At the same time it showed an inside view in a retirement home and a small view over the fence into the film industry.The retirement home at hand may look different from similar institutions in our own country but that is only the surface. Like here in The Netherlands it is a small population with very different people who did not choose each other many of them leading vegetative lives. Our first main character the amah a lifelong help is still relatively active in spite of her stroke. Being moved to the retirement home was her explicit wish unwilling to become a burden for the family she served for 60 years. This particular situation is something we cannot imagine in our own world but apparently it exists there.The other main characters is the last living son of the family. Though not being blood relatives we see the two main characters behave like mother and son. To the outside world they explain their relationship as mother and godson or alternatively as aunt and nephew whatever fits the situation best. Her position as an amah is not known to others than the immediate family members who all seem to care for her.The inside view in the film industry is less extensive and mostly concentrated in the beginning with a hefty meeting about an ever growing budget that some film maker needed and a subsequent meeting with a bank manager about the fine print in a contract that was ignored by the bank. It merely serves to portray the son part in the story and to explain why he is abroad for longer periods and cannot always find time to visit the retirement home. This has the definite purpose to prevent putting him on display as someone not caring. We see the fact that he really cares confirmed in the way he brings her along to a industry screening of this newly produced film presenting her as his aunt.".

	schema:headline " A film about human kindness";
	schema:reviewBody "'A simple life' is a film about human kindness. About caring for others. About harmonious human relationships. Does this sound cheesy? It's not meant that way. The film shows how caring for one another can make a difference but it's never sentimental and there's no tear jerking at all. The story centres around A Tao a housekeeper who cooks and cleans for film producer Roger who is not married and travels a lot. When returning home from one of his travels from Hong Kong to mainland China A Tao doesn't open the door. She has had a stroke and after her stay in the hospital she moves to an old people's home. Roger visits her regularly and gradually they become closer. At the start of the movie they are employer and employee at the end they are friends. Director Ann Hui shows this process with small symbolic scenes. When A Tao serves Roger his food in one of the first scenes only one word is spoken when she asks him to move something on the table to make room for the dish she has prepared. The contrast with another key scene later on in the movie is huge. After A Tao has recovered from the stroke Roger takes her to the first screening of his new film and introduces her to movie stars as his godmother. Afterwards they walk away hand in hand chattering affectionately about the film business. A Tao visibly enjoys this party and the attention she receives from her 'godson'. This is just one of the examples of the wonderful acting by Deannie Yip a famous actress in the Hong Kong film industry but unknown to the rest of the world. In this film she seemingly effortlessly plays A Tao first as a humble servant then as a physically handicapped patient and also as a coquettish lady. How wonderful it must have been for her to receive a 'best actress'award at the Venice Film Festival for her part as A Tao. The film focuses on the relationship between Roger and A Tao and the development of their mutual appreciation. Apart from that not much really happens. There are some humorous little scenes that will make you smile as well as some more emotional ones. This is a slow and lowprofile film to be appreciated by a typical arthouse audience.".

Sometimes Roger's mom also comes to visit Ah Tao and bring her many useful things. Roger's family really love Ah Tao and feel thankful after what she has done for them about 60 years long by taking care of their family. 'A Simple Life' have shown that a simple story could give good impression and enjoyable to watch. The storyline is not complicated at all the movie goes on slowly and very detail. Ann Hui as a director tries to make it safe and straight without any meaningful conflicts which sometimes could make audience feels bored watching it. The relationship between Roger and Ah Tao built really well it shows how they support and take care one another even sometimes telling jokes. Credits should be given to Andy Lau and Deannie Yip their acting is so natural as two characters who has known each other for a long time. Overall 'A Simple Life' is a memorable Chinese movie I've seen recently. Actually I felt exhausted during watching 'A Simple Life' because of it's slow plot but when I rewind what I just saw the movie isn't bad at all and has so much lesson to be learned from it. It teaches audience to respect and appreciate people who has done good things in lives and not forgetting their merit.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Simple Life is a beautiful film that tugs at your heart strings not because of the story but because of the unveiling of the relationship between a family servant and her 'young master' that she has treated as her own son. It is a difficult subject to cover but the gist of the plot is that the servant ah Tao suffers from a stroke and goes through a massive lifestyle change from looking after others to become the one being looked after. Deanie Ip's acting is absolutely incredible in that you are not watching her go through the motions you are actually with her throughout her journey and feel her pain and joy as the film goes on. You can sense the unrewarded joy she gets from looking after Roger to the worries that she goes through to being a burden to him and moving herself to an old people's home and giving up a life of being the carer to being cared for.Andy Lau's portrayal as Roger is very different from the other roles I have seen him in. It is played subtly and allows the character of ah Tao to really shine through and there is evidently brilliant chemistry between the two and in the film Roger grows from being a pampered boy used to having ah Tao revolve around his life to a mature man that realises all that she has done for him.What makes this film so great is the realism in all the scenes and it was not a typical film where you think 'this does not happen in real life'. Also the focus is not on her medical conditions and subsequent pain from her health but her story and how her life changes and the way she copes and adapts.Ann Hui captured ah Tao's story beautifully and I came out of the film feeling like I knew her and had shared her life with her from the day she had her stroke to the day that she passed. Many cameos from many HK stars but liked the way they were written into the film and that they had a part to play and not in the story for the sake of being famous.An absolute mustsee.".

Her life and the relationships around her change drastically.A Simple Life is a touching story about a maid who has served a family for 60 years. She was seen as a servant in the beginning of the film with her employers having no emotional attachment whatsoever. It saddens me to see how Ah Tao was treated with little respect. As the story progresses the emotional connections and the direction of servitude turn 180 degrees making a heartwarming and satisfactory change.The environment in the old age home is strikingly authentic as well from the residents staff the relationships between residents and relationships between residents and their children. How they care for each other is touching to say the least.There are many effective and powerful scenes. The very brief 5 second scene of the old man walking in an alley with a young woman has so much emotion in it I felt this spectrum of feelings towards this old man from shame to anger. The numerous scenes with Ah Tao's humble personality are also very moving. A picture is really worth more than a thousand words.It is also striking to see how the old age home manager speaks accented Cantonese something that is very usual among old age home staff. This adds to the authenticity of the film. Another striking thing is that she is just 5 months younger than the actress playing Ah Tao. Who would have guessed!In short A Simple Life tells a heartwarming story of a humble dedicated and selfless maid. The plot is so strong that it moves people without the need of special effects or fancy sets. A Simple Life is a refreshing change for theHong Kong cinema as it finally churns out a quality drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has got to be one of the best films I seen this year. It's simply sensational heartfelt and touching in every way. I can't see how anyone would call this movie pretentious. It's down to earth and nothing seems to be forced even when it comes to bringing out the emotions. And it's far from being a cookie cutter or cardboard bonding film either. Instead it goes in a very realistic and believable direction but also wonderful at the same time. If anyone that view this film at least has a heart I don't see how it can be viewed just completely negatively. Some might find a film like this boring but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. And felt that this film actually gave me something to take with me when it was finished. It brings out the harshness and coldness of humanity especially for the older people out there. But it also brings out a sense of warmth as well and above all hope. The plot revolves around a bond between Roger LeungAndy Lau a film producer who is picky and stuckup and a servant that has been a maid for his family for multiple generations. And is played by Deanie Ip this is probably my first time seeing Deanie Ip's performance and she is breathtaking. I could really believe the love the tenderness and affection from the character. I wouldn't be surprised if she is like the Maryl Streep of China. I just wanted to reach out and give her a big hug. This film deserves every award it gets. And it's no wonder this was noted as one of the best films at the festival. It's a film that some people will experience at least somewhat in the future or already have. While watching this compelling and even inspiring film I had a chance to reflect upon myself and my life a few times. Thus actually managed to take somethings from this film. It's a simple film with a lot of heart to it. Authentic emotions and relationships. Highly recommended to just about any viewers that has a heart. This film is also inspired by a true story and it's moving in every way. Looking forward to seeing Ann Hui's other works now. Beware though it's a film that might stick with the audiences for weeks or even more. Although some might think it's too subtle and realistic for their taste will at least take away something from the experience. This is a meaningful and worthwhile film that gives a bit of a reflection on bonds relationships and life.9.710".

It was quite different when maid turns too old left no strength to serve his owner what comes to her rescue is to repay for her long and faithful service she did. Like I said the movie get rid of the sappy melodrama and portrayed like that happening in a real environment.This movie does not have any twist and was very plain. The story development was steady and gives away the audience to where it is heading so if you are a smart enough you will get it before you finish watching it. This is the movie the characters it had that make us to judge what we have done in our whole life someday when we become old.

A Simple Life is a beautiful movie about real life love and humanity.The story is about again domestic housekeeper Ah Tao played by Deannie Yip who has been taking care of the same family for 60 years and as Roger played by Andy Lau returns from USA roles become switched as Ah Tao suffers a stroke and has to move into a nursing home. What was once a master and servant relationship becomes a relationship of friendship compassion companionship and genuine love and sense of family bond despite having no blood ties.A Simple Life is filmed in a style very much similar to a documentary and that is part of the charm because it is really like you as the audience is right there alongside the actors and actresses.But what really makes this movie unique is the spectacular performances of all people in the movie especially that of Deannie Yip and Andy Lau. Together they really carry the movie so nicely.This movie is a gem in the Hong Kong cinema and should be on the shelf of any collector or fan of Hong Kong cinema. I am glad that I purchased the movie from Amazon given my interest in Hong Kong cinema and I was more than genuinely surprised by the authenticity and heartwarning compassion that is shown in this movie.A Simple Life is well worth a watch especially if you enjoy movies that are realistic and will have an impact on the audience.".

There are no guns nor violence nor indeed any action at all  this is as simple as filmmaking gets.After 60 years working for a family as a maid Ah Tao played excellently by Deanie Ip suffers a stroke and so retires. Not wanting to be a burden she chooses to live in a retirement home in conditions much worse than she is used to. Lau plays Roger the sole member of the family Ah Tao worked for to remain in Hong Kong who takes time to visit Ah Tao as often as possible in tween his busy career in film production and learning to cook and clean for himself for once.That's it plain and simple. Films like this demand good performances from the cast more so than creative direction or writing and the two leads deliver notably Ip as the looksfartoogoodtobeinher seventies Ah Tao. Lau is also good in a role that sees him have to deal more with shooting facial expressions than shooting a gun. Smaller roles are often played by ubermegacolossal stars of Hong Kong cinema. Sammo Hung Raymond Chow Hark Tsui and Anthony Wong to name a few all pop up here and there adding a sense of humour while watching.While the film is designed to be emotional and sad there is no doubt that old people are funny with facial expressions and stupid behaviour aplenty giving the film a good balance.You can't expect an explosive film but it never tries to be with Ann Hui's work being simple yet effective.www.politic1983.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Life for a parent is a bad deal. You raise someone for 20 years and then are abandoned by them to face death for the next 40 years. Strangely it's the only selfless thing we do as human beings. But it seems so unfair someone takes care of you you should take care of them as well right?That is the central idea of A Simple Life. The story is about Toh Jie transliterated as Sister Peach played by Deannie Yip is a household maid who has worked for the Leung family for 60 years. She still currently takes care of the young master Roger played by Andy Lau. Her health deters and now she in need of Roger to take care of her.Deannie Yip owns this role. She reminded me of my grandmother at times who is currently in an old folk's home. She has the physicality of an old person down the little tics and the way you lean to take off weight when you walk. She deserved that Venice Film Festival award. Heck give her more!Andy Lau has come a long way since his younger days of playingaheartthrobwho diesattheendofthemovietohis ownpopsoundtrack thing. He has learned how to use the subtlety of his face and knows when to chew up a moment. There's one noteworthy scene where Roger is hanging out with his childhood friends and they all decide to give Sister Peach a call and reminisce about the great food dishes she used to make for them. This aches Roger as he realizes this is basically how people will remember her. And I urge people to watch Andy Lau in that moment.There is a little detail with the layout of the old folk's home I wanted to address it had an open door at the entrance. Many times the old people just opened and closed the door and exited freely. My mother and I debated the reality of this usually these old folk's home have a exit button that unlocks the door for safety purposes. There are scenes where Sister Peach and other elderly people are opening and closing this door without supervision. What's worse is the old folk's home is right across from a mechanic's shop! Thinking more about this it dawned on me this is an aesthetic choice. It is probably unrealistic but what that aesthetic choice lead me to consider how dangerous the situation was for the elderly people.As I realized this there was many aesthetic choices in the story that were designed to raise a discussion about how we should treat and handle elderly people. I admired its subtlety. For example there's a scene where Roger and his sister discuss how Sister Peach's expenses should be handled and it gets pretty dark as it starts to sound like a business transaction.There are a lot of funny moments in the movie and thank goodness for it. It is very grim to watch old people suffering and deteriorating in an old folk's home. The film knows that and shows that there is indeed laughter in their lives and Sister Peach does not have it too bad. The story is not about how the whole world is against her. We never linger on her suffering. Things are never dialed up to eleven. It retains a lot of realism a lot of the old people in the old folk's home seem to belong there and still manages to find drama within it. Good work Ann Hui!That's one major thing I appreciated about this movie it does not set out to make you cry. It could have easily done so using melodramatic sensibilities and it does not set that as it's goal.I did not cry at the end but I felt the touching cleanse of a cry. I left the theater thinking about how I should treat my grandparents my parents someday and even the elderly in general. Sometimes they need help walking down from a bus someone to talk to or simply they just need to feel needed. The film's heart is in the right place and I ultimately agree with it's sentiments nobody that raised and took care of you deserves to die alone.For more reviews please visit my blog  httphkauteur.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "A simple life tells us a story of a housemaid' last year of her life. The heroine of the film named Tao had been a housemaid in Andy' family for the last 60 years. She came to Andy's house when she was 16 years old  she grew up with Andy's mother and the growing up of Andy was before her very eyes. She served Andy with great care including cooking dinner washing clothes cleaning the room as well as feeding a cat. At the first shot of the movie Tao was going across a crowed and noisy outdoor market to buy fishes for dinner she picked up the goods so carefully that the shopkeeper seemed impatient. When she came home she prepared a big meal for Andy. Ai night Tao was always standing in the balcony waiting for Andy therefore every time Andy came home she would see the warm yellow light on the second floor then Tao would serve the food for Andy .That is almost everything Tao will do in her daily life.However one time Andy saw the yellow light when he came back but he could not open the door. He yelled loudly hoping Tao would hear him but finally he realized something was wrong with Tao. Tao suffered a stroke and could hardly walk without the walking stick. Andy was wondering to find a new housemaid to take care of her while Tao insisted to live in the nurseryusing her own money. Tao came into the nursery and Andy couldn't get used to the life without Tao he realized how important Tao was. Tao was already the number of his family from the bottom of her heart Tao was even more intimate than his mother. He began to company Tao with unprecedented love and patient until her death.The whole story is really flat and slow you can hardly find any ups and downs. Even when it comes the death it seems so natural. But it still has a big power to move audiences because so many little details in the film are likely happening in everyone's daily life. At the end we all have to face the fear of death and at that time all we need is love and company. In this film wo can see so clearly the grand love in small person it's pure and selfless.".

	schema:headline " Lots of thrills but lots of absurdity";
	schema:reviewBody "Although The Jackal is one of my favorite films due to the fine acting of all the principal players especially Diane Venora and good direction of the action scenes the plot contains an amazing number of outright ludicrous elements that I must protest. Taking it from the beginning In the opening scene a coalition of police forces storms a Moscow nightclub to arrest a Russian gang figure named Gazzi. Now as any policeman knows the first thing you do in an arrest is handcuff the perp. But in this case despite their overwhelming numbers and armament Major Koslova Venora and Carter Preston Sidney Poitier stand and argue with the guy for a few minutes while the other police stand by and do nothing. This of course allows Gazzi to get the jump on Koslova with a knife. Not the greatest police work. Then as Gazzi and Koslova struggle she manages to get her gun free and shoot him. A few minutes later Preston thanks her for saving his life. His life? She was the one he was trying to kill.For revenge Gazzi's brother hires the Jackal Bruce Willis to perform an assassination of as it turns out the First Lady of the U.S. In the next scene the Jackal purchases a weapon on the internet  from some sort of eBay for terrorists it would seem. He chooses a huge Gatling gun that fires monstrous depleted uranium bullets at an advertised 1400 rounds a minute although if you time the actual firing later in the film it isn't even a third of that rate. Now the question is Was he high? If you want to kill a single person the best weapon is a sniper rifle of some kind like the one used by the Jackal in the original novel. One of those would have been infinitely easier to acquire transport and hide. Instead he buys a machine cannon that would be more appropriate for engaging an entire army division. Okay dramatic license but please.He smuggles the giant weapon to Canada and there he contracts a local technohood Jack Black to build him a remote controlled firing apparatus. He tells the hood he doesn't want to attract any attention and demands that he turn over the blueprints for the thing when he is finished. Then when the hood asks him or a few thousand bucks for the plans out of 70 million the Jackal is being paid he takes the guy out into the woods and uses him for target practice with his weapon leaving the corpse and several hundred somewhat unusual depleted uranium bullets for the authorities to find. How's that for not attracting attention? In the book the Jackal kills the guy in his house and hides the body much more credibly.After the gruesome murder scene is quickly discovered Preston and Declan Mulqueen Richard Gere fly up to Canada and locate the hood's shop where they find the blueprints for the firing station that were so important for the Jackal to destroy although after he'd killed Black the Jackal seems to have decided the blueprints weren't worth going back to the shop for.

	onyx:emotionText "Although The Jackal is one of my favorite films due to the fine acting of all the principal players especially Diane Venora and good direction of the action scenes the plot contains an amazing number of outright ludicrous elements that I must protest. Taking it from the beginning In the opening scene a coalition of police forces storms a Moscow nightclub to arrest a Russian gang figure named Gazzi. Now as any policeman knows the first thing you do in an arrest is handcuff the perp. But in this case despite their overwhelming numbers and armament Major Koslova Venora and Carter Preston Sidney Poitier stand and argue with the guy for a few minutes while the other police stand by and do nothing. This of course allows Gazzi to get the jump on Koslova with a knife. Not the greatest police work. Then as Gazzi and Koslova struggle she manages to get her gun free and shoot him. A few minutes later Preston thanks her for saving his life. His life? She was the one he was trying to kill.For revenge Gazzi's brother hires the Jackal Bruce Willis to perform an assassination of as it turns out the First Lady of the U.S. In the next scene the Jackal purchases a weapon on the internet  from some sort of eBay for terrorists it would seem. He chooses a huge Gatling gun that fires monstrous depleted uranium bullets at an advertised 1400 rounds a minute although if you time the actual firing later in the film it isn't even a third of that rate. Now the question is Was he high? If you want to kill a single person the best weapon is a sniper rifle of some kind like the one used by the Jackal in the original novel. One of those would have been infinitely easier to acquire transport and hide. Instead he buys a machine cannon that would be more appropriate for engaging an entire army division. Okay dramatic license but please.He smuggles the giant weapon to Canada and there he contracts a local technohood Jack Black to build him a remote controlled firing apparatus. He tells the hood he doesn't want to attract any attention and demands that he turn over the blueprints for the thing when he is finished. Then when the hood asks him or a few thousand bucks for the plans out of 70 million the Jackal is being paid he takes the guy out into the woods and uses him for target practice with his weapon leaving the corpse and several hundred somewhat unusual depleted uranium bullets for the authorities to find. How's that for not attracting attention? In the book the Jackal kills the guy in his house and hides the body much more credibly.After the gruesome murder scene is quickly discovered Preston and Declan Mulqueen Richard Gere fly up to Canada and locate the hood's shop where they find the blueprints for the firing station that were so important for the Jackal to destroy although after he'd killed Black the Jackal seems to have decided the blueprints weren't worth going back to the shop for. This is a guy that is the absolute best at his trade?

From the day I saw it as a 17yearold in January 1998 I always found it entertaining and exciting. This might be down to the fact that I have never seen the 1973 original.Brucie plays a nameless assassin cool as ice and utterly emotionless. Richard Gere is the only man to have seen him. He's let out of prison to assist the FBI in catching the Jackal before he takes out an uncertain highranking official. Willis and Gere are for the most part leading their own movies as they never meet until the climax. It's very interesting watching them both go about their business Willis hatching a master plan and Gere methodically picking apart his trail and hunting him down. There is great support from Sidney Poitier and cutiepie Diane Venora as a scarred Russian cop.With a wide variety of brilliantly photographed locations across the US and Canada and plot with a mediumlevel of complexity it's not entirely brainless viewing but not too taxing as to alienate lazy viewers. I honestly do not get why so many people hate it. Willis has done far worse films even seen Mercury Rising? that get off scotfree somehow but The Jackal doesn't get off so lightly. Aside from Gere's slightly dodgy Oirish accent I have no complaints about this film. Give it a chance and you might just be entertained.".

FBI deputy director Preston discovers that the Jackal has been contracted out he contacts one of the few men who can identify him  IRA gunman Declan Mulqueen. With the Jackal moving freely within the US it is a race against time to find and stop him before he reaches his target.Before he died the director of The Day of the Jackal Zinnermann approached Universal to have the name changed so that it wouldn't be so closely associated with his own film. They didn't change it and it's easy to see what his point was. The plot of this is a bit silly and doesn't have any intelligence or subtlety. The Jackal is careful is some scenes but takes on FBI agents in others he covers all his tracks in designing his gun but he kills the builder and leaves the plans for the FBI to find! It doesn't totally make sense  things are tidied up too easily  Mulqueen finds the Jackal too easily when the film needs a boost of action.Willis is OK as the Jackal but he's not totally convincing because he usually plays roles where he runs round shooting rather than being a very clinical hitman who only fires one shot then leaves undetected. Even here he does some planning but he only looks comfortable when in running gun battles. Gere is good in an action man role I'm not a big fan but he has one of the worst Northern Irish accents even put on the big screen  it goes from N.Ireland to Southern Ireland and back again from one scene to the next. Poitier is a classy inclusion in the pack but doesn't have much to do but act tough beside Gere. Support is interesting but they don't have much to do  Jack Black was great in High Fidelity but is cannon fodder here. J.K. Simmons is amazing in Oz but is just an agent here. Venora is good despite a very heavy accent. Sophie Okonedo is beautiful as she was in various British TV series but only has a few fleeting lines of dialogue. And Leslie Phillips is wasted in such a small cameo of little significance that you wonder why he bothered.The whole plot sits funny with me  I really don't understand why Gere's character had to be an IRA murderer. There's an early scene where he's verbally attacked by one of the FBI for killing women and children but he's given time to defend himself. After that we all forget who he is and everyone loves him. The final act of the film left a bitter taste in my mouth I grew up in NI and you can't help but wonder who in America wants to promote the IRA as somehow honourable or sympathetic also see The Devil's Own  I wonder if Hollywood understands now how offending it is to see terrorists displayed in this way?Overall it's quite fun in a brash loud sort of way  but ultimately it'll leave you wondering what you just watched and how did that happen and hang on that bit doesn't work. As a distracting blockbuster it's quite good but as a relative of 1973's Day of the Jackal it's an illegitimate third cousin.".

This one can. In fact it even has advantages over its classic predecessor such as better editing better cinematography and even better acting. You may think I'm holding onto a straw here by nitpicking but I'm an odd person that values the benefits of modern productions.On the second point  if silliness better yet stupidity of the plot was the criteria by which to avoid the movie I would probably have seen only about a dozen movies in my lifetime. I would have avoided Bond movies period movies parodies and what not. And I'd be poorer for that. So forget silliness it's no big deal.Now a little on the movie itself. The plot is indeed stupid for an indepth analysis I recommend reading hilarious Roger Ebert's review. The cast reversal is also a bit of misfortune as Gere was initially supposed to be the Jackal. The fact that the role eventually went to Bruce Willis together with adventuristic nature of Jackal's business made me root for the bad guy as I never did before. He is conceived as sort of an upgraded James Bond here being more ruthless with drier sense of humor and taking advantage of both sexes not only females to his cause.I don't know if making bad guy look good was the intention on part of the film crew but it turned out a very subversive move for a typical Hollywood venture making an IRA terrorist that pursues Jackal a likable guy as well is probably another one but I wont go into that. All in all it was a suspenseful voyage with such a good pace that you don't care about the shortcomings at the first viewing so I say it's recommendable. There are certainly far worse ways you could waste two hours.".

	schema:headline " Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon";
	schema:reviewBody "Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it's another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon.I mean where do you start with this film? Okay let's begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was in some way related to either the book or the original film The Day of the Jackal. It's not. In fact it's so different and so bad that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can't hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well okay maybe I am a bit like that but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.Now let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why. In revenge brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move  although to be fair it was pre911 so he wasn't to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe. Gangster hires nasty killer Willis. Police hire cuddly killer Gere cuddly killer tracks nasty killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. Cuddly killer kills nasty killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y'know who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice.Let's put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards. If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold that's up to them. I of course reserve the right to despise them for it. It's a free country.More egregious however is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That's not politically distasteful it's far worse it's incompetent. It's no wonder for instance that Gere still looks so damn good given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of crap. The fact that Gere's accent is not only Southern Irish but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren't looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier a complete waste of space in this film says he's off for a coffee offers to get our cuddly IRA man one then casually says Ah but then you guys drink Guinness don't you. Yeah that's right Sidney the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes.While we're on the subject of Poitier why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well he just hangs around and looks like a twat of course. He's got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to.While we're on the subject of Gere why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing exMujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India he is after all a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist. Let's not forget that Gere's character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he's not why does he know The Jackal? If he's not why does he know all his moves? And if he is why is he such a limp biscuit and such a loveable person? All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn't be bothered to a think about the plot b have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their characterc avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend  I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie d give the central characters something to do e credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists it's an insult to the Irish people it's an insult to not great but pretty good film it rips off and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all  and most unforgivable  it is an insult to my arse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly you'd think with no plot no characters and no dialogue it would be over in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit early.".

It's just great action packed clever and if you like crime it should keep you on the edge of your chair. No it's not like the original but I don't think the makers set out to do this. It would have been a crime to do that actually as the original is in it's own an excellent movie and remakes are most of the time disappointing. Go watch it buy the DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a remake of The Day of The Jackal this movie succeeds in updating the setting without completely destroying the character. As so many remakes tend to do. Here we find the historical and geopolitical context totally changed but there is successfully conveyed the sense of an urgent hunt for one dangerous faceless force of doom.The technical aspects are among the best features. The cannon is for me the true star of the movie. Willis's multiple identities make for the other star feature. Also his portrayal of the psychopath's obsessional attention to detail and determination to make his lethal toy fulfil it's dreadful promise. Check out that look in his eyes in the climactic park scene as he wiggles his joy stick.These things allowed there is one blundering and grossly offensive feature. Gere's character could have been any terrorist from an imaginary outfit or assassin or foreign agent who happened to know about the Jackal. Why make him a hero out of the IRA? This is yet another manifestation of Hollywood's liberal mindset dabbling in things of which they have not the glimmering of an understanding. As a UK citizen I have seen plenty of IRA and UDA thugs dragged out into the daylight. Fat tattooed men with twisted faces scruffy facial hair and mullet haircuts. There never was one who could by the remotest stretch of the imagination be likened to a suave sexbomb like Richard Gere. When one of the FBI agents suggests that his war took the lives of women and children rather than British soldiers he declares that he never got involved in such things. That is a statement every bit as ridiculous as if it were uttered by one of Osama Bin Laden's lieutenants! Can you imagine Richard Gere at a meeting planning the Manchester city centre bombing saying to his colleagues Aw I'm sorry I 'll have to sit it out on this one chaps this isn't my way of fighting a war. And incidentally Ulster has been a constitutional part of the British Isles for five hundred years  twice as long as the U.S.A has existed . Please note Hollywood the Northern Irish ARE British. Moreover the use of the expression British to refer to the English  which would have been what he meant  is a uniquely American error.There are also numerous howlers in the story. For example if destroying the plans is so important to the assassin why does he go off and leave them laying about to be discovered? When the gangster falls dead in the carpark what happens to the body? Where did Gere's pistol come from in the final scenes? Why did the Jackal wait for the FBI to arrive before opening fire on the intended victim? Why when they knew who it was and that he was there did they not simply postpone the opening? Why were there no police or security arriving in the Metro station  apart from the one killed ? These things aside a good set of cliffhangers and one excellent and novel twist a play on our assumptions at the end.".

	schema:headline " Bruce Willis got a big  Gun!";
	schema:reviewBody "It took a friend a lot of convincing to make me see The Jackal. After all the original Day of the Jackal remains one of my alltime favorites and since I'm not particularly fond of remakes I gave this film a skip for many years. However there come those days of 'nothing else on TV so what the hell' and must admit the remake isn't halfbad.Edward Fox is one of my favorite on screenassassins having played his role so convincing that it was frightening. His passionless killingmachine made him look less human than Arnies Terminator and seeing the Day of the Jackal as a kid the thought that people like this could actually exist gave me the creeps. Other than his strange stagecroonerpersona of 'Bruno' Bruce Willis' Jackal may well be the most unusual Willis you've seen to date. Let's speak honest Bruce is a character whom everybody likes to watch on screen  but a thespian with a great repertoire he's not. Willis seems to try and 'outHerod' Edward Foxes psychopath from the original  and does a remarkable job. At times his performance is eerie indeed having the evil glare of a jackal.It's a nice nod to the original where it is not only left open whether the Jackal was hetero homo bisexual or something completely different that there are hints that Willis' Jackal may actually be gay. This is not meant to sound demeaning but a gay Bruce Willis is like let me think a straight Bruno the Sasha Baron Cohen Bruno not Willis' alterego. While Edward Fox slept with victims of both sexes Willis is only once seen seducing a future victim in this case a male politician. But more so during the few moments where we see the supposed real personality if something like this exists of the Jackal there's something distinctly feminine about the character. One example would be when he kills Major Koslova the other more poignant when he receives the call that the contract is off while taking a bath and sipping on Rose wine also a remarkable scene because Willis manages to do all the acting with his eyes alone.To speak of the 'supporting' roles because a film with Bruce Willis other than Pulp Fiction only has one real star all fine as you'd expect from veterans like Richard Gere despite the cringeworthy accent Sidney Poitier sadly one of his last few screenappearances JK Simmons Tess Harper or Jack Black according to rumors the audience was cheering him being shot to bits with people remarking wish this would happen in every film he's in.Of course the movie has weaknesses and plotholes that are bigger than that Freudian nightmare which is the Jackals gun. For the life of me I still don't understand how the exterrorist Isabella Zanconia could have aided with the capture of the Jackal. But so what? In the end this is a boy's movie boys who like big guns and dramatic actionscenes involving helicopters carchases and big guns. Boys who like loud snappy technosoundtracks accompanying Bruce Willis firing big guns. Boys who like to watch Jack Black being obliterated by a big gun. In short boys like you and me  and despite still not being very fond of remakes I can honestly say that I liked The Jackal. Doesn't have to be caviar all the time goes a saying  sometimes a burger from greasy McDs will do just as there are times for a nobrainer like The Jackal.7 generous points out of 10 because giving points doesn't cost money.".

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERSCatonJones once described himself as a setemup and shoot 'em director. He sees himself as a journeyman then which is fair enough it's hard enough to forge a career in film as it is but his 'Rob Roy' shows he's capable of more. Still it's to his credit that he keeps this shambles on the road but that's half the trouble. His competence prevents this turkey from becoming the laughter riot it needs to be in order to be truly entertaining.I won't bore you with the daft plot details. But what's this? I've just received a fax telling me that my dog has been kidnapped and I won't see him alive again if I don't. Blimey okay then. Did you know that the KGB allows the FBI to bust Russian Mafiosa in the heart of Moscow? In fact they're best buddies now and the KGB is invited over to run around the USA too. So it was only ever a lukewarm war then. In fact if a Russian nuclear submarine was ever to sink they'd call their American buddies straight away for help. Anyway the Russian mafia man Terek Murad is mildly miffed at the death of his brother in the aforementioned raid and gives one of his serfs a splitting not to mention lifelong headache for failing to protect him. I loved that man like a brother. So I took no joy in that. Imagine what I can do with someone I hate he tells the assembled mobsters. Bravo! Encore! The orchestra stands. Garlands fly. Tears flow. A superb delivery of a classic line. Familiarity can never wither it's sweet bloom. Long may it reign. Imagine what I can do to someone I hate. Well actually I can. You give them a Tom Cruise video.Meanwhile the FBI man involved in the Moscow raid Carter Preston is in Ireland to get an IRA man released from prison to help him find the Jackal who has been hired by Murad to exact a bloody and unknown terrorist outrage in the States. The terrorist Declan McQueen giggle is not like those other nasty provos. He doesn't bomb. An attitude that no doubt made him a man to trust within the organization. Maybe he just handled the cloakroom during army council meetings. Or did the sandwiches. You see our Declan is a man of integrity. Instead of hiding behind a bush and blowing the legs off people he just shoots them instead. Hey there's a war on you know. Or so Declan tells us. Hang on a minute wasn't an IRA man involved with the deal to partition the country in the first place? Blimey I do wish they'd make their minds up. One minute it's peace on then next minute it's peace off. Anyway to hell with politics this is Hollywood. On with the action! Or inaction in this case. So Declan is released by a curiously magnanimous British government HA! to accompany Mr.Porter and a chain smoking Russian agent named Koslova to find Declan's exwife Isabella who has seen the Jackal's face and is also a Basque terrorist turned housewife. So what did she do in that terrorist organization make the tea? Is she cuddly too? Still if a bottle top gets stuck in the kitchen she can always shoot it off. Koslova ignores Isabella slipping Declan a key to his cuffs. After all he's no danger to the public just a cuddly chap who shoots people he disagrees with. Declan reveals to Preston that he too has seen the Jackal while being double crossed during a Libyan arms deal. What arms that were intended to be sent to Ireland to blow up innocent people? But he said he doesn't bomb. He just let's someone else do it. So that's alright then he's still cuddly. He only bombs when he tries to do an Irish accent.Meanwhile the Jackal is taking a different approach to his predecessor Edward Fox who disposed of a blackmailer with a discreet karate chop and then hid the body in a trunk. Taking a more subtle approach in this remake our Jackal takes the blackmailer to the wide outdoors and proceeds to shoot at him for several minutes with a very big and loud gun followed by the blowing up of his car in a massive explosion that must have been heard for miles around. Later on our hero Declan has traced the bad guy to a boat race moored in a harbour. Preston realising that some people are born cuddly while others have cuddlyness thrust upon them lets our Declan go wandering off on his own to find the Jackal but without a walkytalky. What's he supposed to do when he finds him jump up and down screaming HE'S HERE! THE 'S HERE!? Thus getting himself shot at. Saved by Koslova Declan is mysteriously promoted to what looks like the boss of the whole FBI operation. But hang on since Koslova got a good look at the Jackal's face hasn't Declan's involvement become redundant thus earning him a oneway ticket back to the nick? But NO! They need him. He's indispensable. He's a grubby little sniper. He's...he's...Irish? Yes that's it he's IRISH! And looks a bit like Richard Gere. Funny that. And this time it's personal. The 'war' in Ireland his big calling is forgotten. Meanwhile our highly professional and singleminded Jackal decides to stage an entirely superfluous  attack on Koslova who is guarding Isabella in a house. He is also somehow able to determine how many people are inside and outside the house at any given moment from a vantage point hiding in a dark closet under the stairs. Must have xray specs on. Finally after serving up a little lead salad he leaves giving Koslova a clue as to his intended target. My God he must want that 70m so badly. Anyway she got off lightly. Think what he might do to people he actually HATES. Like leave a map with arrows. I mean can you imagine Edward Fox's Jackal poisoning his van's door handles thus leaving a somewhat conspicuous corpse next to it in a public car park? AND he was only offered a million in that film. Perhaps This Jackal prefers a cat and mouse game. But a mouse doesn't usually send up flares.So finally getting his mind back to the job in hand our Jackal decamps to a speech given by the first lady where he sits inconspicuously next to an open van with a large gun sticking out the back of it. But our Declan has sussed his move and is on the roof looking for him through the sights of a rifle. Will he be able to shoot the Jackal or will his shooting arm be irresistibly drawn towards some innocent civilians? Old habits die hard. However the Jackal legs it into the subway and spotting Declan looking for him in the crowd decides to do the sensible international man of mystery thing by staring directly back at Declan. With conveniently dyed blonde hair. A chase reaches on to another platform which is mysteriously empty. Have all the people suddenly left to join the IRA? Including the police? After all an organization that is full of members refusing to bomb things must need all the help it can get. Our Declan is soon in a sticky situation with the Jackal after exchanging his gun for a child hostage what a guy. So cuddly. I'm seeing fluffy bunnies! But the Jackal is taking an awful long time to shoot him. But help is at hand. It's Isabella! Blimey what a coincidence. She must have been out shopping for banana clips and other house hold appliances. Well Carter Porter is impressed by our homicidal man of the people. So he decides to look the other way and let Declan wander off. How heart warming. Just imagine if that was a British film and that was one of the Oklahoma bombers Scotland Yard let disappear into the sunset. Really gets you there doesn't it?Well it's a very long and boring review but let me tell you it's not a long and boring film. This is a GREAT film. A masterpiece. It's amazing. Wonderful. Encore! Author! Now please release my dog. Mind you if it's the Jackal who has done the kidnapping I've nothing to worry about. He could use cyanide a tank an Uzi 100 pounds of plastic explosives the Iraqi air gun chemical weapons and last but not least a small nuclear device and the pooch would still be left smiling and breathing untouched. Could you just do me a favour Mr Jackal and feed him for me before releasing him? No not that end the one that barks.".

When watching THE JACKAL I found myself comparing American and European films . The original DAY OF THE JACKAL was a very European movie filmed entirely in Europe with a mainly European cast and crew with a very understated performance from Edward Fox as a very English assassin . It was a film that was both intelligent and compelling . The remake on the other hand  Despite having a Scottish director  is a very American film  Loud  vulgar  not very clever  with box office consideration over riding creative and artistic factors . You want a determined and ruthless assassin ? How about Jean Reno ? Ah but you cant do that because the studio want a big name American actor like Bruce Willis in the title role  a role where his character has to don several disguises none of which make him look like anything more than Bruce Willis in a disguise  A bit like Val Kilmer in THE SAINT where no matter how much the hero disguises himself he always looks like Val Kilmer   And being an American film who better to play an IRA man than that well known wee  short  fat  middle aged Irish actor Richard Gere whose  oirish  accent is less convincing than the Jackals disguises . Once again this is the fault of the studio who are dying to cast a big name no matter how unsuitable they are for the role and once again Im disgusted to see an IRA character as a good guy . Note to American film producers  By the 1990s most Irish Americans recognised the provisional IRA for what they are  Murdering scum . In fact one of the main reasons the IRA wanted to reach a settlement was because theyd lost all political and financial support from the Irish American lobby . The IRA had few friends over there then and have no friends over there now so stop making films with IRA characters hoping youll have a guaranteed hit in Boston and New York  its patronising to Irish Americans and offensive to us BritsI do concede THE JACKAL is entertaining in parts and I did like the bizarre title sequence featuring a montage of 20th century Russian history set against a techno soundtrack  but its a very inferior film compared to the original . In fact I cant help thinking the producers shot themselves in the foot by describing this as  A remake  because theres very little common ground between the two except for the assassin plot .

	schema:reviewBody "The 1973 Day of the Jackal directed by Fred Zinnemann from the Frederick Forsyth novel while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things was nevertheless quite an aboveaverage thriller written and carried out with considerable panache wit and style. It remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and then.In adapting that for the 1997 The Jackal it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice making it all quite leaden overdone unsuspenseful unsurprising unsexy and unthrilling.  If we put together a catalog of all the specifics that went into this movie big and small I could give you a miniessay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation ed up.Item the weapon. In the original there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to smuggle it onto the scene how he intends to disguise it and why it needs custom work from his underground craftsmen.  In the remake they apparently thought that today's actionflickraised audiences wouldn't tolerate a small rifle whose point is precision and would demand the lugubrious offtheshelf machine gun which needs a minivan to transport it and whose point is to shout Macho.  The whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components has been reduced to showing us repeatedly like this is a difficult point to follow? that the joystick for his absurdly hightech remotecontrol system has been in his pocket as a pen.  Item the conspirators and motive.Without resorting to dry lecture the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the piedsnoirs  blackfeet the FrenchAlgerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism and formed the view that De Gaulle had betrayed them.  This gives the whole plot some historical weight. The remake seems to leave it as a ganglandshootout revenge story minimally spicing it up by making them Russian gangsters.  Note please that I'm not opposed to updating they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but nontrivial.  Certainly Russia and the rest of exUSSR have been through huge changes of late and an updated story could have been situated there  in a way that would make us feel that it matters.Item the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down and the complex steering of the viewer's sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy.Above I hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall but in this aspect it really was one.  We follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught  at least not too soon!  Then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation  protection efforts and bitbybit we take to him and see he is not the sadsack his domestic troubles may have suggested.  By the time it matters we have been won over to his side.In the remake perhaps Poitier could have handled that sort of development  but Gere sure can't.  And the absurd 48 Hoursderived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from.  The remake has the assassin and the assassinhunter talk about how they 're like players above a chessboard communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to infer what the other is like.  That was achieved superbly in the original.  But in the remake in fact they're brought into facetoface confrontation way too soon so they can grimace at each other bloody the place up and go through some fairly standard chase scenes.Item photography and scenery.The remake does have some nice images particularly in snowy Finland in the opening section.  But the Washington D.C Metro cannot really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces.  ".

Certainly Russia and the rest of exUSSR have been through huge changes of late and an updated story could have been situated there  in a way that would make us feel that it matters.Item the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down and the complex steering of the viewer's sympathies from the bad guy to the good guy.Above I hesitated somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall but in this aspect it really was one.  We follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness we begin to admire him and not want to see his plan thwarted or see him caught  at least not too soon!  Then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation  protection efforts and bitbybit we take to him and see he is not the sadsack his domestic troubles may have suggested.  By the time it matters we have been won over to his side.In the remake perhaps Poitier could have handled that sort of development  but Gere sure can't.  And the absurd 48 Hoursderived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from.  The remake has the assassin and the assassinhunter talk about how they 're like players above a chessboard communicating indirectly via their moves and only able to infer what the other is like.  That was achieved superbly in the original.  But in the remake in fact they're brought into facetoface confrontation way too soon so they can grimace at each other bloody the place up and go through some fairly standard chase scenes.Item photography and scenery.The remake does have some nice images particularly in snowy Finland in the opening section.  But the Washington D.C Metro cannot really compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and bystander faces.  ";

Bruce Willis and Richard Gere had great chemistry. Willis was the reason why I saw this movie. I was surprised to see Sidney Poitier here but he did a great job as usual.Overall this is a solid film that is there for enjoyment not for awards or major critical success.

Before Danny moved to England he helped setting Anna to this world by removing the chord that was twisted around her neck during her birth and at that point he exclaimed a wish to marry her someday...This is first of all a romantic comedy with Danny's chase for Anna as the main plot and quite a lot of interesting subplots and characters. It is most enjoyable and in the end a real feelgood movie. The script is intelligent and at times extremely funny. Especially Danny's landlord Mr. Klammer has got some killer lines early on.The acting is also excellent. Jude Law is his usual self wellacting and beautiful Brenda Blethyn can do no wrong on the screen it seems and Gretchen Mol shows that she is more than just a pretty face. But the real standout performance is Jennifer Tilly as the blind sister Nina...I'm really wondering when she's going to go get the recognition she obviously deserves... A great cast all together.The film has a few flaws the most notable being a rather predictable story but excellent acting and witty writing more than make up for that. Overall Music From Another Room is a highly recommendable romantic comedy far better than most straightonvideo stuff.".

But because the film works on a much smaller scale than a huge doorstop novel the characters are developed very economically in the film.  However thanks to an absolutely inspired bit of casting with the likes of Jeniffer Tilly and Brenda Blethyn as the dying mother the film works extremely well.  And of course the chemistry between the two leads Jude Law and Gretchen Mol is undeniable and provides much of the appeal of the film.  An absolute must see love story which skips beautifully over the potential cliches of the genre and will have you laughing and crying in equal measures.".

	schema:headline " Great ScreenplayWeak Lead Performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Music From Another Room is certainly recommended viewing for what it is and despite what it fails to be. Writer Charlie Peters constructed as good a screenplay as you will ever find in the straight romantic genre. Unfortunately there is a failure in the execution as director Charlie Peters drops the ball in his casting decisions and in his efforts to extract the necessary performances from the two leads Jude Law Danny and Gretchen Mol Anna. And solid efforts from the supporting cast are not enough to make up for these key deficiencies.Peters' story was inspired by Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. It is Danny's fate shortly after arriving in town to stumble across Grace Swan Brenda Blethyn and her family who he has not seen since he was five. Happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. At age five he had assisted his physician father in delivering daughter Anna like the book the family's three daughters are named Anna Karen and Nina. Seconds after Anna's birth 5 yearold Danny had vowed that they would one day be married. But there is no indication in the screenplay that the grownup Danny has come to town for this purpose on the contrary he came to be with another woman who he has fallen in love with but who dumps him and moves away shortly after his arrival.Peters should get credit for a great title as Music From Another Room is a metaphor Danny uses to illustrate how he has felt in the past when he was in love. The idea being that love is like listening to a favorite song playing in the distance and coming back on the same beat of the song when it has been periodically drowned out by closer noises.He should also get credit for the originality of the twoheaded coin flip sequence which sets up the film's resolution according to the flip of a regular coin. The irony being the characters' ability to flip this device of randomnessdestiny into an exercise of their free will.Although not a comedy the film is has a lot of charm and some funny moments. Even with its flaws it is better than average but this does leave you regretting that Peters did not recognize his limitations as a director and bring in someone who could have better executed the ambitious vision of his screenplay.The problem is that the quirky and original elements which make the screenplay so good require exceptional performances from the lead characters who must nonverbally convey a whole lot of character motivation as well as several moments of profound revelation. For actors up to this challenge and for a skilled director the roles offer a wonderful acting for the camera opportunity. For Law Mol and Peters it is way too much to ask and the result is strained and unconvincing. Which means that the mixes of sadness and joy fate and free will ignorance and revelation never achieve the dimensionality they should have. The failure to fill in the blanks with behavioral information combined with elements that were deleted in the editing process introduces an element of incoherence that ultimate undermines an excellent story.Law who has certainly demonstrated acting ability in most of his filmshas stated that he regrets doing Music From Another Room and that he let himself be talked into the part. This may actually be true as he certainly gives very little of himself to the performance. The interesting thing is that the part actually has more potential than roles he has chosen and into which he has thrown a lot of energy.Brenda Blethyn and Jane Adams turn in great performances and one can only wish that Adams and Mol had traded parts.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

It doesn't make any sense until you see the film in which the phrase is part of a slightly silly metaphor about the nature of love. However the title actually made me watch the film along with the promise of wellknown actors Jude Law Jennifer Tilly and Brenda Blethyn.The film is funny at times and lovable in the way we expect from romantic comedies  the opening scenes of young Danny's participation in a baby's birth is a good example full of sweetness and humanity from Brenda Blethyn and young actor Cory Buck. But this is basically not a very good film. The major problem is in the directing and the editing which are without elegance and with plenty of flaws. Too many parts of the film are unfunny. A large part of the latter half of the film is strained and repetitive. The intended mixture of sadness and joy is handled too unoriginally to be anything but indecision.On top the storyline is incoherent Danny's immediate crush on a girl he hasn't seen since her birth is not backed by anything other than Gretchen Mol's nice but perhaps rather bland appearance. For the most part the character is described as a closed and slightly dull personality and Mol plays it with a stiffness to match.Jude Law is a splendid talent but his part much too romanticized and fundamentally uninteresting. Jennifer Tilly plays a blind girl who is provoked into experiencing life more than she has she is good but not excellent. In the end my favorite actors here are Brenda Blethyn and Jane Adams both in fairly small parts.".

The only significant error is in casting Gretchen Mol as Danny's Anna because Mol never allows us to understand why Danny or any man should bother with the bland and onedimensional Anna. Mol's Anna is unlikeable from beginning to the end of the film and unfortunately never seems to be worthy of Danny's admiration.".

If everything is discussed on a round table not literally it becomes more educational and less charming. That is what is pulling this movie down. Movies like French Kiss or Addicted to Love never surprised any viewer with a climax. But those films took their breaths away no doubt. I wish this one was a little more subtle and metaphoric. That way I would not have to settle for a 7.Though there is no surprise in the end the end is very beautiful. Feels like it's filmed by some different director than the one who filmed the educational speeches. But anyway this is a lovely film to see.

The movie starts out as if Jude Law's character will be focal point of the story but actually it's Gretchen Mol's character that the story revolves around. There are the usual scenes where Mol's character is supposed to grow but most of them do not work. I'd blame this mostly on the script. I found it awkward and unnatural. It is not always clear what is going on in the characters' minds from the things that they say although there are plenty of closeups of the various characters which I suppose are meant to make up for this. There is the classic final scene where Mol's character is supposed to realize that she should be with Law's character but it doesn't resonate in any way. It doesn't ring true because it fails to tie together everything that has been going on in the movie up to that point. Overall a disappointment since I thought this movie had the necessary elements to be a good romantic dramacomedy.".

The play is as neat and compact as the film is muddled and overblown. I loved the play and was disappointed to see that some of my favorite elements were changed for the film. The play is set in Brookhaven MS has a cast of six and plays like a symphony with recurring themes and a distinct rhythm. The film moves the action to Yazoo City a somewhat more industrial setting so it loses some of the southern charm of the play. The film shows us the other contestants the audience members and various other members of the community. This carnival atmosphere distracts us from the core issues of the play which are Carnelle's relationship with her family and her need to find her place in the world. Although I feel that Alfre Woodard did a stellar job in portraying Popeye Jackson this role was originally written as a very backwoods white girl. The change to a black character made it impossible to keep the very sweet romance between her and Delmount in the screenplay. In the film Elaine played marvelously by Mary Steenburgen displays a certain mean streak which is absent in the play.In conclusion Miss Firecracker is a very wellacted but overly busy adaptation of a beautifully succinct play about a very eccentric southern family. I recommend the movie for the performances of Holly Hunter Mary Steenburgen Tim Robbins and especially Alfre Woodard. I also recommend reading or seeing the play to really understand the core characters and their relationships to one another.".

Independence from the opinions of others independence from the ties of what someone has set as a standard of beauty the independence to explore and find yourself.Carnelle Scott is a young local woman and she believes that if she can be Miss Firecracker she will receive the validation she has always craved and then leave the town and go onto success elsewhere. She has no friends in town and her reputation is not the best. She has a boyfriend who adores her Glenn but it isn't enough.One inspiration for her is her cousin Elain and there Carnelle doesn't see the forest for the trees. Elain is a past Miss Firecracker. She's not only totally selfinvolved but her life is built around her past victories.

Independence from the opinions of others independence from the ties of what someone has set as a standard of beauty the independence to explore and find yourself.Carnelle Scott is a young local woman and she believes that if she can be Miss Firecracker she will receive the validation she has always craved and then leave the town and go onto success elsewhere. She has no friends in town and her reputation is not the best. She has a boyfriend who adores her Glenn but it isn't enough.One inspiration for her is her cousin Elain and there Carnelle doesn't see the forest for the trees. Elain is a past Miss Firecracker. She's not only totally selfinvolved but her life is built around her past victories.

Supporting her efforts are a group of very odd people among them Glenn Robbins and Steenburgen who seem to not want to let on to Hunter that they don't expect her to succeed when she starts out but when they see her on the stage they all almost anyway cheer her and become very upset when she ends up fifth runner up.

The firsthalf dialogue tells us about Carnelle's Holly Hunter plans to be in the contest. But the action mostly centers on peripheral family problems involving Carnelle's two cousins Elain Mary Steenburgen a former winner and Delmount Tim Robbins something of a roving cad. Both just happen to arrive back in Carnelle's small town to be characters in the script.The second half gets us closer to pageant time. But again Elain and Delmount dominate the plot so that for example as contestants parade onstage the camera is on Delmount delivering dialogue tangential to the film's supposed theme on beauty pageants. The one funny moment was a reference by another character to bullfrogs that had been dressed in miniature glamorous costumes.The story's theme is somewhat clichd contestants enter pageants for acceptance and love. That may have been true in times past. But I think in today's competitive world the real motivation is money or a shot at stardom.Visuals are acceptable. Cinematography is competent though conventional. That the film was shot on location in Mississippi adds some realism to the setting. Casting and acting are okay I guess. Background music trends nondescript and unmemorable.This film could have been so much more. I don't know anything about the play upon which the film is based. But I might have enjoyed the movie more if the writers had scrapped the original material and wrote an original story that put the focus on the pageant rather than on a dysfunctional family.".

	schema:headline " Perfect example of ghastly Southern fried nonsense";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood has a morbid obsession with taking acclaimed stage plays centering on Southern eccentrics and shepherding them to the screen with great fanfare. Sometimes the gamble works in spades Driving Miss Daisy and Steel Magnolias but most of the time it is a pure disaster.Miss Firecracker is a dramedy centering on the woeful Carnelle a Mississippi sad sack played by Holly Hunter whose unrealistic dream is to enter and win the Miss Firecracker contest. Because her flighty cousin Mary Steenburgen won many years ago and subsequently married well Carnelle has rationalized that winning will prove to be her ticket out of the sticks away from her dead end job and onward to glory. With her cousin returning to town to give a speech at the current contest Carnelle hopes to don her cousin's lucky red dress and cinch the prize. Events are complicated by Carnelle's flirtation with local guy Scott Glenn and the arrival of unbalanced cousin Tim Robbins who starts a relationship with the timid seamstress Alfre Woodard helping Carnelle.I am uncertain what Miss Firecracker played like on the stage but Miss Firecracker the film is an uneven tiresome and charmless mess. Beth Henley who penned this along with other misfires like Crimes of the Heart is a taste that I have not acquired. Uncomfortably unfunny when it takes a stab at comedy and woefully lacking when straining for deep insight Miss Firecracker is the typical clichd cornpone idiocy that one expects from depictions of zany Southern characters. God help us all if these depictions are anywhere close to the truth. This is the type of film where the token black character gets saddled with the name Popeye like we are still in the age of the minstrel show  perhaps they still are in Mississippi where this foolishness is set. I couldn't say.A huge problem comes from the fact that the central character of Carnelle is pathetic and often strains the nerves. When her big strategy of winning is dying her hair a garish shade of red and garbing herself in her cousin's lucky dress it is difficult to believe that a talentless boob like Carnelle could qualify for the contest much less potentially win it. Credibility is further thrown to the wind when her idea of a home run is to play a scene as Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind while chomping a carrot  a sequence which makes Carnelle resemble an unholy cross between a drag queen and Bugs Bunny. You have major problems when you not only do not root for your main character to achieve her dreams but actively dislike her and feel associating with her is killing your brain.It surely does not help that Hunter plays Carnelle at a shrill level that registers a 10 on the Richter scale. Hunter with her godawful Texas twang set to earshattering decibels veers wildly between aggravating and psychosis. If one of her costars pushed her out a window to stop the noise it would have been justifiable homicide. By contrast Glenn is so laconic that he seems comatose. Steenburgen struts and vamps with such campy abandon that the discovery of a late act betrayal seems less shocking than it is a foregone conclusion. Robbins and Woodard actually manage some touching and nuanced moments although the inclusion of the former means we must endure a series of thoroughly tasteless early moments of him shoveling up the rotting carcasses of dogs run down in the road as part of his dead end job.There is not an abundance of suspense as to whether Carnelle wins the contest. Henley is well known for her faux bittersweet baloney so an unsatisfactory conclusion is a given. Truthfully not only does Carnelle not deserve a win anyway she should be driven out of town. Then again most of the people we meet in this Southern fried cesspit should be driven out of town. This is the kind of film where if you have an intent of discouraging anyone from visiting the American South you should show them this film and advise it is an accurate description of the people you will meet there. Trust me they will never set foot below the Mason Dixon Line.".

Sometimes the gamble works in spades Driving Miss Daisy and Steel Magnolias but most of the time it is a pure disaster.Miss Firecracker is a dramedy centering on the woeful Carnelle a Mississippi sad sack played by Holly Hunter whose unrealistic dream is to enter and win the Miss Firecracker contest. Because her flighty cousin Mary Steenburgen won many years ago and subsequently married well Carnelle has rationalized that winning will prove to be her ticket out of the sticks away from her dead end job and onward to glory. With her cousin returning to town to give a speech at the current contest Carnelle hopes to don her cousin's lucky red dress and cinch the prize. Events are complicated by Carnelle's flirtation with local guy Scott Glenn and the arrival of unbalanced cousin Tim Robbins who starts a relationship with the timid seamstress Alfre Woodard helping Carnelle.I am uncertain what Miss Firecracker played like on the stage but Miss Firecracker the film is an uneven tiresome and charmless mess. Beth Henley who penned this along with other misfires like Crimes of the Heart is a taste that I have not acquired. Uncomfortably unfunny when it takes a stab at comedy and woefully lacking when straining for deep insight Miss Firecracker is the typical clichd cornpone idiocy that one expects from depictions of zany Southern characters. God help us all if these depictions are anywhere close to the truth. This is the type of film where the token black character gets saddled with the name Popeye like we are still in the age of the minstrel show  perhaps they still are in Mississippi where this foolishness is set. I couldn't say.A huge problem comes from the fact that the central character of Carnelle is pathetic and often strains the nerves. When her big strategy of winning is dying her hair a garish shade of red and garbing herself in her cousin's lucky dress it is difficult to believe that a talentless boob like Carnelle could qualify for the contest much less potentially win it. Credibility is further thrown to the wind when her idea of a home run is to play a scene as Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind while chomping a carrot  a sequence which makes Carnelle resemble an unholy cross between a drag queen and Bugs Bunny. You have major problems when you not only do not root for your main character to achieve her dreams but actively dislike her and feel associating with her is killing your brain.It surely does not help that Hunter plays Carnelle at a shrill level that registers a 10 on the Richter scale. Hunter with her godawful Texas twang set to earshattering decibels veers wildly between aggravating and psychosis. If one of her costars pushed her out a window to stop the noise it would have been justifiable homicide. By contrast Glenn is so laconic that he seems comatose. Steenburgen struts and vamps with such campy abandon that the discovery of a late act betrayal seems less shocking than it is a foregone conclusion. Robbins and Woodard actually manage some touching and nuanced moments although the inclusion of the former means we must endure a series of thoroughly tasteless early moments of him shoveling up the rotting carcasses of dogs run down in the road as part of his dead end job.There is not an abundance of suspense as to whether Carnelle wins the contest. Henley is well known for her faux bittersweet baloney so an unsatisfactory conclusion is a given. Truthfully not only does Carnelle not deserve a win anyway she should be driven out of town. Then again most of the people we meet in this Southern fried cesspit should be driven out of town. This is the kind of film where if you have an intent of discouraging anyone from visiting the American South you should show them this film and advise it is an accurate description of the people you will meet there. Trust me they will never set foot below the Mason Dixon Line.";

According to some Dutch and French webpages like httpperso.orange.frcinefrance1960zazie.html Zazie is not played by 12yo Catherine but by a 9yo Milne what seems right to me by the looks of her she's definitely too petite for a 12yo age 9 or 10 seems much more likely. In the trailer she is described as a 9yo too. Her lines seem a little too adult now and then but bear in mind who wrote the scenario! Louis Malle was famous for breaking taboos. This movie was intended for enjoyment like a comedy but with a sharp view on the changing French society. Also some comments on hypocritical ways of dealing with taboos like homosexuality and dirty old men. Funny to see the traffic congestion in Paris already then and the looney effects inspired by Tex Avery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zazie dans le Metro is the kind of movie that owes its relative positive outcomes more to its style than to its comedy of errors kind of humor. Having been made as an American film and this would be considered a disaster. Why? It would lose in style technique good cultural references and meaningful message. Don't be fooled Zazie has a message in between scenes. Despite an apparent lovely child as the main character and the apparent comedic routine of the film this is more inclined to be a grown up's picture than one suitable for children  they can watch but the easily impressible ones in the audience will keep asking their parents the meaning some of the words used by the girl many of them cursing. So if you want to insist on watching this with a kid be warned that you're going to be just like the adult characters of this explaining everything to the kid.It tells the story of a 12 yearold country girl Catherine Demongeot who is left with her uncle Philippe Noiret a performer artist while her mother is spending a lovely time with her boyfriend. She flees from the house with the intent of taking the subway but that plan fails because they're on a strike so the rest of the movie is her sort of understandable childish behavior against the fact so she explores the city and creates a lot of confusion against anyone she sees.Cartoonish filled of speedup images running as if it were an imitation of a Bugs Bunny gag Zazie dans le Mtro would be an interesting film if it had some coherence rather than just creating images just for fun. An adventurous piece about a girl discovering herself and learning about what growing up means ultimate message of the film would be great. The clownish tone of it was distractive and flat. I was reminded of Amlie since it shared a young female's magical and unusual vision around a big city it's her small world colliding very beautifully with other persons other realities forming a reflexive image about society. Both are colorful and fast paced works carried with visual style and splendorous editing tricks. Amlie is better because it has somewhere to go while Zazie is pure slapstick losing humor the more it progresses. It's not a bad movie but it's not so dignifying of having a terrific director like Louis Malle writing and directing it and let's face it humor doesn't suit him. His greatest works are all dramas see Au Revoir Les Enfants or Damage. It's a good picture indeed genius in its creative compositions elaborated sequences the breathless one in the Eiffel Tower takes the cake paying an homage to the silent era but it's a real tough break to endure the annoying little brat her mannerisms and language not believable in the 1960's context which isn't funny or humored because she's mistreating people who are good to her and undeserving of such treatment.I liked what I saw even though I laughed only once or twice. Mr. Noiret was a class act and made this a very enjoyable film along with the great locations. And don't be fooled by the false advertising she only spends ten seconds in the subway and doesn't even notice. 610".

Seven months ago a cultculturaltheatre from Rio de Janeiro relaunched Zazie and when I saw the advertisement I just thought what a fun and strange movie! Look at its name Zazie No Metr the same zazie in the subway! Look at this little girl at her face and the plot! Well only 3 days ago I finally watched it at a Brazilian cabletv station Eurochannel that shows only European movies and shows. For instance in Eurochannel I watched all these criticsloved and Europeanfestivalwinners such as Festen La Double Vie de Veronique Ma vie en Rose great film Entre Tinieblas Almodovar! Breaking the Waves Bent and a lot I mean a lot of movies made by Franois Truffaut L'Amour in Fuite Tirez sur le Pianiste Baisers Vols Domicile Conjugal Les Deux Anglaises Et Le Continent Les 400 Coups Jules et Jim La Femme D' Ct Le Dernier Mtro... just in November! And I don't know why they aired 6 Hitchcock's films although they were made in USA. Euro is just great. And seeing that Zazie would be aired at it was great. I thought If it is in Eurochannel it must be good...And Zazie is really very good! The beginning is simply hilarious with unforgettable scenes. Zazie running away in Paris while a friend of his uncle try to catch her and then a man that she stoled a jeans is the best of all showing her laughs she appearing and then disappearing like a cartoon. Then she walks in Paris finding even more strange people. But unfortunately after 1 hour it starts to be quite boring. Zazie stops to do her smart comments while the others characters talk more and more culminating in a crazy fight with all of them in a restaurant. And suddenly it ends with a memorable quote of Zazie. Watch it to see.But the biggest surprise was when I realized that the director of Zazie dans le mtro was Louis Malle and that he had directed the touching Au revoir les enfants too that I watched only 1 month ago. It's fun to see how Louis made such different films while Zazie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen Au revoir les enfants is one of the sadder. Au revoir is dark gloomy touching and dramatic and very beautiful too. So I wouldn't recommend only Zazie but Au revoir les enfants too. They're very different but they have one thing in common they're great.".

Raymonde Queneau is a sort of James Joycelite whose work is studded with wordplay but JeanPaul Rappeneau and director Louis Malle make it work. A simple premise  Zazie played by 12 year old Catherine Demongeot is brought to Paris by her mother and dumped on uncle Philippe Noiret so mom can enjoy some R and R with her latest boyfriend. Zazie has only one desire to see and ride on the Metro but the Metro is on strike  spins out of control as foulmouthed Zazie takes off on her own and encounters a succession of preMonty PythonBasil Fawlty types in nothing flat. As if this bouillabaisse needed seasoning Uncle is a drag artist though straight with it. If you don't respond to zany humour you'll find it infantile  as at least one commenter did  if not chances are you'll rejoice.";

I guess everyone has their directors that just seem to produce masterpiece after masterpiece in their own eyes and Malle does this for me. I'm having fun making my way through his filmography and realizing how utterly versatile he is. I'm going in a random order so I've actually seen quite a few of his works prior to watching Zazie this evening.Zazie dans le Metro is highly underrated. However maybe this is a good thing because I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It took some time for me to actually appreciate the film so I would recommend giving the movie at the very least twenty minutes. The colours were vibrant and plenty the editing was bold and quirky and the characters were unique and charming. It can be a bit chaotic at times but that's part of the appeal. I will say I wasn't a big fan of the violent chaotic almost last scene  but we're not all perfect. This has been said before but it kind of reminded me of a young Amelie Poulain and I wouldn't be surprised if JeanPierre Jeunet was inspired by the young Zazie. So if you enjoyed Amelie you will appreciate this. And if you're looking for a fun lighthearted sometimes nonsensical movie that will probably make you smile ear to ear Zazie dans le Metro is an excellent choice.".

The style of the film is quite in contrast with the previous movies of Mr. Malle.

PHILIPPE NOIRET is the unfortunate uncle in charge of taking care of a girl while her mother has other plans.The Gallic humor is not only zany it's also a bit on the puerile side. A little boy with a sign on him that says Secondhand is on display at a flea market. Little Zazie with the bawdy sense of humor and an adult's use of cuss words is funny at first but becomes tiresome by the time the story winds on and on about her wanting to escape from her funny uncle. The sight gags involving the girl running through a marketplace are enough to conjure up images of the French laughing at Jerry Lewis...for no good reason.Malle throws in every possible prop for laughs including fastmotion photography but the total effect is wearying.Paris is a lovely city but it sure has its share of rundown interiors judging from the hotel settings and the residence of PHILLIPE NOIRET as the exasperated uncle. Interesting to note that Paris traffic was a huge headache even back in 1960. All of it is photographed in color with a style that's a cross between Charlie Chaplin's Keystone Cops comedies and the art of Jerry Lewis.The uncle it turns out dances in drag in a nightclub but to bring in any more plot at this point is as senseless as the film which tries hard to be charming in a Gallic waybut never quite makes it.This one is strictly a matter of the viewer's taste. Some will love it others won't even get through the first halfhour.I've had it with that brat! cries a cabbie after spending time with Zazie. Me too.".

Seth has the power to let himself be seen but Maggie finds him far too mysterious. Seth also meets a patient Nathaniel Messinger who has news for him  he too was once an angel like Seth but chose to fall to Earth and become human.

Far from it it's a drama in all of its aspects. And Meg Ryan converts to that change very well. She acts great in this movie. It wasn't an easy part for her there is a lot of crying involved and a lot of dramatic moments in her characters life.As goes for Nicolas Cage's character. Oh my god he plays Seth with such excellence. Really i don't think that anyone else could play the part as great as he did. The way he looks the way he moves .. so cool.Ok the storyline is a little unbeleivable but you musn't be held back by that fact. Just beleive the unbeleivable. Just go with the plot and follow the movie closely.I'm not suggesting that City Of Angels is the best in it's sort. It won't win any oscars but what i am saying is that it's a nice movie with great actors great music and a good storyline which rolls towards very emotional ending.You won't be dissapointed.".

Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan give pretty good performances nothing oscarworthy but it's not the acting that makes this movie great. It's beautiful. Pure heaven to the eyes and ears. While you see the wonderful scenes and backgrounds with wonderful color and beautiful art direction and hear the perefectly performed and selected score in the background with contributions from U2 Sarah McLachlan and the surprise hit Iris from the Goo Goo Dolls it doesn't really matter what kind of acting is happening. The screenplay is pretty good but somewhat lacking which is why I give it an 8.25 on a scale from 110. Its a love story yes and can get cheesy at points but none the less it's still worth seeing once or twice.".

The movie is beautifully photographed and the love story although a little far fetched angel gives up being an angel to become human to be with the woman he loves it is still incredibly moving. Without giving away all the best parts of the movie you had better have plenty of Kleenex on hand...it's definitely a tearjerker. The ending of the movie is a testament to the power of love and life...powerful stuff. This is definitely a chick flick but is just wonderful on all levels.

None of the sermons in here are Biblical believe me. it's really more of a love story than anything else. Plus it's an interesting story with good visuals.Nicholas Cage plays a likable guy. There are actually a few good messages about God and angels  mainly that they exist  and another good message being that all of us should appreciate more what we have here on earth starting with our senses smell taste touch etc. Anyway if you like a good romance story you should like this movie.".

She's the standard actress for this kind of romantic journeys maybe because she always performs the same way.Then the photography. No spoiler here remember when Cage and his angelical companion Cassiel standing on a skyscraper mention the beauty of the view which we are carried to see and there all over the screen stands this awfully big Marlboro ad. Oh how lovely! Also those unavoidable pieces of every simplistic romance movie the character ponders it over with its score of incidental music and the great slowmo moment of ecstasy.And last the plot. Plenty of cliches love conquers all the wages of sin is death the materialistic who starts to believe again... absolutely predictable flat characters clumsy lines. Love is far more complex than this and so is death.Looking at this picture I ask why is it that nobody thinks of rewriting Romeo and Juliet or repainting Van Gogh's The sunflowers but everybody thinks it right to remake Psycho or Wings of Desire?Look for the bestseller How to spoil a classic The Movie!".

Cage as always is an acquired taste. His usual halfham approach to acting is on display here. If you are familiar with him and don't like his style then you will hate this so don't bother. Ryan is adorable and pretty and can cry on cue. So she's perfect for this kind of schmaltz. Dennis Franz appears in a reworking of Peter Falk's wonderful role in the original film. Falk was the best part of Wings of Desire for me. Franz is OK here but not particularly memorable.Despite its flaws I was actually enjoying it for the most part. Not loving it but enjoying it. It was pleasant enough. But the downbeat ending killed the whole thing for me. Look you don't want to make a pretentious art film like Wings of Desire  OK cool I'm with you there. But if you're going to make a mainstream love story then stick with that and don't give me some depressing ending. It made me feel like I wasted my time with the whole thing. It had nothing profound to say and certainly didn't have the nice visuals of Wings of Desire so it really needed to make the love story work. Instead it makes an attempt at the last minute to become something more than it is and it fails. Nice soundtrack though.".

Ryan is adorable and pretty and can cry on cue. So she's perfect for this kind of schmaltz. Dennis Franz appears in a reworking of Peter Falk's wonderful role in the original film. Falk was the best part of Wings of Desire for me. Franz is OK here but not particularly memorable.Despite its flaws I was actually enjoying it for the most part. Not loving it but enjoying it. It was pleasant enough. But the downbeat ending killed the whole thing for me. Look you don't want to make a pretentious art film like Wings of Desire  OK cool I'm with you there. But if you're going to make a mainstream love story then stick with that and don't give me some depressing ending. It made me feel like I wasted my time with the whole thing. It had nothing profound to say and certainly didn't have the nice visuals of Wings of Desire so it really needed to make the love story work. Instead it makes an attempt at the last minute to become something more than it is and it fails. Nice soundtrack though.";

	schema:headline " No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray 'Americanism' the American Way along with a romanticised view of the west as 'Frontier country' where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.And then came this film. The title 'Once Upon A Time In The West' must have seemed to mean nothing more than 'just another western' to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a 'generallyhunkydorykindofscene with the occasional bad guy and indian' and replaces it with an eerie dark hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.I cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation no conversation not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human more real to the viewer while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama is perfected by the absolute fantastic music directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and hearttearing music are not just able to carry the story but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it's genre?Another great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn't required for the understanding of the story yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals just real desireladen traumatised obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.All in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing heartshattering westerns like this one like 'A Fistful of Dynamite' 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly' and 'For a Few Dollars More' none could equal 'Once Upon A Time In The West' in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....I only wish I'd have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001 A Space Odyssey also of 1969 a year of legends.A tip for those who have never seen this movie Bribe beg borrow or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifiaudio equipment if you can't find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH never mind the neighbors and prepare never to be the same again.........I obviously gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can't find anything less than perfect about it.".

One is his understanding of  pacing events and the other is using his actorsactresses to actually  act.  When you see Claudia Cardinale riding up to the ranch all you see is  her face but you can tell instantly what she is looking at and  everything she's feeling. You know Henry Fonda's the bad guy but when  he smiles faintly at the young boy you feel there's something more to  him a personality and human qualities even if he is evil.  The final shootout itself is a masterpiece. The two protagonists say  nothing but as they face off the music lets you know the moment as  come. As they stand ready the scene that's been hinted at throughout  the movie plays out like a dream revealing what the whole story was  about. Then without warning they draw and fire. Just as in real life  it's over before you notice it.  What today's movies lack is how quickly they cater to MTV video  inspired nonstop action and endless clichs. The bad and good guy duke  it it out the violence is so extreme that no human could actually  survive it and always just when you think the bad guy is dead he gets  back up for one last shot. How much I wish today's film makers would  learn Leone's lesson about TIMING and let suspense build rather than  force it in.  The music score which had certain pieces and sections for various  moods and to signify the main characters is one of my favorites. Even  if Clint Eastwood wasn't in it Charles Bronson fills the role of the  mysterious stranger and adds his own elements to the character.  How I wish they still made movies like this".

	schema:reviewBody "Thank god that I'm a Bronson fan. This was my first Leone movie and dumb kid that I was I actually watched it thinking I was in for a  typical Bronson vehicle! Looking back I'm thankful because if it wasn't for his involvement I would never have discovered the beauty and majesty that is Once Upon a Time in the West.I absolutely love this movie. It's probably my all time favourite certainly one of the few that I can watch OVER and OVER again without losing interest. I love the way Leone creates intrigue and mystery around what is a relatively thin plot. He can make even the smallest twist of fate seem like an epic turn of events with that amazing sense of revelation that he generates out of old hackneyed situations something Argento has since picked up. Leone proves in this film that he could seemingly take anyone even peripheral characters and give them screen charisma without using dialogue as a crutch.OUATITW features the most tense two man standoffs ever with some serious dejavu in the direction of his Dollars trilogy. In fact it does feel like those three movies were warm ups  practice sessions in the build up to OUATITW. Here though he perfected everything despite the long running time it's all focused and without a single irrelevant scene. For me the two hours plus just fly by I wish it would never end. Leone was without question at his artistic peak when he made this that's not to say that he went downhill from then on but I honestly don't think he ever did another film where everything came together so perfectly.The cast is flawless. Fonda eclipsed every good guy he ever did in one fell swoop truly chilling. Robards is a great comic character the lovable rogue with an edge. And Cardinale is more than just incredible window dressing she switches between passionate angry delicate and sentimental at all the right moments.Which leaves the hero I'm a huge Eastwood fan but I honestly don't believe he could have done the role justice. His man with no name was a cool sly character with hidden complexities. Eastwood always does these layered personalities with some kind of mental baggage. Bronson on the other hand mostly does himself simple uncomplicated figures with only one state of mind that's why he's put in so many revenge flicks. Plus he looks like he's been seriously wronged at some point in his life Eastwood doesn't have that quality. Bronson is the genuine hardasnails article. You can readily imagine that had he been born decades earlier and been put in the same situation he would resolve the problem in much the same way as his character in the movie sometimes I affectionately refer to this movie as Deathwish part 0 could Harmonica be the great granddaddy of Paul Kersey?.Of course the other great contribution is the music. I still think that the main theme is one of the most breathtaking pieces of music I have ever heard. It affects me deeply whenever I hear it regardless of the mood I'm in. Maybe I should listen to more opera or something I don't know but that's the way I feel. And the individual character themes are just so well integrated into the film it's unbelievable. Leone replaces words with music and it conveys so much more in return. Bronson just plays that melancholy tune on the harmonica instead of answering people back it consistently cracks me up.High Noon Naked Spur Shane The Searchers etc. are all classics of the genre but I really  don't think it's possible to compare those traditional westerns with OUATITW. For me it exists on a plane of it's own it's the kind of film experience that you let wash over you a waking dream. I recommend this movie to anyone if you're on the right wavelength you'll be greatly rewarded.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sergio goes Hollywood for this bigname bigbudget Spaghetti Western. Fonda Bronson Robards and Cardinale queue up and take Leone's choreographic direction in an epic tale of blood and revenge.Frank is a bad guy who has killed a lot of people.  He now works for a railroad entrepreneur whose ruthless sterile tracks are spreading ever westward.  The time has come for the real Americans to confront both the railroad and Frank.Leone sat down with film intellectuals Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento and watched dozens of Hollywood westerns.  From this saturationviewing emerged a 300page treatment which was eventually distilled into the script penned by Leone and Sergio Donati.  There are conscious echoes of Shane and High Noon in the meticulouslyplotted screenplay.  Ennio Morricone apparently sat in on the planning stage and had composed the score in toto before shooting began the reverese of the usual process of fitting music to existing footage.  The result is a tight matching of soundtrack and visuals.  Robards Bronson and Cardinale each have musical 'signatures' which play whenever their characters are onscreen. Bronson's is an eerilywailing harmonica Robards has the plonking banjo and Cardinale the lush strings.  So intricately was everything structured that the themes were available to be played on set so that the actors could coordinate every nuance of gesture to fit with the score.The film is a grandiose lament to the death of the Wild West.  Decay is everywhere to be seen.  Streets bars buildings and people all have a beatup grungy look.  When Cheyenne Robards pauses beside a roughhewn wooden post there is little difference in texture between his face and the post.  Morton the cripple is killing the romantic West of open spaces with his snail trail of railroad tracks leaving the fine adventurous men Cheyenne and Harmonica nowhere to go.There can be few opening scenes with the visual and aural brilliance of this one.  Three bad guys stake out Flagstone's railroad depot in a High Noon pastiche.  Jack Elam who was actually in High Noon leads the villains.  The only spoken words throughout this long but totally gripping scene are uttered by the old station clerk.  Haunting rhythms raise the tension to an unbearable pitch ... the squeaking windmill the chattering tickertape the creaking bench.  This wonderful crescendo climaxes with the appearance of Bronson a sequence as stylised and choreographed as a Shinto ceremony all the more effective for the absence of spontaneity.Equal to and counterbalancing this scene is the very next one the introduction of Frank.  This time it is Shane that gets the treatment as the McBain boy spots five men in yellow duster topcoats.  A growing sense of unease on the McBain homestead is beautifully conveyed was the stopping of a cicada chirp ever so effective?  A cinematic multiple orgasm ensues with the musical theme crashing in as the boy sees the devastation and the camera swoops round to reveal the baddie to be none other than Henry Fonda as Morricone's trademark solitary tubular bell peals out.Cheyenne's entrance is also a piece of impressive cinema.  Inside Lionel Stander's strange labyrinthine tavern quite unlike any saloon ever filmed before the violence which hovers around Cheyenne like a dustcloud is heard but not seen preparing us for his appearance in person.  The sliding of the lamp towards Bronson works brilliantly the film's two good men sharing the light of humour the symbolic forging of a meaningful friendship.By a slow accretion the plot reveals itself.  The leviathan of the railroad must be stopped and there must be a reckoning with Frank. Gradually the fates of the main characters converge and swim into sharp focus for the shootout.It is not the story excellent though that is which lingers in the memory but rather a hundred individual flashes of brilliance  Claudia Cardinale are those eyes for real? filmed on the bed viewed vertically downward through a lace canopy Cheyenne's surprise method of concealing himself on the train Morton when you're not on that train you're like a turtle out of its shell imprisoned by the armature that helps him walk the 'heartbeat' of the train's engine during the cardgame the tension of the ambush preparations against Frank the eruption of guitar music as Bronson enters the frame Bronson's stillness and selfpossession the emblem of his righteousness Fonda's eyes flickering rapidly in his motionless head denoting the waning of his selfconfidence the amazing supercloseups of Bronson and the weird brick arch the only manmade intrusion into the entire terrain and the focus of human depravity.".

My grandmother took me she had always been a huge fan of Henry Fonda's and even though she didn't care for western's she dragged me to this one. I'll never forget how engrossed I was from beginning to end. And this one movie was the basis for all my future wish's to have been born a cowboy. Everything about this movie impressed me one way or the other.Simply put this movie is the most visually stimulating and engrossing movie I have ever watched. I have seen plenty of great movies in my in my fifty years of life but this one is in my opinion more than a movie it's a piece of history unfolding in front of your eyes with no censorship or BS added for flavor. True the movie has been chopped up some for TV and other forms of presentation but when I was in that theater in 1969 the movie was to use a semi modern term AWESOME.No one not even if you dislike westerns should pass on this one.".

	schema:headline " The Best Western ever made??? Not quite but still is AMAZING!";
	schema:reviewBody "After the great success of the masterpiece The Good The Bad and The Ugly which perfectly finished the Dollars trilogy. Sergio Leone get bored with nothing to do and decided to start another trilogy the America trilogy with Once upon a time in the West. That today is considered the best Western ever made in the history of cinema.Once upon a time in the West begins when the farmer Brett McBain Frank Wolff and his sons are murdered in cold blood by the hands of the ruthless bountykiller Frank Henry Fonda who puts the blame on the criminal Cheyenne Jason Robards. Frank was hired by the leggedrail baron Morton Gabrielle Ferzetti to just scare away McBain and his family of their land because she would be much valued with the advancement of the railroad. But on the same day Jill Claudia Cardinale arrives in town coming from New Orleans and when she finds out of the crime she reveals that she married Brett McBain weeks before in New Orleans and therefore the land still had a owner. On the same day Jill meets a mysterious man who is known for Harmonica Charles Bronson because he always carries with himself a harmonica and offers itself as a protector of Jill. And when the criminal Cheyenne knows that he is being unfairly prosecuted he decides to join forces with Harmonica to help Jill keep the lands of her deceased husband. But a web of mystery and deceit circulates between the contradictory relationship of the characters.When the film premiered at the time it was poorly received by critics and was a box office failure only today that the critics and the public praised the film as not only the best Sergio Leone's movie but also the best Western ever made. Well not quite in my opinion but I understand why people praise him as such. The main complain of the critics to the film at the time it was that the film was extreme slow. But this slowness is caused by some reasons.The first one is that the film was completely different from all the Western films ever made even from the Dollars trilogy because Leone gives the film a dramatic tone. What Leone tries to show in the story is the end of the Old West the title shows that perfectly. The original translation from Italian to English was Once upon a time THE West that is the end of the Old West. And that originally came in the time of the advance of the railways and the grand corruption and death that she brought to the population. Leone shows that giving the film an excellent script written by him and Sergio Donati which gives the film a superb narrative with beautiful dialogs between the characters but like any Leone's film it never loses his great sense of humor.The other reason is as always. the magnificent direction of Leone which once again shows advanced for its time. With its perfect closeups on characters and enormous scenarios making everything beautiful and epic. But there it comes the problem that prevents the film to even beat The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Leone was known for his quiet moments brilliantly filmed and Once upon a time is full of them but maybe too much. Without considering the first 10 minutes of the film which is brilliant putting us in the heat of the scene but others seem to boring taking the power of narrative and our investment on them.Another problem with the film is the relevance of the characters. Not that they are not superb and memorable which they are Jill is nothing more nor less than the representation of the women in the world of men in the Old West and its extreme strength and intelligence along with an excellent performance from Cardinale Cheyenne can be compared with Tuco from The Good The Bad and the Ugly both characters are cruel bandits but in several times they are shown to be simple human beings with their problems and their kind and innocent side Frank is another cruelbadass villain that Leone built in his films Frank is a bountykiller who in previous films its showed that they are honored to their job do whoever they were told and paid for and nothing more. But Frank in the film betrays its own principles and gets into the corrupt world of the railways Harmonica is almost the same character that Clint Eastwood was in previous Leone films. Mysterious don't talk much and never shows his true motives only at the most epic and badass moment of the film. All characters are fantastic but thanks to the silent moments of Leone their relevance and relationship fails in several moments in the history.I don't agree that this is the best Western film ever made but I understand why people consider it so. From a fabulous story that shows excellently the end of the era of legends with a flawless script magnificent direction and unforgettable characters. All this makes Once upon a time not only one of the best Western films ever made but a beautiful masterpiece of cinema and the beginning of another amazing trilogy! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Westerns I saw this film many times in the early 90s. Saw this recently again on a DVD aft many years. The plot Claudia Cardinale arrives at her ranch to find that her husband has been murdered by hired gun Henry Fonda. Mysterious gunman Charles Bronson wants an appointment with Fonda. Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the staredown and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly even i found some scenes boring especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long treasured career. I was surprised to know that the story was written by Dario Argento.".

Bronson teams up with outlaw Jason Robards to help protect Cardinale n her ranch from Fondas evil intentions. There are long scenes where you get close shots of a person's face. Sergio Leone loves the staredown and you can see it in virtually all of his films. In this movie he allows the camera to linger longer than ever before. You get those quiet scoreless scenes where the natural sounds of the environment are greatly exaggerated. Leone's opponents take a long time to feel each other out before they act. One may find the long stretches of silence and inaction tedious n boring. Honestly even i found some scenes boring especially the opening scene. Henry Fonda is terrific. No one expected him to play such a ruthless and brutal killer. Bronson was decent but Jason Robards was much better with his tip on guys patting females bottom n the tip on don't get shot by a person who doesn't know to shoot. One of the best part bah the film was Ennio Morricone's score especially the recurring harmonica music during the final closing fight. This is Morricone's best moment in a long treasured career. I was surprised to know that the story was written by Dario Argento.";

	schema:reviewBody "I won't claim to have the ability to say anything new about this movie. It's been around for nearly fifty years and is widely regarded as not just one the best Spaghetti Westerns of all time but one of the best Westerns full stop. And it's not hard to see why an incredible soundtrack strong performances from the entire main cast some surprisingly good humour and funny oneliners a few tense sequences a welltold story that doesn't rely on excessive dialogue or exposition and consistently amazing cinematography and direction throughout. At least half the frames in this movie would probably make good paintings no exaggeration.It's probably the marriage of the great visuals and soundtrack that make Once Upon a Time in the West work as well as it does. There's a good number of dramatic camera movements and interesting reveals that are tied up perfectly with the music almost like some kind of singingfree musical at some points.Sergio Leone was one of the greatest directors of all time. It's a real shame that he apparently never got the kind of recognition he gets nowadays while he was still alive. Out of all his films there's a strong argument to be made for this one being the closest to perfect. Honestly there's not a lot that could be changed to make it better. My biggest direct gripe is the way the title pops up at the very end of the film and rotates in a full circle before it disappears. It looks really cheesy and comes close to killing the mood the otherwise extremely strong ending creates. While we're on complaints another minor one would be that I want to say the film feels a little too long maybe about 10 to 15 minutes. But at the same time I wouldn't really know what to cut. Every scene is so wellconstructed and orchestrated and there's always something interesting to look at or listen to or think about so I'm not really sure what should be cut. It's a pretty weak complaint I know. Like I said this thing's close to perfect.The Good The Bad and The Ugly might be a tiny bit more entertaining and Once Upon a Time in America might have a slightly better soundtrack and stronger emotional moments for me personally but it's still really hard to find much to complain about here. Absolutely recommended to any Western fan and it gets a little better every time I watch it four for me now and counting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once Upon a Time in the West OUTW is a piquant cocktail of style and substance in equal parts potent enough to catapult the viewer into a whirlpool of incessant excitement transcending him beyond the usual realms of an adrenaline rush. Vintage Leone OUTW is inarguably the best Western ever made and undoubtedly features amongst the very best works of cinema period. Leone incredibly surpasses the brilliance of The Good the Bad and the Ugly TGTBTU with OUTW by blending his favorite theme of Greed with that of Revenge. The only thing that TGTBTU lacked was the presence of a strong female character and Leone more than makes up for it in OUTW. Its eccentric yet consummate plot revolves around a female protagonist thereby revolutionizing the very tenets associated with the genre where machismo and chivalry had solely held sway hitherto. OUTW is a juxtaposition of the lives of five individuals viz. Harmonica  a mysterious stranger Cheyenne  a notorious desperado Frank  a ruthless assassin Jill  a beautiful widow with an obscure past and Morton  a railroad baron whose motives inevitably make them cross each other's paths albeit through an act of fate. Henry Fonda is a revelation as the coldblooded assassin a portrayal that is remarkably contrasting to his usual 'good guy' onscreen image. He goes about his business with a sublime touch of feral grandeur that makes him equally chilling and fascinating as 'Frank'. Charles Bronson plays his part with utmost conviction and incredibly manages to conjure up an element of mystery in his portrayal that not only brings 'Harmonica' to life but also gives it a very distinct identity despite Harmonica's conspicuous similarities with Eastwood's 'Man with no name'. The role of 'Cheyenne' is played with equal brilliance by Jason Robards. He has taken care of the various subtleties and nuances to such an extent that he perfectly fits into the shoes of notorious yet likable 'Cheyenne'. Claudia Cardinale is ravishing as the beautiful yet vulnerable 'Jill McBain'. She has fully justified the trust shown by Leone in casting her and by Bertolucci in penning down a strong feminine part in a Western. She truly entrances the viewers with her mystifying pulchritude and enigmatic charm. She meticulously highlights the flaws in Jill's character while also managing to depict the elements of tenacity and grit which represent the true spirit of femininity. Gabriele Ferzetti is quite effective in his cameo as the crippled railroad baron 'Morton'. He suffers from the tuberculosis of bones and each passing day brings him closer to his end thereby further intensifying his desperate urge to fulfill his farfetched ambition of taking the railroad to the Atlantic. He truly represents a man worthy of achieving the impossible unfortunately cut short by his haplessness. Despite the inhuman and unjust means adopted by him to fulfill his naked ambition one finds it excruciatingly hard to derive pleasure from his perpetual plight and eventual doom. Contrary to the popular belief the slow pace of the movie and laconism in dialogue pose no impediment to the viewing and in fact this deliberate pacing enormously adds to the detail and beauty of the movie and also helps in brewing the desired level of tension before it is finally punctuated suddenly with quick bursts of action. Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is vividly descriptive and has elements which have become his and Leone's trademarks like the extreme closeups the quick panning of the terrain the rotating camera shots etc.The haunting score written yet again by the master composer Ennio Morricone enhances the grandeur of the movie tenfold. If Leone's direction and Colli's cinematography are the backbone of the movie then undoubtedly Morricone's plaintive score is its heart and soul. The surreal score has shades of melancholy intrigue and romance that become more obvious with each passing moment. The music features leitmotifs a melodic phrase that accompanies the reappearance of a character that relate to each of the main characters each with their own unique theme music. The soundtrack to the opening scene is a creative orchestration of ordinary sounds like that of the dripping water the clicking of a telegraph a buzzing fly and the screech of a windmill after Morricone experienced a musical performance created by the medley of these sounds. This created an exaggerated version of what had come to be known as 'Spaghetti sound'.OUTW is a magnum opus unparalleled in direction screenplay cinematography and music. With its slower pace and relatively somber theme compared to Leon's previous works Leone managed to transform his image of a satirical showman into that of an accomplished auteur capable of producing much profound works. OUTW also served as the harbinger for Leone's surrealistic masterpiece 'Once Upon a Time in America'. P.S OUTW is an absorbing masterpiece an absolute gem of a movie and a must watch for those who understand the true meaning of 'A Timeless Masterpiece' and are willing to indulge themselves completely through the whole length of the movie. 1010httpwww.apotpourriofvestiges.com".

	schema:headline " The Best Western of All Time bar none!";
	schema:reviewBody "The fourth and best of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is a sprawling operatic masterpiece of cinematography. The languid pacing only accentuates the meticulously presented scenes and the Ennio Morricone score is powerful poignant and haunting. Each major character has his own musical theme. Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it I bought the soundtrack too!.

When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain.

	onyx:emotionText "The fourth and best of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is a sprawling operatic masterpiece of cinematography. The languid pacing only accentuates the meticulously presented scenes and the Ennio Morricone score is powerful poignant and haunting. Each major character has his own musical theme. Henry Fonda's character has a menacing and jarring score which chills and thrills me every time I hear it I bought the soundtrack too!. Fonda as Frank is the coldest villain in screen history as I have read in other reviews and was cast against type in this film. When the camera pans up into his passionless blue eyes early in the movie one sees what a brilliant piece of casting it was to have him as the villain.

Every scene is a piece of art. I know of no other film that affects the senses as this one. Henry Fonda said this was his favorite film and role. It's easy to see why. He created 1 of the great bad guy roles in history. In a side note Leone wanted to put brown contacts in Fonda's eyeswho ever saw a villain with blue eyes Leone said but Fonda wouldn't have it and the effect is magic in the famous Leone closeups. Bronson Cardinale and Robards are equally powerful all have great lines and the camera loves them. Speaking of cameras the visuals are stunning. There is nothing fancy about this movie. Raw power is what you see and feel. Simply the best western if not film ever made.".

	schema:headline " Once Upon A Time.......................There was Sergio Leone";
	schema:reviewBody "No other films in the world have produced such sharp raw gritty and atmospheric yet absolutely beautiful cinematography as those directed by the Italian director the great Sergio Leone. Audiences around the world saw first hand the power and influence A Fistful Of Dollars bought to the world. It made a director famous a young Clint Eastwood a household name and the Western more popular than it had ever hoped to be since the master works of John Ford. However Sergio Leone bought with him a whole new subgenre  a whole new style  and the Western had never looked darker and grittier. 'The Man With No Name' bought with it a whole new meaning to a heroic protagonist. There was no more good guybad guy but only a survivalist type  ignorant and self indulgent yet still moral and fair tough and smart and damn good with a gun. The world fell in love with him and anticipated its sequels which only became more violent atmospheric and realistic and gave the authentic true feeling of the West.It is why I consider 'Once Upon A Time In The West' to be Sergio's definitive masterpiece. He took everything that he ever felt about the West and made some of the most intriguing 3 hours of film ever produced. The budget had never been bigger. The plot had never been more riveting. The music and setting had never been more epic and the cinematography had never been more powerful. This film is perfect start to finish!This time our premise intersects the stories of five people  yes five people  and it is brilliantly crafted. And this time it isn't a chain smoking son of a gun without a name that carries the film but rather a female prostitute. This isn't the 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' so please continue reading. The plot revolves around a certain family and its moist establishment in the middle of a desert with hopes for it to one day be a thriving town with a railway station. It is this future town that brings our five protagonists into relation. The family is murdered by a gang led by Frank Henry Fonda who works the hitman for a corrupt railway boss who wants the town out of the way so he can reach the coast and view the sea before he dies. However unaware of her arrival Jill Claudia Cardinale  the family's patriarch's fiance  comes to claim her property and therefore possesses a threat to the railway boss. Meanwhile a man with no name nicknamed 'Harmonica' he always plays a Harmonica before making a kill has come to town looking for Frank for personal reasons. Charles Bronson nails the role with extreme prejudice. Also a fugitive going by the name of Cheyenne Jason Robards assists in his journey to prove his innocence regarding being the wrongly accused murderer.No spoilers but just an assurance that this film will blow you away. It is impossible to comprehend the overwhelming powerful epic experience in one sitting. This is what motion pictures are meant to be. Masterful storytelling a larger than life score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone cinematography yet unmatched and a cast made in heaven. Performances from all the actors are some of the best you will ever see.It is films like these that redefine genres and that honorable of all words a 'classic'. Prove me wrong. For those who experienced it I hope it has impacted you in much the same way it has me. Upon its release this film was unsuccessful because the world wanted another Clint Eastwood picture. But they couldn't see for a mile what was coming. Sergio Leone is platinum. May the force be with him...........always!".

I saw it again a few days ago after reading so many positive reviews  I must admit to pretty much being bowled over! 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is not your traditional shootemup western. Its an acquired taste and I wouldn't be too far off the mark if I say that it resembles a dish with nearperfect proportions of ingredients slow cooked over an intense fire. Director Leone doffs his hat to several classic westerns and ends up with a film thats greater than the sum of its parts. The lovely Jill McBain Claudia Cardinale arrives in the old west to join her new husband  family only to find them all brutally shot dead. Clues apparently point to the bandit Cheyenne Jason Robards though the dastardly deed has in fact been perpetrated by the magnificently evil Frank Henry Fonda. Also in this lethal mix is a mysterious harmonicaplaying stranger Charles Bronson with his own covert agenda. From the classic opening scene to the explosive climax 'Once Upon A Time In The West' sucks the viewer into its vortex of emotions as layers upon layers are gradually peeled away revealing each characters true motivations. Featuring a stellar cast who have probably never been better and a haunting evocative score by maestro Ennio Morricone 'Once Upon A Time In The West' is mandatory viewing for all film aficionado's. My only small complaint is the occasional selfindulgence displayed by Leone when he tends to give style precedence over narrative.".

Jason Robards is great as the outlaw with a good heart Cheyenne and Charles Bronson is very Eastwoodlike as a man known only as Harmonica with a mysterious past and a quick draw. The central character though is that of the beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Jill a widow seeking revenge.Sergio Leone used a slower more romantic style for this Western but he still was able to produce some great images and a story that will forever be remembered. He doesn't deal too much with character development rather showing us their actions and letting that speak for themselves. And of course we cannot forget the score by Ennio Moriconne.

	schema:reviewBody "thank goodness for IMDb !!! I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship towns to be founded and flourish with mining cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy in this case the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films.".

I remember over the years that echoing mournful theme song but since I missed this movie on first release I didn't make the connection and it never played on television because of rights issues and the unusual length for the time.finally I bought it on DVD and there it was that theme song that gave me flashbacks big time.then I finally knew what the interview with Jane Fonda was about where she described her recollections seeing her father Henry in the unusual role as archvillian and another one with jack Elam about how it took all day to do the scene with the handgun and the fly.this is a remarkable western despite some stretches of credibility.the railroad indeed was the thing that finally opened the west it was the only way to move millions of tons of goods and tens of thousands of people over the long distances wagon trains were too dangerous and got off the beaten path too easily and couldn't carry enough provisions. the railroad allowed in a symbiotic relationship towns to be founded and flourish with mining cattle herding and farming around them.and thus the premise of the movie McBain is going to build a town right in front of the advancing railroad.the corruption violence and greed depicted were certainly problems of the day considering the fortunes to be made. no different than today when a big factory is built and the land selected gains 20 times its normal value and those 'in the know' engage in speculation. or oil or mineral resources are discovered on land held by simpletons who mysteriously are murdered in a 'botched' robbery or some such nonsense. it does happen.the movie is so long I haven't seen it once yet without falling asleep which is not to be taken as a criticism just that wailful haunting theme song gets to me ..... and it is close to 3 hours long.at least the good guy in this case the good girl wins in the end.gawd Claudia Cardinale is beautiful and still making films.";

The best writers and directors can make a point quickly and effectively without seeming to hurry. Sergio Leone it seems can't do that  at least not in this movie.

The word lean cannot be applied here I suppose the best phrase I can offer is elegantly lumbering.I saw the director's edition rather than the theatrical release and as far as I could tell the long scenes didn't achieve anything that ones half or even a tenth of the duration could have achieved boredom aside.Yes there were some pretty camera angles. Yes there were one or two clever lines of dialogue. But the impression I came away with was I'm sorry to say that the director put his selfindulgence firmly above the audience's entertainment. The music was noticeably repetitive the soundeffects intrusive beyond the point of distraction and the dialogue invariably too quiet.I suppose I must be missing something given the absurdly high IMHO position of this film in the top 250. I really can't imagine what that might be!".

It's indescribably beautiful one of the most gorgeous Westerns ever photographed indeed a model for good visual directing and cinematography in any genre. That alone makes the almost three hours a pure pleasure.But it's not a fast movie in any other way. It can't be. It depends on lingering over delicious details small ones shot up close in startling detail and ever deadpan looks and steely eyes. Nothing is believable and it's not meant to be. It's not even a fable quite but more a celebration of being inside an incredible film as strange as that sounds. Not that the scenes are not believableeven the very last shots of the makeshift town and the railroad being built is about as realistic as it gets. Great stuff.Plot? You might at times wonder where the plot went. There are lots of bad guys and you're not totally sure there's a protagonist unless the one woman in the movie is the center of our concerns even if she is clearly a bystander to it all. When it gets clear in the last twenty minutes it's again archetypal and has echoes of the over the tops showdown in Good Bad and Ugly. A small bit of slow motion not needed normally in a movie where everything is slow already makes clear this is the key moment in the film the thing that made the rest of it with all its confusing and violent layers sensible.For my money I'd love all this incredible visceral stuff the sounds and sights filled in with some kind of deeply felt conflict not a purely dramatic one. I watch and am shocked or swept away or impressed or dazzled but I'm actually never moved not from the heart. And there are plenty of aspects here that should really move usincluding feeling for the woman's plight rather than simply recognizing that it is after all quite a plight.Still another landmark Sergio Leone movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was a unique western one in which sometimes the action moves excruciatingly slow which can either be fascinating or boring. Unfortunately for me after spending big bucks for the DVD when it first came out I found it more boring than fascinating. In my previous viewings I always found it fascinating. Maybe I just had a bad day.The movie is filled with gaps of silence while closeups of the main characters' faces are shown. That's director Sergio Leone's trademark and I believe he does it more in this film than in any of his others. When you get closeups of chiseled faces like Henry Fonda's or Charles Bronson's it quite interesting but most of the movie feels like slow motion. At 165 minutes this movie takes a lot of patience. By the way the closeups of Claudia Cardinale's face were with a soft lens so the wrinkles didn't show. That's so typical of older films with the vain female stars. Cardinale looks cheap anyway with all that 1960stype eye makeup.At any rate the action scenes are a decent and not bloody and the characters are quite real meaning believable. I liked Fonda in here best even though I am not particularly a fan of his but his againsttype villain role of Frank was excellent. I read where he said this was his favorite role. I'm glad to hear that. The best character in the film though was Cheyenne played by Jason Robards.The opening credits  spaced out over 11 minutes which was rare in classic movie days  are considered by many as the most famous ever in any genre. The music in this film is different too. It's not as memorable as the score from The Good The Bad And The Ugly however done by the same composer but it has its moments. Early in the film we see some shots of Monument Valley which are the prettiest I've ever seen. I wish there had been more of that.Overall this is a western in which patience is rewarded I suppose. It certainly looks beautiful on DVD and the sound has been enhanced as well. Note when this came out on disc the rating of the film changed from PG to PG13.".

Frank Lovejoy is also fine as a detective.I can't say much for the title tune Julie heard only during the credits and then quickly forgotten by me. To my surprise it was nominated for a Best Song Oscarso what do I know??If you're a Doris Day fan you'll find this suspenseful even though it takes itself much too seriously. There's not a hint of humor throughout the entire proceedings not a single moment of relief. It's all very very intense whereas some humor would have helped. Of course there are always those who will laugh at the plot itself. It is after all a bit unbelievable by the time stewardess Day takes over the controls. It's to her credit that she makes it look real.".

To my surprise it was nominated for a Best Song Oscarso what do I know??If you're a Doris Day fan you'll find this suspenseful even though it takes itself much too seriously. There's not a hint of humor throughout the entire proceedings not a single moment of relief. It's all very very intense whereas some humor would have helped. Of course there are always those who will laugh at the plot itself. It is after all a bit unbelievable by the time stewardess Day takes over the controls. It's to her credit that she makes it look real.";

	schema:reviewBody "In 1956 Doris Day was cast in Julie between two of her best pieces of work the highly dramatic Alfred Hitchcock thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much and her best musical The Pajama Game. Usually those two films are either or both listed on Doris Day's top ten. Julie never is.There was nothing new by 1956 in leading ladies marrying psychopaths Ingrid Bergman had done it twice already in Rage In Heaven and in Gaslight. But both of those films were intelligently done while Julie goes into the hysterically melodramatic.Doris is cast in the title role in Julie as a woman with an obsessively jealous second husband in Louis Jourdan. Louis married Doris after her first husband committed suicide and about all there is to recommend him is that he's a great concert pianist. But after another pathological outbreak Day seeks some solace with an old friend in Barry Sullivan. And she's determined to leave Jourdan and give him the slip.But Jourdan is one grimly determined psychotic. When she returns to her old job as an airline stewardess Jourdan stalks her and ends up on her first airline job. After that things get real interesting over 15000 feet. Julie actually won two Academy Award nominations the first for original screenplay. Impossible for me to believe but as Casey Stengel used to say in baseball you can look it up.The second Oscar nomination was for Best Original Song. That year Doris came out a winner of sorts because while the title song Julie didn't win Doris came home a winner with Que Sera Sera a much better song from a much better film.The over the top melodramatics throughout the film made what could have been a spine tingling climax into something quite camp and quite laughable. I won't reveal what the midair climax is but just to say that it could have worked under different circumstances.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most comedy movies could only hope to be this amusing. An airy drippy title song plays setting up the audience for some sort of romantic drama. No such luck. Immediately and hilariously at odds with the opening music Day comes running on desperately trying to avoid her husband Jourdon who has apparently made a scene over her attention to another man. She hops in her car and he joins her. Even though the road is almost perfectly straight Day spins the hell out of her steering wheel furiously wielding it back and forth on a straight road! This overwrought and overheated beginning is merely a prelude for the wildly illogical and melodramatic story that follows. Jourdon turns out to be a crazed obsessive danger to Day and the film involves her repeated attempts to get away from him before he kills her. Ms. Day is a delightful screen presence and is certainly capable in the right hands of delivering a terrific dramatic performance i.e.Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much. Here however she is up against a heinous script astonishingly nominated for an Oscar! and contrived silly situations which make her look foolish. Worst of all is her hysterically funny series of dramatic voiceovers. The production feels the need to have her breathlessly describe all her feelings and state what is clearly happening on screen! The wording is often fall down funny and her despairing delivery paired with the stark visuals pair up to create several moments of screaming laughter. One scene has her desperately trying to get away from Jourdon but she still manages to pack her favorite outfits and even seemingly make sure she selects the right purse to go with her shoes. Another has her running from him in a snug skirt until she falls on a big rock and lays there. The whole movie is filmed with a crisp clinical detachment since this was a bold new subject and all the happenings were so bleak and gripping. This makes for some really dry viewing today especially when the inept police do their thing and during the climax when realistic but uninteresting air traffic controllers communicate with Day. Day a stewardess gets a breather midway through to scramble some eggs and sashay around in a kicky one piece lounge suit and act as if nothing is wrong with her life! In this section the demure twicemarried character even refuses to come out and meet a gentleman her makeshift roomie is dating because she's not dressed even though her fulllength nightgown comes down to her knuckles and almost reaches her ears! Yes... women just didn't DO that but it's still amusing! Stay tuned for the really kooky climax in which she and one other stewardess work a flight in which Day doesn't even realize that Jourdon in ON board! Like a person wouldn't immediately pick out someone who they know is out to kill them! Situations eventually warrant that Day has to fly and land the plane herself Karen Black fans will be disappointed to learn that she wasn't the first woman in this predicament. Crosseyed Black did it in Airport 1975 but Day beat her by 19 years....and she flies a significant portion of the trip with her eyes CLOSED!! Notably with regards to sexism little had changed in those two decades for the men call Day honey the whole time while in Black's case they continuously called her honey and baby... So many other ripe moments have been left out but in any case the film is a scream. Jourdon is indeed surprisingly menacing and Day tries very hard and found the filming very difficult in real life. Also fun is a glimpse at how dressy and glamorous airports used to be and how much air travel has changed. Don't miss the amateur actress playing an apartment resident who when asked about Day's character pronounces Julie as Julah.".

This seems like the original model for the sarcastic Airplane with a woman landing the plane in an emergency. I came to IMDb because I saw the name Martin Melcher on the credits and wondered if this was when she met her husband. It was interesting to hear that they were already married by this time.".

Move over Darling with James Garner and other such nonsense were so much beneath her.

It's a onenote plot that requires a onenote performance from Day.The premise is that of a relentlessly humorless womanindanger necessitating one plot contrivance after another to keep up the 99minute momentum. In fact the Stones Andrew  Virginia specialized in movie nailbiters their best being The Steel Trap 1952. Here however the premise is carried to such tiresome lengths that the desired tension is undermined by sheer repetition. In short any little thing that can go wrong for Julie does go wrong as she tries to escape her psychotic and apparently ESPgifted husband Jourdan. There's no character development and few conversational interludes just one relentless pursuit contrivance after another.Despite this key defect the movie does have its moments. That seaside cottage setup early on is very well constructed and a real nailbiter. The sneaky passenger cabin maneuvering is also well done with some tense moments. Plus the Stones' penchant for alllocation filming provides a good glimpse of street scenes circa 1956. Nonetheless I wish someone had said something to the Stones about the backfire dangers that piling it on can cause even when the plot idea is a good one. Anyway Day is stuck in a dour role that any number of lesser actresses could have easily handled. No wonder she quickly turned to Technicolor fluff for the remainder of her memorable career.".

	schema:reviewBody "It wasn't long after this film was released that my father pulled into our driveway with a car I thought I recognized.  It was a 1956 Chrysler Windsor Deluxe convertible twotone blue and white with KelseyHayes wire wheels.  It didn't take long for me to realize that it was the same car Doris Day drove with Louis Jourdan menacing her in the opening sequence of Julie.  She would have been off the road and into the ocean had she actually steered the car as she appeared to be doing in the closeups.  It had extremely sensitive power steering and Doris is seen jerking the steering wheel violently as Louis causes the car to accelerate dangerously. No way!!  It was an exciting way to open the film but no driver with a villain attempting his dastardly deed would have had the control to keep the car on the pavement of the 17Mile Drive near Carmel where the exterior scenes were shot.The same car is briefly seen being driven much more conservatively by Martha Hyer in Mister Cory U.I. 1957 starring Tony Curtis.  Ted Turner's flirtation with colorizing blackandwhite movies some years ago resulted in my watching Julie on TV and seeing that beautiful car colorized to a rather ugly pale yellow and ivory. Never available in that year's models by the way.  We kept that Chrysler for several years and it was extraordinarily reliable which is rather surprising since movie companies have been notorious for abusing the cars used in their productions.  A friend of mine in Southern California who had several collectible Thunderbirds was frequently approached to loan his cars to the studios but he always very prudently refused to allow his treasures to make an appearance on the big  or small screen.  Wouldn't mind still owning that Chrysler today.  It was a pleasure to drive not to mention that it would be worth far more than we got for it when we traded it in.".

I must agree with earlier comments describing the opening scene  very distracting rear projection.  Plus she didn't pick up any negative vibes from Louis Jordan's character BEFORE she married him?  The film starts with little backstory.Quite a bit of great location filming adding further realism to the black  white photography.  The leads are all convincing in their roles.Recommended viewing if only to help forget the bloated boring excess of Billy Rose's Jumbo a few years later.  I wish Day had played more serious dramatic roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the blurb on the box or the website where I ordered it from I was mostly expecting KAMIKAZE TAXI to be little more than a festival of violent revenge  and I suppose the name of the film helped with that impression too. First indicator that there might be a little more than that was that it's from the director of BOUNCE KO GALS Masato Harada and the second was that it's nearly 3 hours long. The fact I now know that Kamikaze means something like Wind Of God perhaps shows that the film is a little more than a bloodfest. In fact it's a lot more a film that spans genres and moods and philosophies and all sorts of things  quite a rare meandering beast that calls to mind Shunji Iwai's SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY in its scope and capacity for surprise. I was also reminded at various points of Takeshi Kitano's SONATINE Takashi Miike's DEAD OR ALIVE 2 Shohei Imamura's UNAGI and Shinji Aoyama's EUREKA... tribute to the diversity and depth of the film or perhaps the presence of actor Koji Yakushu for the latter 2 references p.The film begins in a pseudodocumentary style commenting on the presence in Japan of people of Japanese descent but with foreign upbringing and how they are not looked upon as true Japanese by many of those that presumably view themselves thus. It also makes references to Japan's less than noble involvement in World War II and the fact that many in Japan are still in denial about it  including some of the politicians. It notes that these Japanese immigrants politicians with a knack for denial and the numerous Yakuza in the country might not all cross each other's paths that often but that this particular film revolves around a situation where they do.Trying to explain the plot is probably counterproductive but it has a bit of take the money run and when the running doesn't work out too well it has a bit of kamikaze revenge mission  but it's definitely not that straightforward. How many other films with those genrestaple premises would stop after some scenes and film interviews with the sidecharacters that took place in them documentary style? note that it's interviews with the characters not the cast. The film makes a very strong effort to develop and explore its characters even having them spend 20 minutes or so doing selfawareness exercises in a spa.Like Shunji Iwai's SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY I picked up the film not expecting much of anything and was quite astounded by how much I actually got from watching it. I'm therefore somewhat reluctant to sing its praises too highly in case other people pick it up on my recommendation then don't enjoy it for expecting too much. I'm sure not everyone is going to like it  it'sa very quirky contemplative film whose chief virtue in my eyes is never being predictable in 169 minutes. It's very Japanese and deals with many issues of Japanese culture that might not mean anything to people who aren't aware of them  so it's not one I'd pick to introduce anybody to Japanese cinema. But if you've seen and loved SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY and at least 2 or 3 of the other films I mention above you should definitely be planning to pick KAMIKAZE TAXI up soon.".

The spiritual yearning of this musician contrasts sharply with the ugly violence and betrayal of those near to him in the beautiful forest.The film is in Japanese and obviously delivers its message to Japanese society. Keep this in mind when considering the tragedy humour corruption naivety idealism contradictions and poetic style that this film portrays so well. What does this say about the Japanese character? Is it true also for those of us who are not Japanese? Gather your friends and discuss such questions over cups of capuccino or glasses of brandy.

Is it true also for those of us who are not Japanese? Gather your friends and discuss such questions over cups of capuccino or glasses of brandy. There is more to this film than first meets the eye.";

Richard Gere and in fact all the cast were at their best and delivered a great script with all the tension and dynamics it needed. Gere and Molina worked very well together and I'd say it was probably Molina's best performance to date. Beautifully shot and cut it was pacy but not too pacy like many current films. I liked the few library shots to help with creating a feeling for the period and of course the music helped with that too. The story was told well although if you weren't quite familiar with the outline of what happened there could be some moments of doubt.

	schema:reviewBody "The Hoax is a rollicking good time at the movies. It's a strongly written competently directed and well acted character study of a pathological liar Clifford Irving. This amazing true story details the complex hoax staged by Irving a man who in the 1970's fooled a major publisher and LIFE magazine into thinking he was writing an authorized biography of Howard Hughes. Most of the fun emerges from the extreme lengths Irving Richard Gere and his best friend and partner Alfred Molina go to pull off the hairbrained scheme. The more outrageous the lies they concoct the more believable they become and the more money gets thrown at them.Richard Gere has never been that good of an actor but he's always had an arrogant charm that makes him oddly likable and he uses that to its full extent in what is probably his most mature performance here as Clifford Irving a arrogantly likable and charming liar. He's surrounded by a fantastic supporting cast in Alfred Molina as his sympathetic and often comical sidekick Marcia Gay Harden donning blonde hair and a European accent as his longsuffering but eager to con wife and Hope Davis playing his publishing industry connection. Davis probably gets the best line in the film when she says to a coworker who unwittingly foils a staged facetoface meeting with Hughes Pray that you drop dead. The film starts slowly and plays things for winks and laughs and light drama. It gets slightly bogged down in the final act as the hoax crumbles under its own preposterous weight and some scenes get heavy on the melodrama. There's also some wishywashy conspiracy theories floating around about the Nixon administration and Howard Hughes that maybe somewhat true but might be another figment of Irving's fanciful imagination as this is based on his memoirs of the events.These few flaws however don't sink the ship as the playful cast and surehanded direction from Lasse Hallstrom in what his probably his best work since Cider House Rules keep the hoax firmly afloat. What the film ultimately excels in is the connections it makes with Irving's pathological personality that ultimately leads to severe paranoia and delusions of grandeur the paranoia of the Nixon administration that mirrors nicely the modern Bush administration and the alleged overthetop eccentricities of the infamous Howard Hughes. In his mind Irving intertwines himself with these two powerful and tragic men. The film highlights how Irving saw himself and Hughes as smoothtalking larcenous megalomaniacs and truly believed he was going to be a major player in world history with the take down of Nixon even though he never had direct contact with either man and based his story on gossip hearsay and innuendos. It's really not much of a stretch to imagine Hughes bribing Nixon and wielding power like the wizard behind the curtain in Oz and it makes for a well told tale. Whether we believe the story ultimately lies in how much power we allow each of these men to have. In his image Irving thought Hughes held power over everyone and for Irving his tiny part in all that was the greatest story of all.".

	schema:reviewBody "While fighting to enter in the theater where the press screening of the Roma Film Festival took place I hadn't great expectations for this film. The trailer looked so bad. More I have never been much confident in Richard Gere's acting talents but I must admit in this film he proved me wrong. Appearing in almost every scene not handsome as ever he changed his hairline and his nose to look more like to the real Irving Gere gives at last a good performance. I discovered he's also pretty good doing impressions  he does a great Howard Hughes whose photos are constantly shown in the film and who by the way doesn't at all look like Di Caprio. Alfred Molina is also very good  hilariously funny he's the best part in the movie. As for the supporting cast there are pleasant cameos by Stanley Tucci and Eli Wallach. As for Richard Gere I wasn't much confident in Lasse Hallstrm too  I found most of his films rather sappy. He did a good job in the Hoax though. The film has a nice 70s look with appropriate cinematography and a nice soundtrack as well. The one thing that didn't thoroughly convince me was the script it started pretty well but past the middle of the film it kinda loses its way and becomes more confused and repetitive. Still a nice film. Gere fans I'm sorry you will have to wait since the opening in USA has been postponed to April but the wait will be worth it. My rating is 710.".

In terms of the story I learned a lot about it that I didn't know that amazed and impressed me mostly involving the influence the scheme inadvertently had politically.Richard Gere plays Clifford Irving well enough but the entire time I kept thinking of different actors who would've been much more becoming and much more intense. Clifford Irving was a man of dark magnetic manipulative vigor and depth. Gere plays him more dryly as though Irving was virtually cool and carefree rather than coolly masking that intensity.Alfred Molina a scenestealer as always upstages Gere greatly as his nervous friend and partner in crime who is made to do all the highrisk dirty work which translates into hilarity on screen.The Hoax is a wonderful story and a good movie.

The historical details are a bit inaccurate in some areas but those are relatively minor ones which don't affect the story too much. At it's core the film focuses on the lies told by Clifford Irving and how he charmed everyone into believing them. The lies don't just affect his writing career but also the lives of those around him and eventually comes to the point where it's difficult to distinguish fact from fiction in what Irving says a task which is made all the more difficult given the eccentricity of nearly everything done by Howard Hughes during that period of time. Overall the film isn't too bad the main characters are nicely developed the plot is interesting and the acting isn't bad. The subtle 1970s touches vintage Coca Cola and Tab cans news footage hairstyles commercials cars Watergate etc also make it fun to watch. Overall the story acting and the attention to detail force me to give this a 810 despite the few flaws here and there. Definitely a must see for the Howard Hughes buffs along with The Aviator.".

This device used in a recent Oscar winner where it symbolized paranoia works much better here as it helps us understand the obsession behind the ploy.Gere has for many years played second fiddle to other more established stars making them look much better than they really were and it has been a disservice to this very talented actor. In past years he has brought fame or revived the careers of many famous Hollywood leading ladies. Sadly we have neglected to recognize his true value. In Hoax he is the centerpiece and should his acting ever falter the entire illusion would crumble as well. Fortunately for us he is brilliant at every move being so good that he brings to life the object of his obsession as well. There are passages here than feel more real than anything portrayed in The Aviator even though we see mostly stills and a couple of brief videos of Hughes himself.Gere once works magnificently with the rest of his supporting players from Hope Davis to Alfred Molina and giving his scenes with Tucci and Gay Harden more gravitas than one would expect from their very short screen time. The Hoax succeeds in his depiction of the travesty that involved the production of a fake book a deal that fooled its most immediate audience and the nation.Hopefully Gere will receive his due escaping from the kiss of death for those who just happen to be consistently good there will be another stellar performance along the way.

	schema:reviewBody "The received wisdom is that if you lie you must stick as closely to the truth as practical in order to make the lie believable. That basically is what Clifford Irving did with his fabricated autobiography of Howard Hughes the secretive and eccentric billionaire. The problem is that everyone is already familiar with that dictum. If a man spends an evening with another woman he's not likely to tell his wife that he was busy giving a speech at the Junior Chamber of Commerce. The alternative to the received wisdom is The Big Lie the lie so huge so outrageous that others believe it because no one but a madman would make it up. That's what Hitler accused the Jews of doing and Goebbels the English. Or in the anonymous words of the Wikipedia essayist The Big Lie is a propaganda technique. It was defined by Adolf Hitler in his 1925 autobiography Mein Kampf as a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.If Irving and his coconspirators built a nearreplicant of Hughes' real life they surrounded it with fantasies so rich that nobody could possibly doubt them. Would a fraud claim that Hughes was about to land his helicopter atop a New York building for a meeting with McGrawHill  on the condition that the top two floors of the building be cleared the floors scrubbed and waxed and black nondustcollecting material be draped across all the windows? It must be common knowledge by now that Irving did a great deal of research on Howard Hughes  right down to imitating his voice on tape in order to get Hughes' grammatical errors and idiosyncratic expressions just right  and tried to sell the result to McGrawHill for five million dollars or more. The hoax was exposed when a reluctant Hughes finally agreed to a public conference call in which he denied the whole business. Irving spent some time in the slams but nobody was very badly hurt.The movie is based on Clifford Irving's book The Hoax. In other words a quarter of a century later Irving is still making money off his little adventure. Following Irving the movie tells us that it all started off as a prank a big joke that gradually got bigger. Poor Irving. He became a neural shambles trying to keep the enterprise together what with betrayals by friends threats from outside sources traps set for him by Hughes and the President of the United States himself the increased stress on his marriage.According to this fable the wretched Irving is almost driven mad by his responsibility  to others that is. He never thinks of himself. He worries about his family. He worries about his friend's marriage. He receives a mysterious package full of secret data about Hughes including a damning connection between Hughes and Nixon that could bring down Nixon's administration. Thereafter Irving devotes himself to what he now sees as the pursuit of truth and justice. That is he owes it to the American public that his fraudulent book be published because it may contain nuggets of truth.Does anyone believe this unspeakable crap anymore? Irving was a smoothtalking ambitious con man and self promoter who had a toothsome blond girl friend who soaked up the publicity during appearances on TV talk shows and who eagerly anticipated the millions of dollars that were to be bilked from a respectable publisher a rich but private citizen and the millions of ordinary readers who would have bought his fake book. He was undeterred by his exposure as a fraud. In later interviews he would immediately switch the topic of conversation to the tribulations that he and his family had been put through especially his poor little kiddies with tears in their eyes while daddy was in jail. And he's STILL at it with his book now having been made into a movie starring Richard Gere.The screenplay treats the story with the shabbiness it deserves. Handheld cameras wobble during scenes of activity. Impossible fantasies of Irving being kidnapped at night beaten senseless and thrown out of hotel windows by agents of Howard Hughes prompt our sympathy. It never happened and the movie tries to explain it as a drunken fantasy so convincing that Irving believed it had happened. I ask you the honest reader the experienced drunk  when is the last time you were so bombed that you woke up the next morning thinking you'd really been spirited away to Nassau beaten by Howard Hughes thrown into a pool then flown back home? Actually one of Hughes' agents shows up from time to time as a hallucinated figure with which Irving has extensive and informative exchanges. The hallucination isn't entirely without sympathy for Irving but generally practical and suitably distant. I got a little tired of these realistic hallucinations during A Brilliant Mind. I didn't mind them too much when Willie Loman talked with them because back in the late 1940s they had a touch of originality. Here they're just cheap expository tricks.The whole movie is like that  cheap and self serving. The Big Joke conflated with The Big Lie. It stinks.".

He was undeterred by his exposure as a fraud. In later interviews he would immediately switch the topic of conversation to the tribulations that he and his family had been put through especially his poor little kiddies with tears in their eyes while daddy was in jail. And he's STILL at it with his book now having been made into a movie starring Richard Gere.The screenplay treats the story with the shabbiness it deserves. Handheld cameras wobble during scenes of activity. Impossible fantasies of Irving being kidnapped at night beaten senseless and thrown out of hotel windows by agents of Howard Hughes prompt our sympathy. It never happened and the movie tries to explain it as a drunken fantasy so convincing that Irving believed it had happened. I ask you the honest reader the experienced drunk  when is the last time you were so bombed that you woke up the next morning thinking you'd really been spirited away to Nassau beaten by Howard Hughes thrown into a pool then flown back home? Actually one of Hughes' agents shows up from time to time as a hallucinated figure with which Irving has extensive and informative exchanges. The hallucination isn't entirely without sympathy for Irving but generally practical and suitably distant. I got a little tired of these realistic hallucinations during A Brilliant Mind. I didn't mind them too much when Willie Loman talked with them because back in the late 1940s they had a touch of originality. Here they're just cheap expository tricks.The whole movie is like that  cheap and self serving. The Big Joke conflated with The Big Lie. It stinks.";

	schema:headline " a film about trickery done in a tricky style that works with crackling performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Lasse Halstrom isn't out as a filmmaking to make really extreme and probing insights into what goes into a pranksterforger like Clifford Irving. Maybe it's because he like I saw Orson Welles's film F For Fake which covered similar ground and has the only substantial footage of Clifford Irving on record and in full bloom with his BS meter going skyhigh. That film overall dug very deep into what is to have forgery a hoax as part of personality. Halstrom doesn't quite get that but nevertheless he's made an entertaining minisaga of a man or rather men in this case who went to the edge of credibility and almost got away with the whole shebang. His story as covered as well in part in F for Fake is about Irving's incredibly smart and incredibly stupid attempt at passing off as his own the autobiography of Howard Hughes then the notoriously reclusive and nutty billionaire with his fingers in enterprises all over the world. He passes off Hughes's handwriting to the publishers and lawyers as his even as it's really Irving who wrote it all and even went so far as to have mock audio recordings of Irving AS Hughes to get down in the book via assistant Dick Suskind. As the walls seem to be closing in on their scam as well as Irving's marriage it goes as far as mass printings of the book Irving presents until the 'real' Hughes makes a press conference call call of course to disprove the book altogether as a hoax.Halstrom surprisingly makes his film light and dark in tone depending on what stage the story is in and it's even fun at times to see Irving and Suskind go about their risktaking maneuvers to get all documents and information they can on Hughes as if it's guerrilla research. Then as the despair of constant lying increases and the threat of capture and revelation is nearer Halstrom makes it more like a paranoid thriller. This latter part may actually be not quite as convincing so to speak of course as one can't be sure entirely what's true or not in The Hoax because simply one might not see Irving so much as a crazy person ala Hughes so much as a kind of strange artistcumprofessional at what he does to make himself believe the BS before he even feeds it to others. Scenes like Irving getting caught by Hughes's secret agents in the middle of the night are not as striking as Halstrom might have intended even as all the while the performances are still good. And the realm of placing the story in context of the times is hit or miss it works to be sure when going into the Nixon administration sections because it's crucial to the story and according to some articles on the film is possibly really accurate though putting in the footage of Vietnam and protesters and so forth are sort of padding to environment and period. The music costumes locations i.e. Las Vegas and simple political ramifications make it enough.This being said The Hoax provides the audience with some very effective performances. Gere under the right director can be terrific and this is one of his best performances in years as he balances out Irving's higher aspirations of wealth and notoriety with his latter plunge into confusing his own personality with that of Hughes with suspicions of everything or anyone around him. The filmmakers wisely don't make Irving very sympathetic and Gere plays this for all it's worth with moments of charm tension and delusions of grandeur played out wonderfully. However if Gere is good Alfred Molina is better as Suskind Irving's collaborator and the real behindthescenes guy who helps make Irving's fabrications all the more palatable like hiding documents out of the Pentagon or flying to another country to mail an envelope. Suskind unlike Irving ends up dealing with the hoax with more of a psychologicalmoral burden and it ends up weighing on his conscience like a brick. It might make Suskind the more conventional character in the movie but Molina makes him very real and more of the tragic case than Gere's Irving. Molina's track record at the least remains untarnished. Other supporting players like Marcia Hay Harden Julie Delpy Eli Wallach and Stanley Tucci are better than average here.The Hoax is a good treat in this month's lot of schlock and bigbudget trash by sticking close to making it an actor's movie and sort of a bittersweet take on what a hoax does in such a grand scale as that of Howard Hughes and what it does to a person the longer and more intense it goes on for.".

So it is very easy for me to attend his cinema hall.The story is base on the living character of Clifford Michael Irving Richard Gere who claimed to have written the authorized rights to write an autobiography of another American Legend Howard Hughes.

Richard plays this obsessive liar. He is brilliantly accompanied by Alfred Molina as his friend and Marcia Gay Harden  playing his second wife both have acted brilliantly.The Director Lasse Hallstrom famously known for his recent award winning hit Chocolate has done a good job.

	schema:headline " Very Absorbing Underrated Film About the Power of Desperation in EntertainmentMedia";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who has tried and failed to make it in the ArtsEntertainmentMedia world can relate to this story. There are far more struggling writers actors musicians and filmmakers than the very small percentage who achieve a break gain recognition and attain careers. So many artists and writers living in New York and Los Angeles are constantly competing to find that elusive way into what often seems like an exclusive club which in a way it is. This film is about one writer's creative means of getting into that elite club.Clifford Irving was a struggling writer in the late 1960's and early 1970's looking for that breakout novel that would put him on the literary map. According to the film he was on the verge of having his new novel published by McGrawHill when an editor at Life Magazine read the prepublication proofs and denounced it as not up to quality. McGrawHill ultimately rejected the book. There's even an implication that he was already spending the royalty advance money he had yet to receive.Now with bills piling up Irving has to find a way to make a living at writing. He comes up with one of the most amazing ideas to write the autobiography of millionaire magnate and eccentric Howard Hughes even though he had never met Hughes. Irving's choice of Hughes is not just picked from a hat. Late in Hughes' life he had become the richest recluse in America. Few had even seen him outside his very close trusted advisers and associates. Irving's reasoning though flawed had an interesting logic by some accounts Hughes was teetering on the edge of sanity and therefore might not object to the publication of such a book. He had been mentally unstable for many years suffering from obsessivecompulsive disorder. One account claims that whenever he ate peas he had to arrange them in order of size on his plate. Irving realizes he needs help and solicits another struggling writer Richard Suskind Alfred Molina who played Bishop Aringarosa in the Da Vinci Code to gather the needed information and to write the manuscript. The first part of the story is how the two of them gather information about Hughes sometimes using means that border on being unethical which are some of the best moments of the film. At one point Irving sort of becomes Hughes and dictates what will be in the book into a tape machine which Suskind later transcribes.The other part of the movie is Irving's dealings with the publishers. I thought one of the most telling moments of the film is the scene in which Irving proposes the project to the publishers at McGrawHill. The executives just about fall over themselves when they find out that Hughes wants to publish his autobiography through them which is a very telltale aspect of the entire ArtsMedia industry. While publishers are not always as interested in lesserknown writers' projects there is the other side of the coin projects regarded as surefire bestsellers. Publishers will bend over backwards to acquire those projects and the IrivingHughes book appears to them as one of these. Irving like a true con artist bluffs his hand for all its worth making crazy demands but making it sound like it's coming from Hughes. A very compelling story from beginningtoend in part because of the believable performances by Richard Gere Alfred Molina and Marcia Gay Harden as Irving's wife. She also played Pollock's wife in Pollock. At any given moment I had no idea what would happen next but I did find myself routing for Irving. According to statements by the real Clifford Irving not all of the film is accurate. Be that as it may the film as it stands offers an interesting glimpse into the world of media and dealmaking not something publishers and media conglomerates want the public to see necessarily. If there's anything I know about this world it is a helluva lot messier than most people realize.".

Here was a weird man that was afraid of coming in close contact with humans who wanted open himself for all to pass judgment at him something that didn't make any sense. There were a lot of clues to be considered by all those naive but greedy literary figures.

He was basically a con man who pulled the wool over everyone's eyes. His life was a mess. He had cheated on his artist wife Edith for years. With the help of his assistant the researcher Dick Suskind he pulled one of the biggest scams in literary America by pretending he knew Hughes and that the man had entrusted him to tell his side of the story.Lasse Hallstrom the director showed he had a good understanding for the material. He does a great job in the way he staged the film. This is one of his best efforts in the American cinema. The screenplay by William Wheeler is based on The Hoax by Clifford Irving. The book was a confession of the author chronicling his scheme to con the literary circles that thought he was a man without talent but who jumped in the band wagon because he saw the word bestseller all over the place. Our surprise in watching the film was Richard Gere's take on the title character. This actor does much better when he plays against the romantic personal Hollywood created for him. With his curly hair Mr. Gere does a great Clifford Irving. Also good is Alfred Molina playing the assistant to the author. Mr. Molina is fine as the man that knows he is committing a serious fraud but goes along with the con artist that employed him. One thing for sure Suskind was a bad liar something that comes across in the film.The supporting cast include people of the caliber of Hope Davis and Marcia Gay Harden two of the best actresses any director would be lucky to get to be in their films. Eli Wallach shows up as Noah Dietrich who worked for Hughes. Stanley Tucci Zeljko Ivanek and the rest of the cast are fine.Oliver Stapleton captures the images of that era well.

	schema:headline " Good movie but ultimately crap";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the movie I thought it was pretty good so I looked it up to see how true to the real story it was. It turns out there are a lot of facts that are close enough but the whole essence of the story is completely wrong.In the movie they turn the story into a morality tale where the main character is cracking under the weight of lies he is telling to sell the fake biography and how he is destroying his life marriage and friendship with lies.The reality is Irving was a con man with a sociopathic personality who drew a sense of power from his lies and scams. A person of this nature can usually con old ladies out of their retirement savings and make jokes about it after wards. So he wouldn't have been fraught with guilt and remorse and he wouldn't have been tormented by a nonexistent conscience. He would have been riding high along an intense rollercoaster ride until the jig was up.I would have liked to have seen a movie about the real thing.Sure it would have been tougher to make it relevant to the average person. But if you look at shows like The Sopranos and Dexter which have likable yet repulsive characters who are in a lot of ways uncomfortably similar to the average person it's certainly not impossible. The reality is most people do in fact lie and scam a lot more then they are willing to admit  even to themselves  and feel powerful doing so. The movie could have done something with that.The people who did this movie opted for the easy way out and ultimately manufactured a formula movie.

It turns out there are a lot of facts that are close enough but the whole essence of the story is completely wrong.In the movie they turn the story into a morality tale where the main character is cracking under the weight of lies he is telling to sell the fake biography and how he is destroying his life marriage and friendship with lies.The reality is Irving was a con man with a sociopathic personality who drew a sense of power from his lies and scams. A person of this nature can usually con old ladies out of their retirement savings and make jokes about it after wards. So he wouldn't have been fraught with guilt and remorse and he wouldn't have been tormented by a nonexistent conscience. He would have been riding high along an intense rollercoaster ride until the jig was up.I would have liked to have seen a movie about the real thing.Sure it would have been tougher to make it relevant to the average person.

It is painful to watch a liar in action ... even on film. It cuts to the core of what makes us human and our natural tendency to believe others. Combine that with another common human trait  greed  and the combination sets us up for real life con artists such as those seen in Catch Me If You Can and Shattered Glass.This film is based on writer Clifford Irving's implausible con of publishing giant McGrawHill as he presented his The Autobiography of Howard Hughes. His presentation was replete with high quality forged handwritten notes from the reclusive Hughes. Conspiracy theories abound as ties are made to President Nixon Watergate and judicial system. Also touched on is Hughes' personal secret service that was supposedly loyal and well paid to protect his privacy. The conference call that Hughes makes to shut down the project and expose Mr. Irving was Hughes' last known public appearance until his death.The film is very entertaining and at times funny. If you weren't aware of the mystery surrounding the enigmatic Hughes during this time period some of the power of the film will be lost. This is without a doubt Richard Gere's best film performance ever. It took much more than his usual posing and preening and mumbling ... this was a real acting job! Strong support work comes from Alfred Molina as Dick Susskind Irving's friend and coconspirator and a blonde Marcia Gay Harden as Irving's wife. Hope Davis Stanley Tucci Julie Delpy and the great Eli Wallach also have pivotal support roles. It is a pleasure to catch Stuart Margolin in a brief role. Have enjoyed his work since Rockford Files.Hallstom deserves some credit for getting the performance from Gere and creating enough suspense and drama for an entertaining two hours. Worth seeing as a reminder that there are some slick con men out there and they may actually be people you kind of like. Don't miss the soundtrack with work from the great and underappreciated Richie Havens.".

	schema:reviewBody "There can't be many films that occupy your mind for many days afterwards make you read the book they are based on and then watch them again.Innocence is one of those films and it is both beautiful and intriguing at the same time. It is based on a book by Frank Wedekind called MineHaha or the corporeal education of girls the only published fragment of his unfinished novel Hildalla. It was first published in 1901 and although beautifully written it has much darker undertones than the film with references to a body cult of youth and natural beauty which would later become exploited by Nazi culture.The film is very much a metaphor for a childhood world which is in many ways separate but also protected from that of adults. It plays in an isolated Girls School their children enter at the time when they start to make their own independent experiences of the world around them and ends with the onset of puberty and attainment of menarche both symbolising the emotional and physical end of childhood. The cinematography is beautiful and reminded me in many ways of Tarkovsky with its symbolism and haunting images. However the story can seem a little simplistic and linear times and often appears to demand more depth from the young child actors than they could possibly deliver.Nevertheless this is a very interesting and thoughtprovoking film and well worth watching. The French dialogue often has a musical quality and as long as you're prepared to watch this in a calm and unhurried state of mind this is very rewarding and unusual cinematic experience.".

She becomes infatuated with twelveyearold Bianca Berangare Haubruge who disappears each evening and returns in the morning. The girls spend most of their days studying ballet and preparing for an important exam.The school is like a keep. The girls are encouraged to find happiness in obedience. Parents never visit. The world beyond its tall hedges exists like something within a dream.Director Lucile Hadzihalilovic imbues every aspect of the film with a dreamy meditative veneer. Shots of the preteen nymphs dancing cartwheeling and splashing about in shallow water recall the grainy erotic imagery of David Hamilton's early feature films  in particular LAURA and BILITIS. The ballet sequences and striking compositions of solitary female figures in towering external landscapes owe a small debt to Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA and to a lesser extent his PHENOMENA. But this is not a deliberate softcore meditation on childhood sexuality. It is a metaphorical examination of how innocence is ruptured by its own curiosity.The camera angles stress the importance and prominence of legs to a fetishistic degree. This focus is an organic extension of the girls' ballet training a darker purpose for legs is indicated later in a chilling line of dialogue. Debie's cinematography emphasizes light and shade and is never pretty for its own sake.The forest filled with lamps has a deliciously surreal fairytale quality. The sequences where the girls dance for a faceless audience reminded me of one of MULHOLLAND DRIVE's most haunting sequences. The film's sound design also echoes the internal voids of the Lynchian world.The film is not big on explanations and is a touch too slow at times but it presents a thoroughly realized universe that is a stark metaphor for life's discoveries and disappointments. The performances possess perfect pitch and the tone remains both haunting and consistent.What exactly is the film about? The girls may be in a purgatory of sorts a resting place between life and death. Perhaps not. Perhaps they are in a holding pattern between childhood innocence and adulthood a state requiring some loss of innocence and when they manage to escape succumbing to their preadolescent curiosity they have forfeited their place in childhood forever.

	schema:headline " An impressive look trough the young kids lives and fears";
	schema:reviewBody "Before jumping into the story itself I have to say I was blown away by the imagery and sound of this movie. The scenarios are at the same time breathtakingly beautiful and deeply dark to a point of making you uncomfortable. The old rusty lamps that mark the ways trough the woods are an important detail in the creation of the dark ambiance. The soundtrack is in no way inferior and as others said strongly inspired by David Lynch work.All this translates into one of the main points of this movie which is showing on the big screen the contradictions of kids lives at that age. The girls are told to be happy and they spend a lot of time playing outside on the woods and the lake. On the other hand they are subject to a demanding education which is depicted in the movie as ballet lessons which is many times scary dull and somewhat pointless.One of the interesting lines of the story if the fact that the only purpose of being in the school seems to be getting out of there. There is no clear goal and girls seem to don't deeply understand why are they there Iris asks several times if and when can she leave and there's never a clear answer to her question. At a point one of the young girls asks an older one if the reason for one of the teachers having a physical problem on her legs is the result of punishment for trying to leave the school. I love this dialog because it shows two different characteristics of the young kids the uncertainty related to why they must be there and when will they be able to leave and the weird and somewhat surreal stories and fears the young minds are able to create.The movie also shows us that all this is scary enough to the point that some kids can't handle it. There are two very sad situations in the story. The first is when the lonely scared and violent girl shows us she's so afraid of the challenges she faces that she ends up getting out of the school the only way she can by drowning herself on the lake. I believe this tries to map the few kids we all knew in our schools that started being subject of bad influences having a violent behavior taking drugs and tearing their life apart to a point of no return.The second situation is the girl that fails to be chosen. First of all it's never really clear what it means to be chosen. What seems obvious is that whatever it means it's not something that is necessarily or entirely good. My interpretation is being chosen means going to a more demanding school. It may be good because more difficult challenges keep those kids interested but it may also backfire crushing the kids under extreme pressure from teachers and parents. Anyway this girl really wants to be the one and she even tries to have extra ballet classes so she can practice more than the others. When she faces the fact that other girl is chosen she collapses enters an weird depressed almost catatonic state and a few days later she runs away from school and she's never seen again. Maybe she went to look for a place where her talent is acknowledged or maybe she just snapped and tried to run away from the fact she's not the best student. We don't know but it's very easy to map this to some unfortunate and real situations where kids collapse under the pressure specially in demanding societies like Japan.Unlike other reviewers I don't find this movie to be inappropriate in what relates to the young girl's nudity. This being said there's one sexrelated scene that I believe it's the only one in the movie that is meant to be which is the glove one. One day before leaving the school Bianca finds a velvet? glove in the theater that comes from the adult world it belongs to an adult that left the glove behind on her seat. She keeps the glove and a few moments later we see her using it and feeling the glove's fabric on her legs. I believe this scene marks the end of the innocence and depicts Bianca starting to get curious about her own sexuality which is something that usually starts to happen at about her age. I love the metaphor of her hand not being the hand of a child any more but an adult one symbolized by the glove. I believe the glove sequence is a master piece by itself considering how beautifully and nongraphically the issue was handled and of course how tricky shooting a scene like this can be in a way that won't shock the audience.Also I think the last scenes are very strong and important. First it's deeply touching to see the contradictory feelings on the teacher's faces when saying goodbye to the girls for the last time. I remember this from my time as a kid when we ended the 4th grade and switched schools. Teachers are proud and happy to have helped the young girls be ready for the next stage of their lives and at the same time almost crying because they know that in a few months the girls have moved on and forgot about them forever. It's also important to see the new school that looks more like a modern office park with a lot of light the dark days are over happy boys and girls playing water fountains and no walls or limits. It's a new life for those girls. They moved on from their protected walled and seemingly pointless environment to the open real world where they'll be free to make their own decisions meet new friends including boys and go on with their lives.".

	schema:headline " The IMDb Summary Of An Offbeat Boarding School Doesn't Even Come Close To It";
	schema:reviewBody "Offbeat? This film is so far removed from offbeat that previous films described as offbeat are marching in military step unison. Innocence is a gorgeous composition of thought sound and beauty which is utterly compelling to watch but challenges the viewing audience to a hard fought internal battle raising questions within the viewer in a William Blakeish Songs Of Innocence Songs Of Experience manner.

His symbolic use of colours is highly key to the understanding of the events themes and emotions and aids the viewer immensely in being able to 'try' and I emphasis the word and dissect the layers of thought provoking connotations on the nature of innocence.It's not always the most comfortable film to be viewing as certain IMDb reviewers would hasten to claim it has pedophilic tendencies but I fear they're somewhat missing the point of the entire film yes it is often at times difficult to view but there is a purpose. William Blakes collection of poems on innocence and experience charts the replacing of the former with the latter.

These unsettling moments for us are only so because of the experience which we possess and have learnt throughout our existence to the girls they don't see the same sins pitfalls and traps we do to them they are merely acting on instinct as children do in an innocent cares of the worldfree way. Thus the film charts the fall of innocence from the elder girls at the hauntingly constructed boarding school and the continuing of the cycle through metamorphic symbolism the circle of young life. Although it does make me question the use of the word film. If I had but one criticism of the film for all its mesmerising viewing and original premise it comes across more as a case study in innocence rather than a fully fledged story. While undeniably engaging and engrossing it lacks a certain spark becoming more concerned with the ideas than the progression of any one story to the extent where the ideas will be ringing in your head for days afterwards but lacking a sense of resolution. Innocence would be an impressive debut solely on the basis of bravery alone for tackling such a notion and so effectively but the hallmarking of this 'case study' comes in the directors striking use of colours symbolism and cinematography which I personally believe to have been unsurpassed in the films I've seen of recent years. Although you have been warned the film is an intense experience which will not set well with everyone but given that you have now been warned so it's not as if you can claim you were innocent of that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was refreshingly original  if not in terms of theme then certainly in cinematography. The scenes are haunting mesmerising and evoke memories of one's own childhood little flashes and reminders of what being a child used to feel like. The film is about girlhood and loss of innocence and is told primarily from the perspective of the girls themselves. There is an air of mystery and magic in this film that represents how uncertain and mysterious life is for children. Some things in the film are explained most are not. However this is deliberate. The girls find things out by peering through cracks in the doors by listening to private conversations by listening to what the other girls tell them about what is true and what is not true. The scene where Iris stumbles upon two adults in a dark room with a syringe is not explained and nor are the rumours of severe punishment for breaking the rules proved false or true because these things are never clarified when we are children. Being a child is frustrating because so much is kept from you you catch snatches of whispered conversation and you discuss what you have heard with other children often coming up with some very unlikely theories which you believe because you are a child and still believe in fantasy. Making everything even more uncertain is that adults often lie to you to make you do what you need to do at your stage in life. Don't watch too much television or your eyes will go square! or in the film Obedience is the only route to happiness. This sense of mystery and uncertainty of being unsure of what is real and not real what to believe and what not to believe and of being endlessly curious about the unknown but equally too frightened to break these unexplained rules is something which 'Innocence' captures perfectly.While this film is certainly not flawless  the short skirts also made me feel a little uncomfortable even though I suspect the reason for them may have been to highlight the girls' ignorance of their own sexuality their innocence so to speak  however there are many aspects of this film which are great.".

At first I almost dismissed it as artsy pretentious French cinema due to the very slow pace and methodical direction but it had this eerie quality to it that kept my eyes glued to the screen anticipating what was yet to come. The story is told in a very abstract way and the story is never really laid out for you in a conventional manner. In truth it is a very simple tale but told in an imaginative way. There was great imagery and the use of sound to create a mysterious environment was very well done. At times it reminded me of the films of David Lynch especially Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. and Gaspar Noe Irreversible which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. The acting by the principals is very good considering that they consisted mainly of very young girls. The director managed to capture natural performances from all of them and having worked with children on films in the past I have to applaud her efforts on this end as I know how difficult it can be to get them to give you the results you're looking for. From a negative stance the film runs just a bit too long and the pacing could've been trimmed a little to make it run a bit faster and leaner. There were stretches where the film felt like it was never going to end. In the end I would definitely recommend this to those who appreciate arthouse cinema as this caters directly to them. This was an impressive debut for Ms. Hadzihalilovic and I am definitely curious to see what she comes up with next.RATING 12 out of .".

	schema:reviewBody "An excellent and magical film which is definitely not for everyone L'ecole can be experienced on at least two levels. First the entire film is a dreamlike allegory about girls venturing through childhood and into puberty. It is tinged with a sense of anxiety about the challenges and uncertainties of adulthood toward which all children journey. Also there is a sense of trepidation about being molded to the dictates of a society unconcerned with your personal gifts desires and aspirations. In tone and feeling it is like dreamvision poetry from the medieval age. If you're watching L'ecole and thinking Where is there a school like this? or It's bad that the new girls arrive in coffins. Or There should be parents in this movie then you are missing the point. This movie is an allegory as well as a conceit and it requires the symbolism of dreams to speak eloquently and to honestly explore its issues. With no doctrinaire adult character to set things right this movie is free to honestly portray childhood itself while it intentionally avoids preaching about what adults think childhood ought to be. Second L'ecole is a reverent rhapsody on life as it is experienced directly by the senses sight sound touch smell and taste. It explores the life of the body. In connection the cinematography is beautiful vibrant and sumptuous  with saturated colors and natural lighting. If you liked Picnic at Hanging Rock and The New World you will like L'ecole. If you strongly prefer Hollywoodstyle movies with their clear narrative story lines familiar content and tone stock characters and readily identifiable messages such as drugs can destroy your life if you abuse them you will be frustrated or perhaps angered by this film. I also suggest if you have a strong aversion to the sight of the human body you avoid this movie. Because L'ecole is about the senses and the life of the body it must acknowledge the fact that girls have bodies  that they are not just clothes spirit and thought. Nudity means being without any clothing and there is only one very brief nude scene in this movie in which a girl gets out of the bathtub and looks at herself in the mirror evaluating her arrival at puberty. If you sneeze you will miss the nudity so I'm not sure why some reviewers on the internet whine about constant nudity. Furthermore this nude scene is honest thoroughly wholesome and entirely ageappropriate. There's no doubt in my mind that every girl and boy who's ever taken baths in a room with a mirror has done this same selfappraisal at some point while growing up. There are also some swimming scenes involving seminude girls but these are pleasant and innocent. Since they are partially clothed the girls are not even skinnydipping in the true sense of the word as many children throughout the world actually do. Any viewer who was taught The body is the temple of the soul or who remembers skinnydipping as a kid or is familiar with the human body as a worthwhile subject in over 3000 years of GrecoJudeoChristian Art should be fine with the mere seminudity in this film. Regarding some reviewers accusing filmmaker Lucile Hadzihalilovic of making child pornography such accusations are irresponsible false and slanderous  most likely the result of sloppy thinking misinformation or hysteria. Nothing  and I mean nothing  sexually explicit occurs in this movie and all the behavior of the characters is ageappropriate. If you're looking for a special poignant film check this one out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is bound to go over your head and when I saw it in Toronto in 2004 there were indeed 5 people who walked out no doubt confused. Most people in the audience watched intently but treated it with little emotion. The movie was a little slowpaced presumably deliberately so. It was nonetheless a fascinating examination of the movie's title on several levels yours evolution education as well as a brief philosophical examination of life  death. You need a lot of sociopolitical experience in life to understand the movie. Spoiler follows Added comment April 2 2006 It's been 2 years since I saw it in the theatre and I rented it on DVD just now. They have edited one little scene to make the movie less risquuncomfortable so that the movie now can be seen as sticking completely to its symbolic theme best typified by the girls' butterfly dance routine juxtaposed with the study of evolution and butterflies. This theme basically of the selection of the best dancer of the girls by the lady who runs the school is part of a deliberately long scene where the girls are tastefully judged. Not quite like Olympic gymnastics but close enough.There are many other important and symbolic pieces of the movie but I take this one scene to be saying that despite their innocence to the processes of natural selection an external force is acting on them to nonetheless select them for their skills. In the theatre where they dance I believe the accidental falling as exaggerated as it is is symbolic of stronger selective forces of more primitive creatures e.g. butterflies.Not to argue with myself but while the dance and training takes place there is the feeling that there is no escaping this place and I leave it to other commentators to expand on the symbolism of that part of the movie.710".

Most people in the audience watched intently but treated it with little emotion. The movie was a little slowpaced presumably deliberately so. It was nonetheless a fascinating examination of the movie's title on several levels yours evolution education as well as a brief philosophical examination of life  death. You need a lot of sociopolitical experience in life to understand the movie. Spoiler follows Added comment April 2 2006 It's been 2 years since I saw it in the theatre and I rented it on DVD just now.

All the spoken narrative is pared together with the context and explanation. Everything you get you get through the eye.

In most of us it takes a while for these reasoning abilities to awake. Some of us are blessed with a shorter time some take longer.

Water plays a key role here. We open by flowing with not watching but in a powerful natural waterfall. We end with similar but womanmade fountain that carries us away. In between the place of the film is characterized by its lake. The senior girl who leaves every night into hormonal mystery walks into rain. There are glistening moist tunnels under the place that the younger girls can only wonder about by peering through an occluding grate. Learning to swim in the lake is conflated into learning to dance like a butterfly. All of this is heavy investment in image. Each time we touch water the cinematography is striking. But there is no coherence. A more mature filmmaker even an intuitive like Herzog would have worked on this the visual narrative coherence in the architecture of cinematic water.It was missing and it told me that the filmmaker wears an orange ribbon.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

There is a lot of skin and underwear showing in this story and one nude scene very brief so there should be a warning on the case Attention Prudes little girls have bodies get used to it.It may be hard for you to understand but obedience is the only path to happiness.

The girls want to understand but they don't waste time worrying about reasons. They enjoy swimming dancing playing. The ones who do obey get to leave eventually.The kids are portrayed realistically and the simple photography all natural light adds realism. There are birds singing in the forest and the music is like what you hear in a toddler's music box. The children's sweet voices are like music too adding to the tranquil atmosphere with slow soft quiet dialogs  nothing like MaryKate and Ashley.There is no complex plot important mystery to solve or development of characters. This is simply a story about the beauty of youth that exists no matter what the external circumstances are. Innocence is an achievement in many ways above all for getting past the censors but everything in the film really is innocent. I don't understand why this film makes some viewers feel uncomfortable. Maybe they worry that a few rare individuals might find the images erotically stimulating and go out and abuse some real child. But there is now evidence that even pure pornography actually reduces sex crimes.

Anyway soon after it was over I had the same feeling that overtook me during it's entirety which was uncertainty. It took almost one day for the meaning of it to permeate through my mind and help me discern what was being shown. I truly dismiss any claims pertaining to lewd or inappropriate images... whatever abstract version of reality was being amplified it drew me in perfectly. It was a very powerful allegory of modern life. Freedom is a myth that's commonplace. However we continue to live one day after the next as if there weren't strings controlling our movements. We play within our confines. Such is this movie... there are walls there is a hierarchy discipline is enforced. They arrive at a young age albeit in a coffin already deceased. And they dance... Perfection is not demanded of them the act is the goal. As the oldest girls move across the stage every night the shadows of the spectators loom in the background as demons foreseeing perverse omens... Very poignant. I guess people lose their innocence early on in life more and more prematurely in an exponential fashion especially in this western hyperactive hypersexual environment we have created. But I guess the damaged minds of the ones overseeing our children are the true monsters... no matter how secluded and whisked away the upbringing may take place there is no escape from the wretched mold children are shaped with... they dance and the genuine innocence in their actions is oblivious to what they are inexorably being groomed to become even if it is only suggested in the subtext of the film. As we view the chronology of their time in this alternative reality all becomes clear. However seeing purity in its quintessential form and then its slow death at the hands of those who are blind to its light can become quite unbearable. Anyway I recommend this film not that my recommendation means anything if for no other reason than to show us a mirror of the runningtowardsthemousetrap philosophy reigning over our world perpetuating our frustrations by psychotic projective identification murdering off the beauty of future generations as if it would erase our own erroneous undertakings throughout our insipid existence.".

	schema:reviewBody "We're talking seriously bizarre here. Quite by chance I attended a screening which was introduced by the director who asked us not to try to figure it out but just immerse ourselves in it. Some may say that that was a cop out but don't look at me I never said a word. I don't know the source material  a short story by Franz Wedekind  so I don't know how much help it would be in making sense of what plot there is. The only way to deal with it is to describe it and if that includes Spoilers so be it. After an ambiguous opening shot held for about 30 seconds which could be an underwater shot of an empty jacuzzi in full spate or stryofoam melting under a gentle flame lungs filling with liquid or practically anything you like we cut to a room empty except for a coffin on a trestle. In a moment about five pairs of legs surround the coffin. The legs are all female miniskirted and the owners have an average age of around 8 to 10 years. It's a paedophile's wet dream in spades. One of the girls produces a golden key and unlocks the coffin. Inside is another girl of roughly the same age apparently dead. After a beat she opens her eyes and the other girls help her out and tell her that this is her new home. So now we're thinking Afterlifelite Heaven or Hell the choice is yours. Once we see the girls in full shot the most startling thing is their costume identical white tops and white miniskirts which over the intervening days weeks months whatever NEVER get dirty. The House if that is what it  is appears to be in the center of a forest complete with lake and rowboat and a road about one color grade down from Yellow Brick that leads we know not where. It COULD be a girl's boarding school but the only lessons we ever see involve physical exercise andor dance. Of the three adults on the scene one is a middle aged woman who seems to be a combination cookhousekeeper and the other two younger women seem to be for want of a better word choreographers. One girl attempts to row the boat to whatever outside world exists and it fills with water a second scales the wall and lights out for the territory. The others are told that she did 'something bad' and they won't be seeing her again. The girls are kitted out with butterfly wings and taken to the stage of a theater that appears to be part of the house. The audience in the shadows seems to be solely male and the housekeeper figure tells the girls that these 'shows' help pay the freight. It's perhaps important to emphasise that there is absolutely nothing about the dancing that could be described as even suggestive let alone salacious or pornographic which means that it's all in the minds of the male audience. There's also a mysterious woman who appears once a year to 'choose' a girl who will be allowed to leave with her. Eventually the two choreographers lead the girls through the theater and down into an endless underground tunnel which terminates in a railway platform where a train is waiting. They take their seats and the train delivers them to a sunlit plaza up to its ass in fountains. The girls frolic in the fountains. One of the girls sees a golden lad probably around 20 through the fountain. He gives her a dazzling smile. And that's it. Back to the opening shot  whatever that was. And there you have it. Stunning! Breathtaking! Pretentious crap.Take your choice. I know what I think.".

The House if that is what it  is appears to be in the center of a forest complete with lake and rowboat and a road about one color grade down from Yellow Brick that leads we know not where. It COULD be a girl's boarding school but the only lessons we ever see involve physical exercise andor dance. Of the three adults on the scene one is a middle aged woman who seems to be a combination cookhousekeeper and the other two younger women seem to be for want of a better word choreographers. One girl attempts to row the boat to whatever outside world exists and it fills with water a second scales the wall and lights out for the territory. The others are told that she did 'something bad' and they won't be seeing her again. The girls are kitted out with butterfly wings and taken to the stage of a theater that appears to be part of the house. The audience in the shadows seems to be solely male and the housekeeper figure tells the girls that these 'shows' help pay the freight. It's perhaps important to emphasise that there is absolutely nothing about the dancing that could be described as even suggestive let alone salacious or pornographic which means that it's all in the minds of the male audience. There's also a mysterious woman who appears once a year to 'choose' a girl who will be allowed to leave with her. Eventually the two choreographers lead the girls through the theater and down into an endless underground tunnel which terminates in a railway platform where a train is waiting. They take their seats and the train delivers them to a sunlit plaza up to its ass in fountains. The girls frolic in the fountains. One of the girls sees a golden lad probably around 20 through the fountain. He gives her a dazzling smile. And that's it. Back to the opening shot  whatever that was. And there you have it. Stunning! Breathtaking! Pretentious crap.Take your choice. I know what I think.";

It's more like a ferris wheel. I'd say MerryGoRound but a MerryGoRound is fun and simple no matter how you cut it. This movie like a ferris wheel seems simple and like it's going nowhere. But if you stop and look around? Oh no! You're up high and your chair's rocking back and forth  how exciting! This is a slowmoving film but it's not boring.

You're not going to get any concrete answers to many of the burning questions in the movie.But that's the point.Make no mistake. This is one of THE BEST movies if you're looking for something out of the ordinary. It's not crazy or outlandish  it's very appealing with its visuals. What a great director! But it's got some magical mystical quality that ALL Englishlanguage movies don't have these days.Notice I said Englishlanguage? Because there are Korean and Japanese movies that stress qualities like Innocence but go without mention or acclaim. Watch Innocence ASAP though. It's the proverbial needle in the haystack.If you don't like this movie it's not the movie that has a problem it's definitely you. 'nuff said!".

	schema:headline " At it's heart it is a dramatic and enjoyable film  the padding is the problem";
	schema:reviewBody "Peter and Alice Bowman are working on a dam in South America in the employment of a large oil company.  When Peter is kidnapped the company bring in expert negotiator Terry Thorne.  However when the oil company runs out of money due to no insurance they take Terry off the case and he leaves for another job.  However a pang of conscience brings him back to help Alice and he replaces the corrupt locals.  As he tries to help get her husband back he also falls for Alice.As a fan of David Caruso I was annoyed that I missed this film at the cinema I blinked and I missed it! and by the time the video came out it had slipped my mind.  Shown of tv last night was the perfect time for me to see it and despite negative reviews I actually quite enjoyed it.  I think the problem is that the critics struggled to get past the handful of problems more later to find that the film was an effective if talky drama with a thriller edge.  The premise is good and it allows tense scenes where Terry tough talks as well as scenes with Peter with his captors. It's not perfect in this regard as it is a bit talky but for me it was engaging  I got the impression from other comments that people had expected raging gun battles all the way through the film.However what does damage the film is Alice Bowman.  I can see the potential behind Terry and Alice's romance  it could have been another layer of drama.  In reality it doesn't work a bit and only serves to take away from the main thrust of the film  their relationship never convinces and nothing of interest is actually done with it.  Likewise the character of Alice doesn't really work either  I never believed she was emotionally going through the wringers to the degree the script suggested she would be.  A big part of the blame for this must lie with Meg Ryan herself.  She is miscast in the first place but on top of that she is too pristine throughout the film  hair and makeup perfect no matter what and a stupid little hippiegirl personality that stops her being a real person.  It is a bad performance and the film would have benefited from a shorter running time which lost the romance subplot and scaled back on Ryan's time.However she is carried by a real star turn from Crowe.  It may not be that clever a role but he does tough' really well and he helps improve the tension of several scenes.  Morse is a good actor and he does well here. The only downside of his performance is that he seemed fit and well outside of his makeup I was looking for him to look thinner and mentally battered as the film progressed but he didn't  it's not his fault I guess the film had no time to do this.  Caruso gives the same tough performance he does in every thing he ever does so if you like that then you'll like him here  I do!Overall this is an enjoyable film if you can get past it's major problems surrounding Alice and Terry's relationship.  Scriptwise this aspect was weak on paper but a comparatively rubbish turn from the miscast Meg Ryan just makes it all the weaker.  Thank god that the basic premise is tense and the male leads' tough talking is good fun.".

	onyx:emotionText "Peter and Alice Bowman are working on a dam in South America in the employment of a large oil company.  When Peter is kidnapped the company bring in expert negotiator Terry Thorne.  However when the oil company runs out of money due to no insurance they take Terry off the case and he leaves for another job.  However a pang of conscience brings him back to help Alice and he replaces the corrupt locals.  As he tries to help get her husband back he also falls for Alice.As a fan of David Caruso I was annoyed that I missed this film at the cinema I blinked and I missed it! and by the time the video came out it had slipped my mind.  Shown of tv last night was the perfect time for me to see it and despite negative reviews I actually quite enjoyed it.  I think the problem is that the critics struggled to get past the handful of problems more later to find that the film was an effective if talky drama with a thriller edge.  The premise is good and it allows tense scenes where Terry tough talks as well as scenes with Peter with his captors. It's not perfect in this regard as it is a bit talky but for me it was engaging  I got the impression from other comments that people had expected raging gun battles all the way through the film.However what does damage the film is Alice Bowman.  I can see the potential behind Terry and Alice's romance  it could have been another layer of drama.  In reality it doesn't work a bit and only serves to take away from the main thrust of the film  their relationship never convinces and nothing of interest is actually done with it.  Likewise the character of Alice doesn't really work either  I never believed she was emotionally going through the wringers to the degree the script suggested she would be.  A big part of the blame for this must lie with Meg Ryan herself.

	schema:reviewBody "What happens in real life will inevitably have an effect on the reel one. Tom Cruise learnt that with his strange antics in real life  his screen one suffered with a less than expected stellar box office for MI3 despite positive critical reviews. Way back in 2000 Russell Crowe and Meg Ryan learnt that too with their rumoured romance while shooting this movie one of the many reasons resulting in this becoming a box office bomb.I felt that it was not a bad movie actually given the story which I found interesting in the first place for its extremely distant relation to what I'm doing and being an action adventure movie it works with its fair share of big action sequences.Russell Crowe plays Terry Thorne a consultant in the Security and Crisis Response Unit of Luthan Risk International. His job is to negotiate the safe return of Kidnap and Ransom KR victims around the world and of course this brings him frequently to where the action is during the payment of ransoms and the extraction of hostages. He yearns for a management role but as always if you're an excellent field operative you're played to your strengths out there.Which brings him to his latest client Meg Ryan's Alice Bowman whose husband Peter Bowman David Morse an employee with the biggest international oil firmed gets kidnapped by chance during a raid in Ecuador. There are numerous scenes in the movie to perk your interest in this much behindthescenes industry of KR the terrorist? groups' motivation and how the entire business is conducted with the engagement of peers as well as the involvement of shady government personnel. There are many fine touches that might go unnoticed like how network of contacts and peers are milked cooperation extended the wheelings and dealings of large multinational corporations and politics in general. But the focus moves quickly towards a micro one that between Thorne and Alice Bowman as he accomplishes to build her trust in him that he's the best in the business and knows what he's doing.Perhaps this is one of the rare movies that allowed Crowe to be an Australian and keep the accent in a Hollywood production. His Thorne is oozes enough machismo to carry the action through and is credible enough to be believed as a veteran in the business. Meg Ryan this time round has a more serious character to play albeit at times a weepie one steering well clear of the pretty ditzy blonde comedic roles she has become accustomed to. They had probably shot some love scenes for this movie but I suppose the bad press resulted in those scenes ending up on the cutting room floor. The romance between the character was also almost squashed out save for the out of place suggestion of a strong physical attraction which rears its ugly head in the second half of the movie slowing the pace down a little without much mature development. I thought that should it had been removed entirely it'll probably end up a stronger movie with Thorne more in character as a mission driven individual.The first David David Caruso is finding a new lease of life back in television with CSI since branching off to movies after NYPD Blue didn't augur too well for him. I thought his performance here was nothing much to shout about though. However David Morse who usually plays supporting roles put up an adequately engaging Peter Bowman as an executive caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and examines the fear and desperation of a man kidnapped and constantly at the wrong end of a gun barrel.The theme song by Danny Elfman is addictive time to hunt it down and the end credits was played over a helicopter view of the entire Ecuadorian landscape just beautiful to look at. Clocking at just over 2 hours it provided some good entertainment for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Code 3 DVD contains the behind the scenes makingof documentary 13 40' the theatrical trailer and the feature length audio commentary by director Taylor Hackford.".

Enter Terry Thorne an insurance investigator whose specialty is K and R  kidnapping and ransom.  Terry's job is to negotiate the release of kidnapped foreign nationals.  And he is a very busy man.This movie really piqued my interest and not because of the offscreen romance between Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe the father of a good friend of mine is an international financial consultant and he was almost kidnapped while working in SouthEast Asia.  The attempt was foiled by the quick actions of the special security detail that intercepted details of the plan and whisked him out of the country.   I spoke with him after seeing the trailers for the movie and he said that in country he is currently working in you do not anywhere without heavily armed escorts.  The possibility of being kidnapped is viewed as the cost of doing business.   I forgot to ask him if they had the appropriate insurance.Proof of Life grew out of a story in Vanity Fair and is loosely based on the kidnapping of an American businessman by Colombian guerillas. Taylor Hackford is a director who eschews the safety of studios and opts for that extra touch of realism.  In keeping with this goal he took the cast and crew down to Ecuador where he was met with erupting volcanoes blizzards a cast beset with altitude sickness a coup in Quito muggings heart attacks on the set and the death of a standin.   The final cut is an apt homage to those involved.Typically cast as the funny quirky girlfriend afflicted with endless minicrises Meg Ryan has been afforded few opportunities to demonstrate acting abilities.  As Alice Bowman she has the chance to flesh out a multidimensional character that doesn't spend her onscreen time whining crying or laughing insipidly.  And she does so admirably.  Russell Crowe riding high after the success of Gladiator once again delivers a solid performance.  Crowe draws heavily on his own quiet severe introspection to create a character conflicted between loyalties expectations and realities and the feelings he tries to suppress for Ryan's character.  Their real life tryst helped to establish the tone for  the powerful yet subtle scenes they share onscreen.  David Morse is excellent as Terry a man trying to hang onto his sanity in an insane situation.  As he is marched across country and endures humiliation and beatings he never loses sight of his goal to stay alive and escape.  His transformation from clean cut businessman I've never seen him with such a close shave to disheveled captive is done slowly and deliberately and the viewer appreciates what he's experiencing. Finally it was interesting to see David Caruso  who has floated in the acting netherworld since he left NYPD Blue almost six years ago  as a rival KR specialist who assists Terry with his mission.  Caruso reminds us why he has not graced many marquees   he's not very funny action is not his forte and he is an average actor at best.  The other star of the film is the location.With most of the film having been shot in the mountains of Ecuador the guerrillas camp was literally carved out of the jungle it is not surprising that the film looks gorgeous tumbling waterfalls plunging ravines and flourishing jungles are stock backdrops for the story and you begin to take them for granted.  One of my favorite scenes was when the infinite expanse of greenery is broken by a band of camouflaged rebels who were totally invisible only moments earlier.  I was surprised how tight the cinematography was given the expansive vistas but nothing is sacrificed in the process.  In addition to a wellwritten script that avoids most cliches and contains palpable suspense I was impressed with the way the relationship between Alice and Terry was handled.  Rather than have the characters jumping into bed for a sweatfest the writers opted for an undercurrent of subtle tension with the characters exchanging occasional confused glances and moments of awkward silence when their hands brush.The first entertaining intelligent film to come out of Tinseltown in a long while  maybe it bodes well for the Christmas rush.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maureen O'Hara stars in a movie where her husband gets kidnapped those damn commies in South East Asia so she hires tough and dashing soldier of fortune Clark Gable to save the day That's not the cast or the location of PROOF OF LIFE but it does have a very similar plot . Did someone mention this was a 1940s matine blockbuster ? Just curious because while I was watching the movie I was struck by how old fashioned everything felt . Russell Crowe plays an Aussie who served in the SAS and saves a Frenchman from the Chechens in the opening sequence  but you could have had Gable playing an American paratrooper saving someone from the Red Army on the River Elbe in May 1945 . Different actor  different period of history  different enemy but still the same basic story with the action switching from Europe to say South East Asia in 1950 That's not to say PROOF OF LIFE is a bad film . It's not and I found it mainly entertaining though perhaps a little too long . It's just that it is so old fashioned that you can see where the predictable story threads are going to begin and end . You can't deny that both the cast and action scenes are good  it's just that you also can't stop thinking it would have been better if it'd been filmed in monochrome and directed by Michael Curtiz with no bad language or sexual references".

Morse was believably chauvinistic early on before the kidnapping and quite remarkably believable as a desperate hostage.

	schema:reviewBody "In a mountainous South American country where drugs are the major crop of the economy kidnapping is more of a lucrative investment opportunity than a punishable felony. The government is in the business of trying to stop the drug trade and allocating resources for more respectable economic ventures. In response to this anti government Marxist guerrilla groups frequently block off traffic and raid the streets kidnapping citizens and tourist alike freeing the poor ones and keeping the ones who can fetch a high ransom price. Soon they realize this can bring in even more money than the drug trade and change into a professional kidnapping operation. When they kidnap and idealistic American engineer Peter Bowman David Moorse who is in South America attempting to build a dam that he believes will help the locals grow crops the guerrilla group finds out he is employed by a United States oil company and believe that the dam is assisting an oil pipeline robbing South America of this precious national resource. They take him to their camp in the mountains and wait for either his wife Meg Bowman Meg Ryan or the oil company to pay the large ransom set. The oil company sends in a kidnap and rescue specialists Terry Thorne Russell Crowe to negotiate a lower price however the ransom is still much higher than either his wife has or the oil company is willing to pay.While it takes place in a fictional South American country Tecala we can infer that Proof of Life was based almost entirely on Columbia because for a variety of reasons. The geography of Tecala resembles that of Columbia with both flat coastal lowlands and a mountainous region the Andes. The other clue that gives away that Tecala was based on Columbia is the effect of guerrillas. The guerrilla group in the movie is based on La Violencia which also has a Marxist orientation. In Columbia guerilla groups control almost forty percent of the countryside just as in Proof of Life. This film does a great job showing the imprint that guerilla groups have left on the local populace. Many Columbian citizens live in fear that every day something bad will happen to them or their families due to the great amount of daily violence in the country.The film snaps back and forth between three story lines a harrowing escape effort from the mountain camp by Peter Bowman the intense negotiations to lower the ransom price by Terry Thorne and Alice Bowman's emotional roller coaster between her budding feelings for Terry Thorne and feelings of loss and despair for her husband. This triplet of story lines can get quite confusing and annoying at times because its prevents us from getting truly engaged in a storyline. Many of the characters actions and emotions are unbelievable which leads to a distancing of oneself from the characters. Proof of Life overall however was an entertaining movie and a movies goal is simply to entertain. While it could have used more action sequences it succeeded in getting the blood and adrenaline flowing. I would rate it a 6.5 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Proof of Life is a good example of how NOT to make a movie.Alice Meg Ryan and Peter David Morse are married and living in a fictional South American country called Tecala.  Peter gets kidnapped. Terry Russell Crowe is a kidnap and ransom negotiator whose job it is to get Peter released.It is possible to make a good movie about a woman whose husband has been kidnapped and the relationship she has with the man who is negotiating to get her husband released.  It is possible to make a good movie about a man who has been kidnapped and the ordeal he undergoes while living with terrorists.  The point is you pick one or the other.  Proof of Life tries to have it both ways and it fails.  There is no way one movie can do justice to both storylines.  The action in Proof of Life keeps jumping back and forth between the two competing storylines and it is very annoying. The movie has no structure and no focus.The other huge problem I have with this movie is the relationship between Alice and Terry.  The movie falls all over itself trying to convince us that Alice and Terry are falling in love but I didn't believe it for a moment. Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe have absolutely no chemistry with each other. You would never suspect these people had an affair in real life.When Alice offers Peter's sister Janice Pamela Reed a glass of wine and Janice says she doesn't drink this gives Alice and Terry an excuse to exchange a meaningful' look.  When Alice and Terry take Janice to the airport after Janice leaves Alice and Terry stand and stare at each other. When Terry is on the radio talking to the kidnappers he sees Alice in another room.  They stop what they are doing and look at each other.  The movie wants us to believe all this gazing is a sign of romantic attraction but it just looks like Alice and Terry are staring at each other for no apparent reason.There is a scene in which Terry's friend Dino David Caruso spends some time with Alice and Terry.  Alice drinks out of Terry's glass.  We see a closeup of Dino reacting to this.  Alice and Terry light candles.  Dino comments on this.  In this scene the movie is hitting us over the head telling us to find tremendous significance in Alice and Terry's innocent behavior.  So what if Alice drinks out of Terry's glass and they light candles?  That doesn't mean they're falling in love!When Dino asks Terry if he is in love with Alice the question makes no sense because all he has to go on is the behavior described above.

	onyx:emotionText "Proof of Life is a good example of how NOT to make a movie.Alice Meg Ryan and Peter David Morse are married and living in a fictional South American country called Tecala.  Peter gets kidnapped. Terry Russell Crowe is a kidnap and ransom negotiator whose job it is to get Peter released.It is possible to make a good movie about a woman whose husband has been kidnapped and the relationship she has with the man who is negotiating to get her husband released.  It is possible to make a good movie about a man who has been kidnapped and the ordeal he undergoes while living with terrorists.  The point is you pick one or the other.  Proof of Life tries to have it both ways and it fails.  There is no way one movie can do justice to both storylines.  The action in Proof of Life keeps jumping back and forth between the two competing storylines and it is very annoying. The movie has no structure and no focus.The other huge problem I have with this movie is the relationship between Alice and Terry.  The movie falls all over itself trying to convince us that Alice and Terry are falling in love but I didn't believe it for a moment. Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe have absolutely no chemistry with each other. You would never suspect these people had an affair in real life.When Alice offers Peter's sister Janice Pamela Reed a glass of wine and Janice says she doesn't drink this gives Alice and Terry an excuse to exchange a meaningful' look.  When Alice and Terry take Janice to the airport after Janice leaves Alice and Terry stand and stare at each other. When Terry is on the radio talking to the kidnappers he sees Alice in another room.  They stop what they are doing and look at each other.  The movie wants us to believe all this gazing is a sign of romantic attraction but it just looks like Alice and Terry are staring at each other for no apparent reason.There is a scene in which Terry's friend Dino David Caruso spends some time with Alice and Terry.  Alice drinks out of Terry's glass.  We see a closeup of Dino reacting to this.  Alice and Terry light candles.  Dino comments on this.  In this scene the movie is hitting us over the head telling us to find tremendous significance in Alice and Terry's innocent behavior.  So what if Alice drinks out of Terry's glass and they light candles?  That doesn't mean they're falling in love!When Dino asks Terry if he is in love with Alice the question makes no sense because all he has to go on is the behavior described above.  When Terry kisses Alice it comes out of nowhere.I think Meg Ryan is miscast in this movie.  I just never found her performance convincing.  Alice needs to wear a bra and her hair is always a mess.  Alice never actually smokes her cigarettes but merely waves them around and gestures with them.Russell Crowe looks good and gives a good performance.";

	schema:headline " The totally lifeless Proof of life";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in the volatile political climate of Ecuador 'Proof of Life' is basically a film about an engineer Peter Bowman David Morse The Rock The Negotiator who is kidnapped by a ruthless gang of guerrillas. Enter former SAS man Terry Thorne Russell Crowe a specialist in KR kidnap and ransom to negotiate the terms of his release whilst comforting and gaining the trust of Bowman's wife Alice Meg Ryan. The ransom demands are extreme and as Bowman and his company are uninsured it comes down to the family and Alice to provide the money except they do not have the requisite amount being able to accrue a mere 650 000.This is a long and rambling film that fails on almost every level. Considering that Ryan and Crowe were having a sizzling and passionate romance it is incredible that none of this is transferred to screen. Their chemistry is simply none existent and although the film moves throughout at a horribly boorish pace their inevitable romance seems contrived hurried and without any foundation whatsoever. Prolonged eye contact does not suddenly equate to earth shattering deep romantic love. Crowe is an undoubted talent with tremendous and markedly different performances in films like 'Gladiator' 'The Insider' and 'LA Confidential'. There is no doubt that action films suit his acting style and Crowe can pull off a good performance even when he is given very little to play with. 'Proof of Life' is supposed to demonstrate his more sensitive side whilst maintaining the rugged charm and hardness that has made him successful but this is without doubt his worst film to date.Meg Ryan seems to have built her career out of one film 'When Harry Met Sally' and more importantly one scene the faked orgasm scene and she is frankly awful in this film. She seems to be typecast forever playing an emotional and tearful woman and in 'Proof of Life' she is no different. Such repeated sentimentality in her characters make her performances much less effective than they might be in isolation so when the tears come in this film they are much less potent or moving than they ought to be.'Proof of Life' is completely lifeless and the only scene that saves it is towards the end where the film gets some 'Predator' like action scenes and we realise why we have come to watch Crowe viz. to see him fire his gun. The star of the film is Thorne's close friend and fellow KR specialist Dino David Caruso 'NYPD Blue' but he is in too few scenes to really save the film.The premise of the film is a good one as kidnapping has gone up massively throughout the world in the last ten years especially in England but there is so little that can be said that is positive about the film although the ever reliable David Morse plays his hostage role particularly well. The usually sound Pamela Reed 'Kindergarten Cop' plays Bowman's older sister but her character could easily have been left out of the film altogether. In one scene she leaves for the airport to collect the ransom money and we never see or hear from her again.Director Taylor Hackford 'Devil's Advocate' can do a lot better than this although I am sure that the film will be a boxoffice success simply because Crowe is one of Hollywood's biggest actors despite the fact that it is dull and unentertaining.Overall 210".

I disagree with most that the movie is too long I find the duration to be fine I did not catch myself being bored for an instant for the duration of the film.As far as the acting is concerned I think David Morse put in an excellent performance here as the kidnapped husband. Very good acting indeed. As far as the two starring actors are concerned I do not find as some say that Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe were miscast in this picture. On the contrary I think they work well in this type of picture especially Russel Crowe who does a very good job playing an ex SAS officer. Special forces soldiers do not look or act like Schwarzenegger they are more or less exactly as Crowe portrayed them. Yes I agree that Meg Ryan could have been more emotionally involving more dramatic but she brings so many other things to the screen that others don't naivete believability charm etc.. You can't have everything well you can but not always.... In other I found the movie has been well directed the cinematography and sound are also good. On the flip side the screenplay could have been a little more 'sophisticated' Ebert put it very nicely Perhaps the screenplay should have been kept simmering until it was reduced a little and its flavors made stronger.All in all not an artistic masterpiece but a good entertaining motion picture to watch with a beer and a nice packet of popcorn.

They went into the enemy camp with 'Special Forces'that they worked with int taking the other side out and retrieving the hostages. What a spectacular rescue. It was the dynamite that set the story apart from anything like it!! On the back side the behind the scenes story they went through a lot of hard circumstances and physical tests just to make this film. They had to dig out a road to get to one of the spots that they were set to shoot. They also dealt with tremendous cold weather that had more than a couple of the actors and crew frostbitten. They went the distance to make this film work...and it does this one delivers action adventure dangerous territory strength guts love and redemption all within the stories's parameters. This one shouldn't be missed if you enjoy these great actors. I rated this one a 'ten' on the satisfaction of a great film scale. Some may disagree and if they do I say here's a challenge go out and get a crew and make a better picture along this storyline. Recommended highly. This one is should have a higher rating by the movie critics .".

On the back side the behind the scenes story they went through a lot of hard circumstances and physical tests just to make this film. They had to dig out a road to get to one of the spots that they were set to shoot. They also dealt with tremendous cold weather that had more than a couple of the actors and crew frostbitten. They went the distance to make this film work...and it does this one delivers action adventure dangerous territory strength guts love and redemption all within the stories's parameters. This one shouldn't be missed if you enjoy these great actors. I rated this one a 'ten' on the satisfaction of a great film scale. Some may disagree and if they do I say here's a challenge go out and get a crew and make a better picture along this storyline. Recommended highly. This one is should have a higher rating by the movie critics .";

	schema:reviewBody "the action at the end was the best part of this for me but it would be completely lame if not backed up by the deep plot through the middle. Crowe goes fairly well in this as does Morse. However I was more impressed by David Caruso's appearance in one of his most recent films before CSI Miami. I'd only seen him before in CSI Miami which I watch a lot of so his hard but fair cop style was fairly ingrained in my mind. It was like watching every episode of the XFiles and then trying to watch David Duchovny in some other film. You can tell a good actor though if they can blend into any character and make it believable. Caruso did this exceptionally well here.In terms of the plot I was a little annoyed that Crowe's character Terry Thorne allowed himself to take things beyond a professional relationship with Ryan's character Alice. For one I see Thorne as a more professional man than this and second it took the edge off the glee when Peter Bowman Morse got rescued and returned home because we the audience knew that all was not as well as he thought it was because his wife had been kissing the negotiator.Like I said i really liked the action Caruso was the most crucial element to the success of the shootout at the end. I didn't however like how the opening action scene seemed only to be there to get the audience's attention and didn't really wind into the story. Except I guess for introducing Crowe as a KNR bloke. I would have preferred this screen time to be spent on getting to know Ryan and Morse better but I suppose the producers wanted to make the film more about Crowe than these two.".

	schema:reviewBody "The leading figure in Factotum which means a jack of all trades is Henry Chinaski. The movie written and directed by Bent Hamer a Norwegian is based on the novel of the same name by Charles Bukowski who died in 1994. Like Chinaski Bukowski was a drunk indulged in casual sex and liked to gamble and most of Bukowski's books including Factotum are based on his own experiences in and out of blue collar worker. Also like his creator Chinaski is a writer albeit unpublished as yet. Nevertheless it is probably best NOT to approach this film as a partial biography of Bukowski but simply as a fictional movie based on his writings.Chinaski played by Matt Dillon is the ultimate irresponsible goofoff living just above the level of skid row who gets work when he needs cash for booze etc but invariably gets fired within days or weeks. Told not to smoke in a particular workplace he lights up once the boss is out of the way asked to make a delivery he drives the van away while it's still connected to an electric plug leaves the van door open and drifts into a bar. Even outside work he behaves perversely  notably leaving ointment on his private parts overnight when he's been told that one hour is the absolute limit! And Chinaski though initially appearing mildly passive is not averse to violence even to women.The man's sole redeeming features are his belief in himself as a writer and his persistence in writing and submitting his work. His main redeeming feature should be his actual talent for writing but the film gives us little evidence of this except for a few Bukowski quotes which in any case are mainly about his belief in himself. .Dillon fits this role like a glove. By turns he sleepwalks staggers and rampages through the movie  that is when Chinaski isn't drinking in bars or sleeping it off with or without a woman. And because this is fiction rather than biography Dillon can mitigate his deplorable behaviour and slovenly dress simply with his good looks and dark eyes. One suspects that in real life Bukowski was far less likable than his cinematic alter ego.Chinaski's main squeeze for most of the movie bravely and quite unglamorously portrayed by Lili Taylor is Jan who shares her lover's fondness for alcohol and a slacker life. In one sequence when he has split from Jan Chinaski encounters a glossier woman Laura Marisa Tomei who introduces him to a more bourgeois world but this doesn't last long and he soon reverts to his usual round of drink and casual jobs. Incidentally I found the sound quality in the whole Marisa Tomei sequence quite poor and missed much of the dialogue. I'm not too sure what anybody uninterested in Bukowski or Matt Dillon will make of this movie but if you're looking for something in English other than blockbusters romcoms costume dramas etc  this is it. And whatever your view of the movie if you haven't already done so read some Bukowski  you'll love it!".

	schema:reviewBody "If you remember that Bent Hamer made the little film about a Forties Scandinavian household efficiency program called Kitchen Stories you'll be partially prepared for the dry sardonic style of this followup feature the Charles Bukowskibased epic of seedy living Factotum in which Matt Dillon gives a stylized restrained performance as the authorial standin Hank Chinaski and Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei seamlessly slide into the roles of Hank's alcoholic girlfriends Jan and Laura. Bulked up with a zombie stare stifled voice and shambling walk Dillon is very good if due partly to script limitations not as compelling as Mickey Rourke in Barbet Schroeder's Barfly. Even overweight and horribly dressed Dillon is still far too handsome to resemble the pockmarked and ugly reallife Bokowski but you can't fault good looks in a leading man and the film is dominated by Dillon's character who's in every scene his narrative voice brought in to move the episodic plot along and provide Bukowski's insistent commentary on life as he sees it.Those episodes are all we get and apart from brief writing and longer romantic interludes they mainly concern a long round of shortlived jobs  sorting pickles in a pickle factory boxing brake shoes dusting statues driving a cab a hardon's no danger to the driver the instructor says but sneezing is assembling bike parts and so on from which Hank is unfailingly soon fired for drunkenness or lateness insubordination or other misdemeanors  whereupon he goes back to writing drinking and sex  which latter Jan tells him is no good when he gets successful as he does for a while playing the horses. There's none of the post office sorting job Bukowski did for a long time. For Bukowski and his alter ego being a seedy loser is a thing carried off with such chutzpah that it's sexy  and drinking and sex are equally close ways to feed the libido. There are plenty of the tencent aphorisms the tireless writer worked at and there's a plug for the Black Sparrow Press that eventually started to keep and publish his endlessly mailed out submissions and today still survives off maintaining the slob genius' ovre in public hands.Bokowski appeals to the young the easily impressed the hard drinking and those who like the pithy sayings and ignore the arrested development. For those of bourgeois mentality and upbringing there's a certain imperishably tonic thrill in watching a man who's been down so long it looks like up who can tell the employer who's just fired him to give him his severance check immediately so he can hurry up and get drunk for whom no flophouse or flat is too seedy no bibulous girlfriend a worse drunk than he. How liberating it might be not to care about losing everything knowing that since paper and pen are nearly free you'll never stop writing or if you lose heart for a minute or two a dip into the works of some other writer will encourage you in the belief that you can do better. Bokowski was a tough one. Matt Dillon is Irish enough to have seen something of the hard drinking life himself. One senses that he knows whereof he speaks and can convey the alcoholic lifestyle without irony or melodrama. There's nothing quite like Lili Taylor coming out in her underwear to fix Hank a meal. His request is for another round of pancakes. There's still no butter she says. Well they'll be extra crisp he replies.In a smaller but still choice role Marisa Tomei is well disguised as another drunken lady Hank goes home with finding that she lives with a flaky French millionaire called Pierre Didier Flamand with a little yacht and dreams of composing an opera. Hank's been taken off so many two bit jobs being fired has no sting left for him. Bukowski's persona is impenetrable and he's a simple survivor he's almost utterly resistant to the forces of change his wayward lifestyle would activate in lesser beings and hence unlike the downward spiraling drunk so movingly played by Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas Bukowski's Hank in Dillon's performance cannot build toward pathos or true depth. As suggested this film doesn't develop its sequences and relationships as thoroughly as Barfly for which Bukowski himself wrote the screenplay giving it a continuity and focus Factotum's more cobbledtogether script doesn't quite muster. There's something condescending and cultish in the European cultivation of the Bukowski myth in which this is another short chapter. Factotum is an occasionally amusing at moments laughoutloud kind of movie that's well served by all the principals and by director Hamer's dry wit and restraint but after the desultory and boring stretches have eventually started to pile up you may begin to say So what? and wish the fresh novel feel of the early scenes could've been better sustained throughout. Not to fault the editing but mightn't a native's keener ear for the rhythms of the dialogue have kept the flow going better? This is one to see if you like Matt Dillon or Bukowski otherwise save your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "'A man or woman of all work' is indeed what Matt Dillon is in this outthere adaptation of Bukowski stories. Bent Hamer directs in this brilliant and quirky tale of a man who walks through life doing oddjobs to fund his booze gambling and womanising habits.Henry Chinaski is made real by the always brilliant Matt Dillon. It really is no surprise that Hollywood's former pinup embodies the part so well as his perfected mix of sleaze and slack minded cool have made him the renowned actor he is. From 'Over the Edge' in 1979 the award winning 'Drugstore Cowboy' and his recent role as the scarred cop in 'Crash' Dillon really has the ability to expose man's flaws and run to a bar with them.The film is spliced from various Bukowski writings and follows Chinaski his alterego around town as he drinks from job to job occasionally taking time to get fired and get laid. Lily Taylor and Marisa Tomei play two of Chinaski's bedpals with equal sleaze and conviction.This is not your usual movie in terms of subject matter and execution. It takes a Norwegian director committed actors and a fantastic performance from Dillon to pull off a story that really is as much a Homage to Bukowski but also a bold attempt to deliver something different a word not regularly accepted in today's Hollywood run industry. Hence some of the finance coming from Japan.From our introduction to Chinaski's routines of getting work and drinking then losing work and drinking to watching what is essentially a horrible man his treatment of woman his lack of respect for anything we are never really meant to like him. So why do we? It isn't just the looks or square jaw of the lead Bukowski was the complete opposite or his fantastic humorous charm but what lies beneath those eyes. Dillon has always been able to make the jerk likable. In this case we do because he's funny and because we get a tiny glimpse of background reasoning why this man is so talented and yet so flawed. The real Bukowski suffered a tough childhood and Chinaski's family is only referenced to in a hilarious scene of steak and ass you'll see what I mean.Bent Hamer has accomplished a feat pretty standard in European filmmaking traditions light comedy with black undertones outside of the rules of the usual three part formation. This tale could have started anywhere and ended anywhere in this man's life as the selling point it simply having Dillon on screen as this character that is the story.Bukowski was a genius who stuck to his loose morality with his back to society. It should be noted that he held down jobs for long periods one for 12 years while doing what he did best drinking and gambling but the only time he truly engaged was when he was observing for his writings looking for funding i.e. work or needed a female drink buddy. He later had works published hung around with Sean Penn also considered for the role and U2 dedicated a song to him.The cast and crew have created a delightful fresh film that is both funny and dark. The performances are as authentic as ever with a mention going to Lily Taylor's career best performance. This film is a Jack of all trades and seems to have mastered a new one with the tone and atmosphere set perfectly to mirror the down and dirty LA Bukowski became part of.".

This film is a Jack of all trades and seems to have mastered a new one with the tone and atmosphere set perfectly to mirror the down and dirty LA Bukowski became part of.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bent Hamer has become one of the most celebrated Norwegian directors of recent times that DIDN'T spawn from the Norwegian new wave that helped lift the average quality of Norwegian film production out of the quagmire it was in. He was one of the few who was worth keeping around of the previous generation and one of the few who didn't need to be influenced by Detektor or Mongoland.With titles such as Eggs 1995 and Salmer fra kjkkenet 2003 he has long since established himself as a more than competent director with the ability of transferring emotion to film without losing credibility or affecting the narrative disfavourably. Factotum is no exception.Factotum is the absolute opposite of the trend in Norwegian film making the feelgood comedy wave that has swept the scene and is quickly becoming redundant. If the scene does not renew itself and develop Norwegian film making will end up the way it did prethe new wave. Or then again it mightn't. We still have Bent Hamer and he has yet to make a film with Kristoffer Joner who despite being one of our best actors is also the most abused appearing in pretty much everything that comes out. That is with the exception of Hamer's work. Thankfully. May it stay that way. Bent Hamer might possibly be the best contemporary Norwegian director there is.Now regarding Factotum. Casting Matt Dillon despite the critique this move has received was a stroke of genius. Many feel he was wrongly cast for instance because he is not as ugly as Bukowski was. What the hell kind of argument is that anyway? but this truly is a misconception. Dillon manages to summon up the very essence of Henry Chinaski his attitude his stance his walk  after seeing this film I doubt anyone else could ever play Chinaski again never mind Barfly. Dillon looks atrocious like a shadow of a former self so marinated in alcohol and defeatist attitude that he can do nothing else in the world but indulge in these two sins. Oh and live to write about it. This is not a prettyboy who will melt teenage girls' hearts. This is lowlife urban whitetrash America. This is Henry Chinaski. And what he does  in perfect harmony with Hamer's moviemaking magic  is to convey that emotion so brilliantly well to the audience. I personally had previously only had three powerful resonance effects after films in the past I suppose I am too jaded for it to be a generality Requiem for a Dream and the two versions of Insomnia the Norwegian Erik Skjoldbjrgoriginal with Stellan Skarsgaard and Cristopher Nolan's remake with what must be dubbed Pacino's greatest performance to date. The latter two made me feel like I hadn't slept for a week. Factotum made me feel like I had been drinking for a week. And I badly needed another drink when I came out of the theater. This is a truly amazing experience and as far as I am concerned a very rare event. This alone was worth watching the film. Woe unto the US if it is released directly on DVD  the American audience deserve to see it on the silver screen.As far as the story goes most of it follows Factotum pretty closely with a few changes and updates the story is set to modern day with influences from a good selection of Bukowski's additional writing. As far as dubbing the book the weakest ref. these forums and wondering why Hamer and producer Jim Stark chose to filmatize this one out of the bunch it is in my observation the book that best exemplifies Henry Chinaski and thusly serves best as a crosssection of his existence. PostOffice or Women would have been too thematic and Ham on Rye mainly details his upbringing. Factotum was the logical choice.To close I am not naming this the best film I have ever seen or anything of the like but it is still truly a masterpiece a perfect rendition of slowpaced lowlife urbanity and alcoholism and an excellent interpretation of Bukowski's writing. If you are lucky enough to see it in the theaters you should do so  at least if you are a longtime fan or only passing reader of Bukowski.".

One scene that was so indicative of the writer wanting to be left alone is when a coworker is looking forward to meeting Chinaski and the meeting is filled with silence.Matt Dillon has matured into a great actor and I am glad he was nominated for Crash and I would like to see him nominated for this too.

But I thought Dillon's role as Bukowski was just okay. I almost can't quite put my finger on it. He looks a decent bit Like Buk but his actual performance seems almost too much like a mediocre impression. I don't know. It's just not very natural or convincing or something. I'm not an acting coach. He just didn't click with me as Bukow...ahem Chinaski anyway.As a whole the film just didn't capture the feel of the Bukowski novel. It seemed too clean for some reason. The whole film just seemed a lot more tame than the literature. His writing captures this great sense of adventure danger and a frequent raw vulgarity. But also it has a very artful heart to it. The movie missed this entirely in my opinion.But believe it or not though I still think it's a good movie. Outside the actual interpretation of Charles Bukowski's novel it's still fun watch with generally good performances and a phenomenal story to have been based on.".

Indeed the story is moreorless organized around the myriad jobs sought and botched by the protagonist unsuccessful short story writer and all around lowlife Henry Chinaski Matt Dillon. The other principal organizing focus in Chinaski's life is the women he squeezes and drinks with primarily slutty Jan Lili Taylor and more passingly the somewhat classier Laura Marisa Tomei.

What other films to include? Among recent ones Hustle  Flow comes quickly to mind. The Big Lebowski and maybe some other films by the Coens. Quite a lot of Jim Jarmusch's oeuvre but Down By Law for sure. Steve Buscemi's Trees Lounge. Pulp Fiction of course. This film is steeped in richly cynical dialogue well written in collaboration with Jim Stark who also cowrote Cold Fever well photographed by John Christian Rosenlund and well edited alas no credit is given for this achievement on either the IMDb or the film's own website.

He lived every raw word he wrote and Hamer brings it to life on the screen. Did Bukowski live to write or was he writing to live? The likely answer is yes to both.

Seeing a dirty decrepit drunken man like bukowski in the lead role might have made this movie mildly interesting but instead we have this overacting pretty boy horribly miscast. Additionally the rest of the casting was equally atrociousmore watered down acting from the likes of Marissa Tomai etc. If you want to see the real Bukowski on screen check out Barfly which is not perfect but much better or better yet try to track down the old documentary video called Bukowski drinks smokes and talks which has candid footage of bukowski boozing chain smoking driving around the sleaziest parts of LA and yelling at his girl friend. Once you've seen this you'll realize what garbage Factotum really is. Perhaps this movie would be great if you know nothing about bukowski but love this Dillon guy I pity you.".

When you are reading Bukowski especially one of his best like Factotum you can't put it down. You find yourself laughing uncontrollably. There is no fat on the story. But somehow this hack of a directorwriter has managed to make Bukowski seem languid and boring. Instead of coming across as a rebel as he does in his books he comes across as a dullard in this film. Unlike Bukowski's books it almost makes you want to stop drinking. Also Matt Dillon  while a fine actor and one of my favorites  is way too pretty and thin to play Bukowski. Decent makeup hair and clothes but he just looks too much like a pretty boy even with all that. And worst of all is the complete lack of a story throughline. I know Factotum is the kind of anecdotal book that does not lend itself to film narrative but the writer failed to even pull out one clear direction for this film and in the end you can't help but feel like you are watching nothing at all.

That's about it there is no plot or any character development. Our hero is a drunk with sad eyes and a dream of becoming a writer. Though his dream is not strong enough to make any difference at the most it seems to be nothing more then a peculiar hobby.His lack of emotional involvement in his life and in his art doesn't allow any empathy to come trough. Thus we are left with a character that is indifferent to himself almost as much as we are indifferent to him. About half way through the film I felt I needed a drink just so I'll be able to get to the end which seems to be eluding me on purpose. The film is slow and pointless it is too clean to be truly realistic and lacks a solid story to give it some dramatic edge. The director piles up the scenes like a lazy construction worker without building any structure. I suppose die hard fans of Charles Bukowski's novels and poetry might find some interest in this movie to all others I would recommend sitting beer at hand while looking in the mirror.".

So it seemed an odd choice to direct a movie like this but it turns out to be a very refreshing and welcome take at The Bukowsky Case.Essentially this film is about the despairs of alcoholism frighteningly brought to life by an array of simply stunning performances. Matt Dillon as Henry Chinasky is literally sweating alcohol. His face is red and swollen he looks absolutely horrible. Once handsome but now an absolute hasbeen who's sole interests are booze gambling sex and writing. People don't interest him at all including the women sex is all that interests him if only mildly. Lily Taylor is a perfect match as his female interest and fellow barfly. But the real kudos are for Marisa Tomei in a relatively minor role but she really burns off the screen alcohol set on fire. A real treat.It might not be a typical Bukowskimovie in the sense of his sometimes brash aggressive perhaps even typical direct American style so fans of his work might judge this movie very differently and perhaps argue this is not the real spirit of Bukowsky put to the screen. But director Hamer handles it with such warmth humor sly wit and at times very sharp observations that you really shouldn't care about this. Judge it on its own merits.Camera Obscura  910".

Luckily the dark humor remains consistently good until the end and that certainly keeps the attention.Although I'm not a huge fan of Matt Dillon I do consider him perfect for this role. He's playing this extremely sarcastic man with an air of arrogance and cynicism. I didn't know he had that side in him but in Factotum he certainly is proving that he has.

	schema:headline " A Quantum Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Factotum is a quantum movie. Or rather in its efforts to depict the chaotic life of radical writer Charles Bukoska's autobiographical alter ego Henry Chinaski the paradoxes and inherent uncertainties of quantum theory seem an apt metaphor.Hank like Bukowska is a dedicated alcoholic drifting indifferently through any odd jobs he can con his way into then disdainfully neglect until he is inevitably 'canned' spend the payoff on booze and then ricochet randomly off to repeat the process elsewhere. It is as if like the theory through his alcoholic haze Hank sometimes has an idea of where he's going but isn't really clear where he actually is. Alternatively he sometimes has sense of where he is but none at all of where he's going. Like a particle with no discernible fixed identity he bounces randomly around the world colliding with people places and events of which he is part but in which he makes no stable intentional intervention and to which he displays no discernible interest. This process is constantly refuelled by a 247 intake of alcohol and nicotine. If this sounds incredible then we should remember that the real Bukowska's body survived this punishing regime for 74 years until his death in 1994.If this were all then Norwegian Director Bent Hamer's film would not be the absorbing work that it is. For through this fog of alcohol shines the dim light of Hank's determination to write. Not in the least for its rewards or recognition but because it forms the nucleus of his fragile identity. And through the excellent use of Hank as narrator the stark clinical austere quality of Bukowski's writing emerges. This is the poetry of skid row the unsentimental unflinching account of life at the margins of normal society about which Hank is entirely indifferent and Bukowsa himself viewed with contempt. There is a brief doomed flirtation with the idea that we might have some control over our destiny through Hank's initially successful foray into betting the horses. Racing I guess offers the illusion that even if God plays with dice with a bit of determined effort a man might beat the odds. Of course this ends in failure  the house always wins in the end.The paradox of quantum theory is that the precise and rigorous lucidity of the language of science expresses a view of the world of matter that is devoid of certainty and inherently rests upon mere probabilities. Similarly Hank's island of lucidity is the drive to write to create a meaningful response to a meaningless world. His behaviour is as random and unpredictable as the chaotic senseless events of the world that provoke it. Yet an urge to coherence emerges through his irresistible drive to write about that world. He has simple appetites alcohol nicotine and sex and no moral emotional scruple gets in the way of satisfying them. He is drawn into transitory friendships and fragile sexual relationships by the basic need to drink smoke and have sex. The only relationship he has with any semblance of continuity and personal satisfaction is with fellow alcoholic Jan.They share these basics needs and arrive at a kind a stable modus vivendi where they are fully met without having to wander about the world hoping to pick them up in a run down bar. Jan's predilection for leaping into bed with every random bum she takes a fancy to the dirtier the better eventually fractures this sexofconvenience arrangement. Here Hank packs his bag and leaves with the air of a guy popping out for a night's bowling rather than walking away from the only halfway stable relationship he's ever had. This fictional account mirrors Bukowska's own 10 year relationship with Janet CooneyBaker also a longterm alcoholic who eventually lost her fight with the booze in 1962.Hank lives in a downbeat deadbeat world where his holy trinity of physical appetites are the only distraction from that world to which he is always by choice an outsider. The film is visually and aurally dark in tone. Yet through this Hamer's screenplay leaning I suspect heavily on Bukowska's own writing cuts clinically and strikingly like a surgeon's knife making an incision to open up to the unflinching eye the diseased or damaged part of life that may need surgical repair or excision. This is writing honed to a razorsharp edge that is simply startling and despite inducing a sense of recoil exercises a strange fascination. If I have a regret it is that more might have been made of the occasional moments of darkly ironic humour flashing like flinty sparks out of the sheer absurdity of the many irredeemably hopeless situations Hank stumbles into. I don't now Bukowska's work but occasionally in this film Hank's blurred perspective seems to be a weary so what? in response to the world at others there is a flash of rebellion that engages us much more.If there is much of Hank Chinaski to like we find it here.Matt Dillon is a revelation and has never for my money done anything remotely in this league before. Lili Taylor is equally convincing as bed and bottlemate Jan and even manages to tease a kind of pathetic tenderness out of the role. Marisa Tomei is effective as one of Hank's random ricochet lays who is locked into a very weird foursome with two female friends and an older man who manipulates sex from all three by funding their booze and basic needs.Factotum is no nice night out at the movies. Its darkness is as heavy as it context would imply. Yet it is constantly absorbing and thoughtprovoking. It is immensely successful in portraying the world and experience of an autobiographical character based upon a writer both Jean Genet and JeanPaul Sartre called America's greatest poet This 'factotum' jackofalltrades late in his writing life by all accounts became master of one. Offthewall inthegutter but cinematically onthemoney.Zettel".

	schema:reviewBody "Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear is another realistic artistic and excellent work. I did not really like the film being in English but obviously it wouldn't have been possible in Hindi or Bengali considering it's about a Shakespearean actor. The story was compelling and interesting and the idea of taking an old Shakespearean theatre actor Bachchan and casting him in a motion picture is intelligent. Not less impressive is that despite the film being entirely about Bachchan all the other characters are wellwritten. Every character is portrayed as a struggling person. In his way to become a film actor we meet several characters through Bachchan's Harry his costar Shabnam Zinta a modelturnedactress who does not know how to act and what to do with her film career and who has problems with her jealous husband Siddharth Rampal an arrogant independent filmmaker Vandana Shah Bachchan's mistress doublemeaning and his confused nurse played by Divya Dutta. I think the film was well written although it does become a bit slow at times. Harry's character is wonderful  an artist who insists to work on his own artistic terms. I liked Bachchan's scenes I liked the scenes of the three women who have a nice evening on the day of the film's release I liked the scenes of Bachchan and Zinta together their conversations about what acting is. Bachchan is extraordinary  one of his finest and most difficult performances ever. He is intense generous impulsive and his English line delivery is spectacular. The film belongs to him completely although the rest of the cast do a good job. Preity Zinta is extremely vulnerable as Shabnam. She lets go of her bubbly vivacious image completely and is portrayed as a very depressed woman throughout. And although she gives a fine and very sincere performance I don't find it any better than in her commercial films  I generally prefer her in roles of vibrant and strong women who are full of life and happiness because that's what she is. Anyway I liked the scenes in which she smoke anxiously I liked the scene in which Bachchan teaches her how to release tensions by screaming and she breaks down this scene has appeared several times in different films and she was particularly impressive in the film's last scene. Shefali Shah turns in a brilliant exceptional performance not that I expected any less from her. Arjun Rampal and Divya Dutta are very good as well. I knew from the very beginning that this film would not work for the wide audience it's a film for people who like artistic films and festival stuff. This is not a particularly entertaining film but I enjoyed it mainly due to Bachchan's performance.".

That makes it sound as if you're going to get Prithvirraj Kapoor in MughuleAzam  but Amitabh's character Harish MishraHarry not AB is himself something of a scenerychewer and in fact in The Last Lear he gives a nuanced performance of maybe the best character I've seen him play in this career phase and maybe ever.Most coincidentally  the current New Yorker Magazine  Nov. 19 2007  has an article The Player Kings about this kind of biggerthanlife Shakespeare guyOrson Welles and Laurence Olivier.It's wonderful to see major Bollywood stars take on straight acting roles in English. And for some time I hoped Preity Zinta cast as Shabnam an actress Harry's costar in the film he is making would be given something like this to do that used the mature intensity I thought I saw in her. Importantly and fascinatingly to me The Last Lear takes the 75yearold Harish Mishra and us eventually and starkly into some of the themes of King Lear not that you have to know the play to be affected by his performance as a retiredwithdrawn Shakespearean stage actor in Calcutta persuaded to take his first film role by Siddarth the hotshot young director played by Arjun Rampal.I'd say it's only in the last maybe 20 minutes of the movie that you might start having a cascade of recognitions about the Lear themes here. This guy is irritable and cranky  plenty of scorn for the movies heaped on Arjun  but also wise loving and fully responsive to life. In a great scene on an outdoors shoot in the mountains you see true delight replace bluster when the old actor on a film set for the first time catches on to the filmmaker's way of using shots of unguarded conversation to compose his story.What makes this powerful old guy verge on boorish in one situation  he declaims Prospero's big speech about his mastery of the spirits to the back of the house in his own smallish living room to teach Arjun something or other  makes him a wise counsellor for his costar Preity in the next when he uses what he knows about both life and art to push the unhappy and inexperienced young film actress to shout her anger out to the faraway mountain top and we can feel and see her grief unlock and blood start to flow.The movie begins explosively on the Diwali when the film is having its opening with a fight in a fancy flat between Preity Harry's film costar and a man she lives with who is hectoring her offensively about where she's going. She's going to visit Harry instead of attending her premiere and he now some kind of invalid. Her character is strong and selfpossessed somebody a woman would want for a real friend. She's also somewhat bottled up.In the course of a long night with fireworks in the background Shabnam Shefali Shetty as Vandana Harish's longtime companion and Divya Dutta as Ivy the night nurse form a world in Harry's old Calcutta flat furnished like the home of a London stage actor at midcentury and the story leading up to the accident on a filmshoot in the mountains unfurls along with their own stories.The backstory scenes of Siddarth and Harry meeting in Harry's flat quoting Shakespeare and bonding over watching guys relieve themselves against the wall outside on the closedcircuit TV Harry has installed are comical and moving.As the night goes on  it's really a night of metabolization of what has happened  the night nurse is fired and then offered tea and she's agitatedly trying to get hold of a boyfriend who like Shabnam's man is a persecutory entitled jerk full of offensive accusations and the two older women  try hard talk her out of submitting to him.By dawn when Preity crosses the threshhold into Amitabh's room I think you start to get it about his tragic flaw  I am not spoiling things if I tell you it has to do with his pride  as well as the flaws in someone he's trusted  that's ended him up in a tragic situation and thus you're prepared for the brilliant full emotional finish that follows.One thing I'd hope for from another viewing is a better understanding of what's going on with a shocking decision made by Arjun's character.I haven't said much about Shefali and Divya but they are wonderful. Vandana is loving loyal angry exasperated  if the spirit of Cordelia is in the story it's distributed between her and Shabnam Divya is adorable  she supplies a comic presence  and touching as a girl who probably can't help going down a tube she's been warned about off into her own tragedy in the name of love.I hope the actors found this first Englishlanguage movie as rewarding to make as I found it to watch at a film festival but I also hope this finds theatre release in Englishspeaking places  if it doesn't that will be a tragedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just over a year ago I had heard about this movie and that it was being released. But then nothing happened. Then finally it has been released and it was worth it. Ritupatrna Ghosh has done what no other director has done since Aparna Sen released 36 Chowringhee Lane in the early 1980's  a movie with Bollywood stars in English mixed in with some Hindi and Bengali.An ageing Shakespearean stage actor Harish Mishra quits acting a week before he is to due to give a performance of his life in William Shakespeare's King Lear. But then a movie director persuades him to work in his film and once the filming starts the ageing stage actor trains his co  star in pitching her voice.Starring Amitabh Bachchan Preity Zinta Arjun Rampal Shefali Shah Divya Dutta and Jishu Sengupta this is one movie that can be considered to a speciality one. Aparna Sen's style of direction has been applied here in the most effective manner for a movie. It gives one the feeling that they are watching a Shakespeare drama on a screen and I am saying this from my own experience in not just studying some of the bard's dramas but also having acted in one many years back. The director has taken all the efforts in portraying the characters in the rightful manner related to a Shakespeare drama that unfolds and does not have a dull moment ever.It can be said that this is Amitabh Bachchan's best performance  not that it needs to be mentioned. He truly shows what acting is all about and his versatility as an actor can clearly be seen.What made this movie so interesting besides the Shakespeare side of it is that its starts off from an intriguing and inquisitive point and then through the back flashes everything unfolds. This is not a typical Bollywood style movie with songs and a dance troupe or with all sorts of glitz and glamour but it is a simple story which is enjoyable for those who enjoy Shakespearean style acting.Conclusion A movie that is most definitely worth watching but not so if one does not fancy watching something that does not have songs etc and more so if one doesn't like Shakespeare.".

Over the last period or so quite very often nowadays I have begun taking notice of the fact that along with the usual plagiarized concept of movies and the typical trend setting commercial Indian entertainers which when once appears seems to come in a chain or pattern one after the other with the same level of thoughts and stuffs comes some outstanding masterpieces comparable to the best of World Cinema and compete with the classics of the past and present. Are we having a dearth of talent in terms of versatility in Indian Cinema when it comes to direction and movie making? Well the answer is certainly a big NO! HOW? Well How about some movies that include taaren zameen par a WednesdayMumbai meri jaan and now add to that..The Last Lear.I haven't sent much of Rituparno Ghosh's work but I have labeled him as a talented filmmaker but after seeing The Last Lear I believe first I have to applaud him and then label him as one of the best directors in the country at the moment.It was simply exceptional.I would never had thought that such a movie would ever be made after the days of Satyajit Ray. I was literally in awe of the performances and also the story. I have a taste for movies of every genre and I can separate quality from crap but when it comes to making of a movie as The Last Lear and watching Dr. Amitabh Bachchan give a performance of a lifetime I just didn't know how to separate quality from quality.Amitabh Bacchan as we all know is a versatile actor and is a mark of greatness in the Indian Film Industry.Along with the likes of Nasseruddin Shah Paresh RawalAnupam Kher Om Puri he has been the pillar of strength only and only in terms of pure acting talent and when it comes to role personification and giving powerful performances.When we talk of acting we generally think of delivering or presenting the role of a character of a story in front of the audience and playing the character in the most skillful manner possible so that more than anything else the viewers gets to know the character and the character sells the movie to all.But nowadaysit's the actor who consumes or engulfs the character and not the other way round and sells himself and not the character. Almost everyone does that.When we look at a movie we see a Shah Rukh Khan or an Aamir Khan or Hrithik Roshan or Rani or Preity etc not the characters.In the last learafter a long long time that I see the character of the movie Harish and not Amitabh Bacchan because what Amitabh did was he became Harish and was not seen anywhere as the personality that he is.Amitabh Bachchan was at his imperious best.The direction and plot was outstanding and the movie was so well conceived that it just grabs you like anything. Right from the beginning when we know not as what has happened when slowly till the time Jishu senguptathe protagonist brings light towards the events that takes the movie forward and enter the characters one by one. First Preity Zinta was very good.Portraying Shabnam an actress troubled with her marriage and personal life who decides to take a visit at Harish's residence who is dying on the day when his first movie is being premiered.Arjun Rampal meanwhile contemplates some thought that worries him.Soon we get to see the whole plot unveil itself and what exactly happens in it. How amitabh Bachchan a man who was once a stage actor and used to play the characters of the different plays of Shakespeare being completely obsessed with Shakespeare and still lives in the lines of the plays gets to first meet Jishu and then Arjun rampal. How arjun convinces Amitabh to act in his directorial venture in a film and how the relationship between him and AmitabhHarishHarrydevelops as between two friends and also between a director and an actor.Also unfolds other strong relationships between ShabnamPreity and Harish. The scenes describing the shooting of the Film the colourful events during the shooting and also the how the film reaches its climax through the film's description.The story of the plot unfolds is narrated both by the protagonist Jishu and Preity Zinta who meets Shefali Chhayadaughter of Harish.The events in the house of Harish that take place in between the scenes of preity Shefali and Divya Duttathe nurse are also quite realistic and well crafted.The small events in Harish's house when he first meets Jishu for an interview about Neeraj marked the introduction of Amitabh in the Plot and it was fabulous.How Harry watches everything from the window outside and scorns the public for anything he sees wrong. From the first lines that he shouts Idiot to the mocking of the people who litters on his boundary walls is just amazing. The way Harry suddenly breaks into the Shakespeare characters time and again is superb. The ending of the movie is so very touchy and awesome that the character of Harry just consumes one. The technicalities of the movie were brilliant.The camerawork background score and editing was fascinating.What really impressed me the most was the cinematography. The way small stories within the major plot take place is also so beautifully crafted. I won't reveal the plot anymore though I 've already spoken a lot but what I can say is a masterpiece has been produced.If anyone is interested in watching genuinely good movies as this one please watch it and if you like it write your comment here.I don't think it'll be very different from that of mine.Simply exceptional".

I have a taste for movies of every genre and I can separate quality from crap but when it comes to making of a movie as The Last Lear and watching Dr. Amitabh Bachchan give a performance of a lifetime I just didn't know how to separate quality from quality.Amitabh Bacchan as we all know is a versatile actor and is a mark of greatness in the Indian Film Industry.Along with the likes of Nasseruddin Shah Paresh RawalAnupam Kher Om Puri he has been the pillar of strength only and only in terms of pure acting talent and when it comes to role personification and giving powerful performances.When we talk of acting we generally think of delivering or presenting the role of a character of a story in front of the audience and playing the character in the most skillful manner possible so that more than anything else the viewers gets to know the character and the character sells the movie to all.But nowadaysit's the actor who consumes or engulfs the character and not the other way round and sells himself and not the character. Almost everyone does that.When we look at a movie we see a Shah Rukh Khan or an Aamir Khan or Hrithik Roshan or Rani or Preity etc not the characters.In the last learafter a long long time that I see the character of the movie Harish and not Amitabh Bacchan because what Amitabh did was he became Harish and was not seen anywhere as the personality that he is.Amitabh Bachchan was at his imperious best.The direction and plot was outstanding and the movie was so well conceived that it just grabs you like anything. Right from the beginning when we know not as what has happened when slowly till the time Jishu senguptathe protagonist brings light towards the events that takes the movie forward and enter the characters one by one. First Preity Zinta was very good.Portraying Shabnam an actress troubled with her marriage and personal life who decides to take a visit at Harish's residence who is dying on the day when his first movie is being premiered.Arjun Rampal meanwhile contemplates some thought that worries him.Soon we get to see the whole plot unveil itself and what exactly happens in it. How amitabh Bachchan a man who was once a stage actor and used to play the characters of the different plays of Shakespeare being completely obsessed with Shakespeare and still lives in the lines of the plays gets to first meet Jishu and then Arjun rampal. How arjun convinces Amitabh to act in his directorial venture in a film and how the relationship between him and AmitabhHarishHarrydevelops as between two friends and also between a director and an actor.Also unfolds other strong relationships between ShabnamPreity and Harish. The scenes describing the shooting of the Film the colourful events during the shooting and also the how the film reaches its climax through the film's description.The story of the plot unfolds is narrated both by the protagonist Jishu and Preity Zinta who meets Shefali Chhayadaughter of Harish.The events in the house of Harish that take place in between the scenes of preity Shefali and Divya Duttathe nurse are also quite realistic and well crafted.The small events in Harish's house when he first meets Jishu for an interview about Neeraj marked the introduction of Amitabh in the Plot and it was fabulous.How Harry watches everything from the window outside and scorns the public for anything he sees wrong. From the first lines that he shouts Idiot to the mocking of the people who litters on his boundary walls is just amazing. The way Harry suddenly breaks into the Shakespeare characters time and again is superb. The ending of the movie is so very touchy and awesome that the character of Harry just consumes one. The technicalities of the movie were brilliant.The camerawork background score and editing was fascinating.What really impressed me the most was the cinematography. The way small stories within the major plot take place is also so beautifully crafted. I won't reveal the plot anymore though I 've already spoken a lot but what I can say is a masterpiece has been produced.If anyone is interested in watching genuinely good movies as this one please watch it and if you like it write your comment here.I don't think it'll be very different from that of mine.Simply exceptional";

An intriguing movie in typical Ghosh style where people quietly sit and talk and the narration is by means of flashbacks. The story is that of an ageing and ailing stage actor being persuaded to act in a movie which happens to be his last and has been left in a coma as the aftereffects of the shooting. Idiosyncratic vain impetuous he is occasionally lashing out at the modern world and using too much of Shakespearean verses in normal conversation. Though AB looks funny in the poster he looks amazing in the movie and has delivered an intense performance. Preity Zinta's role is her most unbubbly one and her English dialogues are only slightly better than the rest of the cast in which case they sound like recitals. Out and out an AB film.

The spoiltsport is the content itself which fails to connect. Too many flashbacks hamper the narrative. The screenplay could have been sleek and execution more taut. Yes there are many layers to the characters in the movie but a few of them unwarranted leading to overkill. Two is a party and three is a crowd thereby onetoone conversation between Preity  Shefali would have been apt. Divya Dutta's character was unwarranted perhaps forced to drive the message of domestic violence and abuse. Unlike others from the same clan I expected Rituparno to be secular but guess he succumbs to blowing the trumpet. Too many Bengali references and unnecessary mouthing dialogues in Bengali. O.

	schema:headline " Tragedy and The Lear";
	schema:reviewBody " Tragedy in the form of King Lear's play is not new to Shakespeare fans. However  Rituparno used King Lear as a character sought to be played by Harish Amitabh  a veteran stage actor primarily on Shakespeare's plays. However the basic crux of the film The Last Lear is neither about Shakespeare primarily nor King Lear. So what was it all about ? Well here you go  1. Dying Art form and the desire to perform one last time  Harish played by Amitabh is an ex stage artist on Shakespeare's plays. He now lives a retired life in unknown alleys in Kolkata along with his live in partner 'Vandana' Shefali Chaya. Harish is a purist who had a last desire to perform the lead role of the tragedy King Lear however his past did not allow him to play it. Hence there is a fire in his belly to perform Lear which will never come as films today have killed stage plays. Hence Harish hates films and differs to agree it as an art form. The film moves on where 'Siddharth'Arjun Rampal offers him a script of a character known as 'Maqbul' once a renowned skillful clown who goes jobless because of invasion of TV in life of kids commits a crime and absconds.' Maqbul' then lives in the hilly slopes secluded looking for a perfect opportunity to run away from life and Police. The character of 'Maqbul' reciprocates that of Harish himself and he agrees to play the lead role in his first film. 2. Women  Like most Rituparno films Women play a pivotal role in the The last Lear. There is a common facet here viz. Men taking Women as a moral right to bully and try to control them. The film shows the same act of bully with the nurse of Harish with the coactress 'Shabnam' with 'Vandana' as Harish's live in partner. This flow is shown in common across the society. 3. Tragedy  King Lear divides his property among his daughter and ultimately becomes insane in strange circumstances. 'Maqbul' too is tragic who falls from a cliff while escaping Police in the climax and so does Harish who refuses to take a dummy action lead and dictates to do the last climax of Maqbul himself and get's his backbone fractured. 4. Film within Film  Maqbul's story drives the main film. There is a film within a film. Harish is basically 'Maqbul' in some ways. 5. Confusion and gaps in contemporary Indian film production  Its diwali when the film finally premieres. This is not strategic but due to a planning blunder. Siddharth the director does not want to meet media The lead Heroine Shbanam Preity Zinta runs away to Harish as he is bedridden and overall the lead 'Maqbul' is missing too. However I would be candid in saying that this is a very complex film and if someone does not like Shakespeare much he would be bogged down by the numerous dialogues which the film uses. See this film if you love Amitabh and just admire the acting skills of him. For sure it's also one of the best performances by Arjun Rampal as the young director. Rituparno did a great job but this for me is not his best work but definitely in his top 10. As I leave you in the wonderful world of the clown Maqbul and his dying arts I ask you all how will you fell if you give 30 years to a profession and excelled in it but just to realize that today your expertise is history a null and void past. What you would have done if you were HarishMaqbul ? Would you have taken a second chance to do your best  one last time ? If yes then you too are the Lear ! ".

	schema:reviewBody "Surf Nazis Must Die is one of the best films to be distributed by Troma and sadly one of the least appreciated. The IMDb voters who briefly put the film in the bottom 100 should be strapped down and forced to watch Driving Miss Daisy until they come to their senses. I even disagree with the reviewers who lump the film in the so bad it's good category. I think Surf Nazis Must Die is simply good.In comparison to many of its low budget contemporaries the writing in SNMD is positively Shakespearian. The film has some semblance of a plot the jokes are actually funny and the action is well paced. Most surprisingly the film has a bizarre feelgood quality which could almost be described as wholesome if you look past the violence sex and foul language. This is largely due to film's sympathetic heroine the awesome Eleanor Washington who vows to singlehandedly take out the members of an evil beach gang the titular surf Nazis after they kill her beloved son.In addition to Eleanor the film's minor characters also have a lot to offer. Smeg's relationship with his mother is hilarious and the surf Nazis are wonderfully tasteless with members being named after Nazi luminaries. The director makes several very obvious references to A Clockwork Orange but despite their eye makeup and swastikas these gang members are about as chilling as the Goonies.The inevitable bloodshed is rather low key and the gore effects are simplistic at best. However the innovative use of hooks and speedboats more than makes up for any lack of carnage. Unlike many zero budget action films SNMD does not rely on blood splatter or gratuitous sex to pass the time  which under normal circumstances I would consider to be a huge failing. However SNMD is generally in such poor taste and overflows with sardonic humour to the point where the film becomes utterly irresistible.Surf Nazis Must Die is a brilliantly conceived beach holocaust dramarevenge thriller that you can enjoy with the entire family. Forget about the low IMDb rating and brace yourself for this evocative masterpiece.".

However SNMD is generally in such poor taste and overflows with sardonic humour to the point where the film becomes utterly irresistible.Surf Nazis Must Die is a brilliantly conceived beach holocaust dramarevenge thriller that you can enjoy with the entire family. Forget about the low IMDb rating and brace yourself for this evocative masterpiece.";

No the reason that Surf Nazis doesn't live up to its brilliant title is that it isn't outrageous enough. It's far too tame for a Troma film as far as I'm concerned. When I first heard about this movie I was psyched up to see it. Why? Because when you think Surf Nazis Must Die in conjunction with the name Troma Films you just expect something completely twisted...full of sex gore and sick humor. You know...a TROMA movie. But the bulk of this movie just doesn't live up to the expectation that I had.This is atypical Troma and not even all Troma fans will appreciate it. But hey I guess it's not that bad. But with a title like Surf Nazis Must Die Troma should have done better.".

Lloyd Kaufman is a brilliant man creating a company that is entirely based around camp horror with humor most of them with talented actors or untalented ones just for old time's sake and distributed them out to filmfans. You can tell a film is a Troma film if it includes the following 1 Bmovie actors although they do have SOME well known celebs in their films 2 Overthetop gore and violence not disturbing more nasty and disgusting but for humorous purposes.3 Kinky sex scenes filled with softcorn porn Lesbian interaction outrageous sexjokes 4 Virtually no plot. But a hilarious title for the film.When I heard about Surf Nazis Must Die I probably jumped three feet in the air for joy. I mean what else do you want? Surfing Nazis a angry Black woman TROMA?!? It should be the PERFECT Troma film! Unfortunately this particular film makes you wonder why Kaufman didn't kick director Peter George in the teeth after seeing the final cut of the film. In the end the only thing the film succeeds in being a good Troma movie is the title...thats it.Well where do we start? There's virtually no plot. I know I know I wasn't expecting On the Waterfront but come on...even The Toxic Revenger had somewhat of a plot and if not over the top violence...this had nothing. The story set somewhere in the future at least the 80'searly 90's version of the future where tiedye shirts are still in style apparently where an Earthquake has destroyed most of the California coast line ummm...ooook. Out of the chaos surfing gangs begin a war to stake claim over the beach. One of the most ruthless gangs is....OK is that obvious? The surf Nazis. The Nazis are really just a bunch of scraggly lookin' white supremacists who wear tethered clothing with poorly drawn swastikas written on them. Adolf is the leader...hmm clever. He looks like he's about 40 years old but hangs out with high school kids. The others are Eva Sneg Gangdala and Hook and none of them have any back story althought for some odd reason they try to portray Sneg as being some dumb naive teenager with a mother who is worried about him in some pointless subplot. Adolf tries to unite all the gangs on the beach so they can rule the coastline a plot line ripped off of the farmore superior film The Warriors but none of them want to be under the command of the Nazis so one by one they turn on them and are killed...end of that story. Now there's a young man named Leroy with his toughasnails mother who live near the beach. Leroy being black is attacked by the Nazis and killed. This leads Leroy's Momma to escape from her retirement home and seek revenge against the murderers.I basically told you the entire flick. It's that basic and small. You probably get more out of watching the trailer for the film than watching the actual film. The violence is surprisingly toned down with virtually no gore which makes it look like a film made over the weekend at a budget of 75 dollars. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed looking like they improvised it at the set. The acting...eh it's alright. One thing I noticed is that they tried to make this film look more serious than campy...which is the kiss of death being that the film is called....SURF Nazis MUST DIE!!! Oh thats another thing...it's called SURF Nazis MUST DIE but in the film only three of them are actually killed out of a gang of about 7 not including the youth punks. Scenes were long and boring with very little pay off. The surfing scenes were nice though. Obviously it was footage of professionals surfing in Hawaii California does NOT have that nice of waves and most of the film was shot in my home town of Huntington Beach.It you wanna watch a good Troma movie watch Tromeo  Juliet or Cannibal! The Musical! instead. Leave this one to wipeout and hang to dry.".

Go pay your seven or fifteen bucks and plop down at the local cinemark because if you don't stuff like this it just isn't for you.But if you can take a joke then the thing is interesting. I haven't seen a bunch of Troma's catalogue but I think it is one of the more memorable flicks there it certainly isn't Tromeo and Juliet or Terror Firmer but I don't understand the claim that it isn't a typical Troma film. At least it wasn't something like Outlaw Prophet which put Troma on a blacklist with my wife. It was a genuine trash film and taken as such seems as good as any other work of trash.What makes this movie good is the fact that the kids have all given themselves new names a fact that comes up when Smeg is talking to his mom who claims he shouldn't call her mom. That is just choice.Or the fact that the Nazis are all queens in hiding. I like the not so subtle homoeroticism.Of course not only could both of these elements been mobilized more effectively but there are other things it could have hit on. The apocalyptic oil pumping could have been used better along with placing Leroy as part of the energy company pumping the beach dry. I was hoping that the fact that there is a big disjunction between the bourgeoisie expectations of Leroy and the ludicrous turf wars of the surf gangs could have been put to better use.So to all you people who didn't like this because of the film making you are just wrong. This is what good ol' not so Hollywood film looks like. Like all real films it's flaws are that it doesn't exploit everything that it could.".

Until I saw the page for Surf Nazis Must Die. Granted the IMDb itself doesn't do these reviews the users do. But for this film to be on the IMDb bottom 100 is quite telling. This film is hands down and without any question a masterpiece. Anyone that fails to see that just flatout does not understand film.This isn't a so bad it's good film. This is straightup an amazing film filled with awesome cinematography great action and some straightup weirdness that propels the story along. The story itself is very simple nazi gang wants to own the beaches they fight gangs and a black woman gets her revenge on them. VERY simple. A less talented director would've wrapped up the whole story in 30 minutes or filled it the brim with boring filler. However what the talented Peter George does is tell the story in a very slow and deliberate fashion. Instead of focusing on intense action sequences for the whole film the movie slowly builds to them. He usually packs the events up until then with surf nazi propaganda and shots of surfing surfing from the actual actors this is not stock footage!. And believe it or not it's all hugely entertaining. He fills the film with very little dialogue so what is there leaves a huge impression on the audience.It's a difficult film to understand completely especially as I'm not a surfer. Mr. George took a very simple concept and decided to play it up like it's this amazing event surfers who actually would kill over their beaches. The acting is very underrated and there actually is very little comedy deliberate or otherwise here. The only real comedy is the fat black woman who is the hero of the film she is so ridiculous yet I am guessing this is some kind of social satire a fat black woman going after Adolf leader of the Nazis who said that skinny blondehaired blueeyed men were the master race. The film is beautifullyshot with tons of footage of the skies and the beaches and the pacing is very good. Not too much action not too much mindless chatter. Another good point is the music. The score really fits the film.This is a straightup good film. My girlfriend who typically dislikes BMovies even thought this film was gorgeous and awesome. In a lot of ways this reminds me of Six String Samurai a very simple and kind of ridiculous story told through the use of overacting vibrant colors gorgeous cinematography amazing editingdirecting and lots of good music. Absolutely an art film and a wellmade one at that. Anyone that dislikes this film just flatout doesn't understand what makes movies great.".

As a regular lowbudget piece it uses its thousands of dollars reasonably well. Unlike a whole lot of other films made by Troma this one isn't shot by incompetent simians throwing crap up onto a wedgie board to decide the next shot. Hell the actors even kind of try to give some decent performances. The only problem happens when George and his cowriter try and make a solid story out of their material surfing Nazis taking over the territory from rival ethnic gangs. Maybe there shouldn't be much of a story to expect but there could be more either as an actual deranged work of real craft and structure or as a goforbroke guilty pleasure.On the latter part the filmmakers don't even live up to the cheesy promise of the poster the only time one sees some death on the waves occurs in the climax and it's more like a much better version of the climax of I Spit on Your Grave saying much better is indeed a compliment in any regard as it's the worst film ever made. Mostly it's just shots of regular surfing mostly in what looks like soso stock footage and then the action which isn't quite as much as you might expect taking place in other areas between the Nazis and other gang members. This isn't to say the filmmakers disappoint with camp value all the way far from it the highlight is Gail Neely as the Mama of Leroy a black youth killed by the Nazis who goes to exact her revenge on a motorcycle after going through a gun shop like Tuco in GBU. Seeing her is almost worth the price of the DVD.But at the same time there isn't quite enough crazy action to justify the sloppy storyline. There's some interest in the power games between Mengele and Adolph and seeing one of the Nazis Smeg being harranged by his mother at home like a typical nag and a few other things yet most of the plot doesn't hinge on the Nazis or gangs as much as the Mama in her Punisher mode. It's almost the kind of flick that could make an ambitious remake maybe with actual hardcore surf kills and with a plot out of the Warriors but as it is a curiosity veering on being an actual good movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was surely one of the strangest goodbad movies ever. It has lots of surfing a little Kung Fu fighting a ridiculous villain and one kick ass lady! It isn't complex and doesn't have a story arc or anything and it may be too simplistic for some but I found it rather incredibly hard to follow thanks to the bizarre editing as well as every single one of the snoozeinducing scenes with the Surf Nazis which were nighon incomprehensible. They were so loud and annoying it was like they were a bunch of random people doing extremely amateur community theatre on the beach rather than coming off as actual actors! They didn't have a speck of personality between them and even though they were meant to be this big tough ruthless gang who didn't have any problems handling other surfer gangs they were easily overpowered by one vigilante oldster? Whatever! The beaches have become battlefields the waves a warzone... the opening text scrawl so boldly declares.. Mm well nope I'm afraid it's nothing so epic! So near as I could tell the vague and slow as hell plot is that this one aggressive surfer gang who want to control the entire beach of California and all the other gangs because a humongous earthquake has wrecked the city.. That's so lame a beach is a terrible location for a postapocalyptic warzone it just doesn't have the same kind of visual and thematic punch as an inner city ruined ghetto the image of that on a beach just doesn't sit right and makes it hard to suspend your disbelief it feels like it couldn't happen! The setting looks so pretty it makes you wonder why everyone's even fighting at all when there's such a beautiful ocean right there that they could all chill out and have fun in! This oddball excuse for a movie didn't have the budget or panache to pull off such a concept everything looks too dull and cheap. It's an ambitious little flick though gotta give it that.. It's too bad that it's also one that never seems to grasp just how dumb it is if it had opted for a more tongueincheek approach it might have been slightly more wellreceived and have more of a fan base today. As it is I can agree that it's a terrible movie but to me it still wasn't all that bad there were some things that I liked about it a lot. For one thing I loved the beach and all the slow motion footage shots that appear randomly throughout the whole movie the effect to me was very visually positive and strangely uplifting and that's what I took from it. I enjoy the offbeat silly fun vibe more than the actual story to say it has Nazis in the title it's a very light and totally harmless movie it had a certain cute goofy and youthful earnestness about itself. Had I tried to enjoy it purely from a plot standpoint I'd have hated it as much as everyone else seems to. The scene between the Surf Nazi known as Smeg and his mother in the kitchen is very telling I reckon. If it's meant to be a distopian city they're living in then how come Smeg has a nice normal home that he can go to and a tough cookie mother who forces him to stay in his room when he's trying to sneak out? Are the Surf Nazis all just rowdy teens playing nasty crazy games at being Nazis on the beach because there's nothing else to do and there's no law to stop them? I really liked the character of Smeg's mother the actress really did her own thing with her bit part and was a lot of fun in her few scenes. Some of this movie is intriguing but it goes nowhere at all until the coolest mama of all time decides it's time to make a stand! The movie perks up and has a much better final act when she steps up and it stops being just Surf Nazis and finally turns into Surf Nazis Must Die! The character of Mama Washington was the one thing that really made this picture worthwhile for me and was definitely the most memorable thing about it. It was so different and cool to me seeing an old sassy black lady doing action hero stuff not to say they can't or anything but it was sure as hell the first time I'd ever seen that before! She was so funny and entertaining as soon as it showed her and it was at the scene where she's smoking a cigar and playing cards with the other old ladies at the nursing home she was forced to live in and she says I've gotta liven up you bitches! I thought that gal's gonna do something big at some point! The transitional scene is so surreal where she leaps out of nowhere and strongarms one of Nazis you know which one I'm talking about.. So I'm pretty sure that at least some of it was made bad on purpose and it was clearly never made with the intention if being 'great cinema' but overall I found it a fun stupid movie to watch and I think that may have been the whole point and I for one could dig it.

It does not have a serious view of racism or of white supremacist groups or even of children leaving their families for gangs. It just has an angry woman trying to get revenge.

Their films are certainly no masterpieces but some such as Blood Sucking Freaks or Mother's Day are genuinely nasty and others such as The Toxic Avenger are downright hilarious. While Surf Nazis Must Die is certainly not one of the worst movies from Troma Entertainment however it is sadly one of the lesser Troma flicks I've seen. Granted the film is entertaining in a very dumb manner but the focus lies on the 'dumb' here. I am fine with that but I was somehwhat disappointed by the comparatively low level of disgusting gore and tastelessness for a Troma flick.A California beach is ruled by different criminal gangs the most ruthless being the Surf Nazis a gang lead by a guy who calls himself 'Adolf'. When a young black man named Leroy keeps a gang member from stealing an old lady's bag he is brutally murdered by the Surf Nazis. Leroy's Mama however is one tough lady and she is determined to avenge her son's death...The film has its moments but it is often just too stupid to really be enjoyed. The performances are incredibly awful of course but then that's what Troma usually stands for and I do not take this as a flaw in a film like this. I did expect lots of gore sleaze and toilet humor however and these elements were not really present to the extent that I wished for. The film is merely a revenge story with some very lowkey humor. The fact that an elderly lady wipes out an entire gang of Nazis is quite amusing however and the last 15 minutes especially the gory and hilarious showdown are fun enough to make the whole film worthwhile. Still I would have wished for a higher level of tastelessness in the film. It is fun to watch for Troma fans but I'd definitely recommend many other Troma flicks over this one.".

Everything works the photography the acting the pacing and it has that documentary beauty of real life that so few movies have love those window shots where you see small town downtown traffic!. It's historic interest also makes it enjoyable. A kind of poetry pervades this movie that makes it far more effective than the similar To Kill a Mockingbird. Hernandez is pure dignity  character and actor  and Jarman is a most refreshing contrast to today's smartalecky youth. He has a humility that is touching. It is hard to imagine another actor in that role. Is this movie on the side of the angels? Sure. And the black and white poetry saves it.".

Not that it is a bad thing but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world yet I got the feeling it was white society's racism that started it and it spilled over into Negro society until that became his attitude toward everyone.the best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha county actually Oxford Mississippi exactly as Faulkner wrote about it the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing.

	schema:headline " The best Faulkner movie out there of the many that I've seen";
	schema:reviewBody "This is easily the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction that I've ever seen and I've seen several of the most prominent ones. Filmed in Faulkner's hometown of Oxford Mississippi it really captures the feeling of Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County. Intruder in the Dust is not one of Faulkner's best novel but even if it is a clich to say this it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career. It beats Harper Lee's good but simplistic To Kill a Mockingbird fifty feet into the ground I read that one in ninth grade and that's exactly where it belongs. Two of Faulkner's most prominent characters play major parts in the film Gavin Stevens and Lucas Beauchamp. Stevens is probably the single most common character in all of Faulkner's fiction. He's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator because unlike many of his other characters Stevens is a man of logic not emotion at least when he's older. Lucas Beauchamp may be the most prominent of all of Faulkner's black characters he plays a major part in one of Faulkner's outandout masterpieces Go Down Moses unlike all of the other black folks in Yoknapatawpha he refuses to bow down to any white man. He has pride and many in the white population find that an execrable quality in a black man. One day Lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recentlyfired pistol in his possession. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial and everyone's pretty sure that Beauchamp will be lynched before the evening's over or at least the next day as the murder and arrest occurred on a Sunday. Beauchamp on the other hand declares his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses the case seems open and shut. But his young nephew Chick Mallison because Lucas had helped him in the past is willing to help him now.As far as I know no Hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one. Hollywood films rarely persecute the black population but instead prefer to relegate them to servant roles. If you're an African American actor you might as well give up and accept that role as either the mammy the maid the servant or the porter because that's the only way you'll work. In Intruder in the Dust there is to be found one of the most memorable nonporter roles a black actor ever had Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchamp as I described above is no stereotypical character and might have been hard for audiences to accept. Even today black characters are usually simple magical and kind. The recent arthouse hit Far from Heaven is a great example of that. Beauchamp is kind of a jerk and he's very stubborn. Although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel he's not any kind of stereotype. He's a complex human being. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchamp extraordinarily well. I haven't seen the film in a while but he also appears in Robert Aldrich's 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly as well as the cinematic adaptation of Faulkner's final novel The Reivers.All the actors are great in the film. I should also praise quickly Claude Jarman Jr. who has the great role of Chick Mallison. The novel takes place from his point of view and he is the conventional hero of the picture. Jarman is quite an actor he captures the character  who also appears elsewhere in Faulkner's fiction narrating for example events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel The Town perfectly. He would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated John Ford film Rio Grande. The only other film of Clarence Brown's that I've seen is National Velvet quite a different picture than Intruder in the Dust. His job here is exceptional I really have to credit him with capturing Faulkner perfectly. Other famous Faulkner adaptations are too melodramatic The Long Hot Summer filmed in 1958 which I really like despite that or too cold Tomorrow filmed in 1972 which I do not like that coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner. The only other one that really does well according to its source material is Douglas Sirk's great 1958 filming of Pylon really a different sort of Faulkner novel altogether Tarnished Angels. 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Take a look at those faces alongside the entrance to the jail. They're not the faces of Hollywood extras. Somebody in production was really smart to take filming to Oxford Mississippi because you can't get that kind of authenticity from a studio backlot. Scope out the narrow dusty roads the frozen earth beneath and the skeletal trees just barely hanging on. No wonder those faces look hard and unforgiving they're just reflecting the soil from which they spring. Old man Lucas Hernandez better fear for his life but then he springs from that same hard earth.The movie works because it tells a good story that neither preaches nor sentimentalizes and even has some suspense. Old man Lucas is not very likable. He's a victim and we sympathize but he's also haughty and unfriendly. Wisely the script refuses to sweeten him up. That way we're forced to recognize the effects of racism and injustice on even the less sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids dealing directly with racism since that tends to become preachy and less effective. Instead we're shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent man and condemn him to a horrible death. So it's through our common instinct to see justice done that the effects of racism are exposed a much more effective pathway. It also makes the actions of the sheriff and the lawyer more understandable since they are otherwise part of the Jim Crow system.Note how the movie doesn't attack segregation. It's doubtful that old man Lucas would want to mix with whites anyway and there's no hint that even lawyer Stevens Brian wants to cross the color line except to see justice done. No the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future as symbolized by the kid Jarman whose head is not yet filled with notions. He's not exactly friends with Lucas but he has glimpsed the common humanity of being befriended after falling into the frozen creek. The last line of dialogue also shows him siding with his uncle the lawyer instead of his more hidebound parents the dinner table scene is important and easily overlooked. The lawyer might not join a future civil rights march but the kid might. That's the movie's realistically hopeful side.There was a bunch of racially themed movies during this brief 3 year period 194951 The Well No Way Out Home of the Brave Lost Boundaries. Even famously detached MGM got into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately the McCarthy purges in Hollywood put an end to problem films that might not serve Cold War ends. Even so each of these is worth catching up with not only because they're good movies but because even with the passage of 60 years and Jim Crow they're still relevant.".

We attended a week long family reunion at Oxford in July 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie. It still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of Ole Miss. My recollection is of its being a nice little college town that summer but I was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white. I was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had a long way to go. Anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and I would love to know more about that story. Now days Oxford is a larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and I hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years. Juano Hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an Oscar that year but Hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare. One of the best was a PBS treatment of The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so starring Tommy Lee Jones. It really captured the intensity of rural Southern whites that Faulkner wrote so incisively about so often.".

His only hope is to prove his innocence of the crime of murdering one of the Gowrie boys a family klan of five sons led by a father who lost an arm a long time ago as well as his wife. The back story of Lucas the Gowries and the assembling of whites who look more the part of poverty than any other film I've ever seen give this film a heightened sense of realism which is added to by super intelligent overall development. While there is a certain amount of overt racism in the film the real story seems to lie in the faces of all the people the camera catches whether they the people speak any lines or not. The crowd never really turns into the mob that you expect it to which actually makes this movie more interesting and exciting. The film masterfully avoids that drama in order to get at the underlying decency of all the people. This is a must see for Will Geer fans as he plays the skeptical sheriff who brings Beauchamp in near the film's beginning with a crowd already gathering. Set amidst dirt roads rundown farmhouses with an intriguing batch of quicksand that is under a bridge all of which now has probably been paved over Intruder In The Dust is a real look at a life that doesn't exist anymore.".

The crowd never really turns into the mob that you expect it to which actually makes this movie more interesting and exciting. The film masterfully avoids that drama in order to get at the underlying decency of all the people. This is a must see for Will Geer fans as he plays the skeptical sheriff who brings Beauchamp in near the film's beginning with a crowd already gathering. Set amidst dirt roads rundown farmhouses with an intriguing batch of quicksand that is under a bridge all of which now has probably been paved over Intruder In The Dust is a real look at a life that doesn't exist anymore.";

	schema:headline " wonderful and supereffective film about racism";
	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time. The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism. Plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job! Juano Hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South. The crowd could really care less about the detailsthey are just hellbent on a hanging. And despite his commitment to the law the one lawyer in town who has agreed to defend him also assumes he is guilty and doesn't really want to know the truthjust delay the hanging until they could try and convict him and then have a LEGAL hanging! Fortunately a young white man Claude Jarmin begins to wonder about Juano's innocence and begins seeking out the truth. At this point the best character in this wonderful drama is introducedplayed by Elizabeth Patterson the old lady who later played Mrs. Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY. She singlehandedly steals the show as the white person with not only a conscience but the will and determination to stand up for the black man. At one wonderful point in the film a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him but she stands very firm and forces them to back down. There is a lot more to this rather complicated but intelligently written story but I'll leave it to you to see it for yourself. See it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.By the way apparently 1949 was a good year for Hollywood finally addressing race prejudice head on as TwentiethCentury Fox also released Pinkyan equally effective and strong film about racism interracial marriage and even rape! See both films if you can. Unfortunately Storm Warning was also made that year and while it was about the KKK it pulled ALL its punches and the studio held the film two years before finally releasing it.".

He had the support and love of his friends and neighbors both 'white' and 'black' and they rallied around his home and stayed with him.

What stood out for me was the sharp contrast between the dignity of Beauchamp pronounced something like Beecham in the film and his white neighbors' racist vulgarity.Racism informs virtually every white character's motive in this story. Even Chick who was determined to pay Lucas for letting the white boy into his home to dry off after falling into a creek. Lucas refused payment which infuriated Chick who felt insulted by the generosity of a black man. Chick's dedication to exonerating Lucas from a murder was less about finding the truth than scratching this itch to find a way to pay Lucas and balance his inner ledger.Props also go to Elizabeth Patterson as Eunice Habersham the elderly white lady who believed in Lucas and Porter Hall as the onearmed dad of the murder victim. The films' weakest performance was delivered by David Brian. Unfortunately he played one of its pivotal characters Gavin Stevens the lawyer. But he completely lacks any hint of credibility conflict or conviction either as a Southerner or as a lawyer struggling to articulate the whole episode's moral implications for his bigoted white community.".

I suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any Southerner to bear and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES to borrow your use of the upper case iameracing there are many many many places where blacks and white people in the South get along quite well. But to deny the way that black people were and sometimes still are forced to live the conditions and injustices they have had to endure are not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people got along because of genuine affection and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as blacks 'knew their place'. The point of making Juano Hernandez character in film and print a somewhat prickly type not warm and fuzzy was to underscore the fact that bigotry is wrong in and of itself and human rights are just that for everyone regardless of whether we like a particular individual or not. It would do iameracing good to stop denying the existence of racism and the great harm it has done to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that black people among others did not as a rule not an exception receive the benefits of the justice system as evenhandedly as whites. Segregation discrimination and lynching are historical fact. People like iameracing might claim these things were not as widespread as some think and would probably love to exonerate their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be a wonderful thing if iameracing's Southern ancestors if anynever participated in any of the horrible racist actions that mar this country's history and I hope they didn't. If that is so congratulations to them but that fact if true does not erase the fact that others did. And even if the horrible things that were done to blacks in the South and other areas let's not forget the Draft Riots of the Civil War Erawere only half as numerous only a third does that make them any less horrible? Is the murder of ten children the hanging of ten men the sexual assault of ten women any less horrible than the same things happening to a hundred? Iameracing asks us to get the Mississippi Burning chip off of our shoulders before we see Intruder In The Dust well I ask you did the murders of the civil rights activists happen or not? Why should that be forgotten? Forgiven? Maybe. But in order to prevent their recurrence they cannot be forgotten or revised into minor occurrences. The racism that is displayed in Intruder In The Dust is displayed there quite purposely. It is there to make a point. On a cinematically historical level it is also ridiculous for iameracing to discount the racial angle. Any viewer of films that were filmed before the 1960's knows that black actorscharactersextras were usually deliberately cast. To judge from our movie history wars were always fought by middle aged white men There were no black people in the Old West it was possible to walk down a street in a major city and never encounter a black person there were no black hospital orderliestaxi driversclerks salespeople etc. Blacks were almost never cast with regard to a role unless race was a factor. If Falukner and Brown had wanted to tell a simple murder story he probably would not have made the Hernandez character black. Racism exists iameracing. Probably for different reasons I am sure we both wish that it didn't but it does. Wanting things to be the way we would like them to be probably can't be helped but it still does not make them so.".

The black man claims he's innocent but won't tell anyone what really happened even when a white mob starts to gather outside the jail to hang him. I was expecting this film to turn into some courtroom drama about how racism is wrong but it never does that nor does it ever preach. The film simply tells its complicated story and lets the viewer see what's going on and draw the injustice as it plays in front of them. This film really took me off guard as it centers on a lawyer David Brian and his nephew Claude Jarman Jr. who are trying to figure out the truth. The boy owes the black man a debt and decides to try and get him cleared of the murder charges in order to pay him back. This subplot adds a lot of interest to the film and it also adds some rather brutal moments about race and how it is looked at. The n word is thrown around quite often and the film doesn't shy away from the racist undertones and even the lawyer has some racial issues throughout the film. The performances are all very good with Hernandez stealing the film. It's pretty rare to see a black actor get to display so much respect and dignity in such an early film and Hernandez pulls this off wonderfully.".

Striking cinematography and good narrative via flashback take us through the uneasy relationship between the suspect and the son of his lawyer. A still powerful story that predates the Sidney Poitier films of racial prejudice. Porter Hall has a great role as the murdered man's father.

Lucas had helped Chick when he fell into a frozen creek and taught him about something. After a short interview Stevens is certain of Lucas' guilt but Chick returns to hear him out. Lucas directs Chick to his own gun which is different from the murder weapon. Elderly Eunice Habersham Elizabeth Patterson just happens to be in Stevens' office as Chick tries to convince his uncle. Stevens is unconvinced. Chick black servant boy Aleck and Eunice set out to prove Lucas' innocence.Chick's relationship with Lucas is one of those big lessons like Scout in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. He doesn't know that he's learning even while he's learning it. I love the Habersham character. The story also gives a slice of small town Deep South precivil rights era.

Thirteen years before the release of To Kill a Mockingbird this film deals with some of the same issues. Though Mockingbird is a superior film to just about any other film Intruder presents a slightly different view of the public at large. Here racism is just a way of life institutionalized and matter of fact.

He's arrested but it's just a matter of time as everyone in the film seems to acknowledge before he is lynched. Lucas turns to the closest thing he has to a friend a young white boy named Chick Mallison Claude Jarman Jr. Chick together with a friend named Aleck Elzie Emanuel and elderly Miss Eunice Habersham Elizabeth Patterson tries to find out what really happened and save Lucas before he is lynched.Truly wonderful cast. Subtle excellent work from Hernandez. Jarman who had won an Academy Award in his film debut The Yearling is very good here. The real star who steals the show is Elizabeth Patterson as Miss Habersham. I was most familiar with Mrs. Patterson from her work as Mrs. Trumbull the Ricardos' friend and neighbor on I Love Lucy. I don't know how proud she was of this film but she should have been. She gave a terrific performance. Will Geer is also fine as the Sheriff. The only flaw in the cast is David Brian as the loquacious lawyer Uncle John. It's not entirely his fault as his character is written that way. Still over half of the film's speechifying comes from him. Towards the end he was getting on my nerves a little.Thoughtful and effective drama with a surprisingly frank depiction of racism in a time such a topic was rarely addressed in film. When it was it was usually sanitized for public consumption or so as to not alienate Southern moviegoers. It's definitely a film I would recommend everybody check out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Intruder in the Dust 1949 was directed by Clarence Brown The plot was adapted for the screen from a novel by William Faulkner. The scene is Oxford Mississippi which was Faulkner's home town. He knew what he was writing about and what he was writing about was terrible.Juano Hernandez portrays Lucas Beauchamp a proud Black landowner who lives in a society where Black people aren't supposed to be proud. Beauchamp is accused of murdering a white man. There's plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that he did indeed commit the murder.This portrayal of a black man who refused to bow down to prejudice is absolutely brilliant. It was certainly progressive for its time. Very few theaters in the south would even screen it..In situations like this no one expects a trial. Everyone knows that Beauchamp will be lynched. John Gavin Stevens David Brian is Beauchamp's lawyer. Even he thinks Beauchamp is guilty. The best he can hope for is a change of venue. Then if Beauchamp pleads guilty he probably won't be executed. Of course in Oxford that trial may never happen.Claude Jarman Jr. portrays Chick Mallison Stevens' nephew who is determined to save Beauchamp. This isn't a kid detective piece. Chick is brave and intelligent but he can't stand up against a whole town.Elizabeth Patterson plays Miss Eunice Habersham. Miss Habersham is an elderly upper class white woman. She is the bravest person in the movie. A scene in which she confronts the murdered man's brother was the highlight of the film for me.We saw this movie at Rochester's wonderful Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum. It was shown as part of the Reinventing Hollywood series. We were able to see it in 35mm but it will work very well on the small screen.This film was considered very important in its time but it's rarely screened now. It has a very high IMDb rating of 7.7. I think it's even better than that. Find it and see it!".

From the jail cell He tells the town lawyer John Gavin Stevens played by David Brian he didn't do it. So who did and how do they go about figuring who did it? A taut story line that works throughout the film despite the powerful subtext of Southern racism where most citizens would just as soon lynch Lucas Beauchamp.But John Stevens Chick Mallison as played by Claude Jaromon Jr Miss Eunice Habersham played by Elizabeth Patterson and Aleck played by Elzie Emanuel persisted in doing what needed to be done however nervous they might have been doing it. Digging up a grave in 1949 was a serious crime especially if a Black kid AleckElzie Emmanuel was involved. But they persisted and endured.It doesn't hurt that the film is an adaptation of a Faulkner Novel with the same title. Perhaps with black and white cinematography you can't go wrong and they certainly didn't. The tension of the mob sceneno Hollywood extras but native inhabitants of Oxford Mississippi otherwise known as Yoknapatawpha County played for reality and cinma vrit. This film adaptation rightfully belongs in the realm of Classic.While To Kill a Mockingbird seems a modern update of the story the story still is as old as time it would appear. There is a line between white and blackthey can't see us and we don't want to see them. A paraphrase. That was true then and it is still true today. When the Trumpster said ObamaCare was a disaster he meant Obama was a disaster and he was speaking to the David Duke KKK element of racist America that voted for the Trumpster.The movie is available on YouTube and is certainly worth watching.".

Faulkner was a Mississippian and was not your garden variety liberal not even Mississppi's version of liberal. He always blamed slavery for the South's racial problems never the South. And in one of his short stories when a black man is being hustled into a car to be taken off and lynched someone in the crowd interferes and tries to stop it. The black man in the car hysterical with fear lashes out and strikes his wouldbe rescuer. The rescuer belts him back.I'm nobody's idea of a literary scholar but I rather liked Faulkner's early work like Mosquitoes. The writing was precise evocative and often funny. Later on he became wildly experimental and a little glum leaving me somewhere in the dust myself.In any case this story is nothing like the usual Hollywood fare motivated by white guilt and box office. Hernandez' character is proud  too proud. He won't beg for mercy or help. He's too dignified to desire sympathy. He refuses to explain to his lawyer David Brian why or how he came to be standing over a white man shot in the back and holding a smoking pistol. That's taking pride too far. Pride is always impractical but it usually doesn't jeopardize one's life. And Hernandez is no better or worse than any other black man in the South of 1926. He's not Sidney Poitier showing off his discernment and impeccable credentials.The white folks aren't spared either but neither are they denied humanity. Porter Hall is the first redneck peckerwood we get to meet and he looks the part shabby unshaven angry and armed. But he weeps over his murdered son and he is amenable to reason.It's a complicated murder mystery with racial overtones. I don't know why it's not as well known as some of the other films of the period that dealt with prejudice. Clarence Brown and his photographer have included some shots that are almost arty two white hands and two black hands gripping the same bars of a jail cell.I admired it because it depicts a community in which no one is a perfect type of anything a characteristic that is something called verisimilitude because it resembles real life.".

Unfortunately for nonTurkish ppl like most even all of Turkish films many humours in these scenes were lost since mostly attributions are about a life of a very classical and easterner Turkish person and his comments about Turkish social political and cultural life. You will also childish joke scenes which I also didn't enjoy too. I don't know but this must be his way of filming on the contrary his shows never make concessions about quality.Another subject is don't expect a great visual scenes as this is not a Hollywood film which one of the richest governments in the world supports financially on the other hand this is just a Turkish film not the best one which a company accepted to be the sponsor of limitedly.Nevertheless don't get disappointed yet. The film is more than 2 hours and each 5 minutes include at least one thing to laughfor all. Well this is no different indeed for nonTurkish speakers to watch this film or for me to watch how i met your mother episodes. I find how i met your mother as the funniest show ever but sometimes there are a few jokes Americanish. So I think it will mostly make you laugh while it is important to watch it with a valid subtitle to understand every single joke as this movie was filmed mostly to make people laugh.Such a very small explanation for nonTurkish speakers Ridvan Dilmen is a commentator and an old footballer who seems in late minutes in the film. In Turkish matches whenever he says it's a goal well there the shot then and it is. damn! he is like a seer! Well he was not really the person who we expect to see in that scene all of a sudden.Oh I'd almost forget! Have I told you what record Cem Yilmaz broke with this movie? His first film GORA had been watched by about 1 million people in three days in Turkiye. Now this is the third day and I think for AROG this number has already rised up and still is rising...".

The plot was boring I counted minutes towards the end. Lot's of money spent and they used the technology right. However if the story is bad and the jokes are bad this cannot help the movie out.I feel that Cem is not very funny any more. He should spend more time to find jokes and construct a movie.

Cem Yilmaz is very successful in stand up shows but I cannot see the same sense of humor in his movies. The football game part was very long and boring.

She is spared when Mun Ki claims she is his wife and Hoxworth goes along with his wife's suggestion that they can work in the Hoxworth household as domestic servants. Nyuk Tsin becomes known to all as Wu Chow's Auntie Aunt of Five Continents when her five sons are named after continents with Mun Ki's wife in China regarded as their official mother.

Will Penny was Heston's favorite film. The Hawaiians would mark the third and final joint project the two men worked on.Heston plays the grandson of that New England sea captain Richard Harris from the film Hawaii and the James Michener book it is based on. He's every bit the hell raiser that grandfather was but has an eye for business and does have a vision for Hawaii. Of course it's not the same vision as the native Hawaiians had or the same vision that Chinese and Japanese immigrants have. That in a nutshell is the history of Hawaii.The rest of the white characters are descendants from the characters in the first film. The added component are the characters of Mako and Tina Chen who immigrate to Hawaii from China and found a small dynasty of their own. Their story and that of Heston and his family entwine over several decades.One thing I will say about The Hawaiians that is most admirable. The Asian and Pacific Islander characters you see here are portrayed as three dimensional and with dignity. No fortune cookie stereotypes are to be found in The Hawaiians. I've always been of the opinion that you cannot make a bad film about Hawaii because the scenery is so beautiful. The Hawaiians is no exception and the film did get an Oscar nomination for costume design.Tina Chen does a remarkable job as the matriarchal head of her family after Mako dies of leprosy on the island of Molokai. In a patriarchal culture that was by no means an easy thing. Her performance is the best acting in The Hawaiians.The Hawaiians has an Edna Ferber like sweep in its plot and its subject. It's also sticking close to the facts in terms of Hawaiian history a very worthy film to see.".

This guy by the way is already married to a woman still living in Chinahis first wife who he sends much of his earnings to.  So our Heroine  must be her own children's auntie.When her husband contracts Leprosy Wu Chow's Auntie as she is now called by everybody who knows her  nobly follows her husband to the outcast Island of Molokai where she takes care of  him until he dies.Mako is not Chinese but an excellent JapaneseAmerican actor.

Then the noble mother pulls herself to her fullest height surely no more then five feet and declares looking each child in his eyes until he is forced to lower them Impossible has come back from Molokai.  Naturally to find out what happens to this woman you have to read James Michener's epic novel.  This one scene alone would make the film a MUST SEE in my opnion.

	schema:reviewBody "THE HAWAIIANS is the second half of Michener's saga about Hawaii and in many ways I found it a much more satisfying movie. The film follows the life of an adventurer and opportunist Charlton Heston as he tries to strike it rich in 18th century Hawaii. His primary concern is money and power and he is willing to do most anything to acquire itsuch as sneaking off to the Caribbean to steal pineapples to transplant in Hawaii exploit his workers and stomp on most anyone who got in his way.At the same time the story follows a Chinese woman Tina Chen that comes to work for Heston. She is the concubine of a Chinese man whose wife remained behind in China. Throughout the movie she is referred to by her biological children as auntie because she is not the official wife of the man Mako. This is very sad because she is devoted to him and when he contracts leprosy she selflessly follows him to the hellhole island on Molokai to the leper colony. Somehow she survives and can rejoin her children though the man dies of his disease. Once back this polite and selfless woman begins to change to a hardasnails business woman.Later in the story a romance buds between Heston's son and Chen's daughter and both prospective inlaws have to learn to put aside their bigotry and learn to accept this relationship. In a way it is a metaphor for the new Hawaiians of the 20th century.The film has great action acting and a story. Lots to hold your interest in this film.".

Once back this polite and selfless woman begins to change to a hardasnails business woman.Later in the story a romance buds between Heston's son and Chen's daughter and both prospective inlaws have to learn to put aside their bigotry and learn to accept this relationship. In a way it is a metaphor for the new Hawaiians of the 20th century.The film has great action acting and a story. Lots to hold your interest in this film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Hawaiians was made from the middle third of Michener's novel Hawaii.  Compared to the Julie Andrews  Max von Sydow movie Hawaii made from the first third of the book The Hawaiians is unpretentious lowbrow but much more entertaining.  The plot of The Hawaiians revolves around two stories  the rise to political and commercial power of second generation American immigrants and the arrival in Hawaii of Chinese and Japanese immigrants.The story of the American immigrants' rise to power follows the life of Whip Hoxworth played by Charlton Heston.  He gains wealth by establishing the first pinepple plantation in Hawaii then participates in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy which led to the islands becoming an American territory.The story of Chinese and Japanese immigration to Hawaii is told through the life of Char Nyuk Tsin played by Tina Chen.  She becomes the second wife of fellow immigrant Kee Mun Kee who fails at almost everything he does.  But through hard work and perseverence Char Nyuk Tsin prospers and creates a better life for her children.This is not highbrow cinema.  The acting is second rate the script is second rate everything about it is second rate. For example the attempts by the ChineseAmerican actors to speak Chinese is almost laughable.  They speak Mandarin with atrocious accents even though the characters are supposed to be speaking either Hakka or Cantonese.  But it doesn't really matter. This is the sort of movie to watch when you don't want to have to think hard.  It's an enjoyable nobrainer a pleasant diversion while eating popcorn.The Hawaiians enjoys a footnote in the history of the MPAA's movie rating system.  When it came out in 1970 it earned a PG rating despite having two scenes of female nudity.  Japanese immigrant farm workers are shown enjoying a traditional communal bath and one attractive young woman is shown topless for a short time.  This created a mild controversy at the time although the scene is about as sexy as a National Geographic pictorial.I have not been able to find The Hawaiians on tape or DVD. If anyone in the business can get it released please do!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film today is quite forgotten because it never turns up on TV and is not widely available on video and certainly not yet on DVD. Tis is a great pity as THE HAWAIIANS is an excellent and interesting stand alone sequel to the whopper epic of 1966 HAWAII  which was a 70mm release with Julie Andrews and Max Von Sydow and even Bette Milder in a crowd scene. James Mitchener and his tales of the south seas books presented film makers with many opportunities for grand and spectacular South Pacific extravaganza dramas and even one enchanted musical. THE HAWAIIANS is basically the story of how Charlton Heston started the pineapple industry in Hawaii with the help of hard working clever Chinese peasants some of whom were brought into the plantation household for love and 'marriage' and even unfortunately a spot of leprosy. While that might sound trite and I am not making fun of it it allows for 'ordinary' people to feature center screen in an epic way. Because this film is not about major Euro characters like in the first film THE HAWAIIANS unjustly has been derailed and forgotten. But it is actually more interesting because it is about someone else other than religious zealots smashing idols and their sexually repressed wives ripping the corset off to run barefoot down the beach with the native teenagers.. So if you wish to see a truly glorious epic film about the people who actually did something to and for Hawaii whether it ultimately good or bad THE HAWAIIANS lives up to its title showcasing the real hard working people who lived and loved in Hawaii a century ago. I had the unforgettable experience of seeing both HAWAII and THE HAWAIIANS back to back as a double feature 7pmmidnight in a Sydney Suburban cinema one freezing winter night lashed by a monster cyclonic thunderstorm. Here we were rugged to the chin in woolly everything straining to hear the soundtrack over the crashing din of the rain on the theater's enormous tin roof whilst looking at a spectacular cinemascope vista of tropical sunny island drama. About an hour into the first film the plaster ceiling sprang several serious leaks and a very grimy waterfall left of screen that was washing 55 years of dirt from above the curtains. The tubby manager and the broom kid were heard scurrying into the ceiling with empty tin ice cream bins. With hissed directions from Mr Tubby the kid was clomping about on the beams creaking and thudding placing empty tins under the drizzle from the roof above. That plugged the leaks but instead started a hilarious symphony of 'pling' and 'plong' and 'plish' and 'klading' and 'sklosh' as the huge raindrops fell into the empty bins and began to fill them. It sounded like when somebody plays eidelweiss' using a dozen glasses of water of varying amounts. This began to cause the entire audience of a dozen of us to laugh and look about. Suddenly something crashed and splashed from behind the screen as the kid went straight through a part of the ceiling long unseen. A massive puddle gushed from under the masking across the stage to the footlights and waterfalled straight into the front aisle. The kid made his way out from behind the screen cringing wet and meekly looking about. The audience erupted into rapturous applause. The kid took a bow and slipped straight offstage onto the soggy carpet and out of sight. What a night! Value and extras like that never happen in multiplexes today. Anyway after we survived HAWAII we all got a free hot chocolate congratulated the manager and wet kid and went back in storm raging still buckets sploshing away  ceiling straining and let THE HAWAIIANS transport us to another world in another warmer age. Such was the professional cinematic expertise of this very good sequel. I have never looked at a pineapple in the same way ever again.".

The result is actually quite good though nowhere near as good as George Roy Hill's original. Practically none of the original cast or crew has returned. Hill was succeeded as director by Tom Gries Trumbo and Taradash are replaced on script duty by James R. Webb How the West Was Won Cheyenne Autumn who certainly had a bizarre gift for crafting intelligible and reasonably entertaining stories out of momentous historical hoopla. And since it takes place a couple generations after the end of the first film obviously the cast is all gone. Charlton Heston adds more than prestige he also adds presence and strength to the central character of Whip Hoxworth with Geraldine Chaplin decent but underused as his odd wife Purity. Mako is terrific as a Chinese peasant farmer who comes to Hawaii after cheating himself a new wife Char Nyuk Tsin played by Tina Chen in a performance that starts off rather uninteresting but blossoms into a real stunner. The story goes on through racial strife economic and ecological developments on the islands political turmoil and personal tragedy very much in the spirit of the first Hawaii but without all the buildup remember how much time had passed before we saw the islands in the first one? and with a quicker pace. The film is lush intriguing and adequately enacted but there are a few obstacles to overcome before you can really get into it. The worst of these is Henry Mancini's tacky obvious ethnic clichinfused score which comes nowhere near the scope emotion or wonderment of Elmer Bernstein's original. If Bernstein couldn't have been secured surely there was a better option Jerry Goldsmith springs to mind than Henry The Pink Panther Mancini. But the score does have a few moments of... well adequacy. Given that the film obviously failed and having never been released on either VHS or massmarket DVD both suffers in obscurity while toiling in notoriety and given that the first film was at least to this reviewer almost thoroughly a masterpiece The Hawaiians is much better than can be expected. And compared to the lame sequels that stuff the cineplexes these days it plays off like a Citizen Kane or a Godfather.".

	schema:reviewBody "You have to admire James Michener's resolve. He's the guy who wrote the book this screen play is based on. Michener wrote one novel or nonfiction work after another each of them requiring an unconscionable amount of historical and geographic research. There are a couple of dozen doctoral dissertations scattered among his books  Centennial Texas Alaska Poland Iberia. This is about a certain part of Hawiian history a sprawling epic as they say following multiple narrative threads through three generations. The principal thread belongs to Charlton Heston who begins as a reckless and uncaring sea captain and winds up as a cigarpuffing prosperous land owner the evolution being the result of his willingness to take risks. The other main thread belongs to Tina Chen who begins as an outcast young Chinese woman and becomes a socially prominent leader of the Chinese community in Honolulu. She's a minority among the Chinese in that she is Hakka an internally marginal group in China. Her minority status isn't Michener's literary trick either. Hakka is one of half a dozen or so common dialects in Chinese and in one of my classes we had representatives of all of them lined up at the front of the room pronouncing one familiar word after another. There was an obvious family resemblance among most of them. You could hear the buried Cantonese word when it was spoken in Mandarin Chinese. But not Hakka. It was to the other dialects what Rumanian is to the other Romance languages.Wait a minute. Was that off topic? Well it doesn't matter much. There's no describing the plot of this movie. If anything ever happened in Hawaiian history it happens to somebody in this movie. You want to talk leprosy? Racism? The switch from a monarchy to a territory of the United States? The plague? Let it simply be said that it's all here.Charlton Heston is his usual monolithic self and fills the character appropriately. Tina Chen is a beautiful woman who is at best professional. We don't get to see much of Geraldine Chaplin who rediscovers her native Hawiian genes and appears to go nuts. John Phillip Law isn't around much either. Tina Chen's husband is Mako who is Japanese and he's quite good in what is essentially the same role he played in The Sand Pebbles. Some of the supporting players appear to have been chosen for their looks rather than their talent.I rather like Hawaii at least as it was when I was last there years ago. There's a good deal of solidarity to be found on the islands. During the turmoil of the 1960s when American cities were in the grip of violent revolutions or their simulacrums Honolulu went quietly about its business and that in a city more ethnically diverse than any found on the mainland.Anyway the film is worth watching. I can't say I was especially gripped by any of the incidents or characters. I'd recommend it if only for its educational properties. Michener was only rarely effective as a dramatist but all that time he put into his research certainly paid off.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the James Michener novel Hawaii this sequel to Hawaii 1966 received a Best Costume Design Oscar nomination. It follows the life of 'Whip' Hoxworth played by Charlton Heston and those he comes in contact with through many years on the islands before they became our 50th state including the introduction of the telephone and early automobile. Directed by Tom Gries with a screenplay by James R. Webb it features breathtaking views of land and sea including those of seaworthy sailing ships.It begins with Whip captaining a ship transporting Chinese workers to the islands for cheap labor. One of these is Mun Ki Mako who saves a woman Char Nyuk Tsin Tina Chen from being sold into prostitution by claiming she's his wife when they arrive. Whip hires them as cook  servant and takes them to his luxurious home where he's reunited with his wife Purity Geraldine Chaplin. I haven't read the book but I will say that the film skips forward 23 years at a time or more many times as the story takes place over several decades.The first segment of the film establishes the relationships between the two man and wife combinations. Mun Ki is in fact already married to a woman in China and as the resident Chinese Wise ManLawmaker Foo Sen Keye Luke explains to Char Nyuk Tsin all the children she bears for him will be regarded as his wife's whereas she will be known to them as their auntie. However there relationship is one of true love he teaching her how to speak pigeon English since their native Chinese dialects are incompatible. Chen gives the performance of the film one which inexplicably went unrecognized by the Academy in what was IMO a weak year for Best Actresses e.g. given those that were nominated. She accepts her role and eventually gives birth to four sons instead of the five he'd wanted named for each continent per Foo Sen and one daughter. Her character is also transformed from one which she herself initially claims is not smart relative to her husband to a very strong even progressive female  minority role model businesswoman and leader. During this time she demonstrates her deep commitment to Mun Ki by choosing to go with him to the leper colony with no hope of return on Molokai when he contracts the disease.Whip is married to a onefourth native Hawaiian who after bearing him a son herself becomes withdrawn and eventually somewhat crazy as she immerses herself in the dying native culture and ultimately leaves him. He is shocked to learn when he returns from the sea that his grandfather and benefactor has died and left him nothing but thousands of seemingly useless acres of land in lieu of the command of the family shipping fleet he covets. His wealthy missionary family led by his cousin Micah Alec McCowan has control of the assets and offer to give him his ship if the black sheep of the family would leave and never return. He refuses and hires a drunkard well digger Don Knight who finally finds fresh water on the property which enables Whip to eventually become a rich pineapple plantation owner.Whip becomes a man who believes he can do anything he wants which he does by taking bigger and bolder risks throughout the story. He takes his son Noel back from his estranged wife and raises him until the 15 year old departs for his real education on the sea just like his father did. Whip commits several illegal acts including ones which enable him to introduce pineapple growing to the islands.Noel is played by various different actors as he ages but only really figures prominently in the film's last and weakest part when John Phillip Law plays the role. Separated from his wife for years Whip also sets up a Japanese concubine Miko Mayama. The last part of the film is more about the political evolution of the island involving Whip Micah and Queen Liliuokalani played by Naomi Stevens towards annexation by the U.S. and isn't nearly as compelling as the first 90 minutes. It also includes a too contrived romance for Noel upon his return.".

I also haven't seen Hawaii to which this is apparently a standalone sequel so I can't make any comparisons. I did live in Hawaii during high school and had quite a few lessons in state and native Hawaiian history  much more than the writers had apparently.The Chinese casting was very good and mostly Chinese. Unfortunately there were few if any Hawaiians involved except a few extras. Queen Liliuokalani for example is played by a Jewish woman doing an accent that could best be described as aristocratic Italian. There's a couple of white women with impressive spray tans at different points in the movie both playing mixed racial characters as far as I could tell. The wife of the main character is played by a very white woman yet is supposed to be onequarter Hawaiian.The native Hawaiian movement to keep Hawaii as an independent monarchy is illustrated by the insanity of the main character's wife. Her desire to get in touch with her roots is intermingled with her portrayed hysteria and tenuous grip on reality. The natives she lives among for a while are apparently just as nuts since they never appear to notice that she's unhinged. There's a brief condemnation of exploitative white businessmen by the Queen which is itself immediately undercut when she irately orders the execution of one. This seems to be aimed at dismissing the lingering modern opposition to the forceful overthrowing of the Hawaiian government by the US government.So the general impression is of successful white American businessmen building the future state versus various savage ethnic groups engaging in violence and spreading disease. The Chinese woman and her son gain some success and respect by embracing the American way starting a business and going to law school. And even that success is marred by the Chinese businesswoman promising to overcome by outbreeding the whites.The acting and scenery were excellent but this movie is a eurocentric relic which should stayed buried.".

Next came the American and European whites mostly missionaries or seamen. Then came the Chinese followed by the Mediterranean European Portugese and then the Japanese and Filipinos. Hawaiians movie does a great job of covering the Chinese immigrants at the beginning of the story Tina Chen and Mako did a fine job in the film as a Chinese Man and his second wife whom by Chinese law at that time was considered in reality a concubine. The scenes at the leper colony was very close to the original in the book and the rape of the beautiful Hawaiian leper girl Kinau who did not show except for one sign of the disease is also graphically depicted in the film. In the novel the concubine has all sons.In the movie version the concubine has one daughter.A character that has been created from Japanese and Chinese characters in the book.The Japanese former comfort girl mistress of Charlton Heston was actually a made from several different females in the book. Charlton Heston did a great job in his part but in actuality and no fault of his own but of the screenwriter his Whip character did not remain faithful to the book portrayal and Geraldine Chaplin her character should have been left out entirely since it was another streamline of other female characters. People who viewed this movie couldn't relate to Geraldine's Purity's character. She apparently was unhappy in her marriage gave Whip a son but didn't want to return to the marriage bed.Frigid and emotionally detached. She kept going back to her full blooded Hawaiian relatives and the church. She was comfortable with the old ways and not the new and certainly not her husband's sex drive. John Phillip Law plays the son of Whip and Purity who later married a Chinese girl the daughter of the Chinese couple was told to keep his quarter Polynesian blood a secret by his father. There was racism by the socalled Pure white stock against Caucasians who had a little of the Polynesian ancestry. Pure Polynesian Hawaiians weren't too happy at first with their children intermarrying with Caucasians or mainland Asian Chinese then Koreans or other island Asiatic groups like Japanese and Filipinos but it happened. Bottom line on this sequelGood Movie but not what one could call faithful to a James Michener's novel. The Chinese storyline pretty much stayed close to the depiction in the book. The James Michener novel Centennial was better adapted to the small screen than this epic sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is generally easy to detect stylistic or thematic indicators of what is to come in the first features of directors of originality. There are however notable exceptions such as Kazan's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn a worthy but wholly commercial venture that give little of their creators away. Erich Rohmer's Le Signe du Lion however is in an altogether different category. You would expect something of the director's unique way of looking at the world to be present in what is in every sense a significant example of early French New Wave cinema and yet there is nothing I can detect that links it with for example Ma Nuit Chez Maud or the Four Seasons tetralogy. Rohmer went on to become the master of the conversation piece where characters chat endlessly about their philosophy of life the interchange with others being allimportant. How is it that in Le Signe du Lion there is so little in the way of dialogue and that in the lengthy central part of the film we simply observe the main character wandering the streets of Paris bereft of friends and money? Pierre is a fortysomething American musician who does not appear to have achieved much apart from a violin sonata that often punctuates the film in a way that is again untypical of a director who tends to use very little and more often no background music. Equally untypical is this character who shows little interest in interreacting with others unless it be to touch them for money the lack of which is the root of his downfall. Le Signe du Lion is therefore unique in Rohmer's output in being a solo piece. Other characters are around but they scarcely matter. This is his Carrie but unlike the Wyler masterpiece there is no Carrie only a Hurstwood who slides down the slippery slope into degradation when an expected legacy fails to materialise and friends he might borrow from are all away on holiday. Like Hurstwood Pierre suffers early on from the tragedy of his only suit being ruined. Later this is followed by his only pair of shoes falling apart. From then on it is but a short step to his acceptance of the lifestyle of a tramp and beggar. The term road movie like film noir has become a matter of common parlance. May I be allowed to coin a term that I am not aware of having been used for a particular genre  street movie  one that depicts characters wandering in a city often round and round in circles in search of something that eludes them the city becoming progressively more alien. Such a genre would include Odd Man Out Bicycle Thieves The Third Man and certainly this early work by Rohmer. Perhaps because it is so untypical of its director it has become undeservedly overshadowed by works such as Le Beau Serge Les Quatre Cent Coups and A Bout de Souffl and yet particularly in the extended sequence of Pierre shuffling aimlessly around the streets of Paris it can hold its own in this august company. A rather glib ending apart it remains of of Rohmer's finest achievements.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is generally easy to detect stylistic or thematic indicators of what is to come in the first features of directors of originality. There are however notable exceptions such as Kazan's A Tree Grows in Brooklyn a worthy but wholly commercial venture that give little of their creators away. Erich Rohmer's Le Signe du Lion however is in an altogether different category. You would expect something of the director's unique way of looking at the world to be present in what is in every sense a significant example of early French New Wave cinema and yet there is nothing I can detect that links it with for example Ma Nuit Chez Maud or the Four Seasons tetralogy. Rohmer went on to become the master of the conversation piece where characters chat endlessly about their philosophy of life the interchange with others being allimportant. How is it that in Le Signe du Lion there is so little in the way of dialogue and that in the lengthy central part of the film we simply observe the main character wandering the streets of Paris bereft of friends and money? Pierre is a fortysomething American musician who does not appear to have achieved much apart from a violin sonata that often punctuates the film in a way that is again untypical of a director who tends to use very little and more often no background music. Equally untypical is this character who shows little interest in interreacting with others unless it be to touch them for money the lack of which is the root of his downfall. Le Signe du Lion is therefore unique in Rohmer's output in being a solo piece. Other characters are around but they scarcely matter. This is his Carrie but unlike the Wyler masterpiece there is no Carrie only a Hurstwood who slides down the slippery slope into degradation when an expected legacy fails to materialise and friends he might borrow from are all away on holiday. Like Hurstwood Pierre suffers early on from the tragedy of his only suit being ruined. Later this is followed by his only pair of shoes falling apart. From then on it is but a short step to his acceptance of the lifestyle of a tramp and beggar. The term road movie like film noir has become a matter of common parlance. May I be allowed to coin a term that I am not aware of having been used for a particular genre  street movie  one that depicts characters wandering in a city often round and round in circles in search of something that eludes them the city becoming progressively more alien. Such a genre would include Odd Man Out Bicycle Thieves The Third Man and certainly this early work by Rohmer. Perhaps because it is so untypical of its director it has become undeservedly overshadowed by works such as Le Beau Serge Les Quatre Cent Coups and A Bout de Souffl and yet particularly in the extended sequence of Pierre shuffling aimlessly around the streets of Paris it can hold its own in this august company. A rather glib ending apart it remains of of Rohmer's finest achievements.";

Godard was only to get his act together in the following year 1960 with Breathless. To me this is a masterpiece cut from the same cloth. There are glimpses of mysticism in Rohmer's film The Green Ray but really this film takes that a lot further it's a movie that really plays around with chance and fortune. Pierre Wesselrin of GermanoAmerican origin is a smalltime Parisian composer who has never made a cent out of his music. He talks a lot about having been lucky all his life and he is he's fallen in with a crowd of rich friends and he's always bathed in rive gauche society even though he's not a great talent and is very lazy he seems to be able to get people to give him money. There's a very Rivettian feel to the start of the movie Wesselrin throws a party and you have for example this guy who is indoors at nighttime wearing dark glasses he's listening to this febrile screeching section of some classical music over and over again repeatedly bringing back the needle of the record player. There's these little throwaway poetical typically French sophistries where they talk allegorically about Venus and a woman says that noone lives there because it's too close to the sun it's good but I'm sure it sounds better in a marijuana haze. So I don't want to give too much of the plot away but there ends up being a lot of solitary wandering about Paris. I thought the ultimate poetic vision of Paris was Rivette's Paris Belongs To Us but this is up there on that level. Rohmer somehow makes Paris feel like a giant coffin or a kind of Byzantine encrusted cemetery. There's the traditional view of this film which concerns the perils of believing in one's good fortunes but I think on the whole it's far more mystical really pointing at Wesslrin's life being ruled by the stars. It's just gorgeous as well. They must have built the walkways along the Seine when people believed in Arcadia which they don't anymore. The photography just blows me away favourites being Wesselrin in a floppy hat singing by the Seine and his violin sonata played at the start of the film as the camera glides over the Seine. There's a critical idea with this movie about the perils of entrusting your fate to luck. I don't follow that one bit. My reading is that Wesselrin is lucky throughout the movie in fact his experiences are what enable him to finally finish his violin sonata and also to appreciate his lucky situation in life. He reminds me of Tartini a composer who is famous for only one work The Devil's Trill a violin sonata which he heard in his dreams supposedly he saw the Devil playing and then transcribed upon awaking.I really felt like screaming after I had finished watching this at quarter to one in the morning I think I got a few strangled gurgles out would not have been good to wake the house up. This is why I watch cinema for the feeling of ecstasy ec  stasy literally out of stasis.A friend pointed out to me that many of Rohmer's later trademarks are present in this film the seemingly artless but carefully constructed miseenscne. I like to refer to his miseenscne as situational he often does scenes that remind me of the bit in Meshes of the afternoon when a mystical hand lowers a sunflower. It's almost like their are supernatural beings placing objects to be found by the participants in the film.".

Indeed some of its detractors decry the fact that being Rohmer's first featurelength film and released as it was in between Truffaut's THE 400 BLOWS 1959 and Godard's BREATHLESS 1960 the film is tinged more with a predisposition towards cineverite' and perhaps mercifully so than with Rohmer's uniquely sensitive style which he subsequently became renowned for. Having often found his films relentlessly talky and frustratingly mundane those of his fans which have yet to experience this one or have perhaps stayed away because of this difference in directorial ideology I will reassure them by saying that the film's first third was typically Rohmerian. This section however was alleviated for me by the surprising and amusingly silent appearance of JeanLuc Godard who plays a party guest who even seems to come out of nowhere moodily walking through the living room smoking a cigarette and forever fiddling with a gramophone! Other notable 'friends' contributing to Rohmer's first featurelength venture are screenwriter Paul Gegauff producer Claude Chabrol and actress Stephane Audran.The story deals with an American expatriate Jess Hahn who apparently inherits a vast sum of money from his dead aunt and consequently celebrates himself into a state of extreme poverty. However as luck would have it he had misinterpreted the telegram and all his inheritance effectively went to a distant cousin. The film's lengthy and mostly silent middlesection consists of nothing but an increasingly disheveled Hahn walking the streets of Paris going in and out of telephone boxes and hotel lobbies asking after his friends in the hope that they'll lend him a sum of money enough for him to get a roof over his head and a loaf of bread into his belly! While at first I was ready to beg for something to actually happen during this section of the film in hindsight this was perhaps its highlight and certainly a remarkable sequence coming from Rohmer. Of course the continuous location shooting was not only required by the film's narrative but must have proved fundamental in keeping the production costs down.The third and final section then sees a reversal of fortune for Hahn's character. After taking up with a clownish tramp who sarcastically dubs him The Baron and performing their routines on the streets to the bourgeois restauranteurs a journalist friend chances upon him in the gutter one night whereupon he informs him that Hahn's rich cousin has met with a fatal car accident and that he is now effectively a member of high society!

Make that miniature tableau epic snowball. This is definitely not a timecapsule or a period piece it holds better than most existentialism imbibed artistic endeavors.I really loved the sarcastic joke on Camus remember when in the beginning Wesselrin what a name!our musician protagonist throwing that party for the alleged inheritance calls one of the guests a dear friend he calls him Camus only to find out that his name has a bare acoustical resemblance so much for a musical ear and Camus' existential themes.It is astonishing how Rohmer manages to portray Wesselrin's downfall with a sure hand and perfectly nuanced he proves a master of simplicity. Of course he is aided in his vision by Jess Hahn's also exquisitely nuanced performance. This AmericaninParis who as he ambiguously says at a certain point could be Swiss anyone has an allegorical allure that maybe surpasses Godard's takes on matters of FrancoAmerican relations. This is what makes Rohmer's mystification of chance poignant rather than the elbowinyourface ending which is actually out at the elbows. I found the ending out of tone plain bad why since Rohmer has arguably the best musical ear his fondu enchaine is so eloquent in terms of fluid cinematic structure and since he outdid Camus with that early joke and this man's downfall in Paris in situ not some exotic colonialist alibi he seems to say  their temperaments are so opposite why then this gratuitous ending? It downplays the earlier comedy of class and fortune. Read how Known he is in certain artistic circles a newspaper reports in length after he is found out as a millionaire this article thus mocking the cosmopolitan investigative journalism of his friends. This is also fine. Early Rohmer seems more engaged and edgy in the frustrations of metropolitan modernity but it is unfortunate he sometimes shies off into almost premodern mechanics he is usually referred to as having a Mozartean quality. We should then have in mind that automatons played an important role in Mozart being one of the first installments of modernity and exposing the mechanics of desire. In the film's case the automaton of chance somewhat mystifies if it does not travesty the specifics of the Capital. Rohmer does not engage in that kind of investigation unless it is in the gag just before the ending when the music played is something modern anyway as one of the bourgeois clueless couples attending the performance inanely reports to her friend.And then there is Jean de Poulain as the clochard with a bravura performance perfectly in tune with getting us out of the stupor of following Wesselrin in his degradation only to throw us in the highpitched and bathetic boulevard of class his appearance has something to do I bet with the Godot craze of the times and one sees the parallel universes they inhabit.Airy as Raoul Dufy with one or two glib charcoal lines as in Bernard Buffet's portraits Le Signe du Lion shines as one of the most lively portraits of Paris of any time.".

Make that miniature tableau epic snowball. This is definitely not a timecapsule or a period piece it holds better than most existentialism imbibed artistic endeavors.I really loved the sarcastic joke on Camus remember when in the beginning Wesselrin what a name!our musician protagonist throwing that party for the alleged inheritance calls one of the guests a dear friend he calls him Camus only to find out that his name has a bare acoustical resemblance so much for a musical ear and Camus' existential themes.It is astonishing how Rohmer manages to portray Wesselrin's downfall with a sure hand and perfectly nuanced he proves a master of simplicity.

American expatriate Jess Hahn is effective as an essentially foolish man who lives for the moment a grasshopper in a world of ants happy to splash out all his borrowed money on fairweather friends on the strength of a misinterpreted telegram and then paying the price as the real friends who may well have come through for him leave Paris on vacation andor business. People born under Leo do of course have a predilection for being the centre of attention which serves as both an explanation andor justification for Rohmer's camera being fixated on Hahn for something like one and three quarter hours. Along the way the likes of Paul Crauchet and Stephane Audran offer glimpses of the fine actors they would become whilst Godard significantly plays an idiot.

The fourth wall is gone the movie rides so high and smart that we as audience can be subtly acknowledged throughout and made complicit in the production while we continue to believe in the characters and care about what happens to them.Much of the important dialogue is throwaway dialogue in a sense. It's clear to the hearing but lines are often spoken by the characters to themselves for their own and our amusement or delivered in very deftly choreographed simultaneity each speaker maintaining an independent point of view in rapidfire repartee. Implications are understated. We are expected to expect the unexpected to listen to every line.The plot is composed like a piece of music. Each scene takes moment from the timeline established by the impending day and hour and minute at which a husband Cary Grant and wife Irene Dunne become legally divorced and the movie ends at precisely the stroke of midnight which marks that moment. They clearly want each other back but will they cleave together or cleave apart as the clock strikes midnight?One extended movement of the movie lets Cary Grant charmingly undermine his wife's new relationship. In corresponding scenes later Irene Dunne brilliantly plays a dumb floozie pretending to be the husband's sister and demolishing in one evening his reputation and his prospects for marriage in respectable society. In these later scenes in another of the movie's nice compositional touches she does a reprise of a hoochie musical number performed earlier by a girlfriend of her husband's and then falls into her husband's arms apparently drunk. He gestures for her to look back and say goodnight to the horrified guests and to us as they do a wonderful little wobbly dance out the door having burned their bridges behind them. I found the opening few scenes of the movie unlikable but with the entrance of Irene Dunne the movie gets us on board. There's so much great understated visual and verbal double entendre in the best sense that I want to go back and see if there's more that I missed. In one scene Cary Grant has brought to Irene Dunne's new fianc the paperwork on a coal mine the divorcing couple still own. Interrupted by a visitor while advising the fianc on where it would good to sink a shaft har! he explains that he and the fianc brilliantly played by Ralph Bellamy as a very successful bumpkin businessman are transacting a business deal. The movie moves along briskly and doesn't play up the point but we catch for a fraction of a second Irene Dunne squirming as she finds herself looking like the business transaction in question. The movie moves through moments like this quickly with high respect for our intelligence and our capacity to get in on the joke.".

He's at his best when he takes nobody and nothing seriously and he's especially funny at tormenting the slowwitted Bellamy.

We never find out what he was 'really' doing but it was probably naughty. He returns home to an empty house early in the morning. He doesn't know where his wife is and then she returns in a full evening gown with a handsome continental man. It sounds dramatic but its actually very very funny.

Irene Dunne is amazing in a layered performance that is both subtly affecting and sidesplittingly funny  sometimes within the same scene! The scene in which Dunne masquerades as Grant's floozy night club dwelling sister is one of the brightest highlights in film comedy history. Dunne received a welldeserved Oscar nomination for her inspired work in this film which endures as a reminder of why she was one of Hollywood's top actress during the thirties and forties.After flirting with success in SHE DONE HIM WRONG 1933 SYLVIA SCARLETT 1935 and TOPPER 1937 Cary Grant finally became a bonafide superstar with his performance in THE AWFUL TRUTH. Grant was an absolute master when it came to delivering one liners and the prowess that he displays in the film's many moments of physical comedy is nothing short of phenomenal. Exceptional performances are also delivered by the rest of the cast including Best Supporting Actor Oscar Nominee Ralph Bellamy but the film's real scene stealer is the incredible canine performer Asta as Mr. Smith which is easily the best performance by a dog ever! Leo McCarey won a muchdeserved Academy Award for his frenetic direction of what is surely one of the alltime greatest comedies.".

It's sort of a first draft of 'My Favorite Wife' remade as 'Move Over Darling' and has all the patented screwballromantic comedyFrench farce elements of the 'Palm Beach Story' but in a less sophisticated form. Even though 'The Awful Truth' may have established a formula for all subsequent screwball comedies let's face it it's still rude and crude around the edges. But it probably was the 'There's something about Mary' of its time and Leo McCarey apparently got an Oscar for Best Director. Its gags and dialogue are at times so unexpected as to be termed experimental. The movie is really all about the sexual tension between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne married partners who wilfully dissolve their marriage over the husband's possible infidelity barely alluded to and his lack of confidence in his wife's virtue a.k.a. jealousy. But this being 1937 sexuality has to be expressed in devious contrived ways including the occasional gratuitous slapstick. The Swiss clock ending is worth the price of admission in this respect. As is Cary Grant's date's obscene nightclub performance and his martial arts irruption into a society afternoon recital where his wife Dunne is singing an Italian aria that none of Grant's pratfalls can interrupt except for one memorable epochmaking anthologyready second and a half towards the end that no other singing actress could have pulled off. What one has to remember I guess is that none of this nonsense had ever been attempted seen or done on a screen before and it must have seemed terribly daring and innovative thanks to the complicity and high spirits of a perfect cast including Geeshucks cowboy Ralph Bellamy irrepressible fauxFrench charmer Alexander D'Arcy and worldly aunt Patsy Cecil Cunningham. Irene Dunne as usual is a total original and by the way Katharine Hepburn copied her comedy style and not the other way around check your dates guys.".

She pretends they are from a class these snobs would not accept. It is Dunne's finest ten minutes  hilarious and it never grows old.But the whole movie is funny. Cary Grant and his continental mind. Grant thinking he is bursting in on a love nest only to find himself in the middle of a sedate vocal recital. And Dunne singing a Tosti song watches him lovingly as he stumbles and executes pratfalls ending her son with a laugh rather than the words of her song! Asta even is put to better use than he was in the delightful Thin man series. Here is their dog Mr. Smith.Esther Dale never had a better role than as Ralph Bellamy's prudish and prurient mother. And Bellamy as he played the wrong man so often in romantic comedies is easy to take for granted. But he is delightful too.Joyce Compton in endless movies for a couple decades is an absolute scream as Dixie Belle the risqu nightclub performer with whom Grant takes up at around the time Dunne has taken up with deadly dull Bellamy.Not only is this sequence funny but it is also touching Don't we all on the rebound make choices that seem right but turn out catastrophic! I also like Twentieth Century and Bringing Up Baby. I do not like the smug My Favorite Wife also with Dunne and Grant or the mean Nothing Sacred. When it comes to screwball comedy this is the one! It surely is one of the greatest of all American movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film many years ago when I was first discovering Cary Grant and going through some of his big films and somehow it never made a big impression on me and I largely forgot it. So I recently decided to see it again. It was very good but didn't live up to all the rave reviews you see on this site.I was perfectly content with the plot althought it is a little odd more on that later. The cast and performances were just fine. There were definitely some outloud laughs and funny lines. Just... less of them than I expected. That's really my complaint I just didn't think this one was as consistently funny as some of the other great screwball comedies of the era. I blame the script. While there are a few great lines on the whole I think the dialog could've used some punching up. Some scenes just didn't do that much for me especially when Cary is playing the piano and the dog is singing. I just found it loud and irritating and it didn't make sense to me why the other characters were trying to talk over this cacophony rather than either asking for some quiet or just going over to Leeson's apartment which was only across the hall! Also some of the supporting characters could've been used to greater advantage both the aunt and Leeson's mother had great promise but in the end weren't given that much to do and as someone else astutely pointed out the dog just disappears into the aether.Now about the plot It really seems very odd to me that we never DO find out what Cary was up to when he was supposed to be in Florida. He's clearly involved in some kind of deception. Are we supposed to assume that he was indeed having an affair? That seems both a little harsh and a little out of place given the rest of the film. The key sticking point between the couple is clearly made out to be his inability to trust her other than her initial discovery with the orange she never reproaches him over his shenanigans whatever they might be nor does he ever display any contrition over them which you'd think would be required if he really had been up to serious no good. Moreover if he was having an affair it leads to some obvious questions 1 Why not have the affair in Florida? Florida is surely a very nice place to fly off to with a lover and he could clearly afford it. 2 Why not continue with this lover after the divorce? The best he's able to come up with for the first half of the film is Miss GoneWithTheWind who he admits he had just met. Frankly it just never really seems credible to me that he was having an affair it seems more likely that he was doing something of a decidedly less naughty character like bigpokergamewiththeboys or something. But you'd think that something like that would be revealed to us. Sadly it looks like the true answer is that the writers had NO IDEA what he was doing notinFlorida they just needed to contrive something to help fuel the initial argument that leads to divorce. Which really is just lazy and makes the whole thing unnecessarily contrived.On the plus side I think the whole last bedroom scene really works. The film has been successful enough up to this point that we really want to see these two finally get together well back together and we're really curious to see just how it's going to happen and so the film teases and tantalizes us for a while at the end. And I don't think anybody has made a strong enough point of this yet when Irene is lying there in the bed there man she is HOT! Her expression and body language is just so righton she's unbelievably alluring. You totally feel how much Cary's character must want to jump her because you so much want to jump her yourself! maybe only men and lesbians can truly appreciate this.  So overall a very good film but not quite up there with the likes of His Girl Friday or The Philadelphia Story.".

	schema:reviewBody "They really don't make 'em like this any more. I mean really. Sure dialog in films since the '60s and certainly the '70s has tended to become more naturalistic and the acting less stylized and 'stagey' than in the old days but somewhere along the way amidst all the gains in technology and sometimes realism we lost something. One of the things we lost I think was the ability to write direct and act pieces such as this. I don't know exactly why this is so but excellent as many of Hollywood's current actors are I am not sure that something like this could be pulled off as well today. For one I think that today's writers and directors even some of the better ones tend to cater to a greater degree to the lowest common denominator compounding that I'd assert that even with advances in educational resources technology and the fabric of society civil rights etc though like these others such facets of American society have been greatly eroded of late the lowest common denominator today is lower than it was in 1937.Regardless this film is a gem from start to finish in every way. Even the dog that weirdlooking little beast that shows up again in Bringing Up Baby is a sterling actor indeed he's better in his role and more convincing a thespian than many of today's socalled stars. The writing is incredible. Like the way the film's structured the dialog is clever I understand that much of it was improvised testament to the quality of actors involved working with an already great script and the themes and situations are ones that transcend time no matter how long ago the '30s might seem to most of us. It's madcap but it's not too much and there are many points during which I think the filmmakers were pushing the boundaries to see just how far they could go in that heavilyrestricted age of film. Obscene or vulgar language and the like can be funny in the right context or obviously reinforce or suggest other emotions but there may be some truth also in that old saying to the effect that yelling obscenities or just pouring them forth as part of normal dialog indicates a lack of anything more erudite to say. In there I think you also find part of the key to what made this older comedies so perfect and so timeless innuendo no matter how obscure even if it goes over many heads is almost always far more interesting and humorous than a fullfrontal attack on the senses. Of course the makers of these old films had little choice but sometimes out of necessity comes a level of genius and craftsmanship that surpasses by far what might have been the more unfettered route to telling the story.Have I mentioned that the dialog is great? Check this example outLucy  Well I mean if you didn't feel that way you do things wouldn't be the way they are would they? I mean things could be the same if things were different. Jerry  But things are the way you made them. Lucy  Oh no. No things are the way you THINK I made them. I didn't make them that way at all. Things are just the same as they always were only you're the same as you were too so I guess things will never be the same again. Magic.I started watching old movies like these after two or more decades of mostly viewing movies from the '70s and later when a few viewings of Sergio Leone films got me interested in that director's influences and from there I went to Kurosawa back to his idol John Ford and then Howard Hawks and John Huston and so on starting to reexplore offerings by Bogart Cary Grant and others including some classic films that I don't think I've ever seen Gunga Din for example. Right now I'm in the midst of a major Cary Grant kick  the man was brilliant on film and was one who could crack the audience up with a single facial expression or slay 'em with a deft oneliner  and so this film more than satisfies. It's also the film that really catapulted him into the big time once and for all. Irene Dunn is easily his equal in the sparring on screen she's incredible in this filmand gets to wear some farout glamorous clothes and funky li'l hats and indeed all involved are tremendous in their roles. Cecil Cunningham for example as Aunt Patsy has few lines but almost all of them are real zingers. It's a perfect blend of slapstick farce and deeper insight kept moving along relentlessly but digestibly by a highly professional cast and a director at the top of his game.I've actually heard people disdain older movies because they're in backandwhite and even for that matter newer movies shot monochrome. They're missing out on a vast legacy of brilliant storytelling and filmmaking from around the world not just treasures from Hollywood's most golden Golden Age but wonders like Russia's Ivan's Childhood Yojimbo and so many more as well as movies made in Hollywood as late as the '60s and '70s that intentionally used monochrome Frankenheimer's Seconds and of course Psycho and many other masterpieces. Besides the expert cinematographers who shot many such films both through careful use of light and filters and through the vivid clarity of their work actually manage to suggest color where none is present.This one's loaded with color and fun and it really is a film that stands up today as it always will. Thank goodness we have such archival materials as videotape and digitized discs that not only ensure the preservation of such treasures but allow us to call them up whenever we wish to be really entertained.".

Meanwhile Jerry Grant gets hooked up with a grasping socialite Molly Lamont. The love birds continue to peck away at each other and get entangled in each other's new romances. The chemistry is just wonderful between Grant and Dunne and the supporting cast is first rate. Highlights include Grant playing the piano while Mr. Smith the dog does a barking routine but Dunne gets her chance singing Gone with the Wind at a hightoned party. Great fun. Cunningham and Bellamy are terrific but so are Esther Dale Bellamy's ma Joyce Compton Dixie Bell and Mr. Smith who I suspect was really Asta from The Thin Man. The film Dunne and Bellamy scored Oscar nominations and Leo McCarey won for direction. Filled with snappy one liners and hysterical situations. Best scenes may be the night club sequence when Dunne gets stuck dancing with Bellamy and the party where Dunne pretends to be Grant's sister and yells out Hey wait a minute!

The Awful Truth is the flagrant depiction of a high society where no one has to work for a living and where nothing rivals marital status and the adventure of love.

There is comedy farce and sometimes slapstick and the unfolding of a line of comic action and intrusion that is very well written by Vina Delmar gracefully directed Leo McCarey received the Oscar for direction but above all vitally played. We love Grant and Dunne therefore we must love each other. It is a film of twoshots and group shots with the couple looking sideways at each other muttering and gesturing in a private language that would usually take years to learn. We are talking about screwball comedy and despite all the ugly holes in its concept and growth this is the genre in which Hollywood did its best work. This is not to say that Grant and Dunne were simply grand guys who rose above the limitations of their picture. They were great actors who had access to a freeflow comic exhilaration that is still enchanting. Why not look on the bright side? Why not accept that Hollywood was privileged insecure and selfserving  and seeking to bring consolation? Over the decades this has resulted in a few gems and The Awful Truth does what gems do.

	schema:reviewBody "Leo McCarey's The Awful Truth is among the best of the screwball comedies of the 1930s. It is also one of the simplest in plots and screenplays because it does not require any attempts at conspiracy or hidden identities or mystery say as in the comic mystery The Thin Man or in His Gal Friday  which also costarred Cary Grant and Ralph Bellamy in somewhat similar character types. The plot of The Awful Truth is reminiscent of what Jimmy Cagney and Pat O'Brien always are arguing about as screenplay writers in Boy Meets Girl. There the plot is Boy meets girl boy loses girl boy finds girl again! Here it would be Husband and wife split husband and wife sabotage each other's love affairs husband and wife reconcile!Grant and Irene Dunne have been married for awhile we later learn in court that they met when both fell in love with a puppy in a pet shop but both jump to the conclusion that the other has been having extramarital affairs Grant in particular is funny growing disgusted and angrier at Dunne's fairly blameless voice teacher Alex D'Arcy. They agree to separate and eventually divorce their only bone of contention is the puppy  Asta from The Thin Man series  who Dunne wins by a slightly sneaky trick. Dunne is introduced by her aunt Cecily Courtneigh to a neighbor in her luxury apartment house  Bellamy. He's a very wealthy oil man from Oklahoma. Grant tries to pick up a romance with a nightclub dancer Joyce Compton but he finds he delights in humiliating Dunne with her hamhanded new beau. The scene in the nightclub is funny because of how Compton's act embarrasses Grant but he watches Bellamy jitterbug Dunne off the dance floor.Grant manages without fully planning it in wrecking Dunne's romance. Then he starts showing a serious interest in snobby socialite Molly Lamont. Dunne following this romance in the social columns shows up at the home of Lamont's parents as Grant's drunken younger sister  and proceeds to demolish his engagement before his shocked fianc and her parents.The reconciliation is at the end although it seems hinted that Dunne comes out a little ahead of Grant in looking less absurd at the conclusion.The dialog is worth listening to here. A disgusted Bellamy announcing that a boy's best friend is his mother here Esther Dale. D'Arcy weakly agreeing to help Dunne make Grant look foolish  but inquiring if Grant carries a gun oddly enough Ingrid Bergman's servant Carl is used in a similar way in Indiscreet and worries about getting shot by Grant too!. Grant reassuring a dismal looking Dunne that if she gets tired of the nightlife of Oklahoma City she can always go with Bellamy to swinging Tulsa.If not as somewhat meaningful as My Man Godfrey or as dramatically balanced as The Thin Man The Awful Truth ends up being sweetly mirthful to the conclusion. It is a comedy that never fails to entertain.".

It is also one of the simplest in plots and screenplays because it does not require any attempts at conspiracy or hidden identities or mystery say as in the comic mystery The Thin Man or in His Gal Friday  which also costarred Cary Grant and Ralph Bellamy in somewhat similar character types.

	schema:reviewBody "In this movie you can see two of the most brilliant actors Irene Dunne and Cary Grant who are both the Queen and King of Comedy. Apparently they enjoyed each other's company  which isn't surprising at all considering that actors tend to favor actors who can keep up with themselves  as Dunne says But working with Cary Grant was different from working with other actors  he was much more fun! I think we were a successful team because we enjoyed working together tremendously and that pleasure must have shown through onto the screen and Grant compliments her with Irene had perfect timing in comedy and was the sweetestsmelling actress I ever worked with. Dunne indeed has the perfect timing and one of my favorite parts in this movie was the scene where she puts on a double act pretending to be Grant's sister. She has the ability to go back and forth between distinct characters and does it well with her own little refreshing touches here and there. I have to say that I consider Irene one of the best comediennes of the 30s alongside Carole Lombard and Myrna Loy. Turning to Grant he is of course one of my favorites and an excellent actor. He was the steady companion beside Irene and was part of the reason this movie fared so well. He is one of the most natural actors I have ever seen. He can act all he wants and it doesn't seem like he's acting. I admire performers who can do that and Grant certainly deserves the reputation he had and still has.Overall this movie was fun and entertaining although I personally think that the movie's success was rather exaggerated because the story itself isn't all that great. However if you think about the wonderful GrantDunne chemistry and their outstanding performances I guess it's really not that surprising after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE AWFUL TRUTH is the quintessential romantic comedy based on a misunderstanding between the protagonists. Jerry and Lucy Warriner Irene Dunne  Cary Grant are a married couple who get a divorcetheir only point of contention appearing to be the custody of their dog Mr Smithbecause Jerry thinks Lucy cheated on him with her vocal coach Duvalle D'Arcy. The theme of the film is that a marriage must be built on trust without doubt and suspicion. What's odd then is that Jerry spends the first half of the film trying to win Lucy backwhen he was the one who hadn't trusted her in the first place. Lucy spends the second half trying to win Jerry back after he falls for the same misunderstanding again when he happens upon Duvalle hiding in the other room in her apartment. What strikes me as odd is that the misunderstanding the entire film is based on is so small as to be insignificant. Why doesn't Lucy just come right out and say that she didn't do anything wrong? What's so difficult about saying My vocal coach came over this afternoon after I ran away to see if I was alright? Why shove him in a room only to have the farce start all over again? I suppose in the end that is the point. She doesn't clear up the misunderstanding as most sensible adults would because then the film itself wouldn't exist.So the plot of the film isn't particularly strongwhat is its saving grace? It's probably got to be the performance given by the leading members of the castCary Grant is everything you'd ever want Cary Grant to be. Charming debonair gleeful playful mischievous vulnerable hurt every emotion that Grant so skilfully and mesmerisingly displays through his career is available here possibly for the first time in one irresistible package. Irene Dunne is beautiful and very funny in her role as well mild spoilers ahead especially when she assumes the role of Lola Warriner to mess up Jerry's situation with Barbara. A real pleasant surprise is Ralph Bellamy as Dan he plays the perfect country bumpkin and practically steals the picture with his constant singing of Home On The Range his fervent hugswinging of Lucy and declaring that he's so happy that why he could eat three steaks!Most of the film feels like setpieces strung together to showcase the comedic talents of the stars. The film itself most certainly suffers for it since the plot twists don't often make sense but the performances are absolute classics. Some of the best moments include Lucy's breakfast chat with her acerbic aunt played delightfully by Cecil Cunningham Dan's cupwinning turn around the dance floor with Lucy and Duvalle hightailing out of Lucy's apartment with Jerry right on his heels. The ending as well is played out in a  delightfully suggestive and sexy way something that could only have been done with the inventiveness needed to get around the Hays Code in those days. If you're looking for laughaminute comedy you'd be better off with BRINGING UP BABY. And if it's romance you're after you probably couldn't do better than THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Both Cary Grant classics. But this film does a pretty good job of melding the elements of comedy and romance into one coherent whole. THE AWFUL TRUTH is definitely one for true Grant aficionados but it is no doubt a great way to spend a couple of hours.".

He is great as a man who is giving his exwife to be a hard time when she gets engaged to a rich southern oil man. In the end the roles get turned around and the Irene Dunn character gets to give the Grant character a hard time. It makes this a rather fun movie to watch though I wouldn't call it Leo McCarey's finest movie but that says something more about his qualities than that of this actual movie.It has a fun typical 1930's genre story and the movie can be seen as a screwball comedy though its not the best genre example of it since the movie besides its screwball elements also feature many other more subtle comedy styles. It sort is too bad though that the actors obviously had to improvise at times. It gives the movie a sort of a realistic look into how Cary Grant and Irene Dunn worked as actors but it doesn't always provide the movie with some much needed great witty dialog and fine written comedy moments. Sometimes the directing and editing feels like it was done too hasty with at times as a result an end result that isn't quite what it should had and could had been. Nevertheless Leo McCarey still received an Oscar for his directing of this movie. It was the only Oscar the movie won as well but it was nominated in 5 more categories though including best picture of the year.But no I don't want to let this movie sound bad for it really is a movie which I enjoyed watching.

Grant was wonderful with facial expressions and delivering the fastpaced sizzling dialogue. Here he does both with fine class.

How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. The viewer cannot help but feel what they feel nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.Yes there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops but they only spice it up a little and are not a significant part of the movie.For the lover of music Dave Grusin provides a superb Jazz based background featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.Not a movie for the lovers of guts blood and gore. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside watch a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like Harrison Ford to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard this is a move to watch with someone you love.

I don't know whether I buy into Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I took notice of her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.Here her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently Ford a police detective in Wash D.C. discovers that his wife was having an affair. He further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a New England Congresswoman.The story takes on many subplots as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages the uncovering of deceipt and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.I think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.".

The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally either. Where I find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation personal and professional but never seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard Harrison Ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.For five and a half bucks at WalMart with full length director commentary and behindthescenes featurette the DVD is well worth owning.

	schema:reviewBody "Has there ever been a more dour dreary and depressing movie romance than Random Hearts a film that drones on for 131 grueling minutes and traps two wonderful actors Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas in its diabolical clutches?Ford is a police sergeant working in internal affairs and Thomas is a New Hampshire congresswoman whose paths cross when their spouses who are having a secret affair with each other die in a plane crash.  Drawn together by both circumstance and grief the two begin a tentative love affair despite the many complications it sets up.The actors do their best given the stark limitations of portraying two people overcome with despair but the audience is nevertheless subjected to more than two hours of unrelieved gloominess.  In a sense it is a bit of a relief to see a romantic film that is not all lightheartedness and carefree silliness but a subject as profound as the study of grief and loss on the human psyche demands a less conventional more imaginative and serious a format than this film provides.  The brilliant film Fearless from 1993 is a startling case in point.  The actions of the characters often ring false as when for instance the two grieving spouses sitting in a car suddenly begin grappling in a wild sexual frenzy a moment that elicits giggles from the audience because it is so lacking in motivation and preparation.  Moreover the film pads out its narrative by constantly cutting away to an irrelevant and wholly underdeveloped subplot involving Ford's pursuit of a murderous cop  a sideshow that results in a completely ludicrous shooting scene that undercuts the seriousness of the film's purpose.Random Hearts is an obvious and perhaps even admirable attempt to bring a more mature adultoriented love story to the screen.  It's a shame then that all involved seem to have confused dreariness with profundity and gloominess with depth.".

It takes a while to realize what exactly Dutch  Kay are so desperately looking for their cheating partners secret love nest and when they independent of each other finally find it what was the big shocking surprise anyway! It only proved to Dutch  Kay what we in the audience knew all along what should have been obvious to them right from the very beginning of the movie!".

	schema:headline " Better than 5";
	schema:reviewBody "It's worth more than a 5! Random Hearts is one of very few films shot entirely in the Washington DC area and I like to revisit for historic reasons.The film unfolds slowly and runs for more than 2 hours  a tough sell in an age of 10second attention spans. But the plot is more complex than it seems. There is a large cast of sleazy disgusting people. I got much more from a third viewing significantly turning up the volume during the first 5 minutes  especially the haranguing racist lawyer in the court scene. The dialog often seems to be almost mundane filler but no phrase or word is wasted because everything comes back to haunt later as the lies and deceit crash back down the mountain of infidelity. Meanwhile their workday routines are what anchor the sad survivors.Ford is an IAD detective investigating a crime lord who's brazen enough to attempt murder in broad daylight. Kristin Scott Thomas works very well as the icy preppie congresscritter kicking off a campaign and determined to keep any whiff of negativity at bay. Her strategy is to move on immediately since there's nothing she can do to bring back either her cheating husband or his lover. But Ford is a cop and has to know not so much out of spite but because his training taught him to spot liars  and he couldn't believe that his wife had duped him.

	onyx:emotionText "It's worth more than a 5! Random Hearts is one of very few films shot entirely in the Washington DC area and I like to revisit for historic reasons.The film unfolds slowly and runs for more than 2 hours  a tough sell in an age of 10second attention spans. But the plot is more complex than it seems. There is a large cast of sleazy disgusting people. I got much more from a third viewing significantly turning up the volume during the first 5 minutes  especially the haranguing racist lawyer in the court scene. The dialog often seems to be almost mundane filler but no phrase or word is wasted because everything comes back to haunt later as the lies and deceit crash back down the mountain of infidelity. Meanwhile their workday routines are what anchor the sad survivors.Ford is an IAD detective investigating a crime lord who's brazen enough to attempt murder in broad daylight. Kristin Scott Thomas works very well as the icy preppie congresscritter kicking off a campaign and determined to keep any whiff of negativity at bay. Her strategy is to move on immediately since there's nothing she can do to bring back either her cheating husband or his lover. But Ford is a cop and has to know not so much out of spite but because his training taught him to spot liars  and he couldn't believe that his wife had duped him. Naturally they realize their spouses were leading double lives while their friends and co workers covered for them.The couple finally realize as the gossip reaches her daughter that they both need closure. Both stars played the best most convincing roles of their careers. Harrison Ford in particular reached his John Wayne moment. The love scene in her car at National Airport is so packed with intense emotion that words escape me.If you hated it the first time around try it again and repeat this is not a chick flick.";

I saw this movie for the first time just a few months ago but decided to review it AFTER I'd read the book. Couldn't believe some of the differences. Yes the cheating wife was in the fashion business and yes the cheating husband was a lawyer but in the book the cheated husband is not an IA Cop he's an assistant to a congressman and the cheated wife is not a congresswoman but a housewife with a small child a boy!! I'm not sure why the whole side story of him being a cop and the whole story that went with it was added. I watched the movie a second time and pretty much FF'd thru the whole police thing. The whole trip to Miami was nowhere in the book nor was there a sister to Kay. Also in the book there was more detail on Peyton's family background being all Italians and hating Dutch his name is Edward in the book for taking Peyton Lily in the book away from the family and not being Catholic. I really think the movie could've been more interesting to a lot of the reviewers had they used more of the book material. Also missing in the movie was Peyton's AND Kay's pregnancies. Even so I enjoyed the movie. I think Harrison Ford is excellent but thinking back to have him an expectant father would not work at his age the characters are younger in the book. Finally I was looking forward to clarification of the steamy albeit a little awkward scene in the car between Kay and Dutch but that too is nowhere in the book. I was almost disappointed reading when and how they first hook up as it wasn't nearly as exciting as the movie version. I'd still recommend this as a decent movie. Have to admit Harrison Ford was the main attraction for me. But I'd also recommend the book as a supplement to the story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the most ludicrously underrated movie out of the thousands I've looked at on this site. I can understand why most American moviegoers would not like it as it is very nearly unique. The only movie I've seen that it might be likened to is Brief Encounter the original English version with Trevor Howard please but this film is more subtle and interesting than the English classic.Random hearts is a story about two people a man and a woman whom the fates have mockingly drawn together for no better reason than their shared nightmare of betrayal yet as it turns out their very different personalities perfectly complement each other in their efforts to cope and to find the antidote to their poisoned lives  which turns out to be perfect honesty with respect to each other and integrity with respect to themselves.The movie itself is as honest and integral as its protagonists learn to be. Contrary to what some have said the plot is both plausible and realistic and all the little opportunities for overdramatization that most American directors and actors cannot resist are studiously avoided. And since the protagonists are intelligent but not particularly articulate still less selfaware which is what the movie is about meanings and dramatic passages are mostly conveyed visually and by first rate acting and direction rather than editorially via the script. Overall the tone is one of somber realism which creates the ideal backdrop for the subtly dramatic reemergence of the underlying humanity and vitality of the characters in the wake of their mutual trauma.I believe my characterization of this movie makes it fairly selfevident why so many Hollywoodconditioned viewers find this movie flat boring and unsatisfying and I suppose that they also feel cheated because this is not a typical Harrison Ford movie any more than Bridges of Madison County is a typical Clint Eastwood movie. Yet both of these films are among the best that either actor has ever done.Many seem to see the casting of Kristin Scott Thomas opposite Ford as bizarre but I see it as brilliant. A principal theme of this movie is to probe for the common humanity that often underlies superficial differences of background personality and presentation and to remind us of what is truly important in our character and our relationships.".

The first thing that struck me was that it was a comedy rather than a straightforward horror. Instead of splattering noxious Japanese teenagers all over the walls like Battle Royale or intellectualising the angst like Lily Chou Chou Miike just sets about the conventions with a pickaxe handle. He seems to know instinctively when the sugar shutdown is approaching and how to kickstart the adrenalin rush when the pace starts to flag. Sharp direction that works well in the TV medium. I would guess that this series was popular across a fairly wide age spectrum in Japan. The kids because the teen cuties get to kick plenty of tender parts and giggle a lot and the adults for the undercurrent of sly dark humour and nifty dissection of Idol culture. 500 days might seem like a lifetime when you're young.Overall it flags a bit in the middle section but picks up nicely when Miike brings out the coloured filters and bizarre sfx for the last act. I love that Yokohama big wheel and I guess Miike does too because it got a starring role in MPD Psycho. Some of the offbeat stylistic touches from Tennen Shujo Mahn seem to have been taken to their natural conclusion in the MPD series. The digital snowflakes the coloured skies and the heavily treated piano music being prime examples.It's not great compared to the majority of Miike's back catalogue but it's fun to watch whether you have a thing for asskicking teens in sailor suits or not. The two female leads are decent actresses and considering that most of the cast were making their screen debuts they all turn in fairly decent performances. One or two toecurlingly awful transformation scenes notwithstanding.".

	schema:reviewBody "This sequel to Miike's own Tennen Shojo Mahn literally Heavenly Girl Mahn was filmed in 1999 the same year Miike did Dead or Alive and Ley Lines. It couldn't be more different from his yakuza offerings though! Tennen Shojo Man Next differs from the first film in the series in that it has supernatural elements  vampires to be exact! The plot concerns a group of schoolgirls led by the cute Mahn who confront a modeling agency run by bloodsuckers. The vampires are of course only after virgins which leads to some typically for Miike offbeat humor like the scene in which a father tries to rape his daughter while she's sleeping in order to keep her save. That and a discussion about vibrators is further proof that Japanese TV and US TV are not very much alike. As far as I'm concerned that's a good thing.With a running time of nearly 3 hours the film does get a bit boring at first but a fastpaced finale make up for that. Also quite noteworthy are the SFX which are pretty impressive for a madeforTV flick.While Tennen Shojo Mahn Next is definitely not as demented as Audition Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer the open minded Miike fan should find lots of things to like here. Great fight choreography the girls fight the vampires with kungfu decent acting cute girls some gothic atmosphere and the typically crazy sense of humor Miike brings to almost all his films. If you ever find a copy with English subtitles make sure to check it out!".

As far as I'm concerned that's a good thing.With a running time of nearly 3 hours the film does get a bit boring at first but a fastpaced finale make up for that. Also quite noteworthy are the SFX which are pretty impressive for a madeforTV flick.While Tennen Shojo Mahn Next is definitely not as demented as Audition Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer the open minded Miike fan should find lots of things to like here. Great fight choreography the girls fight the vampires with kungfu decent acting cute girls some gothic atmosphere and the typically crazy sense of humor Miike brings to almost all his films.

All in all that skewed Miike vision gives the film more appeal than it might have had in lesser hands. But I would recommend at least 11 of his movies before this one.".

A movie which got huge slaps in the face by critics pointing that this isn't more than something stoners would make for other stoners and myself who never touched weed or any drugs.Even so I liked Surfer Dude. Better to say I loved it. Because it helped me rethink what is important in life and what isn't.The main character Addington represents everything that people living in the cage of the consumer  mass society can only dream about or should be dreaming about.He is the free man part of and living with nature. Not a 9 to 5 office worker like the most of us not someone having only twentysome days off a year. Not working for the profit which actually goes to other one's pocket he is living for living enjoying life experiencing the mystery or magic of nature.There is a big contrast in the movie. The artificial vs the real. The video game and reality show versus the real surfing and life under the sun. Inside and outside.Addington is like a creature from another world but at the end of the film it feels like he is the one from planet Earth with the goat shepherd and the fisherman and on the other hand we who made the fields chessboard looking made the trees stand in order and in the exact same distance from each other in the forest we are the aliens or robots. He is the relaxed one we are the frustrated ones. He does only the positive things and none of the negative ones not even for money. Not feelin' it. Not into it. This thing is double stated with the soulSeoul people scene after the cast at the very end of the movie.Actually I recommend Surfer Dude for those who feel frustrated after work or feel like there is more to life than doing overtime for surplus production.Yes the plot is simple but has important questions. I accept the statement that the flow of the story is very slow too. And overall it could be a little bit better like everything else.But the stills are beautiful. And in its slow way it gives me a long smile instead of periodic laughter.Chill out with the movie dude. And think about your life for a minute.".

Once the conflict is set up it's mostly abandoned and when the resolution comes it's abrupt and shamelessly contrived. The story is resolved within a span of 5 minutes at the end and nothing that comes before has any bearing on it. Also despite the claimed genre of comedy this only barely qualifies. Aside from a few funny lines here and there this is really not a funny movie. It doesn't even seem to be intended as such. Perhaps it was supposed to be a surfing movie instead which it might have accomplished if not for the remarkable lack of actual scenes involving people surfing.This is more like a long stoner fantasy. Really it's like seeing the dream of a passedout stoner. You can just see one waking up and going Dude I just had this dream where I was Matthew McConaughey only I was like this famous surfer and then these corporate dudes were trying to bring me down but I didn't care and decided to sit on the beach for a couple months. Or to draw another comparison it's like listening to an hour and a half of psychedelic music in that the sober people in the room will be bored but the stoned people will see all kinds of depth and colors.This seems to have been made by stoners for stoners. The only reason I can come up with for this getting made is that it was written greenlit directed and in the end only appreciated by people whose minds have been burned out by too much sun and too many drugs. It's so slow and uneventful that you could watch it and follow the story accurately while simultaneously doing your taxes.But hey maybe I just don't have enough laidback beach bum in me to appreciate something like this. It was after all a goodlooking production with good acting lots of hot women in bikinis and a couple without and pretty beach scenery. Though again if like me you insist on things like an actual story and interesting events occurring in your movies you're probably best off skipping this.".

I surf and have for 20 years. I know a lot more surfers who are like these guys than aren't! All these guys whining about this not being real in regards to surfing need to lighten up a bit. Surfing used to be a lot of fun until it became mainstream and overcrowded. That's why I usually paddle over to the next peak to get away from the crowds even if it's not as good. This movie is more about a guy who loves his lifestyle and having it threatened by extinction than anything else. Take example from Tyler Durdin and just let go. Let go of expectations and you might just find a gem right under your nose.".

Surfing used to be a lot of fun until it became mainstream and overcrowded. That's why I usually paddle over to the next peak to get away from the crowds even if it's not as good. This movie is more about a guy who loves his lifestyle and having it threatened by extinction than anything else. Take example from Tyler Durdin and just let go. Let go of expectations and you might just find a gem right under your nose.";

Instead of clever dialogue and an engaging plot we are treated to lots of stoner lingo tight shots of girls' asses and plenty of topless scenes thrown in for good measure.

Remember those Burt Reynolds movies in the 70's that basically had no plot but gave Burt an excuse to make a film with his pals? This is Matthew McConaughey's homage to those.

Like the waves though it is good not to force this movie. It will come to you some day in the TV when you are back from work tired and in need of something laid back. You don't have to spend a penny to see this movie. This is its central message good things are for free. Well almost you have to have a TV. Another good think is the view from the almighty ocean. Yes the shots of the sea and the waves will always have a calming effect on us it is scientifically explained. The long beaches the sand the sun Willie Reed are natural elements that relax us. The good parts of our world. The lead is in most natural meaning always stoned. I never seen a more stereo typical view of a pot head but with a hint of control in the weed consumption. He smokes it not the weed him. What is bad about the movie? Well it is not a serious provocative film for cinema lovers. Surfer dude is like the guy in school that you know you'll never have something in common but respect his different way of seeing things. The plot is not multilayered or anything and the ideas are not explained in detail or in depth. Theories and ideas and intentions of the characters are just what it is. What is good about surf? What is good about the wind... The lines are poor and the actors are just there except of course Woody who is always a pleasure watch.If you want meaning you can find it anywhere. Many say there is no meaning in this movie. Well i say you can find meaning in rock standing still if you want to. There are simple meanings about capitalism and retrieval to nature and stuff like that. The only meaning is not to over analyze this movie. After all it is one more movie that talks about not selling out to video games for money and still the movie product is out in the cinemas trying to make some money! In its defense it doesn't try so much to sell itself with big explosions and romance but it is happy just to be out there. After all it was a bust selling only a handful of tickets. I watched Surfer dude last night in the TV and i enjoyed it for what it is. A movie that doesn't expect anything from you and you should do the same for Surfer dude. Let it be and you never know when it will come to you...".

This user stated The movie starts out giving you the gut feeling that they are faking it that they are some how cheesing it up to make fun of a horrible stereotype. He goes on to say he will spite Matthew in his death bed so I don't take what he says to heart too much BUT I really believe he couldn't be further from the truth. Mr. McConaughey knows that this role didn't require acting at all it was absolutely genuine. Matthew in real life not the movie lives out of a trailer traveling the nation! He'd rather be out enjoying the beauty of nature than be holed up in a huge luxurious mansion in Malibu something he could obviously afford. The trailer's name is 'The Canoe' which he named after a gift he'd received from an Elder Squamish Indian in a trip of his to Vancouver Canada. Also a couple years back I remember hearing Matthew didn't cooperate and was arrested for being too loud while playing his Bongo drums smoking cannabis in the nude with his buddies. I mean come on! This dude epitomizes the Egalitarianistic and downtoearth role that he plays in Surfer Dude. The film doesn't have mindblowing visual effects stomachtwisting suspense or an ingenious plot. If that is what you're looking for don't watch it. Wait until you're in the mood for a down to earth flick. Man this movie is a coastline journey. It makes you want to drop everything and go to the beach or go experience something new beautiful and pure. A film doesn't have to have academy awardwinning performances to do that for you. It just has to hit home on a couple levels. This movie did that for me. You can watch this more than once rewatch with your friends get a good laugh and learn some simplistic yet valuable life lessons. It's got some onelinersgreat quotes in it some gorgeous females beautiful beach scenes hairy buds and phenomenal music. If you like the ocean the sun good times friends and you can take the good out of a situation then I really recommend this movie. After the third time seeing I can still say it has left me in a great mood every time. You can talk and laugh with friends while watching because you don't need to listen for any plot twists or turns. It's a good time. Oh and I do repeat check out the soundtrack to this movie! Great songs by Xavier Rudd and Mishka. Coastline Journey  Mishka The Mother  Xavier Rudd Come Let Go  Xavier RuddHope this helped Hunter".

Matter of fact I rented the movie from my library on a 25 cent charge with the intent to have a good laugh at it and maybe get in with my wife on a Mystery Science Theater 3000 style pokeandjab job. As it turned out by the near of the end of its slim 82 minute running time we felt the same way it's not hateworthy. It's simply too filled with wellintentions to simply stomp and kick the crap out of. While one can argue a lot of misplaced egotrips go that way i.e. M. Night Shyamalan I didn't really sense hubris or too much faulty technical craft going on.It's simply what it appears to be a bunch of surfer dudes and I include in that group the filmmakers and McConaughey got together after many years of prep you read that right many years like seven according to the DVD makingof and made a movie for themselves and the California surfer community. Indeed there's been a minor cult that has risen in California around the movie screenings spring up with masses of dirty and stoned surfers trudging into the theater ready to soak up the waves. At least that's my assumption having never been to the California surfing community nor a surfer's cult movie screening. I can't help but wonder if it was for the 'plot' or the 'comedy'.So why isn't the movie hateful? For one thing for all of his incessant Idon'tneedtowearashirtness McConaughey is a likable guy as Steve a guy who has a craving for a wave all the time every time it's possible. There is not much conflict to speak of except this either Steve rides the wave or he doesn't and for much of Surfer Dude he actually doesn't ride waves but rather try and fend off a corporate leech that wants to sign him up for a reality TV show gig. That's basically the whole movie. Oh and Willie Nelson shows up as a goat farmer who smokes lots of doobs of course and Woody Harrelson pops up from time to time as a uh manager of sorts who smokes a lot of doobs of course and is sometimes hard to differentiate from McConaughey if not for the shirt situation and uh other actors like Jack's father on Lost.Here's what it comes down to there are plenty of totally cringeworthy moments scenes where laughs are attempted and fall flat and some lazy cinematography and music and a story that is so easy to read through you know who every character is and what their destination will be within ten seconds of seeing him or her and that goes for miss wannabe Baywatch star too. And yet it's also a laid back movie for a niche crowd that doesn't try to please to audiences that aren't meant for it. Maybe I wasn't meant for it either and I do like some of these actors and comedies with stoners and surfing and waves and uh virtual reality plots hatched by... oh what the hell it's a retarded puppy of modern movies. It may be stupid but it's still a puppy!".

For one thing for all of his incessant Idon'tneedtowearashirtness McConaughey is a likable guy as Steve a guy who has a craving for a wave all the time every time it's possible. There is not much conflict to speak of except this either Steve rides the wave or he doesn't and for much of Surfer Dude he actually doesn't ride waves but rather try and fend off a corporate leech that wants to sign him up for a reality TV show gig. That's basically the whole movie. Oh and Willie Nelson shows up as a goat farmer who smokes lots of doobs of course and Woody Harrelson pops up from time to time as a uh manager of sorts who smokes a lot of doobs of course and is sometimes hard to differentiate from McConaughey if not for the shirt situation and uh other actors like Jack's father on Lost.Here's what it comes down to there are plenty of totally cringeworthy moments scenes where laughs are attempted and fall flat and some lazy cinematography and music and a story that is so easy to read through you know who every character is and what their destination will be within ten seconds of seeing him or her and that goes for miss wannabe Baywatch star too. And yet it's also a laid back movie for a niche crowd that doesn't try to please to audiences that aren't meant for it. Maybe I wasn't meant for it either and I do like some of these actors and comedies with stoners and surfing and waves and uh virtual reality plots hatched by... oh what the hell it's a retarded puppy of modern movies. It may be stupid but it's still a puppy!";

	schema:reviewBody "Surfing dude? You bet! Woody Harrelson is an acting chameleon! Every time the camera lens focuses on him he becomes a different character. I think that's what makes actors interesting and Woody does it on the level of a skilled consummate professional. In this film Woody shows his comedic side and he does it as his hilarious best! I'm very much impressed by Woody's versatility.What I like about this film is that it's laid back you enjoy the scenery the waves and the babes. The film makes me feel like a surfer bum and I enjoy every minute of it! Steve Addington aptly played by Matthew McConaughey has a dream to become a surfer in his very own customdesigned kind of Eden. The continuity in the film is purposely confused in order to give the viewer a feeling of Addington's initial frustration. His dream does not work out to his satisfaction in the film's beginning. But thankfully midway through the film a 'mermaid' saves the day and Addington's dream sees a delightful 'climax' if you'll forgive my unfortunate choice of words. Matthew has sex appeal and he shows it but not in a narcissistic way. Both Matthew and Woody show their love for the environment and when the film ends I just don't want to come home from the beach. It is obvious that Woody Matthew and the entire cast had a great deal of fun while making this film. It becomes a delightful and somewhat zany surfing party and the viewer is cordially invited to participate in the fun. Unlike Tropic Thunder 2008 there are no 'inside jokes'. Every move is caught by a camera lens and the viewer is always 'let in' on each happening.The film takes me personally back in time. And it is a such a refreshing memory! I can almost hear the Beach Boys singing and 'the Gidge' Sandra Dee is no longer lost. This film is my kind of paradise and I rank it an 8 out of 10. Grab a surfboard smell the salty air and let's go surfing!".

I surf. He knows that he will get by even without the money. That is until the waves dry up. California and the entire pacific coast goes flat. Add suffers what can only be described as massive withdraws coupled with delusional psychosis.The morale of this story is 2 fold. 1. Find what you love and do that. 2. Be careful of what you love brother cause it can drive you mad!I would recommend this movie to dudes dating someone who loves Matthew McConaughey. Dudes who like to surf. Dudes who hate corporate America. and yes dudes who smoke the reefer.AND its not all about the chiseled body of McConaughey there are plenty of beach bunnies to check out during this movie.".

I surf. He knows that he will get by even without the money. That is until the waves dry up. California and the entire pacific coast goes flat. Add suffers what can only be described as massive withdraws coupled with delusional psychosis.The morale of this story is 2 fold. 1. Find what you love and do that. 2. Be careful of what you love brother cause it can drive you mad!I would recommend this movie to dudes dating someone who loves Matthew McConaughey. Dudes who like to surf. Dudes who hate corporate America. and yes dudes who smoke the reefer.AND its not all about the chiseled body of McConaughey there are plenty of beach bunnies to check out during this movie.";

Of all the strides the image of surfing has made this movie sets us all back. There are many professional surfers that are articulate and professional unlike Mcconaughey's character smoking dope and talking like Spicoli. Mcconaughey's acting skills are beyond this role. I personally know surfers who are lawyers doctors business owners firefighters and many other professional occupations yet this movie portrays surfers as a bunch of loser stoners. There is no plot to speak of in Surfer Dude and the character development is weak. To top it off the movie has a flat spell for over 2 months in California. The Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle doesn't even have a flat spell that long much less the Pacific ocean with all the groundswells that traverse it. With the lack of surf in the screenplay we also suffer the opportunity to even see actor face imposed surfing footage in the film. Even Blue Crush was more accurate and respectful to the sport of Surfing than this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts with an man talking about his journey to achieve his dream of opening a pet cemetery in the south bay of San Francisco. We meet the people who help him investors friends pet lovers. We also meet the guy against him the guy who makes a living out of disposing of dead animals. This is the first part of the film. The second part of the film we meet a family that runs a successful pet cemetery called the Bubbling Well Pet Cemetery. We meet the father the head of the business his wife the moral supporter for a lack of a better definition and we meet the two sons involved in assisting in operations one is a former insurance worker the other is a business admin college grad. This is the basic outline of the film. And this sounds kind of boring maybe. But boring it is not. If anything slow at times. Thats because the camera is usually completely still and people are positioned in front of the camera talking into it. What is interesting is how when these characters talk they let loose and go on tangents exposing their world views usually in the context of pets and what we see is the humanity of these seemingly regular people their musings on life and death companionship love filial duty. For instance the first man with the pet cemetery idea talks about how you can't trust people how if you turn around they might stab you in the back but his dog would never do this because you can trust your dog. The dead pet disposal guy rants about and is surprised at the emotional connection people have with pets as though it was something he just discovered in his line of work and his line of work is treated by him as just a job not anything controversial. And the sons of the successful pet cemetery owner one is a motivational speaker. He talks about projecting ideas of success and refraining from using negative words with his little daughter when she has done something wrong. And the other son talks about his musical aspirations and how he found out what love is in college and then found out about the hard break up afterwards. Erol Morris succeeds at exposing the layers of peoples in a real light sometimes showing the contradictory and absurdness of peoples personalities and yet also showing the genuineness of people and their intentions. At times the film is comical at times very serious and other times sad. Morris is a keen observer of human behavior and this film illustrates this very well. For some local history from the southern SF bay area for an interesting look at peoples views on very common human issues we can all relate with and of course on pets see this nice movie. 8 out of 10.".

Both trying to fill a need I got the vibe that when Floyd McClure talked about that specifically he was really talking about the emotional hole left in people's lives by a departed pet. Rather than a hole in one's wallet or just the hole in the ground.Evidently the first part of this took place darn close to where I live these days Los Altos CA! Indeed there is a Gates of Heaven cemetery up by Rancho San Antonio but I think that's just for us twolegged critters.While this definitely had some clever editing a couple of times he turned on a word beautifully from one interviewee to the next there was a lot of strange miscellany left in the film. I call to the witness stand the lady who loaned her son 400 for a car but never sees him any more. Additionally the two squabbling ladies of Los Altos. Fascinating to watch and more of a precursor to Morris' First Person show worth catching if you can! He just kind of sets the camera down and let's folks go awhile...like a confessionaldiary as much as his latter day interregatron.Somehow whether by coaxing them with a Coors or just quietly sitting and filming Morris gets people to really expound on whatever details of their life seem to really matter to them. A couple of the pet couples are placed before tall images of flora? Not sure of the significance.The most touching moment is the filming of the little tombstones for a variety of pets all with some heartfelt little sententia or sweet goodbye. Putting it on film in a way makes these even more immortal.Not sure how people who don't have any pets at all will react to this. I watched this with our 11year old Wire Fox Terrier but he zonked out tends to prefer Bollywwod?. But I'm sitting there thinking of his mortality and the proposed 3K charge for cataract surgery and being a bit torn between loving my pet deeply versus calculating the cost of him. I guess the rendering man is important he did all he could to wipe the smirk off his face having clearly jumped the shark on the pet v. food debate. And I mean putting food on his table...as much as quasifood like bonemeal and byproducts. For him it was just a job clearly and he seemed perplexed how anybody could see it otherwise. But bottom line all of these people were making their living including Morris as the filmmaker off the death of pets. We want our lives to be filled with more than making our rent and paying our bills and one way we try to do that is through our relationships with pets. This film's alright not up there with some of Morris' other work. Oddly comic at times. Like jeez the pet cemetery called Bubbling Well that sounds like a code phrase for a rendering plant. Ick.

	schema:reviewBody "I picked a bad time to watch this movie. I just finished watching Napoleon Dynamite where it's unclear whether we're supposed to relate to the eccentric characters or pity and despise them. That film got me to thinking about other movies that seem to cast a condescending eye on the people involved specifically Waiting for Guffman a fake documentary about smalltown folk who want to take their communitytheater production to Broadway and American Movie a real documentary about people making a cheap horror film.And now I watch this documentary which tells the story of two pet cemeteries in California. And again it's unclear how the filmmaker feels about the people we meet or how we're supposed to feel about them. Errol Morris who followed this initial success with several other wellregarded documentaries  like The Thin Blue Line and Fast Cheap  Out of Control  has an unobtrusive style here. He simply points the camera at people and let's them talk in long rambling monologues. We never see or hear him but of course his attitude is reflected in what material he chooses how he edits it  and in the subject of the movie in the first place.We first meet Floyd McClure a paraplegic with a dream to create a pet cemetery. One inspiration is the death of his collie years before and the other is the local rendering plant which turns animals into glue. He rages against this hellish factory not seeing the irony in noting that he couldn't smell the meat on his own table for the stench emanating from the place. He realizes his dream only to see it fail. Then we visit a successful pet cemetery run by a father and his two sons. One is a frustrated musician nursing a broken heart. The other is joining the family business after selling insurance in Salt Lake City. Throughout we also meet the people who have buried their pets.Morris allows a lot of his subjects to cast themselves in a bad or ridiculous light. The man who runs the rendering department admits lying to the public whenever they have a beloved zoo animal. And though he's very defensive about his line of work he can't suppress himself from calling the people who grieve over their dead pets moaners. The older son at the successful cemetery is shown in his office in which trophies line the desk and the shelves behind him. He claims a job applicant was impressed and inspired by the trophies. Throughout he endlessly spouts clichs from motivational books.Oddly I didn't cringe as much at the people who spent thousands of dollars to bury their pets. Somehow they came off as silly yet ennobled by their love for their animals.Since this movie we've been treated to an endless stream of reality TV and Christopher Guest mockumentaries and Dave Letterman bits where the average guy on the street is put in the spotlight only to be made a fool of. I know a lot of people see this film as beautiful and full of interesting philosophical questions  Roger Ebert who puts this on his alltime ten best list prominently among them. Maybe I was in the wrong frame of mind but I didn't enjoy it.".

It had a Guffman air to it which is to simply let the people talk and expect you to laugh.  But is wasn't.  I listened extra hard and started to see that it clearly did not show any comedic elements but I still didn't know what to make of it.  This film requires multiple viewings but I don't really wanna see it again.Ebert is right this film is about much much much more than a Pet Cemetary.  However it is no where near one of the 10 greatest films of all time.  Ebert must have lost a lot or pets or have a fixation on that movie theater in the sky.".

	schema:reviewBody "They're not like us entirely but they're just like us in an essential way they want to have a good solid profession yes it is as owners and workers at a pet cemetery and they loved their pets. There's an essential part of the doc where a woman talks about the 'spirit' and how when a body dies the spirit must go elsewhere. Although the topic of if there is heaven or hell or any kind of afterlife can be debated till days end a film like Gates of Heaven Errol Morris' debut gives the very clear notion that an animal does have a spirit because the human being that cares for it has a level of love and compassion and just sheer avoidance of loneliness that a spirit must be present. Life becomes all the greater of importance when loss comes as a cycle comes for those who have loved and lost and it's just the same with animals as with people. You don't have to be an eccentric like some may be or may not be depending on your definition of eccentric to know what life is at the least when it's gone.There's not one person in Morris' bizarrely funny and expertly unobtrusive look at the lives and work of those involved with pet cemeteries who is without some kind of spirit and in all their slightly strange the guy who works at the meat processing plant sort of mockable in the Christopher Guest sense there's one guy the exinsurance agent son of the cemetery worker who goes by the Double As and Double Rs as rules for life and has trophies on his desk when he had job applicants for encouragement and cheerfully quaint the old lady who complains about her son and wishes she could drive appearances on film they're very much alive. It's not exactly a satire though one might think it was an offkey one if it were a mockumentary. 'Gates' is layered in ways that many documentaries try to shy away from and at the same time Morris has a definite knack for presenting the people objectively or however much a documentary filmmaker or any filmmaker can present them 'as is' in their testimonials while having a very subtle hand with subjectivity with the camera. It's obvious Morris didn't have much money to make the film it took Herzog and eating his shoe to help get the film released but there are little moments of invention like the spinning newspaper to the headline or the unflinching angles on the explotofland for the dead pets which is now next to a highway or just simple pans or having one man the musician son of the Harberts family listening to the music he's recorded.Morris has lots of things like that going on but it's really all a series of stories and personal accounts of two sides of pet cemetery workersowners the completely heartfelt and crippled Floyd McClure who due to not getting all the paperwork right despite having all of the heart he could muster up lost his pet cemetery and all the animals were dug up. Seeing this gentle man of conscience is one part of Morris's layering as he's a sincere individual who truly loves the animals he worked to find resting places and despises the equally passionate crafty but laughable rendering plant owner and with a fatal flaw at work that he trusted animals more than people. But then there's the mixed flip side of the Harberts family who took the dead pets previously buried with McClure where the patriarch is a consummate professional his kids either have not much interest in the outside world except their own creativity the musician or have accepted their lot in life as a worker for the family the exinsurance salesman. These are the kinds of people that one would've not really seen on Six Feet Under if only because in this case suggestion from the interviews says probably more than the deep character analysis of the show.And Morris deftly mixes these two stories with some people who've had their pets buried or knew people who had their pets buried at the cemeteries. The woman who says the part about the pet having a spirit is one but there's also the woman who tries to get her little dog to sing or the one who talks about the grief she had with the death of her dog and at the end of her tips to help save one's dog the husband says neutered. There are closeups of the words on the gravesites of the animals that ring this tragiccomic tone of the film ever so much that there's enough in just having a memory left of remembrances for these creatures that lived as short as two years and as long as sometimes twenty for those who were closest to them. Gates of Heaven while not quite Morris's best film Fog of War and especially Thin Blue Line are higher up though not by a lot is a worthwhile 80 minute observation of the shaky but absolute reasons why that people need pets and in effect just need each other period.".

The film does not work as a philosophy lesson check out any work from Terrence Malick instead for that and it does not work as a comedy sometimes it is unclear if the people are serious or just playing games with the filmmakers.

	schema:reviewBody "If this had been the first Errol Morris documentary I'd seen then perhaps I would have enjoyed it much more than I did. After having seen possibly his best film MR. DEATH a magnificent documentary by Morris I think my expectations for GATES OF HEAVEN were higher than what it delivered.This film is a documentary about pet cemeteriesthe people who own them run them patronize them or who are in affiliated industries. Like other Morris documentaries I've seen there is no narrationthe people just talk and talk and talk. While this can work very well in this documentary it created a piece with little sense of direction or purpose. Sometimes what you saw was pretty interesting or insightful and often it just seemed like pointless rambling. I really wish Morris had taken the more poignant moments and fleshed them out some more. In particular the rather sad old lady towards the beginning who just ranted about how her son takes advantage of her and how she's all alonethis was VERY powerful and compelling but then the scene abruptly changedleaving me feeling rather annoyed. Another interesting person was the guy at the rendering plant. While I agreed in part with him and his sensibilities he sure came off as a bit of a jerk and I wanted this to be pursued as well.Overall this is a very hit or miss film with many dull momentspeppered by some that are actually a bit intriguing. My advice is to try some of Morris' other documentarieswith experience they certainly got better.UPDATE Apparently director Werner Herzog told Morris that he'd eat his shoe if GATES OF HEAVEN ever got released. And since it did Les Blank made a strange little documentary in which Herzog talks A LOT and eats his shoe. I saw it on Turner Classic Movies recently.".

Fortunately producerdirectoreditor Errol Morris handles this particular subject  a pet cemetery the cemetery's owner and employees and the various people who have buried their deceased pets in the cemetery  in a commendably delicate subdued and respectful manner thus making this strikingly offbeat and original oneofakind feature a genuinely remarkable achievement. Morris wisely shoots the numerous folks he interviews in an appropriately plain prosaic and unadorned straightforward style allowing these engagingly colorful individuals to speak at great length sometimes quite clearly sometimes rather haltingly always directly to the camera. There's a welcome and praiseworthy paucity of phony affected pretension and heightened cloying preciousness evident throughout however there's still plenty of authentic heartwrenching sentiment to be savored in this picture. It's here in spades and is made all the more poignant because it's presented with such great unwavering conviction and a real sense of purpose. While this highly unconventional is definitely out of the ordinary it's thankfully never really bizarre or grotesque.

More specifically it focuses on the cemeteries at Foothill Memorial Gardens in San Francisco and Bubbling Well Memorial Park in Napa. It's probably as famous for being the film that led German director Werner Herzog to eat his shoe at its premiere than anything else as encouragement Herzog had stated he would eat his shoe if Errol Morris ever completed his film he did and Herzog duly obliged. Gates of Heaven takes a slightly unusual approach to its subject in that it deals with it in a determinedly straightfaced manner despite its potential for absurdity and lets the material speak for itself. Morris does not interject nor does he use editing techniques for cheap laughs taking people out of context. In this way a film such as this requires more work on the viewer's part than for example a documentary by Michael Moore which has a clear agenda and makes it obvious to the viewer what it demands they should be thinking. Gates of Heaven on the other hand just presents interview footage and allows us to form our own opinions on what we see.The subjects are the pet owners and the cemetery people. It's made up mostly of static shots of people talking. In all honesty despite the commendable intentions this minimalist approach to the material is a problem in that quite a lot of the interview footage is rambling and tedious. It isn't often either very enlightening or particularly funny. The idea I think must be to take a strange scenario but to use this as a means of looking at the people involved more than anything else. The result is quite mixed as the characters involved aren't in all honesty always especially interesting and the pet cemetery subject probably requires a more inquisitive approach in order to extract more interesting material. So while I respect the philosophy of Morris in this endeavour I can't say I especially get much out of this film.".

Of course this being Morris Gates of Heaven is not really about cemeteries but about the mediocrity horrors and vacuousness of middle class America.What's staggering is how precise a tightrope Morris walks. On one hand the film seems to be about pet cemetery rackets and the predatory nature of businessmen who exploit human fears and frailties the love of animals fear of death etc. On the other it's mocking humans for being stupid and easily duped and yet on the other yes this freakish film has three hands this is a grotesquely moving and very human piece of work Morris celebrating the eccentricities of pet lovers and small towners without surrendering to phony warmth. As a result the film possesses an odd blend of horror humour and heart.The film mostly consists of interviews slow pans and talking heads Morris interviewing embalmers cemetery owners bankrupted businessmen and people whose pets have just died. We watch as these people simply talk Morris not asking questions providing narration or adding any stylistic flourishes. It's Frederick Wiseman meets David Lynch.What's interesting is the sheer oddness of the people Morris meets and how utterly normal their oddness is. Whilst a docmaker like Marcel Ophuls adopts a confrontational style when preying on his subjects Morris instead treats his camera as a confession booth his subjects anxious to share their wisdom and eager to express themselves. One woman speaks for example of establishing a deep and meaningful relationship with her poodle another frets about being unable to find the right exit off a highway whilst others deliver incredible monologues peppered with strangely chosen words and intonations. The end result is the world of Lynch's Blue Velvet only take much further Norman Rockwell facades peeled away to reveal every shot is artfully composed by Morris designed specifically to emphasise a kind of glossy banality a veneer of vapidity something utterly ordinary sad silly desperate depressing and yet touching.Incidentally this is the film which prompted Werner Herzog to eat his shoe.

In that sense the two films that most closely mirror it are fictive films Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs Started Small and Tod Browning's Freaks. One might also put it in league with the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest were it not played or shot straight. In fact this is the film that Werner Herzog ate his shoe over. Morris had no money to finance the film and Herzog told him to do it anyway and promised Morris that if he made a film Herzog eat a shoe at the premiere ala Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. The act was subsequently made into the short subject film Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe.The film's premise is that there are people who will pay thousands of dollars to bury their pets like humans. OK I'm a pet lover a cat lover but I've never done so. I've never viscerally understood why we bury humans. A corpse is a corpse is a corpse. As long as it is disposed of cleanly who cares? Yet the film starts off with a disabled old man Floyd McClure who tried to start a pet cemetery south of San Francisco the Foothill Pet Cemetery in Los Altos because he was haunted by the memories and smells of an animal rendering plant he visited as a youth as well as the death of his collie as a boy when it was run over by a car. Manifestly lacking any business sense the man soon lost his business as well as did several other investors one schlemiel lost thirty grand in 1970s cash! and the animals four hundred and fifty pets had to be exhumed and moved to another better pet cemetery the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park in Napa Valley which has designer plots run by a family of even weirder folk if possible.The weirdest and most hypnotic person on screen is an old lady who sits in her home's doorway and divides the film's halves between McClure and the Harbertses. She is Florence Rasmussen the poster girl for human strangeness and she distractedly and digressively paints her tale of woe and her no good grandson whom she's going to get money back from and his whorish exwife whom she calls a 'tramp.' What this has to do with dead pets is anyone's guess although she ends her soliloquy by lamenting the loss of a black kitten and suspecting that a kitty serial killer is on the prowl. She is sort of the addlebrained female equivalent of what Danny Harberts will likely end up as. Yet despite all that there is a genuine movement of emotion that the film conjures as well as some truths even if as trite as the quote which ends the last paragraph.Perhaps the greatest emotion conveyed is when dumb old Floyd McClure says 'When I turn my back I don't know you not truly. But I can turn my back on my little dog and I know that he's not going to jump on me or bite me but human beings can't be that way.' And this is why the film is worth watching. It is not even remotely a great film but it is an interesting document something that like a truly great film such as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story could be sent on a spaceship for aliens to find in a million years and tell something of what a real human was. The fact that such qualitatively disparate examples of an art form can reach the same level of inner.dare I say it? truth is one of those grand ineffables that makes art worth indulging sort of like the last shot of Gates Of Heaven of the Harberts' growing dream cemetery at dusk. On and on it just is. Then like life and dream it all ends. So too humanity. Alack?".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know how Errol Morris ever became so respected when he produced garbage like this.This movie jumps from person to person never making much sense.It's basically just a record of stupid people saying stupid things.The first idiot was a pear shaped loser with the IQ of a pear.The man is 48 years old and doesn't look a day under 100.He said things like worsh and they don't waste nothing multiple times.His only purpose in the movie is to try to make the guy from the rendering plantthe only guy in the movie with a functioning brainlook evil and he fails consistently.So he mentions being charged with a crime and then they just move on and we never find out what happened to him.The focus then moves on to another mental midget.This guy blames the pet explosion on human birth control.He says birth control makes women get jobs and if they don't have a baby they need to get something to fondle.He goes on to say then the woman's parents need to get pets because the lack of grandchildren leaves them nothing to fondle and rear.With thoughts like that rattling around in his empty head you know his offspring are going to be real winners.Those fools are the next to grace your screen.They are both college graduates who couldn't function at real jobs.The older one was too stressed out to sell insurance and the other one got dumped by his girlfriend so they both had to move home and let daddy support them.The older son goes on to explain how a graph chart works and how hard it is to drive to vet offices no wonder insurance was kicking his ass.The other one babbles about music and we are treated to way too much of his terrible guitar playing.At one point he plays a recording of his noise while we are treated to a view of his pot plants.And I didn't even mention all the idiot pet owners.One old lady cries about how she raised her grandson and he doesn't do anything for her.She claims to have bought him a real nice car but later admits she only gave him 400.But what would you expect from a person who doesn't even realize they had to raise their grandson because they failed at being a parent the first time?The rest of the pets owners can't shut up about how they will see their pets in heaven and it's just so sad that people can be that stupid.The only reason to watch this is the guy at the rendering plant.".

A third name which has made some of the most influential interesting and informative documentaries is Errol Morris. Morris even created a new kind of camera system for his documentaries called the Interrotron which the filmmaking industry continues to use today.This Interrotron allows Morris and his subjects to discuss a variety of topics through the actual camera lens itself. In Morris's more recent films this technique is used more often than not but one thing has remained constant which is Morris relies on straight up interviews rather than a narration to tell whatever story he is trying to tell. But before Morris's bigger known films such as 'The Thin Blue Line' or 'The Unknown Known' he made a couple of amazing documentaries back in the late 70s and early 80s called 'Gates of Heaven' and 'Vernon Florida'. The documentaries put Morris on everyone's map as a talented filmmaker to look out for in the future. These two early films set the stage for the unique and uncompromising film career of Errol Morris.'Gates of Heaven' follows a couple of families and their pet cemetery businesses in California. Without the use of a narrative or even narration or a score Morris only interviews these families and other people about their thoughts on putting their beloved pets to rest. The result is a charming funny and bittersweet outlook on the relationship between humans and their pets. Through these interviews Morris gets a glimpse of what life means to the common people of America and how business and industry affect our emotions and decisions in these difficult times. It seems like a strange subject to document but when Morris found out that one of these pet cemeteries had to close down and the hundreds of buried pets had to be dug up and moved to another location he thought it would make for an engaging film where people might think of their pets as a member of the family and deserve the same rights as humans. I know I agree with this.".

I certainly wouldn't go that far on either account but I think there's no question that the film has a unique charm that draws you in no matter what your feelings are in regards to people treating pets better than humans. I thought some of the most interesting aspects were early on when we hear from the owner of the cemetery as he discusses what made him decide to do this. It certainly wasn't for the money but instead for just needing a beautiful place to put pets to rest. It's also interesting hearing from the people who actually pay a lot of money to have their pets put into a coffin and given a place to where they can visit them. I thought some of the stories were rather sad as it's clear these pets were the only thing in these people's lives and now they're gone. Some of the stuff with the elderly people were extremely sad. While I found the subject matter to be interesting I can't say I was completely won over by it. I think at times the people really go off topic on things and just seem to ramble on.

Nonetheless I went to see Big Fish 3 days before its release in Canada with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts ears and especially our eyes with each cartoonfantasylike scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year he is Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty the dollhouse sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology all you have is a very simple story and therein lies the heart of this film that one can create their own legacy the story of my life. Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies but through the art of storytelling and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our stories that we are immortal.Go see this movie bring the kids bring your date bring your parents! It is for everyone...everyone who appreciates a visually and emotionally beautiful irregular story about a regular person's life. 5 stars!!".

	schema:headline " Tim Burton's Surprise Heartwarmer";
	schema:reviewBody "I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be Edward Scissorhands or Batman II?  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy a dark thriller or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish. Big Fish combines Burton's unusual humor with a heartwrenching story of a fatherson deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUVsized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son Will estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer. Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a housesized giant a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth military service during the Korean War morphs into a behindthelines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping a truly weird emotional state. Burton deals with mythic themes in Big Fish.  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the bigfishinasmallpond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues customers he's a traveling salesman and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly It's A Wonderful Life he still manages to show how all of us  even the little fish  have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love  unrequited and reciprocated  control almost all of Ed's many adventures. The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot Finney Helena Bonham Carter and McGregor are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long suffering wife  and she still looks great! you believe she has had a long and loving life with FinneyMcGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scenestealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch. I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.".

	onyx:emotionText "I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be Edward Scissorhands or Batman II?  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy a dark thriller or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish. Big Fish combines Burton's unusual humor with a heartwrenching story of a fatherson deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUVsized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son Will estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer. Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a housesized giant a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth military service during the Korean War morphs into a behindthelines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.

	schema:reviewBody "I've had high hopes for this movie since I first heard about it some time ago.  After all most of the Tim Burton movies I've seen barring Planet of the Apes have been really wonderful.  To say the least Big Fish did not disappoint me.  The story  by no means complex or suspenseful  was simple enough to allow the viewer to really take in the fantasy and mythology in Edward Bloom's tales.  One didn't need a surprise ending or secret identities to make this film enjoyable.  Rather it was the simplicity and universal nature of the story that made it interesting. While some reviews have mentioned that the film can seem choppy at times I didn't see this at all.  The transition seemed smooth and logical and while sometimes I found myself wishing for more scenes of younger Edward Bloom I never felt bored by any of the movie.  Nothing seemed to 'drag'. I was also quite impressed with the quality of acting in nearly the entire cast.  Billy Crudup didn't really hit his stride until the end but he was tolerable through the first threequarters of the movie.  Albert Finney did a great job of portraying a lion on his last legs bigger than his body but unable to show it.  Jessica Lange was amazing and added the emotional oomph that Billy Crudup often failed to provide.  And while Ewan McGregor's role was not particularly difficult at no point did he overplay the character and his accent to my ear anyway never slipped. Though this wasn't as dark as Sleepy Hollow or as bizarre as Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice Big Fish definitely had the Tim Burton touch in its scenery.  The colors  whether dull for Elder Bloom's time or bright for Younger Bloom  matched the mood perfectly and everywhere you looked especially in Bloom the Younger's timeframe there was something else to marvel at.  Tim Burton fans will not be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every other year you get a movie that oozes magic and charm. Think Chocolat. Think Amelie. Think What dreams may come. Perhaps even Being John Malkovich. And this year it's time to think big... Big Fish to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood the emotional reaction of the audience is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still there's no way around it in a proper review We meet a disillusioned young man and his father a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate firsttime listeners and children. Unfortunately there's barely any of those left as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile we hear his life story as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably bestknown for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker more gothic visuals Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish then is a new direction for him. Yes it is eye candy or perhaps even eye Hagen Dazs. But this time the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means a great story or collection of stories and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great watch the audience. At key moments everyone was chuckling or laughing at others I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes this is heartwarming stuff that a colder more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And better yet he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor playing the father in his youth may not have much more to do than smile be charming and sustain a Southern US accent but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange playing the aged father and mother respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.After cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes it managed to enchant the audience but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace  it takes its time just like a good storyteller would but perhaps leaving behind the fivesecondattentionspan MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series or multipart TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of Big Fish The Animated Series or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish  a franchise or a single movie. It definitely is more deserving of praise awards and viewers than any other movie released during the past six months including LOTRRotK.".

Here they come under the guise of hilarious situations and extremely poignant compassionate moments. Essentially this is a humanist fable dressed in deep poetic magic realism because it's the story of a man who is dying and who has one last thing to do.This man is Ed Bloom Albert Finney and he's over the years become estranged from his son William Billy Crudup because William has gotten increasingly jaded from these tall stories Ed tells him over and over again. We can call it the syndrome of someone who has lost touch with his inner self and has accommodated himself to the norms of Society and what It considers normal and acceptable.In his last days he recollects his memories from his much younger days played by Ewan McGregor when he hadn't found his calling until he came across a witch Helena Bonham Carter who foretold him his future. From then on he had what can be called a hell of a life going from seemingly implausible adventure to another. These exaggerated tales infuriates William until a crucial event forces him to acknowledge the essence of the matter  Ed Bloom's reality  and in one overwhelming tour de force of direction William clumsily at first but then more sure of himself creates his own storytelling which I won't talk about. Suffice it is to say that its transition into reality is one of the most beautiful and moving sequences I've seen.This is by far one of the best films Tim Burton has made in his curriculum of offbeat films. Solid performances are in leaps and bounds from the main actors to minor players  the sad expression of a circus clown who has to shoot Ed because the wolf he is about to kill is actually Amos Calloway is a haunting shot for example. Jessica Lange's quiet scene in a bathtub filled with water hugging Ed and weeping. Alison Lohman caught in a frozen moment of time which enhances her beauty. The moment when William reenacts his own story and carries Ed out of the hospital which segues into the otherworldly emotional climax. A beautiful ensemble piece with otherworldly images this is only second to LORD OF THE RINGS a distant cousin in absolute beauty and simplicity of its message.".

Expediting faulted emotions is a sink or swim endeavor and in this case Big Fish swam No pun intended Metaphorically all of these accolades are a way of saying that the ending to this film was very powerful and cohesive...surprisingly and effectively so!! I give Big Fish a five star rating and a perfect 10!! This website ranks it as one of the top 250 films ever made!! I totally concur!!";

	schema:headline " Tim Burton's career equivalent of Forrest Gump is an ultimately rewarding adult fable with some beautiful cinematography and memorable ideas...";
	schema:reviewBody "It was either Cheaper by the Dozen The Haunted Mansion or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either it was bad enough in last year's Daddy Day Care so I chose to see the more adultoriented of these three films and I'm glad I did because Tim Burton's Big Fish is a marvelous filmfull of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them tobut actually have a purpose here.Pee Wee's Big Adventure is simply one of the best films of all time and you can quote me on that. That was Burton's breakthroughthen came Batman which was very good but slightly lacking in substance and then came Edward Scissorhandsone of my sister's favorite films a beautiful love story and an eerie fable...but just missing a very small ingredient that kept it from becoming a great movie perhaps the same with his film Ed Wooda very good film but not exactly one of my alltime favorites.I have my doubts as to whether anyone other than Tim Burton could have pulled off Big Fish. Here's a movie I expected I would dislike and come away feeling a little bit emptybut that's only partially true. The movie doesn't quite exceed on the level it tries to but as a film it's one of the best motion pictures of the year.It stars Albert Finney as Edward Bloom an old man who loves to exaggerate tales of his past and pass these on to his friends and family. One night his son William Billy Crudup tires of hearing the story about how he caught the town's largest fish in a lake using a gold ringso he ignores his father for three whole years until his mother Jessica Lange informs Will that his father is dying of cancer and that he wishes to speak with his son one last time.Drawn back to his old Alabama hometown with his new wife Will finally learns the truth about these socalled exaggerated storiesand we as the audience get to see them in flashback mode. It begins with a young Edward Ewan McGregor a big fish who was just too small for his own town and had to move away to search for brighter prospects. On his journey he comes across an assortment of odd fellows including a Gentle Giant a failed poet living in a heavenly town named Spectre and a strange circus ringleader who also happens to be a werewolf.All of these stories that Edward Senior tells his family relate to their current positions and to call the film simply beautiful would be what John Candy once said is the understatement of the year. My particular favorite character was the poet living in Spectre played by Steve Buscemi a wonderful supporting actor who I had no idea played any role in this film prior to viewing the opening credits and seeing with Steve Buscemi appear on screen.Buscemi's poet has been working on a particular poem for twelve years whilst living in Spectre. Can I see it? asks Edward. It says Roses are red violets are blue I love Spectre. But it's only three lines long! says Edward. That's the reason you don't show your work to people Buscemi says.Danny DeVito also appears as the circus ringleader and the most regretful scene in the film is that in which we see him naked from behind. I shudder at the thought. But for what it's worth DeVito's second reteaming with Burton is magnificenthe's a supporting character but the film certainly benefits from his performance.Like all of Burton's films Big Fish teeters on the edge of greatness but it never quite crosses the line. This is a marvelous film full of warmth kindhearted fables and beautiful cinematography and it's one of the best films of the year. It's certainly a unique film experience unlike any you've ever had before. Unless of course you've seen Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Then some of it may look a bit familiar.Still I enjoyed it more than The Lord of the Rings. And I could actually relate to this film.Trivia note Edward Scissorhands was a Tim Burton film. The main character of this film is named Edward. Sometimes when people pronounce his name with their thick Alabama accents it comes across as Ed Wood. Mere coincidence or something more? We may never find out.4.55 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:headline " Very sweet imaginative story despite lacking a strong conclusion";
	schema:reviewBody "Will Bloom feels like he doesn't really know his father  his habit of telling exaggerated and untrue stories instead of the truth.  They don't speak for several years until Will hears that Ed is on his deathbed and returns home.  He hopes to find out the truth behind the stories but can only get more of the same without doing some digging.Even having watched the trailer I was unsure exactly what this film was about but I trusted that Burton's imagination would carry it.  Having seen it the film can best be described as being about story telling in that the film is more about the wonder of the stories told than the actual narrative in terms of startmiddleend.  In terms of the traditional idea of narrative the film is not perfect  it is not as meaningful or as satisfying as I would have hoped and this is shown in an ending that although sweet is not as neat as I would have hoped.  However the telling  that's where it is at.The stories told are wonderfully whimsical and amusing like the film states the stories have elements of truth but also be coloured by Bloom to add life to them.  For me it was very simple to get involved in the tall tales and I was held in the spell of Ed's stories easily  even thought it never came to a real' solution I was still captivated by just how sweet and imaginative it all was.  If it sounds like I'm having trouble putting my words together it is because I found the film quite hard to quantify  all I know is that I found the whole experience to be very sweet and enjoyable despite it not really amounting to much in the grand scheme of things.  In this regard the film is a consistently imaginative fantasy film that is gently humorous and outright funny at times.The cast are pretty good.  I was originally a little put off by McGregor's Alabama accent and it took me a minute to get past it but other that his performance was very good and he helped create the film's mood of wonder and whimsy.  I think both McGregor and Finney needed to have that sort of accent  I don't know why but it is a storyteller's accent and it does help the material.  Finney is good and manages to keep the spirit of McGregor's character going despite not being surrounded by the images to support him. The support cast works well whether they be tall giants or wellknown cameos from Buscemi Carter and Devito.  Lange Crudup and Cotillard are all good but it is easily McGregor and Finney's film.Overall some will find the lack of structure and real substance to be a problem  after all this is a film about tall tales and not everyone will be able to enjoy that.  However this is a wonderfully light and fun bit of whimsy that is a lot better than I expected it to be.  While it may not amount to a great deal more than that it can still be enjoyed for what it is  a great fun story!".

	schema:headline " It has no idea what it wants to be";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view his Edward Goreyish surrealism his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant the ugly and the weirdly bizarre and show them in a lovable accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that train wreck you can't look away from feeling Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.Not so this time with his latest effort Big Fish.To tell this nested set of stories Burton assembled a cast that is top notch Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom Albert Finney as the elderly Edward Bloom Jessica Lange as Bloom's wife Sandra Billy Crudup as their son William Bloom with a host of minor roles filled by such notable performers as Robert Guillaume Danny DeVito Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi.  He even includes folksinger Louden Wainwright III in a notsoinvisible role for what reason I cannot imagine and insists on spelling his name incorrectly throughout the entire film's opening AND closing credits. This puzzled me a great deal.In fact I was puzzled many times throughout the film but mostly after when I should have been nodding and smiling and not wanting to wait until it came out on DVD instead I was itching to leave the theater as soon as possible and sat there with a distinct frown on my face when it finally ended.Very few films have made me feel as if I wanted to leave. No matter how bad a film is I rarely walk out on it. Maybe that was the problem with Big Fish it really isn't BAD. It's pretty. But it's also hollow. You keep watching and watching and watching hoping that it will eventually turn into the film you think it should be then it ends and you realize it never will.Basically the story line is simple enough. Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He tells stories about his own life and adventures and entertains for decades with these fantastical talesfirst his friends then his wife then his own son William. But as William grows up he becomes irritated with then angry about these lies that he was told. He wants to know the real fatherthe one that he can't see for all the stories that he feels act as a smokescreen. Yet he cannot get any closer to the truth so he falls away from his father emotionally until his mother phones him to tell him that his father is now dying.So William packs his suitcase and pregnant wife and moves back home to help sort out the end of his father's life. Immediately he is faced with the same stories the same lies the same fantastic tales of his father's adventures and cruelly and selfishly cuts the old man off time after time. He refuses to accept either the stories OR the magic they contain and most of all the fact that they are very entertaining stories. But he is forced to remember the stories as his father relates them to William's wife who seems to be entranced by them and him.As the stories get told we are 'treated' to them. ALL OF THEM. These are not SHORT stories. These stories are long they are convoluted they have many moments that make you want to question Edward as he tells them and they contain many many MANY dead ends that leadand this is the really frustrating partnowhere at all. And they go on and ON.For example take the story about his walk down the haunted road. Edward ploughs his way through mists and trees that grab him literally and strange sounds and ick and double ick!! a HUGE nest of large black jumping spiders !! and a town that shouldn't even exist and these things get barely a mention at all except for the town. The entire time the voiceover is yammering on and on about perseverance. About ANOTHER story that was told earlier. About NOTHING. After several dozen of these sorts of scenes you are left with a feeling that you are missing the pointif you knew where to look maybe it would pop out at you. But it never  does. Because it isn't there. You are constantly trying to reconcile what you are seeing with what you are hearing.In fact if you removed the soundtrack and voicetrack from this film entirely and just WATCHED it you'd be so puzzled you wouldn't be able to make sense of the plotbut what you would have was an entirely different impression of what was really happening!  This feeling of being pulled in two different directions is not only unsettling it's highly irritating.The film has two major flaws in addition to this.  First it is about the Southto be precise Alabama.  There is an ingrained southernness about the movie that needs to be there because there are several references in it that would only make sense in the Southern U.S.  Yet Burton uses three British actors one from New Jersey and a New Yorker and only ONE person has even a HINT of an Alabamian accent. He doesn't go so far as to allow his Brits to speak with their normal accents but they don't do Suth'n either. And neither Albert Finney NOR Danny DeVito speak in consistent accents. Devito wavers from exaggerated hillbilly to his usual Noo Joisey intonation and Finney can't decide where he's from. This smacked of really shoddy dialogue coaching and did nothing for the continuity.Second the film is FAR FAR TOO LONG. It needs a good edit. The pace is snaillike the acting sometimes seems improvised and directionless. And it just has no idea what it's supposed to be ABOUT most of the time.There are many little oddities all through the film a street shown briefly in one scene mirrors one seen in Edward Scissorhands The 'martial arts' in the Chinese army scene is idiotically choreographed the twins seem to change size in their various scenes as does the giant. The banjo man on the porch in Spectre is not only playing the song from Deliverance he IS the young man who played the banjo in Deliverance! And why Louden Wainwright? Did Burton owe him a favor? He's no actor. He sticks out like a sore thumb among those who ARE actors.There are things that make no sense visually OR plotwise. Why does the kid steal shoes? Who or what is that naked fish woman? How can so many barefoot people dancing on grass make so much noise? What's up with the bits about Edward's need for waterabout feeling dry? He soaks in a tub fully clothed! Even some of the camera angles are downright awkwardas if an amateur camera operator had been given free rein to be as arty as he wanted to be.And probably the weirdest one of all Tim Burton has made another movie about someone named Edward.None of these little items or the other dozens of such things are explained or illuminated in the film especially not at the end when one might expect them to become clear or at least say why they cannot be clear. They are simply there. And they build irritation throughout the course of this very long film and the pacing is slow slow slow. Never have I felt so much like getting up and leaving a film just to take a break from it all.This film isn't a fantasy. It's not an allegory. It's not a drama. It's not a comedy. It's not even a decent Tim Burton film! The characters aren't all that likeable or believable if Jessica Lange had ducked and nodded and smiled ONE MORE TIME in that film I'd have thrown a tomato at the screen. And NO ONEI repeat NO ONEshould have to see Danny Devito NAKED OR repeatedly watch Albert Finney slurping.I really wanted to like this film. From the previews it looked like an entirely different film than the one I saw. It looked lighter more magical more surreal.

	onyx:emotionText "I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view his Edward Goreyish surrealism his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant the ugly and the weirdly bizarre and show them in a lovable accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that train wreck you can't look away from feeling Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.Not so this time with his latest effort Big Fish.To tell this nested set of stories Burton assembled a cast that is top notch Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom Albert Finney as the elderly Edward Bloom Jessica Lange as Bloom's wife Sandra Billy Crudup as their son William Bloom with a host of minor roles filled by such notable performers as Robert Guillaume Danny DeVito Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi.  He even includes folksinger Louden Wainwright III in a notsoinvisible role for what reason I cannot imagine and insists on spelling his name incorrectly throughout the entire film's opening AND closing credits. This puzzled me a great deal.In fact I was puzzled many times throughout the film but mostly after when I should have been nodding and smiling and not wanting to wait until it came out on DVD instead I was itching to leave the theater as soon as possible and sat there with a distinct frown on my face when it finally ended.Very few films have made me feel as if I wanted to leave. No matter how bad a film is I rarely walk out on it. Maybe that was the problem with Big Fish it really isn't BAD. It's pretty. But it's also hollow. You keep watching and watching and watching hoping that it will eventually turn into the film you think it should be then it ends and you realize it never will.Basically the story line is simple enough. Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He tells stories about his own life and adventures and entertains for decades with these fantastical talesfirst his friends then his wife then his own son William. But as William grows up he becomes irritated with then angry about these lies that he was told. He wants to know the real fatherthe one that he can't see for all the stories that he feels act as a smokescreen. Yet he cannot get any closer to the truth so he falls away from his father emotionally until his mother phones him to tell him that his father is now dying.So William packs his suitcase and pregnant wife and moves back home to help sort out the end of his father's life.

	schema:reviewBody "A flat mug of beer that should have been a bubbly flute of champagneI was very frustrated and disappointed by Big Fish . clearly a lot of time money and talent went into the production of the movie but for me it never really came together.At its center Big Fish is a movie about storytelling.  Yet I think that its fundamental flaw is that its stories are poorly told.  The older Ed Bloom is clearly meant to be a delightful raconteur who charms his wife his daughterinlaw friends and acquaintances with his tall tales. Yet it's hard not to agree instead when his son accuses him of being an embarrassment after Dad takes the floor at his son's wedding to tell obviously for the 100th times his elaborate and version of the story of his son's birth.   As played by Albert Finney Ed Bloom does seem more like the drunken uncle from whom you try to wrest the microphone than the Aesop or Garrison Keillor if you prefer of his day.But it's not just Bloom who can't tell a story sad to say Tim Burton seems to suffer from the same deficiencies as his protagonist.   In Burton's hands Bloom's stories seem always to be more about the production design than they are about any human emotion or contact.  As always the LOOK of Burton's film is impressive but in most of the stories we have nothing but the design to which to react.  The actual people involved are either too flat or too deliberately odd for the viewer to relate to.   As the younger Bloom Ewan McGregor stands around with a charming little grin on his face but with no real connection to the action around him  he plays Bloom like a genial optimistic idiot.  So things like Spectre Bloom's war service even his courtship of Sandra all come across as incidents rather than important emotional points in Bloom's life.   We are therefore left feeling much as Will does  that Bloom's stories are just so much blarney being spread by a man who's determined to keep his emotional life hidden.SPOILERS AHEADBecause the storytelling is oddly flat it is difficult for the viewer to participate in the catharsis that Will is supposed to experience at the end of the film.  When Will helps his father finish his storyfinish his life in the last few scenes obviously we are meant to believe that Will having learned that there was more fact to his father's stories than one would expect had somehow emotionally connected to his father after all.  But frankly I don't see how.   In most of the stories we are told Bloom's only emotional quality seems to be tenacity  he's going to marry Sandra he's going to get home from the war he's going to fix up Spectre. Emotionally he seems as indifferent to those he meets along the way  Norther Amos Karl and especially Jenny  as he seems to be to Will. Blooms connection to his wife does seem to be the one exception. Certainly although Bloom is portrayed as a decent fellow but there is nothing in Bloom's stories at least as they are told here that gives us any reason to believe that Will is wrong to find his father distant and unapproachable. Indeed Bloom seems always to have been a rather selfinvolved lucky hack indifferent to those around him and adept at using cheap sentimentalism to get his way with people.   Sadly even when his son is trying to make some sort of deathbed connection Bloom falls back on the same sort of hucksterism to avoid any real emotion and to coerce Will into participating in a last talltale finale.The sad thing is that I think Bloom's stories were SUPPOSED to draw us in and show us Bloom's emotional depths but fail to do so because they were told wrong.  The last couple of Albert Finney's scenes are actually quite good and would have worked wonderfully if they followed a better film.  If Bloom's stories were better told  i.e. if we were able to feel an emotional connection to his life  then Will's conversion would be both credible and satisfying and the film would I think be a charm.Miscellaneous asidesJessica Lange is wonderful as always.   What a shame she's sort of wasted in this.With VERY few exceptions people who aren't from the South just SHOULDN'T attempt southern accents.  As usual they are awful and all over the place here.Nothing is helped by the fact that the big fish is crappy CGI and looks fake.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I heard that director Tim Burton Batman Edward Scissorhands Planet of the Apes Sleepy Hollow directed this tale I assumed that an extraordinary saga would unfold on the screen as something unnatural and weird yet entertaining.  Weird it was yet it often failed to convey a story.  Rather it made some attempts at reconciling Edward Bloom's Albert Finney as the dying old Bloom and Ewan McGregor as young Bloom tall yarns he would tell repeatedly to anyone who would listen and especially to his son Will Bloom Billy Crudup.  Will soon learned to disbelieve all of his father's fantastic stories and ultimately became totally estranged from his father whether as a result of shame or the lack of intimacy and connection with his father.  His mother the eversmiling Sandy Bloom Jessica Lange lends little of her stellar talents to this wooden role.The fables as they unfold are truly implausible and often border on the ridiculous.  Clearly one is left with the same mindset as the son Will that Edward is a huge bullster who may have trouble separating fact from fantasy.  The story or stories are told in confusing flashbacks sometimes in a true Tim Burton fantasy and sometimes in what appears to be a vaudeville style.  The characters are indeed colorful and weird such as the ringmaster of the Circus Amos Danny DeVito and the Colossus George McArthur.  It borrows heavily in fantasy style from other recent fantasies like the Truman Show Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings yet does not come close to telling a story with clarity and style.The film jumps from clarity to confusion and back to rationality and clarity.  We are touched that the son ultimately appears at his dying father's bedside and attempts to find out who his father really is.  There are many seeing the picture who will be quite taken by its symbolism fantasy and fatherly machinations.  For myself this film could have been written in a much more coherent manner and revealing much much more of the possible intimacy that can exist between father and son.  The comedic routines are quite funny and Burton seems to have the timing down quite well.  However its humorous sequences are not enough to carry the film or to carry the story from scenetoscene.The ending is predictable early in the film and clichd at best.  Helena Bonham Carter's talents are wasted as Jenny the child becoming adult who had her eyes on Edward since he was a young man.  She also plays a more interesting role as a witch in this flick but it also falls flat and gets placed on the shelf with the rest of the cast that have not been adequately developed.  This is a picture that you will either love or simple discard as too much weirdness and lacking coherence.  Obviously you know where I stand.Opens everywhere December 25th in the Bay Area.".

The story or stories are told in confusing flashbacks sometimes in a true Tim Burton fantasy and sometimes in what appears to be a vaudeville style.  The characters are indeed colorful and weird such as the ringmaster of the Circus Amos Danny DeVito and the Colossus George McArthur.  It borrows heavily in fantasy style from other recent fantasies like the Truman Show Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings yet does not come close to telling a story with clarity and style.The film jumps from clarity to confusion and back to rationality and clarity.  We are touched that the son ultimately appears at his dying father's bedside and attempts to find out who his father really is.  There are many seeing the picture who will be quite taken by its symbolism fantasy and fatherly machinations.  For myself this film could have been written in a much more coherent manner and revealing much much more of the possible intimacy that can exist between father and son.  The comedic routines are quite funny and Burton seems to have the timing down quite well.  However its humorous sequences are not enough to carry the film or to carry the story from scenetoscene.The ending is predictable early in the film and clichd at best.  Helena Bonham Carter's talents are wasted as Jenny the child becoming adult who had her eyes on Edward since he was a young man.  She also plays a more interesting role as a witch in this flick but it also falls flat and gets placed on the shelf with the rest of the cast that have not been adequately developed.  This is a picture that you will either love or simple discard as too much weirdness and lacking coherence.  Obviously you know where I stand.Opens everywhere December 25th in the Bay Area.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive unique brands of images he puts into his films and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does though not always successfully Planet of the Apes proved that.  Now there's Big Fish a film loaded with visual spectacle and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling using both makeup sets and CGI at his disposal and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.This man is Edward Bloom played by both Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor and they both deliver wonderful work here as the dying Bloom still telling stories of adventures and the young Bloom playing them out respectively. As do Billy Crudup as Edward's son William who's grown weary of his father telling the story of his birth involving a catch of a big fish among many others and all he wants now at his deathbed is the truth.  Jessica Lange is also dependable as Edward's wife Sandy the love of each other's lives.What's so alluring about the world Burton creates based on the novel by Daniel Pierce which I imagine must be loaded with vivid description is that he simply builds on the world Edward created for his and his family's amusement.  Stories like the visit to the town of Spectre and that town's most known poet Norther Winslow Steve Buscemi in one of the film's highlighted supporting roles the years spent working for nothing in the circus for Amos Danny DeVito another note of interest just to know more about Sandy whom he sees frozen in time his stint in the war etc.  All of the people and environments that are reveled are done so with many visual effects but they're the kind that help build on Burton's vision instead of depleting it.  Even if a scene may have dialog or acting that could be taken as over the top the storytelling is on par with some of Burton's best work i.e. Batman Edward Scissorhands and even the somewhat recent Sleepy Hollow.  The best thing that can be said about Big Fish even to those who might not like it is that the journeys and stories taken in the film by real and 'elaborated' real characters generate a film as a delight for all ages. That it also has comedy along with drama grounded in a sense of humanity for both is also a feat accomplished well by the actors.  To me this is one of the better films of the year.  Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Big Fish...What made me watch this film in the first place was solely based on the fact that Pearl Jam got nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. That's what got me to the theatre the first time. What made me goto the theatre two more times after and purchase the DVD the second it became available was the greatness of the movie. It's not often that a love story so deep comes along. This movie encompasses two types of love between a father and son and a husband and wife. But it's not a sappy romance. How Tim Burton did this proves how genius he is. Though the movie itself seems so farfetched it could not be more real. If you've already seen this movie and like it you'll know what i mean. For those who don't know whether or not to watch it brings me to the next point. Someone who doesn't even like the story to this movie could still love it. It's one of the few movies I can tell people has some of the greatest imagery. Sure movies these days have cool effects and stuff but with Big Fish you will be captivated by the use of colour and parallelism. From the town of Spectre to the cool carnival everything is so magical. Now onto two very important things that give this movie the 100 rating i gave it and why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes Acting and Sound. Surely everyone knows Ewan McGregor. But it's his supporting cast that make this film amazing. The chemistry between Billy Crudup William and Albert Finney older Edward Bloom is amazing. Though they have few scenes together the ones that they do have together are very touching and again extremely realistic. Jessica Lange older Sandra Templeton and up and comer Alison Lohman Sandra Templeton suit their respective parts perfect and they both compliment each other by their characters. They we have the always funny Steve Buscemi no one could have played his part better and Danny DeVito who is also incredible in this movie. Helena Bonham Carter also provides a very unique role in this movie... her mystique and subtle beauty suited this movie perfect. Then came sound. A great original score a fantastic soundtrack and an amazing and I'll say it again AMAZING original song by Pearl Jam made this whole movie come together in perfection. Elvis Presly Buddy Holly and the Allman Brother to name a few of the old school music in this movie are an excellent choice to showcase what time periods we look at in this movie. All in all Tim Burton Danny Elfman and the casts best pictures in my opinion. Just a side note Billy Crudup hasn't appeared in many films but to mention two of his other movies Almost Famous and Sleepers seems appropriate. He's casted in some great movies if ya ask me. Thanks".

	schema:reviewBody "How much is 70000 worth to you? I'm sure that right now 70 grand would come in real handy. But is it worth numerous beatings getting shot being run over and having your toes mashed by a hammer? It is to Porter.I'm sure you're aware of the plot to this film vengence old flames and mucho violence but that barely scratches the surface of this brilliant little noir. Whilst the story is basic the nuts and bolts used to make it are complex twisting and not quite what you expect. For a start there are the characters. No good guys. Not one. Porter is a criminal. He's not even a particularly nice one. He's a killer a thief a thug a gambler a cheater a liar and I bet he doesn't even pay his taxes. Likewise everybody else. Sadists murderers corrupt cops drug dealers gang members mobsters hookers. They're all here in their various shades of bad.The success of this film relies on two people Gibson and screenwriterdirector Brian Helgeland. With the lead gleefully playing against his nice guy image Porter is as nasty as they come but still retains such charm and Gibsons trademark grin that not for one moment do you dislike him. He's cool in a way that Bruce Willis' Jackal never was. He quietly slipped across continents with hitech equipment in various guises waiting for his moment. Porter just walks into the hoods house with nothing but a revolver and asks for his money back. A lot of the comments I've read say that Porter is mean. He isn't. He'll just do what it takes to get his money back. He has nothing to loose so why not do it anyway. Porter is who Riggs would be if he'd never met Murtaugh. Out of control against massive odds but just crazy enough not to give a damn.Helgeland shows real talent as a director in his first time outing. As a scriptwriter he's always been in the upper classes with a talent for mixing unrepentant violence with uneasy humour. Here he shows he can tell a damn good story along with writing it. Nothing happens the way it's supposed to. We're used to good guys threatening to kill but always really bluffing. Porter isn't. He'll ask for what he wants he doesn't get it BANG you're dead. People die at the wrong time too. Characters that are supposed to last until the end die in the middle while minors that only just arrive survive only to get whacked by the finish anyway. The motivation is all wrong as well. 70000 is chump change to these people. The mobsters are wearing suits worth more than that. But Porter wants that and nothing more. He spends most of the film correcting people who think he's after more.While based on the same source material as Point Blank Payback is nothing like it stylistically. The first used understated violence. Payback goes for the jugular and rips it out with copious amounts of rheseus negative. It's hard to see this film working without this combo of star and director. If you had say Sylvester Stallone or Nicolas Cage and Richard Donner or Joel Schumacher in charge you'd just have a bunch of nasty people doing nasty things with none of the ghoulishly comic touches that make Porter cool. Be thankful it's the combination it is and then go and see it. If you like thrillers you'll love this.".

But is it worth numerous beatings getting shot being run over and having your toes mashed by a hammer? It is to Porter.I'm sure you're aware of the plot to this film vengence old flames and mucho violence but that barely scratches the surface of this brilliant little noir. Whilst the story is basic the nuts and bolts used to make it are complex twisting and not quite what you expect. For a start there are the characters. No good guys. Not one. Porter is a criminal. He's not even a particularly nice one. He's a killer a thief a thug a gambler a cheater a liar and I bet he doesn't even pay his taxes. Likewise everybody else. Sadists murderers corrupt cops drug dealers gang members mobsters hookers. They're all here in their various shades of bad.The success of this film relies on two people Gibson and screenwriterdirector Brian Helgeland. With the lead gleefully playing against his nice guy image Porter is as nasty as they come but still retains such charm and Gibsons trademark grin that not for one moment do you dislike him. He's cool in a way that Bruce Willis' Jackal never was. He quietly slipped across continents with hitech equipment in various guises waiting for his moment.

Porter's singleminded nononsense determination to get what he sees as justice for himself strikes a chord and has you rooting for him right to the end. This film rarely lets up on the intensity and gets better as it goes along. It will make you laugh and cringe at the same time but you won't want to take your eyes off the screen for a second.

Some have hated this film just because of what it was and that's a shame for them that they can't enjoy a film that neither glorifies nor trashes the underside of life. In a weird way the main character Porter who was Walker in the Lee Marvin film played this time by Mel Gibson who is almost as good as Lee Marvin. Nobody could be better than Marvin in this kind of role has a kind of decency code of his own even though it is more than a bit twisted. After all in a world inhabited by criminals the rules change significantly and so once has to either adapt or find a way out. Porter does both in both versions.No sense in rehashing the plot. Suffice it to say that it is about a crook who got burned and wants what is coming to him and gets even along the way. Besides the plot has been recounted by so many better reviewers than myself. I can only say that in Point Blank the ending is a bit more ambiguous. A precursor to the films of the 1970s.It's always hard for me to rate one film version over another. It is almost impossible to not want to in my mind at least mix and match actors in roles. James Coburn played the same part as did Carroll O'Connor in the original and they are both perfect while being so different. After all they were both accomplished actors. And maybe I could have done without a lot of the SM and BD scenes in the newer version but I chalk that up to the changes in the world since the 1960s.Long before there was a Quentin Tarrantino there were great directors like Don Siegel Sam Peckinpah and Sam Fuller who were as tough as nails and not just some fan who knew how to use the best of all of these guys brilliant touches and add some sick jokes. But directorwriter Brain Helgeland does spectacularly well with the material while the new cast shines in their roles almost as though they weren't acting but living the parts. And that goes right down to the underrated David Paymer as a pathetic hustler who could easily have been played in earlier times by an Elisha Cook Jr. as he did with the Wilmer role from The Maltese Falcon yet Paymer does so with more humor. It is hard to make one root for people so lacking in morals but director writer and actors manage amazingly well.Both Payback and Point Blank are instant classics that should be considered as such. And God bless the memories of Lee Marvin and John Vernon both in the original Point Blank version. Such fine thespians will be sorely missed. Fortunately their memories are on celluloid and other mediums to be enjoyed by many more audiences.You might have guessed I really love these two movies.".

It takes a relatively simple plot and makes a bit of cinematic poetry out of it. And if I was forced to compare Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson's performances then I'm sorry but Gibson would lose big time. However Payback is a much better film than I thought it would be. There are sufficient differences to make the story interesting and though it is told in a much more straightforward and dare I say 'safe' way than Point Blank it is a very well made film and tells a compelling story well.

He goes up the ladder little guy to the top boss to finally get his money.Gibson gets beaten up several times and even gets tortured in one toes crunching scene.

However the city scenes are bleak a la Batman.Despite the above I still found the movie good enough to watch several times. Most people like a simple revenge story which this really is and there is dark humor in here too. The other characters are interesting particularly the one played by William Devane.

It's a simple play on perspective not often utilized in the movies. Usually the hero is A HERO white hat and all even with a few quirks or deficiencies to his character. Not so here. And the key to the whole picture is buying into Mel as a bad man all despite his many years in heroic roles beforehand. It works very well especially in the beginning where it really needed to. There's an early scene during the credits where Mel forces himself to smile in a mirror as preparation for putting forth his 'best face' to a teller at a bank. One gets the impression this really is a man unaccustomed to smiling a sour angry man. The early scenes also recall the beginning of Miami Blues that being a criminal swooping into town and wasting no time in bringing a little terror  hardship on certain select bystanders. There's a danger in a film sense of satirizing such moments too much to the point of slapstick comedy  rather than dark comedy which it really is. But Mel doesn't mess around here he means business bashing scum left  right and blowing 'em away as he moves up the ladder of an organized crime organization. The rest of the cast is topnotch by the way. The casting directors must have had a field day on this one. Then Mel himself is beaten the whole theme of the movie seems to be about pain how much one can stand how much one can dish out. It ends up being very cathartic. The cinematography also helps this picture the photography is quite starkultracrisp adding to the 'punch' of the whole show. The lines on Mel's face are deeper than ever he seems to carry years of pain there. And years of guilt maybe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aristotle once that good theater evokes catharsis in its audience. Catharsis meant the creation of characters whose fear torment or happiness the audience could identify with.  I disliked PAYBACK because I couldn't identify with any of the characters and the thing that really scares me is to see how many people did identify with the brutish nasty little thief who stars in this movie.Porter Gibson is a professional criminal who plans a brutal robbery but finds himself cheated out of his own share of the loot.  Now Porter will very unsubtly go about getting his share of the loot back. Not the whole haul mind you but only his own share the share that he stole fair and square.Don't you know somebody like Porter? Haven't you always wanted to do something like what Porter's doing?  Aren't you itching to find out whether Porter outdoes all his fellow bad guys and gets away with his money?  I don't know about you but for me the answer is no to all three questions. If Porter were at least intelligent about how he goes about his scheme he might be worthwhile watching but in fact his tactics are incredibly dumb and succeed only by fiat of screenwriter and director.  For one example Porter stupidly gives away his greatest advantage the fact that his adversaries don't know he's alive.  In another scene Porter asks a Hulking Tough Dude to show him to his criminal boss.  The Hulking Tough Dude refuses so Porter rips the HTD's earring out.  The HTD immediately whips out a gun and shoots Porter dead.  No wait that's what would really happen.  Because we are living in HayesAbascalHelgeland Land the HTD meekly leads Porter in to see the criminal boss.I have difficulty believing that anything of Brian Helgeland the screenwriter of the excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL survives in this film since he was sacked before it was done.  It is much easier for me to blame Terry Hayes cowriter and author of such stupidity as MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME and Paul Abascal who was final director.  Whoever may be to blame obviously wanted to take his source material a Donald Westlake story variously alleged to be either POINT BLANK or THE HUNTER and turn it into just what we all needed another take on PULP FICTION.  He got all the bad parts of Tarantino's hit right the mindless senseless bloody and sadistic violence the characters with no appeal or redeeming features whatsoever and the darkerthanblack humor that generally hurts too much to laugh at.  However while the dialogue in both films is mostly meaningless Tarantino's had a spontaneous natural sound to it it may have been empty but it was at least realistic.  Here the lines sound contrived as well as empty.  Gibson's voiceover narration is omnipresent and irritating especially when used to reveal points about his character that are already intensely obvious since there is only one point to his character that he is an unmitigated S.O.B.It takes a lot to earn this disgusting film its one lonely star.  The dark cinematography by Ericson Core conveys the amoral world of Porter convincingly.  Gibson is always watchable though it's sad to see him play such a onenote role.  There is a second note Gibson's romance with Bello but it's so tackedon and reeking of cliche that it doesn't count.  Gregg Henry's Val Resnick the antiantihero is appropriately slimy.  Kris Kristofferson plays a character named Bronson who probably by design resembles the Bronson we all know and who is vastly more sympathetic than Gibson.  James Coburn reprises his dapper villain role from MAVERICK which is always fun.  But best of all is Lucy Alexis Liu as Pearl the sadomasochist to whom all the violence is just a game.These few bright spots failed to distract me from the underlying fact that PAYBACK is a lousy film with a lousy script and at times is damn near unbearable to watch.  The one thing it taught me is a valuable but very disturbing lesson the viewing public has enough sadists who think that screaming bloody agony is laughoutloud hilarious to make dreck like PAYBACK commercially successful.  It's scary.Rating  out of .".

	schema:reviewBody "Payback is the third interpretation of Donald E. Westlake's novel The Hunter 1962 written under the pseudonym Richard Stark. A crime thriller novel the first of the Parker novels. The other films are John Boorman's Point Blank 1967 starring Lee Marvin and Ringo Lam's Full Contact 1992 starring Chow Yunfat. Payback was directed by Brian Helgeland and written Brian Helgeland screenplay and Terry Hayes screenplay theatrical cut. Cinematography was by Ericson Core and music was by Chris Boardman. The film stars Mel Gibson as Porter Gregg Henry as Val Resnick Maria Bello as Rosie Lucy Liu as Pearl Deborah Kara Unger as Lynn Porter David Paymer as Arthur Stegman Bill Duke as Detective Hicks Jack Conley as Detective Leary John Glover as Phil William Devane as Carter James Coburn as Fairfax Kris Kristofferson as Bronson Theatrical Cut Sally Kellerman as Bronson Director's Cut Trevor St. John as Johnny Bronson Theatrical Cut Freddy Rodriguez as Valet Manu Tupou as Pawnbroker. There are two versions out there the theatrical release and the director's cut.I've seen both versions. The best film version in my opinion would be roughly the theatrical release with the narration and blue tint then go with the director's cut but keeping the blue tint to the ambiguous end. I'd keep the beating also. The film looks great in a Noirish way. It homages beautifully classic noir with it voice over narration the heavy use of stylistics and locations that evoke cinematic memory. Gregg Henry is impressive he evokes the spirit of Dan Duryea.Unfortunately the film goes somewhat slowly off the rails with various scenarios i.e. Porter cutting a gas line under a an 80s Lincoln which would be physically impossible to do you can't squeeze under that type of car no way and the unneeded extraneous additions of dominatrix Pearl Liu  and the Chinese Tong machine gun battle where it veers off into Action film and touches on Tarantino land when it didn't have to a shame. The majority of Films Noir were simple stories when you overload then with action sequences you tip the film past the noir tipping point it becomes more of the Action Genre for me anyway. Give it a fair shake your personal noir tuning fork may accept it more than mine does. Watch also the Film Soleil adaptation of the novel Point Blank 1967 for a comparison same story set in California. I haven't seen Chow Yunfat's Full Contact 1992. Screencaps are from the Paramount DVD. 6.5710".

This dark and delicious film stars Mel Gibson as Porter a former Mafioso who was left for dead by a former running partner and robbed of his half of a heist 70000.00and Porter's singleminded quest to get his money back not concerned with what he has to do or who has to kill to get it. The funny thing about the story is that all the people who stand in his way can't believe Porter is going to all this trouble for only 70000.00...which is chump change where mob money is concerned but this doesn't concern Porter who just wants it back no more no less. Gibson appears to be thoroughly enjoying himself here in one of his most offbeat and engaging characterizations. Effective support is provided by Maria Bello James Coburn Kris Kristofferson Gregg Henry David Paymer William Devane John Glover and a brief but memorable turn from Lucy Lieu. The cinematography is dark and drearyit almost looks like it's in BW but's it notbut it fits the style of the film perfectly.

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly Mel Gibson has had a lot of low points in his personal life that don't need to be recounted here. At the same time whatever you may think of him or his ideas personally you have to admit that generally speaking the man manages to put out some pretty good movies. But as we know every rule has to have an exception. For Mel Gibson as far as I'm concerned Payback has to be that exception.Payback tries so hard  it tries so very hard. The effort that everybody seems to put into making this an exciting crime and revenge story is so hard that to be honest it's almost embarrassing at times. Everything you could possibly think of that could be thrown into a movie like this is thrown into this movie  drugs gun fights beatings torture murder prostitution sadism masochism Chinese gangs organized crime corrupt cops. Think of anything that could be included in this kind of movie and you'll probably find that it's here somewhere. Often in abundance. Thrown together without any real concern over whether it makes any sense.In the movie Gibson plays a vicious con man named Porter. He's been betrayed by his wife and expartner and left for dead while they get to keep all 130000 of a heist they pulled off. But somehow Porter survived and he's out for revenge assisted by an exgirlfriend prostitute of his played by Maria Bello. The entire opening sequence struck me as absolutely ludicrous. Without giving too much away I'd love to know since Porter apparently was left in pretty desperate circumstances how he managed to connect with the guy who was doing the surgery to remove the bullets. And although he's a vicious con we're apparently to believe that he's also rather honest because once he gets started on his quest for revenge everybody keeps offering him the whole 130000 and he keeps insisting that he only wants the 70000 that was actually his share of the original heist.It has some comedy value. It really does. A sort of tongue in cheek quality that  in the midst of all the violence and ugliness on the screen  actually has the ability to bring a smile to your face on occasion. But that doesn't save it. Not even close. 210".

Mel Gibson is playing the role of the antihero made famous by Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson. He is not the bad guy since he kills bad guys but he is not really the good guy either. He is a cold hearted robber with a mission to get the money back his partner stole from him no matter what. He will not stop until that goal is accomplished. That is the plotoutline.

Confidential 1997 some say by star Gibson  replaced by production designer John Myhre who reshot up to thirty per cent of the film including a drastically different ending which included Kris Kristofferson  the torture scenes none of which are present in the director's cut  as a result the film was delayed by over a year because as soon as the original production on Payback finished Gibson did Lethal Weapon 4 1998 before doing the reshoots for this got that? Good. It's perhaps surprising then that Payback is such a good film in fact I think it's a brilliant dark noir thriller that is a personal favourite of mine  has been ever since I originally saw it at the cinema all those years ago. The script by Helgeland  Terry Hayes who is credited with the Theatrical Cut here on the IMDb was based on the novel 'The Hunter' by Richard Stark  is a deliciously dark tale of revenge it's told from the perspective of Porter who is a pretty nasty piece of work himself like during the opening sequence when he steals from a homeless beggar for instance which sets the character up perfectly  I just love the the fact that Gibson's character is a bad guy  you end up wanting him to win it's something very different that I just think works brilliantly. The rest of the larger than life over the top character's are fantastic too from the criminally underused dominatrix played by Lucy Liu to the funny Fairfax played by James Coburn to the menacing Bronson played by Kristofferson. It moves along at a nice pace it has a pretty clever  absorbing plot with some cool twists  turns along with a great ending. I just think it's a brilliant film  it's as simple  straight forward as that.This version of the film has a really muted colour scheme with a blue tint in fact it's not far from being black and white. It's a colour scheme which suits it down to the ground though  is very stylish the recent director's cut is not tinted in this way  the colour is more vibrant. The violence isn't that excessive but it is fairly brutal at times Gibson putting a cushion over someones face  shooting them in the head at point bland range for instance  there's a scene where Gibson is tortured which has a bit with a hammer which will make the squeamish amongst you wince. I didn't like the fact that the dog survived being shot in this version though  more realistically it dies in the director's cut. There are some good action scenes  setpieces as well including some cool sequences with Pearl the dominatrix.With an estimated budget of about 50000000 this is very stylishly made the production design is great  it's a cool film visually. The acting is great as well from a good cast I've always liked Gibson who is apparently the richest actor in the world... maybe I don't like him so much now! Everyone else puts in really good performances too.Payback is in my opinion a brilliant ultra dark thriller with a really cool edge to it. I loved it  thats all there is to it. Director Helgeland  original editor Kevin Stitt got the opportunity in 2005 to compile a 'director's cut' released straighttovideoDVD in 2006 as Payback Straight Up  The Director's Cut reinstating the original ending  a completely new musical score as well as removing the blue tint from the picture as well as other changes this 'new' version actually runs 10 minutes shorter than the theatrical cut.".

	schema:headline " Payback by name payback by narrative but brilliance by opinion.";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with a series of gross close ups some nasty looking surgical tools a grubby glass having a drink being poured into it before being gulped down by a sleazy looking man as a spread chart makes itself apparent on the wall behind him complete with pictures of a fetal nature complete with unborn babies  maybe a sign that this guy does cheap back alley abortions as well. As it happens he's removing a bullet or two from our antihero of the hour someone who lays everything out for us as he lies there on the slab informing us of what was taken from him and what he's going to get back. The item in question is 70000 a score he inherited from robbing the aforementioned Chinese gangsters with partner Val Resnick Henry. The location is an unnamed city a place we first see by way of an extreme long shot as the lead makes his way over a bridge  the city has that appearance of being cut off from the mainland as if this scuzzy hostile crime infused dystopia is somehow disconnected from the normal world.The stark differences between both Val and Porter is highlighted in this one scene they share in which either hostilities are at a minimum or they aren't frantically moving around the screen for whatever reason. They stand street side and watch the Chinese go about their routine. Val is frisky nervous and energetic  his blonde hair and effeminate clothing is in stark contrast to Porter's jacket darkly hued hair and gruff unemotional tone is the polar opposite to that of Val's appearance. Whilst swiping the case Val's sadism becomes first apparent in his beating of the Chinese driver. He utters a line along the lines of The trouble is with kickn' a Chow's ass half an hour later you want to do it again! which foreshadows both a violent and sadistic driven relationship with Pearl Lui a Chinese mistress. This as his foil Val sports a name ambiguous in terms of gender already adding to his dress sense and hair style somewhat out of sorts for a piece of this genre. Later on ideas as to how Val strives to survive in this hostile world arise when certain parallels can be drawn between characters.Payback is quintessential noir a film that ought to be a vital part of any noir cannon despite all the problems disagreements and issues that threatened to run it aground prior to release. The film is a smart highly intelligent and highly enjoyable romp through an unspecified unhinged city in America in which thieves backstabbers liars traitors crooks and criminals rule the majority of the roost. To see it is to experience one of the great films of recent times and one of the more under appreciated films of our time.

	onyx:emotionText "The film begins with a series of gross close ups some nasty looking surgical tools a grubby glass having a drink being poured into it before being gulped down by a sleazy looking man as a spread chart makes itself apparent on the wall behind him complete with pictures of a fetal nature complete with unborn babies  maybe a sign that this guy does cheap back alley abortions as well. As it happens he's removing a bullet or two from our antihero of the hour someone who lays everything out for us as he lies there on the slab informing us of what was taken from him and what he's going to get back. The item in question is 70000 a score he inherited from robbing the aforementioned Chinese gangsters with partner Val Resnick Henry. The location is an unnamed city a place we first see by way of an extreme long shot as the lead makes his way over a bridge  the city has that appearance of being cut off from the mainland as if this scuzzy hostile crime infused dystopia is somehow disconnected from the normal world.The stark differences between both Val and Porter is highlighted in this one scene they share in which either hostilities are at a minimum or they aren't frantically moving around the screen for whatever reason. They stand street side and watch the Chinese go about their routine. Val is frisky nervous and energetic  his blonde hair and effeminate clothing is in stark contrast to Porter's jacket darkly hued hair and gruff unemotional tone is the polar opposite to that of Val's appearance. Whilst swiping the case Val's sadism becomes first apparent in his beating of the Chinese driver. He utters a line along the lines of The trouble is with kickn' a Chow's ass half an hour later you want to do it again! which foreshadows both a violent and sadistic driven relationship with Pearl Lui a Chinese mistress. This as his foil Val sports a name ambiguous in terms of gender already adding to his dress sense and hair style somewhat out of sorts for a piece of this genre. Later on ideas as to how Val strives to survive in this hostile world arise when certain parallels can be drawn between characters.Payback is quintessential noir a film that ought to be a vital part of any noir cannon despite all the problems disagreements and issues that threatened to run it aground prior to release. The film is a smart highly intelligent and highly enjoyable romp through an unspecified unhinged city in America in which thieves backstabbers liars traitors crooks and criminals rule the majority of the roost. To see it is to experience one of the great films of recent times and one of the more under appreciated films of our time.

That's the second problem  in the midst of a revolution Locke receives a dispatch from London and reads it out loud while Elena is in the house.Elena continues to be in love with Locke betraying him at the same time.The acting is very good and Howard and Francis have wonderful chemistry.

	schema:headline " Early espionage rare film set in revolutionary Russia";
	schema:reviewBody "The cast is tremendous in this 1934 Warner Brothers film British Agent. Based on a 1932 book the movie takes place mostly in Russia in the early days of World War I and of the Bolshevik Revolution. My high rating of the film is partly because of its historical value. It depicts very well those events and that time in history. Few movies have been made of these two events in relation to each other. Even with Hollywood changes and the natural nuances of the source writer R.H. Bruce Lockhart in his memoirs the movie has value for the historical events it covers. It also is credible in its portrayal of the culture and people as well as costume and dress of the time. It would be interesting to know how much the characters in the film are based on real people. Some are obvious  Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. But many others have fictitious names. Still some are obvious from people in Lockhart's book. It's not hard to get his connection with the male lead Leslie Howard. In name  Lockhart and Locke as well as in character. Howard plays Steve Locke who is viceconsul to the British embassy in St. Petersburg and Moscow. When the revolution breaks out and the embassy officials are called back to England he is left behind as the sole British representative. He's then the acting Consul for Great Britain to Russia. In real life Bruce Lockhart was Acting British Consul General in Moscow when the first Russian revolution broke out in early 1917. But he returned to England before the Bolshevik Revolution of October. In January of 1918 he returned as the UK's first envoy to the Bolsheviks. His main purpose was to persuade Russia not to sign a peace pact with Germany and to come into WW I on the side of the Allies. That's very close to the portrayal of Locke's character and his movements in this film if not the exact titles he carried. Kay Francis plays Elena Moura. She is the secretary to Commissioner of War Trotsky. She and Locke are the romantic element of this film and it comes across as a believably deepfelt love between the two. Howard and Francis carry off this relationship very well with a respect for each other's ideology. In real life Lockhart did not have this romance but he helped the couple that did. British writer Arthur Ransome had been living and writing in Russia when he met Trotsky's secretary Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. After the end of the Bolshevik Revolution Lockhart helped her get to England. She later married Ransome who became famous for his children's books. Lockhart's life itself is very interesting for his wide travels and experiences. It's every bit as intriguing as this film that is based on a short span of that life. Sir Robert Hamilton R.H. Bruce Lockhart was a journalist author secret agent British diplomat to Moscow and Prague with other travel and business experiences as well. He also played football at Cambridge. He was a secret agent also in his consulate positions in Russia. He was a friend of Sidney Reilly. Lockhart's son Robin wrote the book about Reilly Ace of Spies. It was the basis for the 1983 TV miniseries Reilly Ace of Spies.The rest of the cast in this film are excellent. William Gargan Cesar Romero J.Carrol Naish and several others play their parts superbly. The only drawback to this film is the sets and quality of the film. In places it seems very stagy. As I said the historical aspects and book connection raise this film a couple notches. The only criticism I have is with the conduct of Howard's character Locke. I don't know if Lockhart or anyone else in British intelligence of the time advised on this film. But if British intelligence operated as loosely in that day as it appears in this film it would be no wonder to any viewers how the enemy could find out so much about Britain's operations. An example is the repeated scenes when Elena is visiting Steve and someone brings him information. Old Steve leaves doors open and talks freely about the matters so she can overhear him with no difficulty. And then when he sees she's gone a couple of times after that he doesn't seem to think any more about it or he disregards it. I would suppose that by WW II British intelligence would have improved to a point that such loose and stupid behavior would get one shot or locked up as a collaborator or very bad source of leaks at the least. I wonder that no one thought about that when making the movie. Or was it shown that way on purpose? Perhaps it really was that way?The movie opens in 1917 Petrograd outside the British embassy. The city's name had been changed from St. Petersburg at the outbreak of WW I. St. PetersburgPetrograd was then the capitol of Russia. In 1924 its name was changed to Leningrad and after the fall of the Iron Curtain and collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 the city's name was changed back to St. Petersburg. There are many more interesting details about that time and those events. History buffs will have no difficulty finding articles on line. In the meantime and for all others this film serves as a good peek at the events and time. And it's a film that most people should enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "The cast is tremendous in this 1934 Warner Brothers film British Agent. Based on a 1932 book the movie takes place mostly in Russia in the early days of World War I and of the Bolshevik Revolution. My high rating of the film is partly because of its historical value. It depicts very well those events and that time in history. Few movies have been made of these two events in relation to each other. Even with Hollywood changes and the natural nuances of the source writer R.H. Bruce Lockhart in his memoirs the movie has value for the historical events it covers. It also is credible in its portrayal of the culture and people as well as costume and dress of the time. It would be interesting to know how much the characters in the film are based on real people. Some are obvious  Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. But many others have fictitious names. Still some are obvious from people in Lockhart's book. It's not hard to get his connection with the male lead Leslie Howard. In name  Lockhart and Locke as well as in character. Howard plays Steve Locke who is viceconsul to the British embassy in St. Petersburg and Moscow. When the revolution breaks out and the embassy officials are called back to England he is left behind as the sole British representative. He's then the acting Consul for Great Britain to Russia. In real life Bruce Lockhart was Acting British Consul General in Moscow when the first Russian revolution broke out in early 1917. But he returned to England before the Bolshevik Revolution of October. In January of 1918 he returned as the UK's first envoy to the Bolsheviks. His main purpose was to persuade Russia not to sign a peace pact with Germany and to come into WW I on the side of the Allies. That's very close to the portrayal of Locke's character and his movements in this film if not the exact titles he carried. Kay Francis plays Elena Moura. She is the secretary to Commissioner of War Trotsky. She and Locke are the romantic element of this film and it comes across as a believably deepfelt love between the two. Howard and Francis carry off this relationship very well with a respect for each other's ideology. In real life Lockhart did not have this romance but he helped the couple that did. British writer Arthur Ransome had been living and writing in Russia when he met Trotsky's secretary Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. After the end of the Bolshevik Revolution Lockhart helped her get to England. She later married Ransome who became famous for his children's books. Lockhart's life itself is very interesting for his wide travels and experiences. It's every bit as intriguing as this film that is based on a short span of that life. Sir Robert Hamilton R.H.

So the fact that British Agent is set in Russia during this period makes it very interesting and unique. Aside from the very leftist film Reds don't get me started on my I dislike this dull film and Dr. Zhivago this is the only mainstream film I can think of that actually tries to discuss this period in history.Leslie Howard plays a government agent sent to Russia following their first revolutionthe one that preceded the Communist revolution five months later. The brandnew Karensky government replaced the Czars and tried to strike a balance between conservative and liberal camps. Unfortunately they chose to try to remain in WWIsomething that the people just couldn't take as Russian losses had been staggering and the people were starving. So Howard is given the impossible task to convince this teetering government to stay in the war because the Allied forces were afraid Russia exit would doom them to lose. And such missions to Russia DID occurbut they had absolutely no effect and the country soon had a new revolt and they simply quit fighting.All this is pretty interesting and here is where the film starts to bog downeven though it's actually supposed to be based on the true story of a lady revolutionary. Kay Francis plays this woman and although Leslie is not in the least sympathetic to the communist cause they inexplicably fall in love. Perhaps in real life this made sense but in the movie they simply went from point A to point Cskipping the explanation as to WHY they fell in love and why she was suddenly willing to abandon the nation she so loved. Why?! According to this movie it was almost a whim! My other gripe against the film is small and very typical for movies of the era. This is that no one in the film really looked or sounded Russian! Heck most didn't even bother to put on a fake Russian accent! Still if you can ignore these two problems the film is interesting and informative. And that makes it worth seeing.".

I can see now why it has a rather oddly paced structure where you have to really listen to every word and take in every frame to really comfortably follow it.";

	schema:reviewBody "No Blood No Tears the second feature by Corean action auteur Ryu Seung Wan isn't so much an action picture but more of a pulp noircaper movie like a number of the films of Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino.The story itself features a rather large cast of characters but our protagonists are two women one with an abusive exboxer boyfriend turned criminal and the other an excon turned taxidriver who owes some gangsters some money. A somewhat complicated scheme is hatched by multiple parties to steal money from an illegal dogfighting event and it appears as though multiple gangs are involved as well as the police some wannabe criminals. Once the scheme begins all the parties go for the bag of money and multiple double crosses are revealed along with fists flying feet running and a whole lot of people getting beaten up andor killed. All of which is clear even if it's a little chaotic at times.Humor is present in the film more in the form of irony or just people or the audience reacting to the madness that's occurring but it's not a comedy. The action is stylish and some of the choices in direction including some crazy tracking over surprisingly long choreographed fight sequences can be surprising both in effectiveness and audacity. The art direction is also notable the film being drenched in dark tones perfectly setting the atmosphere.I think all thesps do a good job with the increasingly deranged boyfriend being the most surprising of all as his character changes. It's not an easy film to watch due to the heaping of physical nonglorified violence so those that can't take such images should generally stay away. Also if you don't pay attention or try to do something else while watching this film you might lose track of what's going on due to the expansiveness of the cast. And things do get quite chaotic when multiple groups are encountering each other and also quite amusing as well in a maddening can it really get any crazier? kind of way.Fans of crimeheist movies with a little grit and humor like those of the aforementioned directors will find a lot to like here. I personally enjoyed the insanity the comedy some kick ass violence but I did wish it would've relented just a little on some of the pummeling that happened. It sometimes just got brutal to watch such an unfair matchup. But overall I enjoyed this energized entertaining funny sequence of increasingly crazy events. 810.".

But not so that you can't follow what is going on as it happens. Don't plan on being two jumps ahead however. Just let the movie come to you and you will be rewarded.The whole issue of the heist and most of the fights which are pretty brutal don't really come into play until the second half of the film but there is plenty of good stuff in the first half to get you there.The story is centered around two good female leads. Hyeyeong Lee plays Kyeongseon who owes the local neighborhood loan shark a lot of money. She's got a certain past and tends to solve problems by a beer bottle across the head or a kick to the gut. Then we have Suji played by Doyeon Jeonthe frequently smacked around moll of a lowlevel gangster. A chance encounter puts them together and gets the wheels turning on how they can make off with a whole lot of the highlevel gangster's money.There are double crosses triple crosses and lots of surprises along the way. A multitude of other characters play important roles. Inept police detectives idiotic street punks who switch back and forth from being informants for the police and trying to get in on the goods themselves loan collectors who don't know if they should start taking off fingers or sit down and eat lunch with the debtor. Perhaps most impressive is a gangster tough credited as Silent Man played by famed martial arts action director Doohong Jung. He has a great fight scene where he really gets to strut his stuff.If you are tired of the same old Hollywood plots fights and chases do yourself a favor and seek this film out.".

It's a remarkably smart movie too with a collection of notatall stock characters.  The main character is a female excon who's trying to go straight by driving a taxi.  She's having a tough time of it though because she keeps beating the hell out of guys who try to solicit her for sex and there are a couple of geriatric thugs who keep chasing her for some money owed by her exhusband.  The plot goes from there and provides a colorful and unique vision of a criminal underworld.".

In a nutshell No Blood No Tears is about two downandout women who spy a chance to make some quick money enough to change their deadend lives inadvertently setting off a sixsided gang war over the missing funds. The film is also noteworthy for the first onscreen appearance of South Korea's most accomplished action directormartial arts choreographer Jeon Du Hong Fighter in the Wind Arahan as The Silent Man a mob enforcer. Stylishly shot in browns reds and inky blacks No Blood No Tears only drawbacks are two chase scenes one on foot the other a car chase that are a bit unconvincing. Otherwise No Blood No Tears is really fun stuff. It's definitely worth a try if nothing else for the impromptu cage match between Jeon's silent man and Jeong's Bulldog a washed up exboxer one of the best fight scenes I've seen in some time.".

It was like director Seungwan Ryoo wanted to accomplish a lot of things all at once but didn't fully manage to juggle all the balls he had put up in the air. The movie was trying to tell too many tales at the same time and it ended up being a rather confusing stupid and irritating mess of a story. Sure No Blood No Tears had its moments but in general there was just not enough of a red thread throughout the story to hang on to.The acting in the movie was actually quite good and I think that goes for everyone in the movie because the actors and actresses portrayed their characters quite well and came off as believable characters on the screen.It was a shame that there was too much going on in the movie at the same time and that the movie was jumping back and forth trying to tie together all the various story lines and characters. It just didn't work out as the director had intended. And that is the reason why I give the movie only a mediocre grade. No Blood No Tears could have been a much better movie had the director not trying to throw so many different elements into one project. Would have been better to focus on a couple of the story lines and tie them together in a more constructed way.But still Doyeon Jeon playing Suji and Hyeyeong Lee playing Kyeongseon  the two main characters  actually made the movie worth enough to sit through till the end.".

The biggest surprise for me though frankly was Pilou Asbk in his role as Teis Sara's new found love. What a charm what charisma and what talent.

	schema:headline " This is NOT just another movie";
	schema:reviewBody "First to expect this movie to be like every other movie is unfair. It does not exist for the sole reason to entertain you like Die Hard or Shawshank Redemption. To say it was melodramatic is ridiculous. Why? Because this is what REAL JW's have to deal with exactly. This is a recreation of their REAL world. I just watched it with a room full of exJW's with multiple females in it having gone through nearly identical situations and even disfellowshippings. I know at least 3 others that have gone through the same. So it's really like saying some people's religion and even lives are melodramatic. Well then fine if that's your prerogative having NEVER been a JW. This movie has tremendous value in it clearly showing you the overwhelming nowin complexity in choices that most nonJW or maybe noncult people never have to struggle with. So don't downgrade this highly accurate movie on that petty concept because of your ignorance. Not everything is about movie entertainment value.Second further along the lines of socalled mistakes in accuracy  A There ARE dark depressing Kingdom Halls. Having previously been a JW for 25 years and attending DOZENS of them I can say that they do indeed exist and I have been in numerous.  B Elders in a few other countries ARE allowed to wear beards.  C whether they closed the prayers correctly in completely inconsequential.  D Students ARE often encouraged to not pursue education. I know many JW's who sacrificed careers and education because of 1975 alone. I personally was directly asked 15 years ago when I would quit college to pioneer. It happens plenty and is in writing in the WTS publications about how good pioneering is and potentially bad education is because the kids start to think for themselves and never come back!. So don't downgrade this highly valuable movie on a handful of petty concepts because of your ignorance. That's like saying the whole Ferrari is weak because of the lugnuts.Really in addition to a number of other concrete or abstract aspects this movie was in large part about her TRULY opening her eyes to the cult she was seemingly trapped in and standing up for herself enough against everyone to escape. Many of us exJW's have lost it ALL friends parents children spouse career health retirement education etc and fought through solitude loneliness pressure etc. with integrity and more courage than most people will ever have to muster. She portrays this PERFECTLY and BEAUTIFULLY. So don't downgrade this highly accurate movie just because you haven't TRULY opened your eyes or mustered your own strength to leave in your own JW cultcontrolled life or if you never have been a JW yourself. That's unfair.That being said...Please watch this movie. Everyone.If you were a JW and went through a hard time disfellowshipped or similar then this movie may really touch you and help you feel understood.If you need to explain to someone else what it's like to be a JW and all the crazy games everyone plays in the cult then this movie is almost certainly perfect to do so.If you want to understand that JW's are not just some nutcases that come knock on your door and are actually humans that are caught up in a difficult life of soulcrushing conformity and insanityprovoking mindcontrol some of which is not really their fault like if they were raised as a child in it and got wired that way then this movie may really help you understand them and cut them some slack. It can be completely overwhelming to be a JW sometimes as perfection is expecteddemanded and humans are not perfect. The pressure can be truly unbearable at times when you think your life and even those of numerous others around you may be LITERALLY decided upon based on your actions doubts andor perfect conformity. And you may not have ANYONE around to share that with that will talk to you anymore. Literally look you in the eye and walk by as if you don't even exist.The acting was truly superb by EVERYONE in the movie as well as any other aspects of a movie that you expect as the awards it earned shows. I am very grateful for the time and effort they put to get it right instead of just close enough while trying to make a .Please watch this movie and thinkfeel what a small percentage of the REAL people in our world deal with on a daily basis. Everyone. This is NOT just another movie but so much more than that.".

This movie has tremendous value in it clearly showing you the overwhelming nowin complexity in choices that most nonJW or maybe noncult people never have to struggle with. So don't downgrade this highly accurate movie on that petty concept because of your ignorance. Not everything is about movie entertainment value.Second further along the lines of socalled mistakes in accuracy  A There ARE dark depressing Kingdom Halls. Having previously been a JW for 25 years and attending DOZENS of them I can say that they do indeed exist and I have been in numerous.  B Elders in a few other countries ARE allowed to wear beards.  C whether they closed the prayers correctly in completely inconsequential.  D Students ARE often encouraged to not pursue education. I know many JW's who sacrificed careers and education because of 1975 alone. I personally was directly asked 15 years ago when I would quit college to pioneer. It happens plenty and is in writing in the WTS publications about how good pioneering is and potentially bad education is because the kids start to think for themselves and never come back!. So don't downgrade this highly valuable movie on a handful of petty concepts because of your ignorance. That's like saying the whole Ferrari is weak because of the lugnuts.Really in addition to a number of other concrete or abstract aspects this movie was in large part about her TRULY opening her eyes to the cult she was seemingly trapped in and standing up for herself enough against everyone to escape. Many of us exJW's have lost it ALL friends parents children spouse career health retirement education etc and fought through solitude loneliness pressure etc. with integrity and more courage than most people will ever have to muster. She portrays this PERFECTLY and BEAUTIFULLY. So don't downgrade this highly accurate movie just because you haven't TRULY opened your eyes or mustered your own strength to leave in your own JW cultcontrolled life or if you never have been a JW yourself. That's unfair.That being said...Please watch this movie. Everyone.If you were a JW and went through a hard time disfellowshipped or similar then this movie may really touch you and help you feel understood.If you need to explain to someone else what it's like to be a JW and all the crazy games everyone plays in the cult then this movie is almost certainly perfect to do so.If you want to understand that JW's are not just some nutcases that come knock on your door and are actually humans that are caught up in a difficult life of soulcrushing conformity and insanityprovoking mindcontrol some of which is not really their fault like if they were raised as a child in it and got wired that way then this movie may really help you understand them and cut them some slack. It can be completely overwhelming to be a JW sometimes as perfection is expecteddemanded and humans are not perfect. The pressure can be truly unbearable at times when you think your life and even those of numerous others around you may be LITERALLY decided upon based on your actions doubts andor perfect conformity. And you may not have ANYONE around to share that with that will talk to you anymore. Literally look you in the eye and walk by as if you don't even exist.The acting was truly superb by EVERYONE in the movie as well as any other aspects of a movie that you expect as the awards it earned shows. I am very grateful for the time and effort they put to get it right instead of just close enough while trying to make a .Please watch this movie and thinkfeel what a small percentage of the REAL people in our world deal with on a daily basis. Everyone. This is NOT just another movie but so much more than that.";

It's hard to explain what it is that makes a film rewatchable but the fact that I each time I walked out of the cinema felt differently about Sara's dilemma is one of the reasons that I felt I had to see it again. The film manages to maintain objectivity in its portrayal of the Jehovah's Witnesses. You are not forced or manipulated into disagreeing or judging them but free to make up your own mind. Sara and her family's lives are great and carefree before she meets Teis. Some people need something like religion to hold on to in order to get balance in their lives and the film's portrayal of the family is so charming yet presumably realistic that you can't help but envy the relationship between the family members. There is a mutual love and unconditional solidarity and respect that I at least have rarely seen in nonreligious homes. I was not raised as and have never been a religious person and I have never thought that I actually needed to bother with religious questions. But this opened the gates for me. I have rethought my whole religious standpoint. I don't see the fact that I ended up where I started in any way as a bad thing. I needed to know why and this film helped me.Sara's dilemma is so identifiable that everyone is ready to discuss it from the second the cinema lights go up. The fact that people take this film with them home and discuss it days after they have seen it shows how universal this religious question is. There is no definite right or wrong and everyone young and old rich and poor Europeans and Americans can relate to the issue and have an opinion about it. That is besides great acting great musical score and cinematic finish editing is i.m.o. exceptionally subtle and unique what makes this film important. Because that is the feeling you have after watching it that you've just witnessed something important that you wouldn't have been without. Niels Arden Oplev yet again gave me an experience in the cinema that I won't soon forget and I'm thrilled that this film will be representing Denmark at the Oscars now we just need to get it nominated. I can't wait to share it with the rest of the world and see if it affects you as deeply as it has affected me.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read about this movie and thought it seemed interesting but it still far exceeded my expectations. Inspired by a true story Worlds Apart is a superior drama that delves into one of the world's most intriguing religious groups and the universal theme of divided loyalty.17year old Sara Dahl Rosalinde Mynster is a beautiful but somewhat introverted student who lives in a small Danish town with her parents Andreas Jens Jrn Spottag and Karen Sarah Boberg and her younger siblings Elisabeth Sarah Juel Werner and August Jacob Ottensten. All are active Jehovah's Witnesses. Early on Andreas confesses that he has committed adultery. Karen decides to divorce him but because he is repentant the children oppose the divorce and decide that Karen should be the one to move out which she is.Shortly afterward Sara and her friend Thea Catrine Beck attend a party in which Sara meets a 23year old musician named Teis Johan Philip Asbk. She falls for him but becomes very drunk. Teis walks her home and the two stay in touch.They soon get together again and while walking through a mall Sara is approached by a young man revealed to be her older brother Jonas Thomas KnuthWinterfeldt. The two have a brief and curiously awkward conversation. After Jonas leaves Sara explains that Jonas was expelled from the JW organization because of reading an improper book and therefore is to be shunned by his family. Sara adds that she only spoke to Jonas because Teis was there. Teis who is nonreligious quickly becomes hostile toward Sara about the JW belief that only JWs are saved.Teis finds Sara at school shortly afterward and apologizes for criticizing her faith. The two steadily grow closer and one night at a caf Sara loses track of time and misses her train. She spends the night at Teis' apartment where the two sleep in the same bed and kiss but don't have sex or even undress.Still Andreas is very upset and takes her to see the church elders all of whom are middle aged men. Seemingly led by a man named John Anders W. Berthelsen she is questioned about Teis including whether he touched her breasts or not. The movie doesn't show that act but Sara says that it happened. The elders do accept her claim that the two didn't have sex and allow her to remain in the organization but order her to end her relationship with Teis through a letter.She does so but feels bad about it especially after learning that Teis has called her several times since receiving the letter but that her family hasn't told her. She asks Andreas for permission to talk to Teis in person. Andreas reluctantly agrees and shortly after Sara visits Teis he surprises everyone by attending a service at Sara's church. Andreas and John are suspicious and John offers to refer Teis to another JW church. But Teis insists that he wants to hear about God the same way that Sara does. John reluctantly accepts that and gives Sara permission to see Teis provided the two don't have sex.Teis' faith initially appears to be sincere and Sara's grows as well. She quits school seemingly some kind of posthigh school institution to become a pioneer doortodoor missionary. But right after a large JW convention Teis and Sara have sex for the first time. From there Sara's faith steadily fades.Sara says that she's moving in with Karen but actually moves in with Teis. Karen covers for Sara and also secretly sees Jonas. Teis introduces Sara to his nonreligious parents Vagn Hans Henrik Voetmann and Jette Charlotte Fich. Vagn treats Sara cordially but Jette spews out a long list of antiJW comments. Sara and Teis leave and Teis seems embarrassed by his mother's behavior but reveals to Sara that he's concluded that he doesn't believe in God after all.Eventually Sara's faade falls apart. Elisabeth while visiting Karen notices that no clothes are in Sara's supposed closets. That leads to Sara being given an ultimatum from the elders  leave Teis or be expelled.I won't reveal her decision but I will say that my only significant criticism of the movie is that a character dies because of refusing a blood transfusion. That strikes me as a forced attempt to emphasize one of the most distinctive parts of JW doctrine. However that character's funeral is very powerfully used to set up a hard hitting climax.This is one of my three favorite foreign movies along with Noi Ni albni from Iceland and Kissed by Winter Vinterkyss from Norway  what is it about the Nordics?! The performances in Worlds Apart are outstanding the screenplay is very compelling and there's plenty of great scenery for anyone who appreciates small town Denmark as I do.JWs are widely ridiculed and dismissed as being brainwashed. But despite coming from one of the most secular countries in the world this movie is surprisingly balanced in its portrayal of JWs. While their beliefs and tactics are brought into question the movie portrays JWs as above all human beings. None are demonized and all are portrayed as well intentioned and in some cases compassionate even if misguided. And they even evoke sympathy because of the torment that stems from their dilemma between loving someone  whether romantically or familially  and the fear of going against the teachings of the church and maybe even losing their salvation.I've read dozens of message board postings related to this movie and almost all posters who identify themselves as former JWs describe the movie as very realistic and emotional. And even most with no ties to the JW church can relate to the aforementioned universal theme of divided loyalty.Unrated by the MPAA but very PG13 level this is one of those rare movies that I strongly recommend to everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw 'Worlds Apart' at the Tribeca Film Festival. Like most melodramas the focus is not so much on the mundane details of the characters' lives but how they react to the overall conflict. In the case of 'Worlds Apart' Sara the main character must come to terms with possibly leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses a group she's been raised in along with the rest of her family and a boyfriend who she's fallen in love with. One notices that certain characters are underdeveloped in this movieparticularly weak portraits include the older brother who has been expelled by the family for leaving the group as well as the mother who moves out of the family home after her husband has an adulterous affair. One never feels that we get to know these characters as fully realized people at allthey're just there to further the plot along. The same thing can be said for Sara's boyfriend. We learn that he's a musician but we never find out anything else about him. What about the father? He works as a hotel clerk and that's it. Does he have any friends or is his whole life simply hanging out with his family and attending church? At least Sara has one friend who she interacts with and she's the most compelling and interesting character. The film becomes more interesting when we visit a Jehovah's Witness youth rally. We need more of a 'behindthe scenes' look at the group. One gets the feeling that the screenwriter is only looking at the Jehovah Witnesses from the outsideas though there are more details that he is not privy to. It is precisely those details that would have made the film a lot richer. He's on much more solid ground when he depicts the attitudes of the boyfriend's parents. Those characters are much more realistic and obviously echo the filmmaker's own values. As this is a melodrama complex issues are often reduced to formulaic black and white scenarios. Hence Sara's decision to leave the group almost seems preordained. Similarly Sara's brother's decision to rejoin the group is designed to shock but his actions are never really explained. Nonetheless 'Worlds Apart' still keeps one's interest despite the predictability of its storyline. The characters are likable enough and the acting is convincing and heartfelt. If one accepts the director's view of the Jehovah's Witnesses in his country Worlds Apart at its core is a cautionary tale on the dangers of cults. This is a competent well puttogether film. If you're looking however for something a bit more nuanced look elsewhere. As a solid melodrama World's Apart delivers what it promises to do.".

Here and not her sinful love for Teis based on lies and sex a sin in the everythingseeing eye of Jehova mediated by her father and the elder starts off her doubts the father and not the lover.

Three kinds of young witness Thea speaks off the unfaithful the between the faithful Thea the between Sara as the faithful on her way passing between to be beyond the unfaithful Thea backs anxious realizing that it has gone too far. It is Thea telling Saras father what happened when the friend is needed. Is Theas accident a scarifying suicide for what she has done by denying blood transfusion knowing that death is for the higher cause? Saras questions and answers increase in strength  as well her selfthinking and selfdeciding standing her ground when tested by her father he always tells her that her decision is hers but he regards it not as a good idea the community  and society. To be with Teis against her fathers and the community's wish Sara 'moves' to her mother their conversation shows that daughter and mother understand each other the mother waiting and hoping for this moments the toothbrush and clothes with Ties observed by her sister. Two bedrooms in case father and the community make their checks. Lies and two lives. Finally as her brother Sara is expelled the first step done by her father. Sara Do not hide behind Jehova. It is your decision. After Theas funeral Sara appears uninvited her fathers accusation that she is selfish not thinking that she hurts him her sister and brother. Sara asks Do you love me? he Why do you ask of course I do and Sara Do you love God more than me? The fathers yes is responded by her Why? followed by his answer He has made me. He is the father in heaven he can give me eternal life. Sara Father. I believe this is very selfish of you. And her father You can repent and return that we again can be a family. Sara Good bye father. The last scene in a train car Sara leaves for Copenhagen where she will train for a teacher never seeing her family again. And to Jehova Jehova this is the last time we talk to each other. I do not believe in you any more. The Swedish SVT1anouncement 20100510 22.00 for To VerdernerWorlds Apart tells The Swedish SVT1anouncement 20100510 22.00 for To Verderner tells that Sara has to choose between religion and love. It is not this. It is so much more. Neither religion or love but 'naked' freedom the strength to be persona non grata the unwelcome person. For Tabita Broener Sara it was painful years journey. What is left behind will always be a companion in daily life for better or worse. One of the reasons to leave hardly noticeable is the subtle tempting danger of spiritual and physical incest. With Lacan the Third is absent opening the door for incest. The decision of leaving is always personal. But to go to action help is needed. Tabita Broeners story was read by the director and cowriter Niels Arden Oplev 2006 in Berlingske Tidende. A journey of many years was movie transformed to a year. The director uses neutral respect only facts speak helped by an expelled consult. Generally wherever political and religious 'sects' are the same is observed leaving the warm incestious room you are marked as 'persona non grata'. The lacanian Nom du Pre the empty space of l'ordre symbolique is not empty but occupied by l'ordre imaginaire. Mirrorreflecting to the members what Jehovah told by the elders what is wright and what is wrong. The absence of the Nom du Pre makes the mentioned incest possible. It is this that is the danger and that Sara falls in love with the disturbing Third Teis. It does not matter if he sees what Sara sacrifices and should balance. He was just a stepping stone for life outside and is too much the symbol of the past. Not only the community is closedminded also Teis parents are insensitive practice selfrighteous hypocrisy. Many members of such communities do not question the base of faith do not brake out unsatisfied what they have. Few as Sara are consciously hungry for more without the courage to look for it outside. This is the reason why her brother returns to the fold of the community telling Sara that he is unable to 'live isolated and lonely'  meaning outside their family. To see the mother and Sara secretly and not at all father his other sister and the little confused brother . If critic wants to see which is not true it is here. The description of the organizations effect on the family and how they handle it. These scenes are heartbreaking. Questioned the organizations will answer with passages from the Bible  still it is sad. Sad as this method is well used in other political and religious organizations.".

It tells the story about Sara a 17yearold girl who discovers a new world after meeting a man named Teis who unlike her family is not part of a religious sect. Precisely and engagingly directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints draws a gripping and intimate portrayal of a young woman's relationship with her brother who has been banned by his parents for choosing to not follow their doctrines and a man who values love more than religion. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions and the fine cinematography by Danish cinematographer Lars Vestergaard this characterdriven and narrativedriven lovestory which is based on real events depicts a poignant study of character and contains a great score by Danish composers Jens Bjrnkjr and Jacob Groth. This instantly involving romantic and heartrending comingofage story about a courageous person who is forced by the ones she holds dearest to make a choice that no one in this world should have to make examines themes like family relations ostracism and fundamentalism and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure substantial character development abrupt editing colorful characters and the commendable acting performances by Danish actresses Rosalinde Mynster Sarah Boberg Sara Juel Werner and Danish actors Jens Jrn Spottag Anders W.

For one thing the elder who presides over most of the meetings wears a facial beard. JW's do not wear beards. Mustaches yes beards ... no. Also there are some instances where he closes prayer without first saying  In Jesus' name or something similar. This is incorrect. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the only proper way to approach God in prayer is through the name of his son as the scriptures direct. Also the meetings look like dark somber occasions...this is far from reality. The meetings are full of interesting parts given by different members welllit and the atmosphere is inviting not somber. And it is NEVER encouraged for a young one to quit their formal education and become a full time pioneer. That was appalling. No mother or father would support the decision of a youth in high school to drop out to pursue full time preaching. Jehovah's witnesses do not endorse that plan of action. Also I was very offended at the point of the film where Sara tells her young brother they lied to us. There is no Armageddon. The movie does not provide any means by which she could have arrived at this conclusion. There is no bible proof presented no discussion nothing. She just decides for herself it is a lie. I am one of Jehovah's witnesses. I did not care for the film but tried to watch it openmindedly. I found nothing of value here.".

Fornication and adultery are wrong no matter what faith you belong to because the bible God's word says that. Any avid Bible Reader remembers the priest who allowed his sons to commit fornication in the temple. He lost his life because he condoned wrongdoing. I have many friends who chose to do what they wanted and instead of carrying on a facade lying adding more sins to the mix they just went to the brothers and disassociated themselves. If that's what a person chooses to do no one stops them. Major inaccuracies 1 Elders don't hunt people down if they happen to see them or make a shepherding call and know they are having problems they try to encourage them to seek help disfellowshipping is a LAST resort they are in the business of helping not hurting. 2 There is no leader they are bodies that are all in agreement on various things  meet in committees to make decisions 3 We are educated people. The world headquarters has doctors lawyers nurses electricians engineers etc. I have 2 degrees that I pursued while I participated in the ministry regularly and worked fulltime. I am not alone there are many like me some doctors and teachers. 4People are not told they will die they are encouraged to follow a course that will 'ensure' they remain in God's memory. Only God can read hearts  can condemn or excuse a person. Ultimately he will choose. As humans that is not our place. Any person that wants to sin and not answer to God for anything is truly selfish and will not really be happy.".

When I was going through a rough time when i was 13 yes the elders did come to see me but only to encourage and they were very caring about the whole situation. Now fast forward when I stopped going to meeting for a while i didn't get any visits I was engaging in sex my mum probably knew but again there's nothing she could do The elders only come to you if YOU APPROACH THEM!!! I wasn't expelled because I was not baptised I didn't make a promise to Jehovah. AGAIN the elders WOULD NOT expel you if they have not spoken to you what !!!! Yeah this is getting me even more upset. I've been in the world yeah I had some fun times but I had rough times at the end of the day no one FORCES you to get baptised its your own choice you cant make a promise to the grand creator and then suddenly decide this isn't for me see it from our point of view please.

How the elders are portrayed in this movies is ridiculous lol when they visit you they are friendly and not daunting im going to stop cuz ill only get more angry on a last note I am happy worshiping Jehovah God you can say that my parents were JWs yes but I KNOW its the truth I have been to other churches and what Jehovahs Witnessess are preaching is the truth we are loving people if you want to make a movie about JWs then get it right and we are ALLOWED TO WATCH TV AND PLAY COMPUTER GAMES THE ELDERS DO NOT TELL US WHAT WE CANT AND CANNOT DO!!! obviously they put it in that movie to make us seem so boring and strict I have LOADS of fun being a JW with my friends we drink dance listen to CHART music like Rihanna Beyonce all of that we are free to listen to what we want its just up to our conscience......";

The premise of this story is to present the moral conflict of pursuing the desires of one's heart at the cost of losingwalking away from everything a person has always known. The actors in my opinion don't fail here it's more so the script and the fact that the complexity of this story is completely undermined by missing elements that are integral to a story like this. The story is centered around the Christian faith of Jehovah's witnesses but never is the bible actually opened in this movie and utilized as a reference point for the beliefs that witnesses uphold which is universally known as how they defend their faith  all their actions. As others have said I don't feel like witnesses were demonized but at the same time they are characterized as zealots of some sort who live by arcane ideas and principles. In real life the issue with Sara pursuing a relationship like the one portrayed in the film would be that of engaging in a relationship with a person who doesn't sharecherish the same biblicalmoral values of a professed Christian. this basic conflict becomes evident when Sara boyfriend tries to be sexual before they are married  If I'm driving to NYC and you're driving to LA why would I ride in a car with you we are going in two different directions it therefore would be of no benefit to ride with you the same is true with choosing life partners who are going in different directions it makes no sense An honest way to have told this story would have been to allow the bible principles that Sara was taught to be scripturally explained only then could one possibly grasp the difficulty of grappling with what your heart selfishly wants versus holding onto everything you know to be true. The absence of a logical explanation of the practicality of bible principles over simplifies this movie down to a thing of I don't want do what other people tell me to do anymore thing versus I know what is right I have a relationship with God and feel truly tornconfused. The movie is a complete failure and a disservice to the notion of sentimental dramas and the faith of Jehovah's Witnesses. Witnesses aren't mindless sheep. If questioned every thing they believe can be explained scripturally and as far as their outlook of the future they can explain that too contextually and prophetically. Maybe it's easier for people to just write them off as mindless losers  I don't know. At the end of the day whether one agrees with the bible message they bring that's a matter of choice. SaraTabita must really be bitter that she allowed the story to be developed in such a one sided manner that cushions sympathy in the direction of her choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I don't know much about Danish films so I don't recognize the actors and actresses who do a first rate job in performing their roles. The film is about Sara Dahl a Danish 17 year old Jehovah's Witness. The film begins with the baptism of her and her best friend Thea. Sara is more dedicated and devout than Thea at times. When Sara meets Teis at a club their relationship begins slowly to evolve more than a friendship. It's actually realistic that they don't move fast. Jehovah's Witnesses especially the single girls like Sara and Thea don't date at all and especially outside the sect. Teis takes an interest in the religion. When things don't go as planned Sara makes difficult choices that can ruin her family. This film is based on Tabitha's Story which is probably true. While Sara is played beautifully by the actress as a sympathetic complicated young woman who must make serious decisions even without the back up of her family. This film is worth watching even with subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Put simply anyone who is not a Witness but who has Witnesses or ex Witnesses in their lives should watch this movie. You will understand them better for it.It illustrates simply without histrionics the pressures facing a person in a religious group that punishes failure to comply with 'the rules' with expulsion which can and does even extend to family members refusing to associate with you anymore and where an individual's freedom of conscience is ignored.Imagine yourself faced with a choice do what your religion and family expect or lose them. And you do not lose just family Jehovah's Witnesses typically have few if any real friends outside of the religion.I have been there and done it. It really is like starting over.To get more complex some reviewers especially Jehovah's Witnesses seeking to defend their faith miss the point or are in error or bothOne reviewer expects it to show the Biblical justifications Jehovah's Witnesses use for their beliefs. Well I believe an appropriate channel for that would be a film they make. This film is a girl's story of how the religion she just happened to grow up in meant that by doing what many young people do she loses her family and that everyone she grew up with in the religion now thinks she will die. The reasons they might claim for doing and believing what many people would find morally reprehensible are irrelevant as the same Bible can be interpreted in many different ways by other faiths.Only very few religions are so sure that their opinion about a Biblical passage is so accurate that anyone who disagrees should be kicked out. And these opinions change for example the definition of the word 'generation' Armageddon was meant to come in the lives of those of the generation of 1914 but as this generation has died out the definition has shifted so it looks like they were never wrong and the now rescinded prohibition against organ transplants it used to be considered cannibalism and that someone receiving a heart transplant would develop personality traits of the donor but the doctrine changed.... no sorry if your loved ones refused organ transplants and died we were wrong at any point.Another reviewer quibbles about an Elder having a beard. As has already been pointed out in some countries this is OK. But before you quibbled did you ever wonder what the hell does a man's facial hair supposedly godgiven have to do with his suitability to act as an Elder? Or maybe this is another opinion set at a time when men with beards were beatniks hippies etc. and now presented as an unbreakable rule except in countries where beards have been more traditional where the rules are different LOL even though these opinions of grooming standards are archaic and nonBiblical?Yet another reviewer tries the 'poison the well strategy' by implying that you cannot listen to exbelievers as they will be bitter. Well honestly would you buy a car of someone who told you never to listen to anyone who had owned that car in the past but then got rid of it? Maybe they got rid of the car for a reason to do with the car! Maybe people stop being JWs because of something to do with the religion? Elders do follow up on people who have left been there especially if they are told that this person who no longer even attends meetings is breaking the rules.The Watchtower magazine has vacillated between some support of higher education and warning against it. The '90s and early 00's it was more acceptable. In the '70's and 80's it was anathema.And yes some JWs are educated. But see the reaction if you openly tell other JWs you intend to research evolutionary biology thoroughly using textbooks etc. so that you can understand the beliefs that JWs have no evolution of species humans have only existed for less than 10000 years and be able to defend them better or that you are going to read 'Crisis of Conscience' by expelled exgoverning body member Ray Franz or you openly disagree with the meaning of certain scriptures. In most religions this is tolerated. But as shown by the expulsion of the lead character's elder brother you can be kicked out for reading the wrong books and contradicting the elders!And most certainly just as you don't see Legolas running round after a battle in Lord of the Rings picking up arrows otherwise where does he get them all from you don't see everything that must have shaped her desire to leave. Her brother left for reading the wrong books... maybe ones that show that they JWs have either directly stated or heavily implied certain dates for Armageddon and been obviously wrong. Maybe her discussions with her boyfriend's atheistic family? But these are not the point of the film. Or her mother who 'has doubts' but is forced to maintain a facade or lose her family?The point of the film is that certain groups of believers have a very tight controlled set of beliefs which just like any faith Hebrews 111 Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for the evidence of things that appear not. is based not on FACT but opinion. These same believers have to comply with these set of opinions or be expelled and when a fellow believer is expelled will exercise a choice based on their OPINION to maintain or sever ties with them. This opinion is presented as god's opinion but this is false even blasphemous if you really believe in god... all it is is just another opinion but one valued so highly by those holding it that it comes before everything else. There is no real option to agree to disagree and maintain normal ties".

But after watching and reading a lot on the internet and watching this movie that should be a true story and what resembles the stories I've read and heard about I think it is a very important movie to watch and think about.Not only for people who are jehovas witnesses but for anyone who have any beliefs. Putting things in perspective I myself get these questions. How can you put your faithlove in something you never seen or only have been told about above REAL human beingsfamily.To that I will never understand and will as the main character think it is more egoistic to deny your family then your own beliefs.To get into a more movie perspective the movie was by no means perfect. It's filmotography was the worst part of the movie real dull and not very movielike. But maybe it was intentional to make it feel more real?Anyways if the message of the movie was not as important or near and dear to me I would rate it a 7 but because of personal importance I dedicate it a 9.I hope you liked my short and perhaps not super informative review. I already wrote too much to go any deeper within the movie.All the best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Review By Morgan StewartIt is hard to put into writing just how marvelous and wonderful Bridge to Terabithia really is yet as I attempt it I can't help feeling disturbed at how ridiculous people are being about the marketing of this film. Thank goodness most real critics have looked past the agreeably deceptive marketing into the heart and beauty of this film which with or with the misleading advertisements is impressive. After seeing it I struggled to think of a better way of marketing this film without giving away its ending or taking away the only audience that still seems to watch PG movies kids.After watching it however I couldn't imagine taking anyone under ten to see it nor could I imagine anyone under ten enjoying it as much as young adults or even older audiences would. So as deceptive as the advertising was I myself realize that the fascinating story the charm and skill of the actors and the good direction of newcomer to live action filmmaking Gabor Csupo more than makes up for the slightly skewed first impressions. And I am eternally grateful that it did not turn into what everyone seemed to want a cheesy Narnia ripoff. If anything the movie was a lot better than the preview made it seem to be and I was pleasantly surprised.Instead of the brash and rude approach to filming movies that seems to be the standard today with effects driven movies Terabithia focuses on the characters the story and the heart when telling this beautiful tale. Which is part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Too often now days the story is built around the effects not around the characters. A rather cumbersome and annoying way to tell a story or be told a story if you ask me. Instead Terabithia uses the talents of both the amazing young actors and its adult cast to enthrall and absorb the viewer in the magic of imagination and the reality of everyday life.The story focuses on young Jess Aarons whose school life and home life aren't all that ideal. He deals with bullies at school and four sisters at home. Josh Hutcherson who I haven't particularly enjoyed before plays the part of Jess perfectly his emotions and reactions spot on throughout.What is a school without the new girl? Leslie Burke played by AnnaSophia Robb takes on the part of the imaginative and friendly new girl and brings to Jess gifts of imagination and friendship. Robb truly does a superb job in bringing to life the thoughtful and imaginative Leslie Burke.All of the supporting cast was also brilliantly portrayed. I especially enjoyed the performances of Robert Patrick as Jess's father and young Bailee Madison as Jess's little sister May Belle.Together Jess and Leslie create a world to call their own. A place that no one else can get to a place in their imaginations. Terabithia a land of beautiful creatures and dangerous enemies springs forth from their imaginations and becomes a place to call their own away from the bullies and monotony of everyday life.What really struck me as brilliant was the limited yet still perfect number of glimpses into the children's' imaginations. We don't see a lot of Terabithia which is good because it is more about the journey of the characters than the land of Terabithia. That said it still has quite a few more scenes of adventure than the book by Katherine Patterson all of which add to not take away from the story.The writing also is quite good. David Patterson son of the novel's author takes great care when adapting the beloved work of his mother into a screenplay. Most of the lines from the book aren't there but there are a few which make it in revealing the care and love that was put into the scripting of this movie. Personally I enjoy the screenplay of the movie more than the words of the book but that is just my opinion. The movie's script greatly aided in the believability of the characters and the motion of the scenes which were crisp and wellplanned.The movie touched on my every emotion bringing me to tall peaks of happiness and leaving me tearyeyed and disconsolate but still had a perfect and satisfying ending. I also personally thought the scenes and situations were more powerful poignant and realistic than the book which surprises me. Usually the movie can't live up to the book. In this case the phrase seemed switched around. The book didn't live up to the movie. As weird as it is for me to say this about a movie Terabithia touched my heart like no film has ever before. And I doubt any film will give me quite the same feeling ever again.".

From what I had seen in the trailers I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world similar to the Chronicles of Narnia clearly I did not read the book. Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie but I will say that in my opinion this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy's life and all the troubles he faces concerning school family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The childstars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film the story dominates. Which in my opinion is a lot better than the other way around. Overall I found the movie very enjoyable but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie before deciding on whether or not you'll let your kids watch it.".

The children depicted are very real and likable well except for the ones you're supposed to dislike that is and easy to identify with. The movie is a faithful and touching adaptation of the beloved children's classic book.The two main characters Jesse and Leslie splendidly played by John Hucheson and Annasophia Robb are typical preteens steering their way through the routine ups and downs kids everywhere deal with and they develop a friendshipfirst crush due to their common interests and challenges. They find an old tree house and create a fantasy castle type kingdom complete with magic and populated by creatures based on people they know. Unlike so many other fantasy movies this world is just an amusement for them not a refuge that they actually enter. The animation effects of this fantasy kingdom are skillfully executed in such a manner as to point out the reality that exists alongside the fantasy. For example a tree begins to move comes to life and performs an action then relaxes back into its real position.The relationships of all the characters and what they learn from their experiences are the true focus with the fantasy sequences only spicing what's happening. There are many themes touched upon friendship tragedy adventure creativity bullies competition family life even making an enemy to a friend. I liked all the characters and the actors that played them each person helped build the story. Emotional even heart wrenching in one case this movie is a gem. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bridge To TerabithiaI have not read the book and did not see this movie with many expectations. To begin with this is a story of Jesse Aarons Josh Hutcherson. Jesse is the fastest runner in his class and very proud of being so. Frequently picked on by the local bullies troubled with the financial situation back home and oft ignored by all but one of his 5 sisters he immerses himself within his drawings as an escape... Leslie Burke AnnaSophia Robbis the newkid in his class. She has a panache for writing which coupled by her ability to outrun all the guys in her class including Jesse ensures that she doesn't have the best luck making new friends. However with their affinity to be picked on Jesse and Leslie soon find themselves extremely fond of each other and off looking for a place of their own... This is Terabithia...And this is where I'll end my summary for I do not wish to go into the spoilers for the movie.All the kids in the movie really shine in their respective roles. As many reviewers have said before me Josh and AnnaSophia are a wonderful pair! I would also like to mention the young Bailee Madison playing Josh's younger sister for her portrayal of May Belle. However what truly lifts this movie from good to great is the simplicity of the whole story. This is a children's movie through and through and but do not expect a typical Disney feelgood comedy. Do not also expect huge CG sequences like say The Chronicles of Narnia.This movie is full of heart and everything about it is shown from the eyes of a child. Life is not a pretty thing and more than the magical kingdom of Terabithia this is a tale of a young kids' coming to terms with matters of being bullied being loved having a true friend and even trying to understand death.By the end of it all many people around me were moved to tears and I myself was trying desperately to hold back. The movie its message and its delivery are all beautiful.On a critical note the only thing about the movie that I didn't particularly love was the music. The music in general wasn't very well suited and certain songs were just not needed but I suppose thats what the MTv culture demands.In conclusion I highly recommend it. Go and watch this movie and if you have them take your children... They'll love it!910".

	onyx:emotionText "Bridge To TerabithiaI have not read the book and did not see this movie with many expectations. To begin with this is a story of Jesse Aarons Josh Hutcherson. Jesse is the fastest runner in his class and very proud of being so. Frequently picked on by the local bullies troubled with the financial situation back home and oft ignored by all but one of his 5 sisters he immerses himself within his drawings as an escape... Leslie Burke AnnaSophia Robbis the newkid in his class. She has a panache for writing which coupled by her ability to outrun all the guys in her class including Jesse ensures that she doesn't have the best luck making new friends. However with their affinity to be picked on Jesse and Leslie soon find themselves extremely fond of each other and off looking for a place of their own... This is Terabithia...And this is where I'll end my summary for I do not wish to go into the spoilers for the movie.All the kids in the movie really shine in their respective roles. As many reviewers have said before me Josh and AnnaSophia are a wonderful pair! I would also like to mention the young Bailee Madison playing Josh's younger sister for her portrayal of May Belle.

Jess and Leslie deal with their problems by recreating them in an imaginary world where they can be the things they aren't in real life.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on January 23rd 2007 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life. Heartland gave that award to this film.This is a story of a poor 10year old boy who wants to be the fastest boy in his class at school. To his surprise the new girl who moves in next door to him beats him out fair and square and wins the race. This is no way to start a relationship or friendship.However they have something in common. They are both being bullied at school. And they each react differently. The boy Jesse is passive and tries to stay out of harm's way. The girl Leslie is aggressive and challenges her tormentors. Who knows what the right way is to fight bullying but they find their defense in friendship with each other. And they find a wonderful way to experience this trying time in life via their vivid imagination and the creation of a magical and enchanting kingdom that is very real to them.They are both creative people. He is an artist and she is a writer. These creative people are able to close their eyes picture another world and keep their minds open to fantastic visions.But the bullying persists and they attempt to come to grips with their pain in various ways. They try to out smart their tormentors and do but they don't enjoy being bullies and becoming like their enemies. This story is based on a Newberywinning novel. It is a child's story. But it is also a story for adults. It will bring you emotionally to your knees. It is lovingly and professionally told and the fantasy part of the story  the magical kingdom  is wonderfully and briefly shown on the screen. This keeps the story grounded and believable.Jesse and Leslie are beautiful people regardless of their ages. They show us how to enjoy life how to do the right things how to be faithful to one's friends and have hope for the future. We learn a lot from these ten year old children. FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video.".

I've been trying to drag my friends there with me because I think that everyone should see this but unfortunately the add campaign may have ruined all chances of that happening. I find that every time I ask one of my friends to go with me they say that there is no way they are going to watch that movie which means I'll probably have to see it alone when I watch it again I will definitely be watching this again.

The ending was very magical and moving..I am not usually an emotional person but i found myself on the verge of tears. The Acting was really good as well. The young girl that played Leslie did a great job as well as Zooey Deschanel playing the kids teacher.

I was absolutely enthralled by the novel and found myself crying at the end the first time a work of fiction had made me cry. The magic and wonder of the book stuck with me the past decade so you can imagine my excitement when I found out it was being turned into a movie!I went in with high expectations and was not in any way disappointed. The movie version of Bridge was incredibly true to the book and the young actors portraying Leslie and Jess did a fantastic job. One of my favorite parts was Zooey Deschenal as the music teacher the way she got the kids singing those songs was fabulous those scenes were my favorites. They were so well done with the children looking like they truly cared about what they were singing putting all their feeling into it.The most powerful aspect of the film was the portrayal of the imagination children possess. My friends and I found ourselves crying when Jess finally kept his mind wide open as Leslie suggested and saw Terabithia for the first time. It broke my heart to realize that at 18 I no longer possess the imagination and creativity that Jess and Leslie did at their young age.Terabithia was shown as the perfect escape mechanism for the two kids to get away from their bullies and family troubles. It was amazing how their fantasy world where they were a brave King and Queen gave them the courage to stand up to their bullies.The moment Jess found out he was going to the museum with his teacher I broke down because I knew what was coming. When Jess' father breaks the new of Leslie's death your heart all but breaks. The scenes that follow can be very difficult to watch particularly when the kids are next shown in music class singing a mournful sort of tune very sadly Jess with his head on his desk fighting back tears.The movies wraps up beautifully with Jess bringing his everpresent little sister Maybel to Terabithia having finally built a bridge into he and Leslie's secret kingdom. He tells her she is the princess and that her subjects the Terabithians were all very excited to see her.The whole movie was so powerful and has a devastating effect on those of us who miss the innocence of childhood when all one needed to have a good time was the head on their shoulders.10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the heartbreaking book BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA strays from the regular family film while still delivering a strong message.Two words you must remember before seeing this movie though FALSE ADVERTISING.Terabithia is NOT another Narnia by any means. It is advertised that way but it is not what it seems to be. For book fans however Terabithia is a great adaption.The acting is amazing Josh Hutcherson Little Manhattan pulls his part off excellently. Josh is one of the best male child stars of this generation without a doubt. Annasophia Robb Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stars in yet another Walden Media film and despite her disappointing performance in Because of WinnDixie she gives a great performance. She is able to captivate Leslie's innocence and freespirited nature without becoming annoying or obnoxious. Putting aside the two wonderful leads another star shines The puppyfaced Bailee Madison. Her smile lights up the screen and she is cute without getting on your nerves. She steals every scene she has a line in. The other children and the adults again are great and this is what truly makes the movie move along.The moral? Many worried parents seem to have the wrong idea of this movie. I can understand why but you must look beyond the obvious. This movie does not just make us realize what reality is but it shows us love friendship and courage. It teaches us how to stand up to our enemies and how to make friends How to love and how to deal with the issues of everyday life. The movie shows us that love comes in every shape size and way and that a true bond cannot be broken despite road blocks. The ones you love are always with you.And with ending this I will put a quote that most people have heard but it truly fits this movie Fairy tales are more than real Not because they tell us that dragons exist but that dragons can be defeated.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on the heartbreaking book BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA strays from the regular family film while still delivering a strong message.Two words you must remember before seeing this movie though FALSE ADVERTISING.Terabithia is NOT another Narnia by any means. It is advertised that way but it is not what it seems to be. For book fans however Terabithia is a great adaption.The acting is amazing Josh Hutcherson Little Manhattan pulls his part off excellently. Josh is one of the best male child stars of this generation without a doubt. Annasophia Robb Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stars in yet another Walden Media film and despite her disappointing performance in Because of WinnDixie she gives a great performance. She is able to captivate Leslie's innocence and freespirited nature without becoming annoying or obnoxious. Putting aside the two wonderful leads another star shines The puppyfaced Bailee Madison. Her smile lights up the screen and she is cute without getting on your nerves. She steals every scene she has a line in. The other children and the adults again are great and this is what truly makes the movie move along.The moral? Many worried parents seem to have the wrong idea of this movie. I can understand why but you must look beyond the obvious. This movie does not just make us realize what reality is but it shows us love friendship and courage.

	schema:headline " Great adaptation of a beloved book!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bridge To Terabithia was my favorite book as a kid  I first read it over 25 years ago. It was an amazing haunting sad and powerful story of friendship and loss. It's still one of my favorite books as both an adult and a writer. It has since become a modern classic of children's literature a book beloved by children and adults alike. It's also one of the most controversial children's books of all time  one of the most banned and challenged.But I never expected it to be made into a feature film. I assumed that the mediocre madeforTV version would be the only film adaptation made of Bridge To Terabithia due to its difficult themes. I was absolutely shocked to learn that Disney's Walden Media division was making a feature film. I envisioned a bubblegum monstrosity having almost nothing to do with the book on which it was based.I was never more happy to be wrong in my life! This is a wonderful adaptation of Bridge To Terabithia and very faithful to Katherine Paterson's beautiful heartbreaking story. That's because the movie was coproduced and cowritten by David Paterson whose reallife childhood tragedy inspired his mother to write the book.Fifthgrader Jess Aarons Josh Hutcherson is a poor introverted but artistically gifted farm boy living in rural Virginia. He has four sisters. His two older sisters despise him and his younger sisters worship him. With money so tight Jess's emotionally distant foultempered father spends most of his time working out of town.The only bright spot in Jess's life is his pretty hip music teacher Miss Edmunds Zooey Deschanel who admires Jess' talent for drawing and encourages him to try and realize his dream of becoming an artist. Jess has a huge secret crush on her.Jess has no friends but he hopes to win his peers' admiration by becoming the fastest kid in the fifth grade and winning the big race at recess. Jess is shocked when a new classmate  a girl named Leslie Burke Annasophia Robb  decides to join in the boys' race. She ends up beating him and embarrassing him in front of the other boys. That's no way to start a friendship but soon Jess and Leslie become inseparable best friends.Leslie is the complete opposite of Jess  she's bright outgoing and a fierce nonconformist. She's also creative like Jess  a natural storyteller with a vast imagination. Together Leslie and Jess create Terabithia a secret imaginary kingdom in the forest where they rule as king and queen. It becomes a sanctuary for them where they are safe from ridicule the reallife school bullies that persecute them and the imaginary monsters that Leslie dreams up.To Jess Leslie is more than just his best friend. She's his soulmate and his reason for living. She took a poor awkward farm boy and made him a king. For the first time in his life Jess feels good about himself. With Leslie by his side he's invincible. She also teaches him important life lessons like being compassionate to those in need  even if you don't like them.Then suddenly a terrible unimaginable tragedy takes Leslie away from Jess forever. Devastated and nearly crushed by the weight of his grief Jess must summon all the strength Leslie gave him in order to cope with his loss and make the magic of Terabithia  and Leslie's memory  live on.This is one of the alltime great tearjerkers a story of great emotional depth and power. So bring lots of Kleenex. I'm a grown man now and I've read the book many times but I still tear up at the end. The movie is just as powerful and Josh Hutcherson's superb emotional performance will melt even the hardest of hearts. Annasophia Robb is magnificent as Leslie. She literally becomes the apotheosis of the character.The supporting cast is excellent as well especially Robert Patrick as Jess' father  a role that's a far cry from the witty tough guys he usually plays.Beautifully and sensitively directed by animator Gabor Csupo in his first liveaction film Bridge To Terabithia also features a soaring gorgeous soundtrack by Aaron Zigman. As I said before the script by David Paterson and Jeff Stockwell is very faithful to the book and captures all the emotion of the story. However I must say that some key scenes of character development in the book are either not in the script have been changed or are woefully underdeveloped.If you haven't read the book I wholeheartedly encourage you to read it after you see the movie. Some fans of the book may complain about the changes and omissions but I've been a fan for over 25 years and I think that this is a firstrate adaptation of Bridge To Terabithia.".

The movie is very faithful to the book but also brings new life to the material. The actors who play Jesse Hutcherson and Leslie AnnaSophia Robb were both fantastic and literally could have stepped straight out of the book. Given their respective ages I was very impressed with the level of acting talent especially as the film draws on some adultrelated themes. The visuals were fantastic and potential viewers of this film should know that the fantasy element was not at all overdone.

I found the movie confusing mean and upsetting. They really never developed the back story of the kids to explain why they are some what misfit. There wasn't much activity in or about Terabithia except at the very end of the movie. There's a creepy teacher who I felt was not developed as the kind caring understanding type of teacher but as being just a little to interested in the boy when she only takes him on a field trip into the city. Last The death of the girl. When the girl drowns in the creek I was shocked. I had tears flowing down my face. It was very sad and I really wasn't expecting this twist. This movie is advertised as a children's movie. I can imagine how this would really upset children. So I say the reviewsadvertising should have have warned me of the true nature of this story.".

I found the movie confusing mean and upsetting. They really never developed the back story of the kids to explain why they are some what misfit. There wasn't much activity in or about Terabithia except at the very end of the movie. There's a creepy teacher who I felt was not developed as the kind caring understanding type of teacher but as being just a little to interested in the boy when she only takes him on a field trip into the city. Last The death of the girl. When the girl drowns in the creek I was shocked. I had tears flowing down my face. It was very sad and I really wasn't expecting this twist. This movie is advertised as a children's movie. I can imagine how this would really upset children. So I say the reviewsadvertising should have have warned me of the true nature of this story.";

She is more fortunate at home  cool successful parents  so she better tolerates to be bullied at school. The two quickly become best friends. So far the movie is just average.Now there the first of the two elements of the story the two elect a piece of wood as an imagined magical world of their own where they are king and queen. We get to see this world though their imaginative eyes  elves and trolls and whatever. Part of this world clearly mimics the rest of their real lives.Problem is the movie fails miserably at this element. The world is rather uninteresting and totally unlike a world imagined by a child. No room for self humor or exaggeration or details. Everything is too simple. Both children but especially her are far far too wise. They never really let go of themselves. That's just a lot more boring that any madeup world is supposed to be. Compare with Calvin and Hobbes fantasies. That is how a world imagined by a child can look like.The movie here also starts to focus the interior struggle between let imagination rule and get out of your Peter Pan syndrome. The former wins. The movie fails miserably here too maybe characters are just too flat for that. Fact is the struggle just look stupid excessively stylized and plain straightforward.So now is the time for the second main element of the plot tragedy strikes. Unexpectedly she has a random accident and dies. How will everybody and especially he react to this? Not too bad after all. Everybody is just a little sad her family moves then life goes on.This tragedy element has little connection with the previous one and seems just a strong element inserted at random in an attempt to add flavor to this insipid movie. Failure again. For the second time character are probably just too flat to produce anything interesting at this point. For an example of a really touching movie that believably and profoundly depicts the tragedy of a missing child see Stanza del figlio by Moretti. The comparison is embarrassing.Summary the movie is based on two elements with huge potential unchecked imagination interesting full of artistic potential and death of a child deeply moving full of emotional potential.

	schema:headline " A decent movie in itself but horrible as a fantasy and for children";
	schema:reviewBody "To be fair Bridge to Terabithia is actually quite a nice movie....if you ignore the fact that it is advertised as fantasy and aimed at children. If it were marketed correctly I would be pressed to give it a MUCH higher rating but as it stands it is completely inappropriate.I have never read the book so I'll admit that I went willingly into it uninformed but neither have a lot of other people who made that same decision and I imagine the people in charge of the movie must have realized this. It therefor falls on the previews to accurately portray the content of the film for those of us unfamiliar with the original text but whoever was responsible for that failed miserably.By the trailers one would reasonably expect the movie to be something akin to The Chronicles of Narnia children entering their own miraculous fantasy land with all sorts of adventure and no shortage of magical creatures.What you get is only a few brief glimpses at anything even remotely whimsical. There are some monster squirrels and a giant troll based off of real life bullies they have problems with at school and the Dark Master who is only ever seen as a black blur running through the trees and never has a direct encounter with any of the characters.The majority of the movie deals with hard life issues like emotionally distant family members bullying isolation and the harsh reality that you have to grow up and leave your childish fantasies behind sooner or later that the real word is a rough place and you have to learn to weather it. That's all well and good in a comingofage film for older kids but that is not what it's marketed as or who it's aimed at.The fantasy elements which we rarely actually get to see are imagined by the two main characters Jess and Leslie as a coping mechanism and never fully developed until the very end of the movie where Terabithia FINALLY comes alive in its fullest but we only get to see it for a few seconds before the credits roll.There is a bit somewhere in the middle where they bring up religious commentary out of nowhere and why they feel the need to do that is anybody's guess as it has very little to do with any part of the movie before that moment. It ends up coming off as awkward and a bit pretentious on the writer's part and probably should have been cut. Not to speak poorly of religion or Christianity it just seemed totally out of place here. But perhaps worst of all is Leslie's death. The movie spends the whole time up to that building her up as a sort of personal savior for Jess. He is alone at school and at home with nobody to appreciate his love for the arts until Leslie and her family move in next door and he finally meets a kindred spirit. They fast become best friends and through Leslie Jess can finally experience happiness. If they had left it at that this might have been a perfect kids' movie but instead near the end of the film they kill Leslie off out of nowhere while Jess is away on a trip with his teacher at the museum and when he comes home his parents just lay it on him. So not only does he lose the closest person to him at that point he is not allowed to say goodbye to her and the news that she is gone is dropped on him like a bomb.It is truly and completely tragic. They just keep laying one thing after another on poor Jess until you feel YOU the viewer from the outside are going to cave under the feeling of complete and total hopelessness and grief.Now everyone has to learn to deal with tragedy at some point and it would be perfectly acceptable if the people in charge of advertising had given us fair warning of this ahead of time but they did no such thing. They made it seem like a bright fun fantastic children's movie and then blindsided us with a load of bereavement so overwhelming that it smothers the rest of the film and makes you feel horrible afterward. I am twentyone years old and well acquainted with these sorts of things and I was surprised into tears when they killed that sweet little girl. There is no way a little kid would be ready to handle that.I feel as though I was tricked into watching this movie and it was almost shameful for those in charge to advertise it for young children.".

	schema:headline " Young Lincoln Gets the 'Ford' Treatment!";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history with more classic films released than in any other and John Ford directed three of the best Stagecoach Drums Along the Mohawk and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union Young Mr. Lincoln.With the world plunging into a war that America dreaded but knew it would be drawn into Abraham Lincoln was much on people's minds in 1939 as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life and had triumphed. On Broadway Robert E. Sherwood's awardwinning Abe Lincoln in Illinois with Raymond Massey's physically deadon portrayal was playing to packed houses it would be filmed in 1940. Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography Abraham Lincoln The War Years was published and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in speeches and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. became the most popular landmark in town a fact that Frank Capra made good use of in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century Fox as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's screenplay of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer he designated it a 'prestige' production and assigned John Ford to direct and Henry Fonda to star.Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'Great Emancipator' and feared a bad performance would damage his career. Even a filmed makeup test in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln wouldn't change his mind. According to Fonda John Ford whom he'd never worked with cussed him out royally at their first meeting and explained he wasn't portraying the Lincoln of Legend but a young jackanape country lawyer facing his first murder trial. Humbled Fonda took the role. John Ford offered a different scenario of the events but the outcome was the same! Obviously they found a chemistry together that worked as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.Unlike the introverted melancholiaracked Lincoln of Abe Lincoln in Illinois Ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney who made friends easily and misses the mother he lost too young resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story. Injustice riles him and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's undocumented relationship with Ann Rutledge in Ford's version the pair are truly in love and committed to each other. After her death Lincoln would frequently visit her grave to share his life with her 'spirit' a theme Ford would continue in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the bigcity 'intellectuals' represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek and his slick 'advisor' Stephen Douglas played by a young Milburn Stone and the informal rulebending country sense of Lincoln. With Ford 'regular' Ward Bond as a key witness the trial is both unconventional and riveting.With the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance and his destiny dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just good would ultimately triumph.Young Mr. Lincoln is a truly remarkable film from an amazing year!".

Obviously they found a chemistry together that worked as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.Unlike the introverted melancholiaracked Lincoln of Abe Lincoln in Illinois Ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney who made friends easily and misses the mother he lost too young resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story. Injustice riles him and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play on Lincoln's undocumented relationship with Ann Rutledge in Ford's version the pair are truly in love and committed to each other. After her death Lincoln would frequently visit her grave to share his life with her 'spirit' a theme Ford would continue in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln's inexperience yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the bigcity 'intellectuals' represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek and his slick 'advisor' Stephen Douglas played by a young Milburn Stone and the informal rulebending country sense of Lincoln. With Ford 'regular' Ward Bond as a key witness the trial is both unconventional and riveting.With the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance and his destiny dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just good would ultimately triumph.Young Mr. Lincoln is a truly remarkable film from an amazing year!";

	schema:reviewBody "Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the directorstar collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge.John Ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the Great Emancipator but just a jackleg prairie lawyer. That being settled Fonda headed a cast that John Ford directed into a classic film.This is not a biographical film of Lincoln. That had come before in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln Raymond Massey did the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.But as Ford said Fonda wasn't playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois. The film encompasses about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him clerking in a general store getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaving Lincoln a most melancholy being.Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice. He's served a couple of terms in the legislature but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him.This is where the bulk of the action takes place. The two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff. The trial itself is fiction but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case Lincoln defended. I'll say no more.Other than the performances the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town in a Fourth of July celebration. It's almost like you're watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself young vibrant and growing.Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance the tune Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays Mary Todd is the same one Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to in My Darling Clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in Tombstone. Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons I believe. The first is he's the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. In fact Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the background Lincoln came from. And secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War albeit for some necessary political reasons. His assassination assured his place in history.Besides Fonda and others I've mentioned special praise should also go to Fred Kohler Jr. and Ward Bond the two town louts Kohler being the murder victim and Bond the chief accuser. Also Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in you can't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.".

You can see Ford coming to terms with the grand Griffithesque vision of America through its most complicated avatar Lincoln. Ford's love for his country was more like Lincoln's than Griffith's anyway like Lincoln he acknowledged the genius of the democratic experiment but he was also aware of its dangers mob rule and selfsatisfaction. YML's greatest scenes are all about this.First there's the local parade Abe attends surrounded by yahoos whom he loves but also sees for what they are. We see him in another scene accepting a legal case from one of these  and warily biting the coin offered him for a retainer. Veterans of the recent War of 1812 and Indian Wars march through the crowd is wild for them Abe merely respectful.Then a agon of old men in tricorners is pulled through the parade route. No one seems to know who they are. Lincoln quietly informs his friends that they are veterans of the War for Independence  and gravely doffs his stovepipe hat. His friends mildly ashamed it appears of their prevous jingoistic glee follow suit and stand silent and hatless as the old men pass.Then the mildly ludicrous plot  about two brothers accused of another man's murder  kicks in and Abe goes to work. The scene where he confronts a lynch mob putting his foot up against the log they're using for a batteringram against the jailhouse door is a classic by any standard. But note how Abe talks to the mob on its own level while remaining in spirit resolutely on his own higher plane. After appealing to their macho impulses by offering to lick any man here he delivers a housedivided speech that soothes their savagery and leaves them confused and irresolute. Dontcha wanna put that log down now boys? he asks when they have been flummoxed by his eloquence. Ain't it gettin' a mite heavy?Throughout Ford indulges in shameless historical foreshadowings that would have made Stephen Vincent Benet blush. Abe meets Mary Todd and Stephen Douglas he rides down a dirt road with a bumpkin who's playing a new tune called Dixie on a jawharp. Kinda makes you feel like marchin'! says the bumpkin as he and Abe ride through a muddy patch in the road.The ending is impossible to describe without inviting derision but I swear to you it works. Having won his case Lincoln allows as how he might take a walk  maybe to the top of that hill. As he trudges on the skies send down rain and lightning  and Abe seems to know what this is a prelude to.I acknowledge the superiority of the great Ford films that came after but I will always have a special place in my heart for Young Mr. Lincoln.

	schema:reviewBody "Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like.  It is a fooler.  Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe on the surface that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin.  But through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.  In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor.  It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect.  There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard.

	onyx:emotionText "Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like.  It is a fooler.  Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe on the surface that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin.  But through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him.  In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor.  It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect.  There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard.  He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War.

This classic film about the early life and career of Abraham Lincoln offers a portrait of the eloquent United States leader that emerges wordforword in some instances from the pages of history. For example the campaign speech delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the first few minutes of the production was taken verbatim from historical records. The central storyline is loosely based upon an actual court case conducted by Abraham Lincoln early in the course of his legal career.Today Americans sometimes forget that Abraham Lincoln did indeed possess less than a year of formal education...Yet he taught himself to read and write and he could quote long passages of Scripture entirely from memory. He mastered a number of difficult academic subjects entirely on his own volition. Young Mr. Lincoln accurately depicts the nation's Sixteenth President as an ambitious and enterprising selfstarter an aspiring politician with a concern for other people and a devotion to principle and morality. It makes everyone remember just one more reason why Abraham Lincoln remains an enduring influential and inspiring figure in modern history.This wonderful film by the great director John Ford boasts a talented cast of actors and actresses and includes a powerful portrayal of young Abraham Lincoln by Henry Fonda. It presents material suitable for all ages. This classic film would make an excellent literary addition to most modern high school and college History classrooms. The film offers a refreshing depiction of Abraham Lincoln by offering a perspective on a more innocent era in civic life in the USA.".

	schema:reviewBody "And on the most exalted throne in the world sits nothing but a man's arse.  Montaigne John Ford directs Young Mr. Lincoln. Released in 1939 the film plays like a precursor to Ford's The Sun Shines Bright itself a loose remake of Ford's own Judge Priest. All three films feature kindly wise rural lawmen who pretend to represent American values and who save wrongfully persecuted workers from lynchmobs.Lincoln charts the early life of Abraham Lincoln the soontobe sixteenth president of the United States. Early scenes sketch Lincoln as a humble folksy hero. He's plain speaking modest shrewd witty and identifies with the poor. The film's opening sequence finds Lincoln's handlers denouncing acting President Andrew Jackson. Lincoln then states his own policies I am in favour of a National Bank and for everybody's participation in wealth! Jackson of course was famous for his Bank Wars which sought to dismantle and limit the exploitative powers of the central bank system. Lincoln meanwhile would back the National Banking Acts which created a highly cartelized banking system and partially necessitated a growing Empire.Other odd scenes abound. Early in the film Lincoln champions credit which a poor family reject. They prefer straightforward barter. The scene is repeated later in the film only here Lincoln is paid with coin for his pro bono work. Later Lincoln is shown struggling to judge two pieces of pie possibly an allusion to the Civil War Lincoln the purported bringer of unity rather than division. Before this he is portrayed as a rural lawman who defends the poor and presides over petty disputes though in reality he'd quickly become a corporate layer Whig and stooge to special interests.Elsewhere the film portrays Lincoln as existing or operating outside the normal sphere of politics. Lincoln stands for God moral virtues truth the scripture and family Right and wrong that's all there is to it!. He embodies an instinctual or innate sense of Justice and Fairness which transcends written laws. He believes the state should honour the most humble and vulnerable people and that personal sacrifice  a long walk which he himself takes  is a good thing. Such a stance encapsulates the idealist project of the film.One of the best written examinations of this aspect of the film can be found in a 1970 Cahiers du Cinema text titled Young Mr. Lincoln texte collectif. Written by all the magazine's editors the essay became a landmark of AngloAmerican film criticism and what some would call the most anthologised taught and referenced essay in film theory primarily for its role in politicising filmcriticism the Cahiers group at the time were influenced by French philosopher Louis Althusser.Writing on the way Ford portrays moral and spiritual virtues as being worth more than political guile the magazine said But this very repression of politics on which the ideological undertaking of the film is based is itself a direct result of political assumptions the eternal false idealist debate between morality and politics Descartes versus Machiavelli the very ideology of American Capitalism is to assert its divine right to conceptualise it in terms of permanence naturalism and even biology and to extol it as a universal Good and Power. This enterprise which conceals politics under the idealist mask of Morality has the effect of regilding the cause of Capital with the gold of myth by manifesting the spirituality in which American Capitalism believes it finds its origins and sees its eternal justification. The seeds of Lincoln's future were already sown in his youth the future of America its eternal values is already written into Lincoln's moral virtues which include the Republican Party and Capitalism. Young Mr. Lincoln was produced by the infamous Darryl Zanuck. Some read the movie in terms of the upcoming 1940 Presidential election which pitted the incumbent Democrat Franklin Roosevelt against the Republican party. The Cahiers writers themselves described the film as American Big Business goes to war against the New Deal but Zanuck produced The Grapes of Wrath soon after and Ford was long trading in Lincoln's themes. The film ends with Lincoln striding off into a thunderstorm the whirlwinds of the Civil War on the horizon. Here the Battle Hymn of the Republic plays a song which covertly links Lincoln to Christ a lawman sent to judge the wicked.Aesthetically Young Mr. Lincoln is excellent. Ford's customary rural poetry and immaculate framing are on display as well as his fondness for communal activities dances and town gatherings. For Ford family state community and moral virtues coalesce into an ideal which is sometimes threatened  by ridiculous strawmen racists Indians drunks bullies  but never destroyed. The film possesses another likable performance by Fonda Fonda's Lincoln is out of place amongst both the poor and the wealthy but uses his charm to seduce both groups and a neat vein of humour particularly in its final act where Lincoln destroys his opposition with a series of jokes. Like a superhero origins tale the film paints in broad mythological brushstrokes. Ford even goes so far as to have Lincoln ride into town on a donkey evocative of Jesus' famous muleride into Jerusalem. This was the first of Ford's seven collaborations with Henry Fonda.510  Worth one viewing.".

I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on I'll just call you Jackass then???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head.".

However I heartily agreed with the quote from Henry Fonda who played Lincoln that I felt as if I were portraying Christ himself on film. The bottom line is that the film loses a lot of credibility because Lincoln is a caricature in the filma man too pure too good and too unlike us have been a real person. This silly superhumanness is made worse by the scriptone that is the exact opposite of the old TV motto from Dragnet. Instead of changing the names the protect the innocent this film keeps the names but completely changes the facts to suit a Hollywood need to make Lincoln a saint. This is true in this film and is even more apparent in films like D.W. Griffith's dull biopic of Lincoln 1930.The myths are many but a few I'll tackle are Anne Rutledge and the trial that took up about 75 of the movie. As for Rutledge historians will agree that Lincoln knew this ladybut as for a romance between them most doubt this ever occurred. At the same time there is a lot that we DO know about Lincoln's wife Mary Todd but in this film she has almost no personality and has no impact on Abe. So this is an odd case where a myth is promoted and a true story the marriage is omittedeven though it was VERY fascinating and could make a great movie in itself Mary was an odd and rather crazy lady. As for the trial it actually DID occurbut the events were very very different. And you'd think that based on its title the film would have a lot more to do with Lincoln and his early life! So who is this film good for then? Well people who like somewhat dull biopics that are fictionalized would love this film and perhaps John Ford fans would like itthough ford himself was not happy about the projectmuch of it because the studio insisted on injecting some pretty sappy myths into it beyond what you already had in the original script. Frankly I think a comic book version of Abe's life or even Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter might be more informative!".

And he never let the idea of a good story get in the way of the truth about the real events that some of his films are based on.This is especially true with Young Mr. Lincoln a highly fictionalized accounting of the early days of Abraham Lincoln's law practice. If you are looking for insight about Mr. Lincoln or a story about Mr. Lincoln's early political aspirations forget about it. This is Ford's country and his stories are about ideals his ideals and if he can use an Abraham Lincoln or a Tom Joad or an Ethan Edwards to communicate those ideals than he will. And if he has to bend the truth a little or even a lot it doesn't really matter. The idea is to let the audience know what he believes America is and how it should be.Young Mr. Lincoln is not a great film but it does have a pair of great performances. First and foremost is a wonderful portrayal of the alternately melancholy and insecure Lincoln performed by Henry Fonda. Fonda is at the top of his game communicating the uneasiness and insecurity of Lincoln.The other top performance is turned in by Alice Brady as the mother of two defendants that Lincoln tries to clear. Her performance is nothing short of heartbreaking. All the rest of the cast especially Ward Bond does the requisite amount of mugging and upstaging that is customary in a Ford film.In conclusion if you're looking for a history lesson go elsewhere if what you want is American idealism look no further.".

	schema:headline " The Paths of Destiny ...";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't think the decision of making a movie about the most admired and beloved President of the United States during the rise of fascism and totalitarian regimes on the year of 1939 was fortuitous. The world was about to live its darkest hours and John Ford came up with Young Mr. Lincoln as a necessary reminder of the beauty and purity of the American ideals incarnated by one man Abraham Lincoln ... But while the movie could have sinned by being overly patriotic Ford chose a more nuanced direction with no room for obvious material and it ironically made the 'propaganda' aspect more efficient and the film no less enjoyable.Abraham Lincoln is portrayed by Henry Fonda with an uncanny resemblance that will get more and more impressive as the movie progresses. But I guess the reason why Fonda wasn't nominated for an Oscar which surprised me was because the characterization's strength relied more on the direction. John Ford creates Lincoln through very subtle and eloquent contrasts. Take the first scene the man in political campaign has all the mannerisms of corruption speaking loudly and standing with confidence waving arms like an Antic comedian. And then comes Abe a young man in a horizontal position a bit clumsy when he's standing as if he's still trying to domesticate his tall and heavy demeanor. But after the previous histrionic speech the audience waits for a new tone ...Lincoln tries to find where to put his hands very uneasy he still lacks confidence but when he starts talking something happens. The way he talks this humility exudes a sincerity that the children in the audience got the sign of a promising future. Fate is marching on but there's still this sweet innocence so unlike the figure we know. In the later scene we see him again lying near a tree as if the towering man still prefers to stay out of the public but I think there's more about this. This is Ford showing Lincoln as the symbolic continuation of the tree the man as the tree the pillar of America the eternal symbol of justice. No wonder he's studying law under it. And then comes Ann the girl who encourages him foreseing a great future. And we feel like a forbidden love growing between them as illustrated by another allegory with the hostile branches and the barrier that kind of blocks their way.And this leads to one of the most abrupt ellipses with the next shot featuring her grave she's dead. Why? How? All we know is that there'll be no obstacle for Abe's destiny. Destiny which plays a significant part like in this poignant scene where Abe lets one branch decide if he's going to continue law studies or stay at home. The branch falls in the direction of his girlfriend's grave and seals his fate ... although he wonders if he didn't unconsciously let it fall that way. This touch summarizes what I particularly liked in this film showing Lincoln as a man who has this unique quality to be serious without taking himself seriously he obviously cheats in this game because he feels like inhabited by a greater future. He then becomes a lawyer and settles in Springfield.And his profession reinforces his attachment to true American principles among them free circulation of money  look at the cold stare he addressed to the man who was about to give him a fake piece Lincoln could be a falcon with natural authority. And when the poor mother paid him at the end he accepted out of respect for money one of the pillars of success and prosperity and for the pride of the family he saved. Family as the second principle and more generally community as symbolized by the circles ... whether meant for lynching or dancing. In both cases Lincoln is the outsider who makes his entrance with authority for the mob or clumsiness for the aristocracy. He's standing alone and can't get into the dancing circle during the ball only till Mary invites him and as he said he's the worst dancer and does look ridiculous.And this is one of his admirable qualities modesty and capacity to always tell the truth. Even for his weaknesses his sincerity shows a strength that would belong to one great leader and no surprise than in the scene after when we expect something romantic he just stares at the river and doesn't even pay attention to Mary who chooses to slide away. He's again contemplating a promising future something great that transcends his environment. The truth is marching and speaking of truth he'll take any juror who's a drunkard and admits his weakness over one who thinks he's better than the next fellow. He will prevent the mother who saw her two boys 'killing' a man from denouncing one of them as he will never let the Secession destroy his country family is as sacred a principle as union. His youth already planted the seeds of a profound attachment to noble virtues. He'll bring the light as he did for the murder case where Ford showed his talent again because the murderer was obvious despite the obscurity and we missed it. Lincoln is the light.There is a transformation smoothly going during the movie as we see a man lost in his own selfdeprecation and derision and builds a character out of that. At the end Fonda even sits like Lincoln his demeanor is more powerful. And as he's walking to the hill he looks more and more like the Lincoln we know and the film ends with the Washington Monument as if good old John Ford was artificially injecting some propaganda material telling us  now this is the 'Lincoln' you all know but he doesn't fool anyone this movie is about a more human Lincoln and no less fascinating. Yes siree ...".

	schema:headline " Young Mr. Lincoln is classic film from John Ford";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 was a banner year for John Ford. He directed Stagecoach Drums Along the Mohawk and this excellent movie. All three films are now considered classics and worthy of indepth analysis and study. Young Mr. Lincoln doesn't have the action sequences of the other two films mentioned but it makes up for that with its atmosphere and an undercurrent of the coming Civil War. Despite the quaint rural setting there seems to be a foreboding of doom just around the corner and the film is loaded with symbolism. On the outside Lincoln as played by Henry Fonda can be easily mistaken for a goodnatured country boy with little ambition. Inside his character is far more complex and torn between which path to take in his life. Director Ford injects as much local flavor into the proceedings as he can with a county fair scene that's loaded with humor and coupled with a firm nod to history. The veterans of two wars pass by in a parade to remind viewers just how far the new country had progressed in a short period of time. The pieeating contest with Lincoln doing the judging and a tugofwar between locals are also highlights. The film eventually centers itself on a court case where the inexperienced Lincoln must defend two young farmers accused of murder. Using all the intelligence wit and perseverance he can muster Lincoln is able to win the day by exposing the real guilty party. It's his sharp eye for identifying the truth that saves him and his clients from disaster. Along the way there are omens of the future dropped in from time to time. The last scene where Lincoln is walking alone near the top of a hill during a driving rain storm is symbolic of the rocky road that's ahead of him. All this would be nothing more than a brief trip down history in the hands of a less competent director than John Ford. Instead this great filmmaker is able to project a multifaceted Lincoln who disguises his intelligence with jokes and stories but can lower the boom on an opponent at a moment's notice. There's a lot going on in young Mr. Lincoln's head and Ford makes sure his audience understands that. The rest of the cast includes Alice Brady as the mother of the two accused murderers Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Ward Bond playing a duplicitous character named J. Palmer Cass. What Lincoln does with that fellow's name during a cross examination is hilarious. For true film buffs look for Milburn Stone Doc from TV's Gunsmoke in a small role as Stephen Douglas Lincoln's nemesis and future political opponent. Also the director's older brother Francis Ford appears in a brief but pivotal scene as a drunken juror named Sam Boone. As usual the rest of John Ford's Stock Company of players are all featured.".

He captures Lincoln's gravitas while still portraying him as an ordinary human being. In particular he captures Lincoln's plainspoken manner lending him an every man status even as the film glorifies him.The film also benefits from some back door social commentary particularly in a scene where his clients are about to be lynched. Although Lincoln's speech is directed to the situation at hand it offers a pointed criticism of the lynchings then common in the South.The film does at times slip into hagiography particularly the ending which features Lincoln walking into an oncoming storm in a bit of over the top symbolism.

There was no more American a filmmaker than the great John Ford who was never more at home than when he was in the mythic Wild West a place of beauty violence and mysticism.

While that film portrayed the brutality that people are capable of juxtaposed with a story of oneman's fierce determination Young Mr. Lincoln shows the brutality of America and how one man's fierce determination can overcome the odds and make a difference. The partiallyfictionalised court case is based on the case of William 'Duff' Armstrong a man accused of murder who was proved innocent by Lincoln against a state that believed he was guilty.Although Ford wisely chooses to keep the focus on Lincoln's early manhood rather than to fit in his entire life the film is sill confined to the rules of the biopic. The film suffers by being episodic shifting from Lincoln's early discovery of law to his relocation to the love interest to the 'big event' that will define him at this point in his life. Knowing Ford's gift for storytelling the film is disappointingly simplistic in structure. It is however anchored by a very impressive Henry Fonda performance whose appearance is uncanny to Lincoln under some effective makeup. And as you would expect the cinematography is superb and proves that noone can capture America like John Ford.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "In retrospect this was the first of a onetwo punch Hollywood characterization of prepresidential Lincoln as the US prepared for a probable eventual formal participation in WW II. Unfortunately most people feel this version suffers in comparison with Ramon Massey's characterization in 'Abe Lincoln in Illinois' which covers most of Lincoln's prepresidential period not just up through his early years as a young lawyer and politicianas the present film does. Yes Lincoln had his morose private side at times but Fonda's Lincoln too often comes across as Zombielike not helped by his sometimes excessive eye makeup. Fonda's Lincoln periodically demonstrates his willingness to participate in various physically demanding tasks and activities after he has become an established townie. However I don't understand the point of his participation in a tug of war tying the end of the rope to a horse cart which then pulls the opposition trough a big mud puddle. What lesson of Lincoln's character does this demonstrate? Imagintion? Winning any which way? His sense of humor? Perhaps all of the above? Also Lincoln's use of apt anecdotes in his courtroom and political persona is well known but his respectful treatment of his opposition was also legendary. Thus his attempt to discredit a witness by changing his name from John Cass to Jackass would seem out of character if eliciting a raucous laugh from the courtroom and theater audience. Although Lincoln was known for generally being easy going and careless in his personal appearance I doubt if he lounged with his feet up on a table while cross examining a witness! I'm sure this characterization was meant to convey the relative informality and crudeness of even formal culture near the western frontier. When traveling out of town on horseback Fonda often had a coonskin capped traveling companion signifying his continuing emotional attachment to his frontiersman roots. However be aware that sensible frontiersmenincluding Boone and Crocket didn't wear such hats in the warm season. They were too hot! Lincoln's involvement in one murder case dominates the second half of the film. The details of this murder revealed at the end would seem very unlikely however there is a message in this story. The question is How best to handle extracting justice for criminal acts. Three possibilities are dramatized. The first mob vigilante hanging is vehemently opposed by Lincoln as too often resulting in punishment of innocents or of a party simply trying to defend themselves. This is a very effective scene. Fonda would again star in a film dramatizing this point 'The OxBow Incident' released during US involvement in WWII. This film was not generally well received at the box office although it won critical plaudits. Perhaps this was because of its ponderous pacing but perhaps also because war involves what amounts to legalized vigilante killings...The second approach is exemplified by Donald Meek's portrayal of the prosecuting attorney opposing Lincoln as defense attorney. He represents excessive legalism excessive badgering of witnessesexcessive pomp and excessive ambition to win a case at the expense of the truth. Lincoln's middle way is presented as the best way dispense with legalisms and court formalities if they get in the way of truth and justice. Spin some apt humorous stories to liven up the legal proceedings. Perhaps most important a good lawyer will eventually guess the truth and find a way to prove it. That message is perhaps the saving grace of this film and is one that most people can agree with. Unfortunately it is very seldom practiced. That's just not the way the standard legal system is set up to function. Lawyers are advocates for clients not truth seekers as are judges and juriesideally.".

	schema:headline " A toolittleknown and toolittleappreciated gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Now this is what I call a toolittleknown gem. Despite being a perpetual student of film and being a fan of Vincent Price 1960s films and the various genres this film can be seen as I somehow overlooked this title for years. I can't remember anyone else I've read or talked to who mentioned this title. Maybe that's because a film like this is an acquired taste one that apparently many people haven't acquired. I must have come across it sometime but I didn't really notice it until I stumbled across it on Netflix recently. Some of the descriptive terms that regularly pop up in others' reviews of this film include silly ridiculous goofy insane and absurd. I wouldn't disagree with any of those terms. What I would disagree with is that they denote something undesirable in films or that they denote something that deserves less respect than other descriptors. Other admirable terms that I would add include surreal satirical madcap occasionally atmospheric and funny. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine certainly isn't intended to be realistic and despite popular conceptions it's not intended to just be a laughoutloud comedy either.One could think of Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine as what we now call high conceptVincent Price in a transformative mode between his Cormandirected Poe characters and Dr. Phibes meets Frankie Avalon in a beach film attitude meets James Bond meets 1960s 'madcap''screwball' comedy.Price is Dr. Goldfoot a satire of a Bond mad scientist with a name that's obviously a pun on Goldfinger. He's planning on usurping the wealth of some of the world's richest men by creating a veritable army of hot robotic women in gold bikinis appropriately enough since they're mechanical but artificially intelligentsentient golddiggers. Todd Armstrong Dwayne Hickman is one of the victims of the nefarious plan and Craig Gamble Frankie Avalon an almost secret agent becomes involved because the robot aiming for Armstrong initially mistakes Gamble for himthey have a similar look. Gamble falls in love with her and searches for her once she disappears. This gradually leads to Armstrong and the eventual discovery of Dr. Goldfoot's scheme.In the 1960s filmmakers were on the upswing of increasing experimentation. The Hays Production Code which filmmakers had started seriously challenging in the 1950s was decreasingly influential or enforceable and would be abandoned before the end of the decade. In addition to broaching previously forbidden subject matter and images filmmakers were also increasingly experimenting with the structure of films. The roots of this were the same as the roots fueling parallel revolutions in pop music for example and more importantly in society leading to the lifestyle experimentation of the hippies. For films plots were often pushed and prodded including some attempts to effectively abandon them. The result was a lot of sprawling and toooftenmessy madcap comedies. In a number of famous cases such as Casino Royale 1967 or What's New Pussycat 1965 the experimentation ended up hurting the films as much as helping. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine has the same basic attitude and sense of experimentation but director Norman Taurog and writers Robert Kaufman James H. Nicholson and Elwood Ullman admirably keep a relatively tight lid on their plot. It gives us the best aspects of the era's freewheeling sense of filmic adventure while not forgetting about the importance of a coherent story.As a Price fan some of my favorite moments arrived with Price satirizing his previous screen personae. Dr. Goldfoot lives in an elaborate laboratorydungeon beneath a funeral parlor that serves as a front this is prescient in an oblique way of Don Coscarelli's 1979 film Phantasm and many scenes of Dr. Goldfoot in his home environment are surprisingly atmospheric including the chamber housing Goldfoot's razor sharp pendulum which almost trumps the one in the Roger Corman Pit and the Pendulum 1961 which it references or questionably spoofs. Price is good with this kind of comedy if you like complex ambiguity because he's so dry and his comic characters are so closely played to his serious characters. It's a very subtle difference.Frankie Avalon is far less subtle but he's no worse for that and he's primarily done lighthearted roles anyway. Avalon's scenes often veer towards slapstick. Some of the best material in that vein arrived in his special agent office with his boss Donald J. Penny Fred Clark.Even though this is a 1960s film with one foot in the comedy genre as a Vincent Price film you wouldn't expect the climax to be an extended madcap chase scene. It is and it's one of the best sequences of the film. Our heroes and villains chase each other around the streets of San Francisco with some attendant very attractive cinematography in a miniSan Francisco travelogue in a number of increasingly absurd vehicles and scenarios.Insofar as Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is a James Bond spoofand that's a prominent mode although certainly not the only dominant oneit was obviously one of the influences on Austin Powers International Man of Mystery 1997. But Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine is also somewhat serious about its other genres and it satirizes golddigging marriages and highprofile divorces in a time where they were becoming much more commonplace in the public consciousness. Of course it's also a great excuse to watch a dozen scantily clad beautiful women who even gogo dance a bit for us.".

	onyx:emotionText "Now this is what I call a toolittleknown gem. Despite being a perpetual student of film and being a fan of Vincent Price 1960s films and the various genres this film can be seen as I somehow overlooked this title for years. I can't remember anyone else I've read or talked to who mentioned this title. Maybe that's because a film like this is an acquired taste one that apparently many people haven't acquired. I must have come across it sometime but I didn't really notice it until I stumbled across it on Netflix recently. Some of the descriptive terms that regularly pop up in others' reviews of this film include silly ridiculous goofy insane and absurd. I wouldn't disagree with any of those terms. What I would disagree with is that they denote something undesirable in films or that they denote something that deserves less respect than other descriptors. Other admirable terms that I would add include surreal satirical madcap occasionally atmospheric and funny. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine certainly isn't intended to be realistic and despite popular conceptions it's not intended to just be a laughoutloud comedy either.One could think of Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine as what we now call high conceptVincent Price in a transformative mode between his Cormandirected Poe characters and Dr. Phibes meets Frankie Avalon in a beach film attitude meets James Bond meets 1960s 'madcap''screwball' comedy.Price is Dr. Goldfoot a satire of a Bond mad scientist with a name that's obviously a pun on Goldfinger. He's planning on usurping the wealth of some of the world's richest men by creating a veritable army of hot robotic women in gold bikinis appropriately enough since they're mechanical but artificially intelligentsentient golddiggers. Todd Armstrong Dwayne Hickman is one of the victims of the nefarious plan and Craig Gamble Frankie Avalon an almost secret agent becomes involved because the robot aiming for Armstrong initially mistakes Gamble for himthey have a similar look. Gamble falls in love with her and searches for her once she disappears. This gradually leads to Armstrong and the eventual discovery of Dr. Goldfoot's scheme.In the 1960s filmmakers were on the upswing of increasing experimentation. The Hays Production Code which filmmakers had started seriously challenging in the 1950s was decreasingly influential or enforceable and would be abandoned before the end of the decade. In addition to broaching previously forbidden subject matter and images filmmakers were also increasingly experimenting with the structure of films. The roots of this were the same as the roots fueling parallel revolutions in pop music for example and more importantly in society leading to the lifestyle experimentation of the hippies. For films plots were often pushed and prodded including some attempts to effectively abandon them. The result was a lot of sprawling and toooftenmessy madcap comedies. In a number of famous cases such as Casino Royale 1967 or What's New Pussycat 1965 the experimentation ended up hurting the films as much as helping. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine has the same basic attitude and sense of experimentation but director Norman Taurog and writers Robert Kaufman James H.

As the robots created by Dr Goldfoot were obviously the major inspiration for Austin Power's fembots you could quite rightly expect this to be an ultracampy James Bond spoof like the Matt Helm Dean Martin and Flint James Coburn series that Mike Myers draws upon. Unfortunately after the swingin' title theme sung by The Supremes! it all goes rapidly downhill and despite a fun premise it's basically a dull and unfunny mess. TV's Dobie Gillis Dwayne Hickman and Beach movie fave Frankie Avalon play a stupid playboy and a stupid spy respectively who try and thwart the evil Dr Goldfoot Vincent Price in full on ham mode who plans on conning millionaires around the world out of their money by seducing them with female robots created by his bikini machine. I always enjoy watching Price but this surely must be one of the worst movies he was ever involved in. Veteran director Norman Taurog who made several Jerry Lewis and Elvis movies is given a complete turkey of a script and two awful performances by Hickman and Avalon and there's not much that can be done to save it. Even so Price fans will probably be able to sit through it without nodding off and Susan Hart is pretty cute. Also keep an eye our for cameos by Annette Funicello and Harvey Eric Von Zipper Lembeck and a laughable rock band called Sam and the Apemen. Somehow this rubbish was successful enough to warrant a sequel directed by  would you believe it?  Mario Bava!".

	schema:reviewBody "Vincent Price is a mad scientist named Dr. Goldfoot his Ali Baba shoes are gold and his fembots wear gold bikinis! who uses beautiful female robots to seduce rich bachelors to swindle them! Frankie Avalon is one of the worst secret agents imaginable only hired at his agency because his longsuffering uncle is over the operations the government hates them though!. But Avalon's Craig Gamble he is so dire at his job that his code number is a fraction! stumbles literally onto Goldfoot's criminal enterprise when he becomes fixated with one of the fembots Diane Susan Hart stunning bubbly and full of energy ordered by her master to deplete wealthy executive Todd Armstrong Dobey Gillis himself Dwayne Hickman. When Gamble and Goldfoot have a tug of war for Diane her hand comes off this was the final jolt needed for Craig earlier in the movie she was spouting milk and this failed to convince him that she wasn't quite human!. Will Goldfoot who has created many fembots in his laboratory be successful in bilking riches from dopey luststruck bachelors or can Gamble clumsily stop him? This is perhaps best viewing for those who love seeing Price poke fun at his villain parts while slapstick Avalon tries to mimic Buster Keaton and sexist humor so prevalent during the 60s are primarily the objects of comedy throughout this entire film. This movie tries damn hard I'll give it that and the cast seem to be really enjoying themselves. I guess what you find funny will determine if this succeeds or not. The cast play for as many laughs they can but seeing Avalon go crosseyed fainting at the sight of a robotic hand ripped from his beloved Diane or being trapped in a folding bed in a closet or being bopped by a filing cabinet drawer that opens with a thrust is what constitutes as comedy in this filmtrying to prepare you just in case this kind of humor doesn't suit your fancy. One scene has Hickman's convertible backed up a phone poll as he smooches with Diane while a police officer writes him a ticket. Hickman later signs his signatures to stocks merely at the proposal of Diane even after she refused to give him a little somethin'somethin' on their honeymoon night. Price constantly ridicules his assistant Igor a corpse he brought back to life to help him continue his work on fembotsIgor's mistreatment is also played for laughs throughout such as when he tries to remove an ice cube from a club patron's blouse instead removing her bra or when a fembot with a deep manly voice performs martial arts on him due to a disagreement. My favorite part of the film is when Price takes his uninvited guests now prisoners in his mansion Hickman and Avalon on a tour of his medieval dungeon full of torture contraptions some amusing cameos appear from those bubbleheaded Beach Blanket Bingo movies. There is also a protracted chase through San Francisco where landmarks like those long winding roads and hilly streets as well as the historic trolley cars are all put to use a lot is obvious green screen and sets but locations are still used effectively. Price applies devious eyes and a demented cackle to his mad scientist even having a Pit and the Pendulum Torturer moment that is inspired with poor Hickman laying under the swinging blade. I think this might be a bit too irresistible to some in the mood for dumb fun while I'm certain others will find Dr. Goldfoot silly in the extreme to the point of obnoxious. With John Mullaney and Fred Clark costarring as Igor and Avalon's Uncle respectively.".

Will Goldfoot who has created many fembots in his laboratory be successful in bilking riches from dopey luststruck bachelors or can Gamble clumsily stop him? This is perhaps best viewing for those who love seeing Price poke fun at his villain parts while slapstick Avalon tries to mimic Buster Keaton and sexist humor so prevalent during the 60s are primarily the objects of comedy throughout this entire film. This movie tries damn hard I'll give it that and the cast seem to be really enjoying themselves. I guess what you find funny will determine if this succeeds or not. The cast play for as many laughs they can but seeing Avalon go crosseyed fainting at the sight of a robotic hand ripped from his beloved Diane or being trapped in a folding bed in a closet or being bopped by a filing cabinet drawer that opens with a thrust is what constitutes as comedy in this filmtrying to prepare you just in case this kind of humor doesn't suit your fancy. One scene has Hickman's convertible backed up a phone poll as he smooches with Diane while a police officer writes him a ticket. Hickman later signs his signatures to stocks merely at the proposal of Diane even after she refused to give him a little somethin'somethin' on their honeymoon night. Price constantly ridicules his assistant Igor a corpse he brought back to life to help him continue his work on fembotsIgor's mistreatment is also played for laughs throughout such as when he tries to remove an ice cube from a club patron's blouse instead removing her bra or when a fembot with a deep manly voice performs martial arts on him due to a disagreement. My favorite part of the film is when Price takes his uninvited guests now prisoners in his mansion Hickman and Avalon on a tour of his medieval dungeon full of torture contraptions some amusing cameos appear from those bubbleheaded Beach Blanket Bingo movies. There is also a protracted chase through San Francisco where landmarks like those long winding roads and hilly streets as well as the historic trolley cars are all put to use a lot is obvious green screen and sets but locations are still used effectively. Price applies devious eyes and a demented cackle to his mad scientist even having a Pit and the Pendulum Torturer moment that is inspired with poor Hickman laying under the swinging blade. I think this might be a bit too irresistible to some in the mood for dumb fun while I'm certain others will find Dr. Goldfoot silly in the extreme to the point of obnoxious. With John Mullaney and Fred Clark costarring as Igor and Avalon's Uncle respectively.";

	schema:headline " I am Dracula....I Bid You Welcome";
	schema:reviewBody "Dracula is a true cinematic classic that still hold up well today more than 70 years after its initial release. Bram Stoker's novel had been filmed before most notably the 1922 German masterpiece Nosferatu with Max Schrenk playing the vampire as a monstrous rat like creature with no redeeming qualities. Bela Lugosi rose to instant fame with his portrayal of Dracula a part he had been playing on stage for several years. Lugosi's interpretation is that of a suave and sophisticated nobleman with a hypnotic stare and a cultured Hungarian accent. This made the character more appealing to the ladies while at the same time terrifying to the audience when we see the monster revealed beneath. The story has the tragic Renfield Dwight Frye arriving in Transylvania to complete a transaction with the Count which will allow him to lease a English castle. Before they leave for England by ship Dracula turns Renfield into a quasivampire who obeys his master's every command. Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship's crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive. Renfield is committed to a sanitarium run by Dr. Seward Herbert Bunston. Dracula seeks him out and discovers Seward's comely daughter Mina Helen Chandler and her friend Lucy. Dracula quickly kills Lucy and sets his sights upon Mina whose fiance Jonathon Harker David Manners is baffled by her sudden change in health and personality. Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing Edward Van Sloan who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and...... The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula's castle is dark damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet Swan Lake. Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in Frankenstein 1931. He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several poverty row quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played Ygor in The Son of Frankenstein and again in 1948 again as Dracula in Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein. With his well documented personal demons Lugosi wound up his career in cheap B' movies ultimately becoming the star in some of Ed Wood's classics. Oddly enough though he was forever identified with the Dracula character he only played him on screen twice in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play Dracula like characters in MGM's Mark of the Vampire 1935 and in Columbia's Return of the Vampire 1943. Dwight Frye almost steals Dracula from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in Frankenstein this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough Stoker's book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania. Also filmed in a Spanish language version.".

Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing Edward Van Sloan who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and...... The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula's castle is dark damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet Swan Lake. Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in Frankenstein 1931. He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several poverty row quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played Ygor in The Son of Frankenstein and again in 1948 again as Dracula in Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein. With his well documented personal demons Lugosi wound up his career in cheap B' movies ultimately becoming the star in some of Ed Wood's classics. Oddly enough though he was forever identified with the Dracula character he only played him on screen twice in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play Dracula like characters in MGM's Mark of the Vampire 1935 and in Columbia's Return of the Vampire 1943. Dwight Frye almost steals Dracula from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in Frankenstein this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough Stoker's book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania. Also filmed in a Spanish language version.";

Sure there may be a few campy scenes that look like they might be out of some high school play production the rubber bats and armadillos in Dracula's castle come to mind but there is an unmistakable suspense and eerieness about the film. If you are lucky enough to find the DVD reissue from 1999 you have three great versions the original 1931 version with basically no background music the 1999 rescoring of the movie by composer Philip Glass and the extremely interesting Spanish version made at the same time as the original with totally different actors.  If you have this DVD watch the movie twice once with no soundtrack and once with the Glass rescoring.... totally different movie.  Glass' score is great but it doesn't really help the movie at all it actually hurts it in many cases.  But the utter silence in Browning's original just makes my skin crawl!  The acting is actually quite great Lugosi is of course phenomenal as is Dwight Frye as Renfield.  The fear the suspense and believe it or not the sexuality combines for a great movie that was an unbelievable success in its first release 700000 in it first US release 1.2 million worldwide.  Not bad for a movie made 72 years ago!".

	schema:headline " Lugosi's Triumph";
	schema:reviewBody "Tod Browning's film of the Stoker novel didn't so much eclipse Murnau's NOSFERATU 1922 as shove it into antiquity. One big reason was the technological advancement of sound. Roughly three years old by 1930 the public embraced the talking picture wholeheartedly over silents. The other big reason for Dracula's success was that the star of the stage play had been cast as the star of the film. And movie history was made. Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula is now a eightyone year old icon outlasting all other interpretations before or since. The twist is that this Dracula looks nothing like Stoker's creation read the book. Lugosi either through his work with the playwrights or later at Universal with Browning devised the most insidious form the character would ever take a handsome courtly wellgroomed civilized aristocrat so gracious and attractive that he projected an aura of wellbeing over the viewer. This was worlds away from the MurnauMax Schreck approach of headon abomination in NOSFERATU. Sensibly no one in their right mind would stay within viewing distance of Schreck or Kinski in NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE and Dafoe in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE after the first glimpse. But Lugosi's Count would have you chatting and drinking wine until he began to drink of you. That cape and those evening clothes are the perfect deception. Browning's Dracula is sometimes stagy and tentative in its continuity it feels at times that the director was unsure where to go next in the progression of scenes. But Karl Freund's photography summons up a persistent mood of heavy gloom and enveloping dread. Two other assets in the film are Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Van Sloan was Universal's resident Learned Man appearing as an Egyptologist in THE MUMMY 1933 and perhaps most famously as Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN 1931. A careerlong character actor Dwight Frye was an eccentric talent who appears to have worked exclusively at Universal. He had his best role as Renfield producing a still bloodcurdling sneering laugh that seemed to come from the depths of a hellish insanity. If you haven't seen this Dracula please do so. The Count awaits.".

Although falling short of the outright perfection of James Whale's Frankenstein also 1931 and its sequel Bride Of Frankenstein 1935 Dracula still proves a great adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Lugosi's performance is the definitive Dracula his minimal movements and slow pronounced dialogue spoken with his Hungarian accent proves an unnerving Count. I'm not forgetting Max Schrek's Nosferatu while amazing for its sheer dedication it was hardly the Dracula of the book.Director Tod Browning who up to the point of making Dracula had made over 50 feature films controls the film superbly and opts for slow menacing darkness rather than loud jump scenes and special effects. It builds up the mood gradually and with Lugosi's fantastic central performance makes for an atmospheric experience. It's a pity that Browning would almost end his career the next year with the commercially disastrous Freaks which I consider a true great of the horror genre.It's just a shame that the film's final scene is rather soft and anti climatic jarring with the brilliance that came before.

	schema:headline " Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!";
	schema:reviewBody "While Tod Browning's Dracula is not the definitive take on the most famous vampire of all time it is possibly the most memorable one. This is not due to Browning's technical achievements or directorial wizardry by ANY means. It is due to Bela Lugosi's careerdefining portrayal of the title character. Born in what is now Lugoj Romania Lugosi brings to the part the flavor of his homeland making him more believable as Dracula. This otherworldly aesthetic helped to make his performance what many consider the ultimate incarnation of Stoker's Dracula. Having played the Count in Hamilton Deane's Broadway version of Dracula which started in 1927 Bela Lugosi was more than prepared for the role when it was time to commit it to film. Still struggling with the English language however he had to learn his lines phonetically. European accent in tact he was able to deliver such memorable lines as I bid you welcome Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make and of course I am Dracula. His performance alone is reason enough to watch this monster movie classic. If only the rest of the film was as spectacular as Lugosi. Dwight Frye's Renfield while perhaps a little too overthetop is still another highlight to the film and even Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing is enough to challenge the might of Count Dracula. The rest of the film is rather flat to me. Now I know it was made in 1931 and that at the time it horrified audiences but I still stand by my opinion that the overall movie pales in comparison to Bela Lugosi's performance. Everyone else just seemed to be going through the motions and it seems especially evident while Helen Chandler and David Manners are on screen. They just aren't convincing. I'm not saying that their performances ruin the film. It is still a classic and certainly worth a viewing but if you are in the mood for a vampire movie that is worthy of Bram Stoker's name look no further than F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. It is much more convincing and even scarier than Tod Browning's Dracula despite being nine years older and silent. All in all though one cannot overlook the stellar performance of Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!".

	schema:reviewBody "Thinking back to 1931 it's hard to imagine what going to the movie theater was like for people. It was something new and exciting instead of having 6 movies open in one weekend they were lucky if 6 movies opened in one month. Horror movies were nothing new in 1931 but one's with sound were and Universal Studios cranked out hit after hit after hit one of the first being was Dracula. Not too many people realize that these films created exactly what we think of the typecast today with the most popular monsters. Dracula if you've read the book is nothing like what Bela created the cape the accent the charm the presence the looks etc. This was the first time we ever had a romantic Dracula the silent film released before called Nosferatu was a monster Bela created a Dracula that could charm you one second and the next he's draining the life out of you. Dracula is one of the most memorable movies of all time and it's not hard to see why when you watch it.Renfield a British solicitor travels to the Carpathian Mountains. He enters a castle welcomed by charming but odd nobleman Count Dracula who unbeknownst to Renfield is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula's three wives suddenly appear and start to move toward Renfield to attack him but Dracula waves them away and he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the Vesta bound for England Renfield has now become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship's crew. Some nights later at a London theater Dracula meets Dr. Seward who introduces his daughter Mina her fianc John Harker and the family friend Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula and that night after Lucy has a talk with Mina and falls asleep in bed Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theater the next day after a string of transfusions and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Later on Mina has the same bite marks and now the men call on Professor Van Helsing to take on Dracula and save Mina before she meets the same fate as Lucy.Despite the fact that it might not be as terrifying as it was back in the day you have to consider that this movie made people faint in the theater and gave them nightmares for years to come. The film does have flaws Lucy dies and that's it she never comes back which was interesting that Mina was becoming a vampire when bitten but Lucy doesn't. However the atmosphere of the film still holds up incredibly well Dracula's castle has the perfect shadows and isolation that could send shivers down anyone's spine. Makes you wonder how the heck Renfield could stay in that place? I would've camped outside especially when Dracula comes down and says in that creepy voice I bid you welcome would you trust someone like that while looking at your neck like it was a Thanksgiving turkey leg? Bela gave a terrific performance that will be remembered for all time. But also much credit to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield and still has one of the most horrific images of all time when they open the door on the ship to see him laughing manically with his eyes wide open. Not to mention his scene with the maid where he's laughing at her she faints and he crawls towards her. You know what? I lied this is still a scary movie and I will continue to watch it every Halloween. Bela is king and made Dracula one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history.910".

Bela Lugosi became a cinematic legend after this movie and his portrayal of Dracula basically invented the modern vampire as we know it. Murnau's silent classic 'Nosferatu' was an obvious influence on Todd Browning but while Browning was no James Whale the innovative British director who made 'Frankenstein' for Universal a few months after this he added a lot of his own style and ideas to the project and Counts Orloff and Dracula are completely different kinds of creatures. Lugosi made his Count sophisticated attractive and sexy and this is what made this movie such a sensation at the time and what helps make it still a wonderful viewing experience. Lugosi's performance is one of the greatest in horror history. Some of the other actors in the cast are a bit shaky but Edward Van Sloan as Van Hesling is excellent and Dwight Frye's Renfield a different character from the book is also memorable. Both actors would reappear in 'Frankenstein'. 'Dracula' is an important landmark horror movie but even better is still a fantastic viewing experience seventy years later.

	schema:reviewBody "Bela Lugosi forever captures the role of a certain undead Transylvanian count who takes a trip to London in the first legitimate version of the classic Bram Stoker novel.  Despite many attempts by many talented film makers I believe this version directed by Tod Browning remains the definitive take on the oftenfilmed novel.  But why?  Is it simply nostalgia?  Granted I do fondly remember staying up late as a child watching this film on Ghost Host theater and finding myself suitably frightened.  However if I were the same age today would I find the film as effective?  Would a steady diet of more modern and explicit horror films made me too jaded to enjoy the more subtle charms of this film?  I hope not but I could see how it might.  The film is slow and its slowness is further emphasized by the absence of an under score.  It is stagey  being as it was more influenced by the stage play than the novel itself.  Also the story plays itself out too quickly.  Van Helsing manages to figure everything out and dispatch the count in about two seconds.  There simply isn't much suspense  and even less gore or violence.  Yet it remains the champ.  Why? The main reason is Lugosi himself.  He gives the performance of a lifetime. He truly inhabits the role and is genuinely creepy.  The rest of the cast particularly Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield support him admirably.  However when I watch the old Universal horror films nowadays I find myself really enjoying the atmospheric sets and lighting. Yes there is still much to love about Dracula today.  As long as you avoid the optional Philip Glass score on the DVD!".

Simply said scenes where we find ourselves looking into his eyes we find ourselves fearfully looking into the eyes of death. Bela Lugosi also imposes a strong presence over his characters which I think is important to his image in Dracula. He is much taller than the other actors which makes him look more powerful and makes his present felt. He is wonderfully scary. While it is obvious that it was made in 1931 during some scenes it still strikes fear in the audience.The Miseenscene is incredible in this movie particularly in the opening scene when the carriage comes speeding up the hill and quickly drops the man off to Dracula. There is a thick fog and darkness Dracula wearing a black outfit covering everything and cliffs in the background. Dracula's castle is also an excellent example of miseenscene with the darkness high cathedral ceilings spiderwebs everywhere bats swooping about and wolves howling in the background.".

Universal wanted a big budget film but because of the depression this one was made on the cheap. The studio head wanted Lon Chaney Sr for the title role. He was not available and almost by accident they found Bela Legosi.Todd Browning did a great job directing the first horror film. Todd could not have liked the fact that at night the crew shooting the Spanish Version would look at Brownings daily shot and then reshoot improved versions of their own with their cast.Still the Spanish version did not have Bela. The rest of the cast around him played the roles real well. The real irony here is that Bela would only do the role one more time making fun of himself in Abbott  Costello Meet Frankenstein. Legosi is one of the few actors who has the best dramatic performance and the best comedy performance on film for the same role.This original holds up well including the creepy arrival of the ship of corpses in England. The estate rented by Dracula in England is now actually the same name as a famous web site. Another accident related to this film. Sometimes fate creates a work of art where none is expected. Dracula is one of those copied a lot but none as good as the original.".

The opening scene is absolutely brilliant but while there are still some compelling and welldone scenes the second half is rather talky. That said there is a lot I loved about Dracula. The costumes sets photography and lighting are suitably atmospheric and grandiose the story is still the timeless story even with the many changes I love and the screenplay apart from the odd stilted line from John is very good.I saw Dracula in two versions one without background music which added to the genuine atmosphere and one with a suitably hypnotic and haunting score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass. While I loved Glass' score I do prefer slightly the one without the scoring the silence further added to the atmosphere I feel. The whole film is beautifully directed too and while the film is very short at about an hour and a quarter the pace is just right.The acting is very good perhaps theatrical in a way but I think it worked. Bela Lugosi has such a magnetic presence in the title role Edward Van Sloan is perfect as Van Helsing but in a sinister and funny performance Dwight Frye steals the film.In conclusion excellent film and a classic. 910 Bethany Cox".

Dracula is a spectacular wellknown classic vampire story with a magnificent transposition of the Bram Stoker's novel to the cinema. Although being a 1931 black and white movie the photography and the camera work are excellent. There are at least two magnificent scenes the long traveling of the camera in the sanatorium from the yard to Remfield's room and the long stairway in the end of the movie to Dracula's tomb. The performances are quite theatrical as usual in that period and the film does not show any explicit violent scene. I dare to say that probably it is Bela Lugosi's best performance.

Classic movies sometimes drag and don't hold my interest entirely but I never really seemed to hit pause. I was glued from the get go from the starting opening scene in Transylvania. Renfield played by Dwight Frye was very sufficient and creepy. The characters of Van Helsing Dr. Seward and Mina were terrific and casted perfectly. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was of course the star of the film and spawned a long list of Universal movies for himself. The role of John Harker was annoying at times and didn't have the best dialog written for him. It's obviously a classic that all horror fans have to watch. I would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't like 1931's Dracula despite its few flaws.".

Renfield played by Dwight Frye was very sufficient and creepy. The characters of Van Helsing Dr. Seward and Mina were terrific and casted perfectly. Bela Lugosi as Dracula was of course the star of the film and spawned a long list of Universal movies for himself. The role of John Harker was annoying at times and didn't have the best dialog written for him. It's obviously a classic that all horror fans have to watch. I would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't like 1931's Dracula despite its few flaws.";

The actors were every dramatic which played out nicely and gave more life to the scene. I enjoyed Renfield because he was so insane and his laugh was creepy. I laughed at the part between the male nurse and Renfield when the spider is taken away from him. I didn't quiet understand the beginning with the three girls they did not seem to really add anything to the film. I think Dracula is a classic that has been redone many times.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes after the first two reels this film is less effectively baroque but it's still heartily enjoyable stuff even if the finale is poorly handled. Bela Lugosi's performance as the good Count is so wonderfully definitive that it seems remarkable how many other actors have subsequently donned the cape. I've not seen any of the other versions but I suspect few could match Lugosi's hypnotic display of acting. From the wonderfully eerie sublimely photographed Transylvania scenes to the scenes in a London theatre Lugosi is spellbinding. While he dominates the film others make their mark. Helen Chandler is quite good as the unfortunate Mina Seward Dwight Frye is wonderfully mad as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan is towering as Van Helsing. Certainly there is a contrast in tone between the two parts of the film the first nightmarish eerie mesmerising and very cinematic the second more akin to a stage play and rather more melodramatic but it does come together in my view as a most effective likeable whole. It is all immensely helped by a quite wonderfully Philip Glass score that perfectly complements and embellishes the images. In many ways it is typical Glass and that is no bad thing but the atmosphere the Kronos Quartet create is just right. Rating .".

This film was the birth of the horror film as we know it.  Its importance can not be underestimated.  Dracula is a wonderful film for so many reasons but first let's look at its many faults.The film is by today standards very antiquated.  It has almost no soundtrack stage acting for the most part limited special effects and a slow pacing.  It has long parts of little action and lots of chat.  It shows little while leaving much to one's imaginationa plus for those like myself that are good at envisioning what is not shown.  With all this not going for it why is Dracula such a classic?  Why is it considered to be such a great film and a great horror film?The answer is that even with all these flaws and bear in mind some of these flaws are not flaws for all the film offers a rich story in an eerie atmospheric way.  Bela Lugosi was Dracula.  He was the model for oh so many vampires to come.  His gesturing his deliberation in speech his facial movements all created a vampire never to be forgotten.  Despite Lugosi however is the real genius of the film....Tod Browning.  Browning created a movie and a setting hitherto imagined and conjured on a screen.  Browning was the man behind the camera that created the cobwebbed stairs of the Dracula castle and the squalid emptiness of the crypt.  He created the ghoulish female vampires thirsting for blood.  Dracula is not just a film to see it is film history and should be viewed with that in mind and not put under a microscope of today's languishing tastes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've probably written about these films more then any other yet I notice something new every time I watch. This time I realized Dracula is set in the modern day. During the flower girl scene you hear a car horn and see modern street lamps. Another question I ask for the first time Why did Dracula disguise himself as the carriage driver? Why hide his face? Despite this question it is one of the most atmospheric scenes in a film built primarily on atmosphere.Modern critiques tend to say Lugosi is the sole graceful factor in a stagy film. True but don't undersell. Karl Freund's camera is not stationary. A pan around Renfield's shoulder a slow move up steps a panorama of Seward's sanatorium. Renfield leering from the ship or the shadow of the captain lashed to the wheel are just two chilling scenes. The use of shadows is toned down from Universal's silents and it's generally agreed that Freund's artistry was held back by Todd Browning. Wither Browning had trouble adapting to sound or was still grieving for Lon Chaney and the version of Dracula they had planned on making is debated.Either way you can't deny the power of these images. The early shots of Dracula's castle the brides awaking in the catacombs the illogical armadillos beetles in tiny coffins Lugosi's glaring eyes. These images are the base upon which all American horror films are built. They still send chills up a viewer's spine seventy years later. The set design is incredible particularly the dusty staircase of Castle Dracula or the ruins of Carfax Abbey. Supporting the sets are fantastic glass painted backgrounds.I won't waste words on why Lugosi is the iconic Dracula. He exudes an authority over everyone simply with his body language. Shots of him doing nothing but standing in shadowswept doorways manage to be creepy.Given Dracula's sway over the opposite sex it's easy to understand while the vampire is a fantasized character for men. But why is the vampire a sex symbol for women? The film is split on the issue. The scene of Dracula cornering the flower girl brings to mind nothing but sexual assault. I believe Dracula leaning over the sleeping bodies of his prey aren't meant to be provocative but rather to invoke classical nightmare imagery. We are all vulnerable when we sleep and many horror films prey on that innate vulnerably. Yep I just traced a line from Dracula to Freddy. Dracula is feared by his female victims yet still oddly attractive. Lucy doesn't seem totally asleep when Dracula comes for her. A later scene where Mina walks into the count's arms his cape wrapped around her blending in with the shadows is undoubtedly romantic. The vampire is a man with complete control over his females psychic and sexual. Why women would desire such a mate is a topic unsuited for this blog. The seductive female vampire is a horror concept not yet solidified. Mina once turned seems less like a willing seductress and more like a drug addict uncontrollably forced to attack her beloved husband.The movie is flawed no doubt. Who the heck is the main character? The count is unknowable. Harker or Seward don't do anything besides wring their hands. Van Helsing comes in too late Lucy exits too early while Mina is a damsel in distress. Nope it's gotta' be Renfield. We follow him from the beginning and he features in most of the scenes. A book must exists that explores his character more. There's a lot of untapped potential there. Dwight Fry had enough range to play a straightlaced businessman perfectly even if his unhinged insanity is what we remember. When his spider is thrown away you almost feel for the guy. His monologue about Dracula presenting him with a feast of rats is great and I wonder why no other adaptation has gone into more detail about that. Why does Dracula even keep the guy around? He doesn't serve him much and is even responsible for revealing the count's hiding place.The pacing drags in the latter half as the staged qualities take over. There's a number of narrative question marks. Lucy's story arc is oddly abbreviated. We hear about her escapades as the Woman in White but Van Helsing disposes of her offscreen. Why does Dracula have Mina just hanging around the abbey at the very end? What purpose did that serve? Renfield preys on the unconscious maid in one scene but we never find out why. The guy sure gets out of his cell easy. Dr. Seward should probably hire a new staff. Dracula's final confrontation with Van Helsing is anticlimactic. Even the weaker second half of the film has its moments such as Dracula making eyecontact with Mina's maid or smashing the mirror out of Van Helsing's hand.I'm not begrudgingly calling it a great movie. It remains the best adaptation of Stoker's novel in many ways and is the most important of the Universal Monster cycle in countless ways.".

	schema:reviewBody "Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make! so said Bela Lugosi in what was to be the role that cemented him as a pop culture icon of American film. To see director Todd Browning's original 1931 adaptation of Dracula is to see the American horror film at its finest. Dracula is the vampire formula at its purest before it could be diluted by the telling and the retelling. Dracula is a surreal experience as Browning takes us with him on a journey into our fear of death but also our fear of the filthiness of sex. It is a film that has aged like a good wine which Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula swore to never drink.If one were to try and dissect Todd Browning's Dracula to find a sole element of success the search would lead us time and time again to Bela Lugosi. Dracula simply is not Dracula without Lugosi's portrayal of the Count. So much credit has to be given to Lugosi and his portrayal of the titular character. It is doubtful this film would have the staying power or the atmosphere that it has if another actor was portraying Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance and how it succeeds is the marriage of so many factors but arguably Lugosi's greatest asset to his performance would have to be his rich Hungarian accent. Lugosi surprisingly doesn't get much dialogue in the film as much of the exposition comes from the protagonist Professor Van Helsing played by Edward Van Sloan and Dracula's slave Renfield played by Dwight Frye. The lines Lugosi does deliver are often extremely concise. It is not the lines themselves but rather the way Lugosi delivers them that creates this character. How Lugosi delivers the lines offers more insight into this character than any detailed dissection of the character could. Lugosi's lines are read almost phonetically each word one by one each little nuance of the language stressed in Lugosi's thick Hungarian dialect. The resulting effect is hypnotic poetic frightening and in many ways very sad. Lugosi's introduction is in my humble opinion one of the strongest scenes in motion picture history almost solely based on the delivery of the line I am... Dracula. The scene follows Renfield a solicitor whom Dracula will drive mad as he ventures through Dracula's dilapidated castle searching for the Count. Dracula appears out of the shadows sucking in whatever air Renfield could muster in these catacombs of death by merely saying I amDracula. Lugosi's delivery is as much a part of the aging castle trapped in time as the cobwebs are. Lugosi was so suave and mysterious as Dracula that the audience became attracted to the vampire. Dracula is not merely Lugosi's picture though. The film has a strong supporting cast highlighted by actor Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye. One thing that can be said of Dracula's entire cast is that despite the extreme material no one even comes close to going over the top with their role. The amount of sincerity and the absence of any tongue in cheek aspect of performance are to be admired. Sloan and Frye's characters both had the potential to skate towards over the top territory but both performances are firmly grounded in reality and are very effective in complimenting Lugosi's Dracula.Dwight Frye is very strong as Renfield. The role is as complex as that of the Count. Renfield is a bipolar madman enslaved to do Dracula's bidding. Frye is asked to exhibit behaviors on all forms of the spectrum. This character and the characterization are unpredictable to the extreme. One constant about Renfield is that he is the predator and he represents the fear of sexuality within the vampire mythos. Frye's facial expressions are other worldly especially when we see the extent of Renfield's madness. There is a scene where Renfield crawls with vulture eyes towards a housemaid who has fainted by the sight of his very appearance. Frye too is asked to deliver insight into a character despite the fact that the lines don't explicitly offer character exposition or development. Renfield's dialogue mainly consists of nonsensical lunatic ravings. The way Frye delivers the lines and how he builds the intensity is really powerful though. It is these build up of the madness that keeps this character effective.Technically Dracula isn't all that impressive a picture from a cinematographer's standpoint but does it really need to be? Browning is very cautious about what he wants to do with his camera. Much of the film is very static and offers little to no movement of the camera. What Browning captures in his shots though are really powerful images. The amount of attention given to the detail of each shot truly is amazing. The fact is there is not one shot of Bela Lugosi blinking in the entire film that shows an incredible commitment. Browning is more of a still photographer than he is a cinematographer but the power of the images is unmistakably there. This static dreamlike world is perfect for the subject material.It may hurt the pacing a tad but an argument can be made that the audience are much better able to appreciate Bela Lugosi and even Dwight Frye's performance due to the way Browning stages his picture. Browning's appreciation for the hypnotic quality of images is one of the strengths of the film not one of the weaknesses.Dracula is a masterpiece of film making. The film still offers a hypnotic experience almost 80 years after Bela Lugosi first uttered I amDracula. It is a film that has only gotten better with age. Todd Browning and Bela Lugosi succeeded in creating a surreal picture where vampires do exist.".

It's more than a little dated of course so there's no bloodbiting or onscreen death or murder plus the acting is very theatrical at times and there's quite a few long drawnout sections of total silence that highlight exactly how old and pioneering it is.With that said all horror fans should watch this at least once as it does make a great latenight Halloween movie that will live on  just like the old count himself  forever.".

Or maybe it is simply their really cool fangs! Whatever it is vampires are sure to stay in fiction films for a long time yet to come. And some older vampire films like Dracula1931 will surely never die! I could watch this film classic again maybe because Count Bela has hypnotized me with his famous line Look Into My Eyes...

	schema:reviewBody "For Xmas last year I got the Universal Monsters box set containing 8 of Universals horror movies from the 30's and 40's. I started watching this set with Dracula a movie that I watched back in the 80's so I haven't seen it in 30 years It's still a chilling and frightening movie when you put it into the context of when it was released. Bela Lugosi's movements when he attacks and the light across his eyes must have really scared the daylights out of the 1930's audience today it's almost humorous. But the movie is regarded as a classic movie from that period. It was the start of the horror movie genre Classic Lugiso lines including cheeldren of the naight I nevair dreenk vine and I am Count Draculaaa and no doesn't say I vant to dreenk your vlodd. The scene where Dracula meets Van Helsing is a classic especially when Van Helsing asks what sort of creature makes marks on a neck and the maid introduces Count Dracula. This scene is quickly followed up by the lack of Dracula reflection in the mirror. Dwight Frye's Renfield is excellent his creepy laugh and the expression on his face when he is not given his insects is memorable. Bela Lugosi epitomizes the perfect Dracula no other actor has ever matched Lugosi's Dracula. Combined with Dwight Fryes Renfield they were the perfect pair for this movie. Interesting that nurses were stationed in the lobbies of theatres when the movie was released to attend anyone who was scared by the movie. I love this box series and I am really enjoying watching Dracula one of my favourite classic horror movies.".

It was being screened in a city that i lived and studied at that time. i saw the film four times and i even knew many of the lines of the characters! The film is a journey. It is a journey of discovery for Neelkanta the poet and two others who join him in his journey. The young man and woman. Together they traverse the countryside in Bengal.The character Neelkanta is played by Ghatak himself. And how unforgettable is the man as himself in the film! And he does not forget to shoot down his great rival Satyajit Ray by presenting Shatrujit Basu Utpal Duttwhom he carefully presents almost in appearance as Ray himself! Neelkanta accuses Shatrujit of short changing the cause for fame and recognition.The most interesting relationship is between the young lady whom Neelkanta calls Bangabala girl child of Bengaland the young man who joins the journey. They perhaps a younger generation. Ghatak's films carry the separation theme. The river Subarnarekha that is symbolic of that separation the agony of partition. The indescribable pain of a little boy whose parents happened to be on the wrong side of the river.The river flows. Like Neelkanta's journey of discovery. He finally discovers the emerging spirit of Bengal in the forest surrounding his home in the village. He is at peace in the company of those youth who are waging a losing war against the status quo. He enters into arguments with all these characters. He goes to the forest to meet the youth fighting the police. Before going he tells his wife to send his little son to see him the next morning early at sunrise. I want to see your face in against the rising sun he says.And he emerges from the forest in the morning only to be shot down by the police.i call this the most poignant film from an Indian film maker. The poetry of Death Vision. That is what it is.And it has the intense painful signature of Ghatak films personal touch.As i watched the film i wept for Ghatak. Even today after thirty years i still weep. It is a pity that India never understood a genius.Everything about this film is special even the characters' names. Neelkanta is a synonym for God Siva. He is called Neelkanta because he has a blue patch on his neck throat actually. That was caused by the poison he volunteered to drink in order to save the universe from destruction during the mythical churning of the Ocean of Milk.See the connection now? Neelkanta says lifting the bottle to his lips This is nectar!Is it?".

In a time when West Bengal  the Indian portion of Bengal after the Partition of India was in the turmoil of Naxalite politics Ritwick Ghatak comes up with this masterpiece. It should be noted that he wrote the script produced and directed Jukti Takko Aar Gappo'. The film has long sequences shorter though than Ghatak's other films and is edited quite well. The music draws heavily on Tagore's compositions and Bengal folk music and also includes much instrumental music composed by Ghatak himself.Ghatak was affected by the Indian Partition in his personnel life and which greatly moulded his outlook to the world. He leant heavily on leftist political themes in his work but he always manages to deliver a message. Nilkantha is a hopeless drunkard who cannot rid himself of his addiction. He eventually loses wife and son and is forced to set off on a road in search of food and shelter. He takes along with him a wretched homeless women who has crossed the border from Bangladesh and his younger relation of his. While on the road he meets many similar people out on the road with him. He likes those who find solace in the bottle like him a theme which comes up in a repetitive way in the films. Ghatak manages to show many sights and sounds of rural Bengal. In this depiction he is a master and depicts his homeland with an expert eye. The song by the Bangamala sounds quite melodious while she's singing but reality for Nilkantha and his groups starts immediately when it stops. To use film as a medium to show this is quite Ghatak's achievement considering the long sequences that he uses. Ghatak is a master in showing the world of the alcoholic with its bouts of drinking wandering and loitering. Eventually the aimless alcoholic meets his end by an arbitrary police bullet just when he is to be reunited with his son. The police carry his remains away and silence descends on the forest. Life goes as ever. Can an alcoholic even after many failed attempts be eventually cured by contact and love of his family? One cannot tell because the state intervenes with bullets intended to kill terrorists the Naxalites were branded as such in the 1970s and the wretched alcoholic is caught in the crossfire and dies.".

One cannot tell because the state intervenes with bullets intended to kill terrorists the Naxalites were branded as such in the 1970s and the wretched alcoholic is caught in the crossfire and dies.";

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece of Hollywood Weird";
	schema:reviewBody "This picture is absolutely one of the oddest damn things ever to come out of the old Hollywood studio system. Von Sternberg himself called it a relentless exercise in pure style and he wasn't kidding. Where to begin? For starters it marks the apex of Sternberg's worship of Marlene Dietrich worship is hardly too strong a word it might not be strong enough. His justly famous expressionistic lighting brilliantly shot by Bert Glennon dazzles the eye throughout. During the wedding ceremony for instance the whole scene is lit by what must be 10000 candles and is shot through a variety of diffusion materials in one shot Dietrich's face can hardly be more than a foot from the camera lens but there is a candle between them and fabric as well making her face waver and melt into the sensuous texture. This scene is largely silent and the movie as a whole though made in 1934 is often silent with music only. Rubinstein's KammenoiOstrow arranged for chorus and orchestra plays through the whole wedding scene while Sam Jaffe a wonderful and versatile actor plays the insane Grand Duke Peter like Harpo Marx on bad acid. The dialogue throughout is just plain weird and the miseenscene far weirder. Sternberg has created an entire fictitious style for this movie that might be called Russian Gothic. The buildings in no way resemble the airy rococo palaces where the real Empress Elisavieta Petrovna spent her time rather we are given a nightmarish phantasmagoria of wooden architecture with railings and balustrades carved into the shape of peasants in attitudes of great suffering and vast doors which armies of ladiesinwaiting struggle to open and close. The aftermath of a brutal feast is portrayed with a skeletal tureen stand presiding over the indescribable flotsam and jetsam. Louise Dresser is a hoot as Empress Elizabeth never mind the accent and I also like John Lodge although I didn't at first the aplomb with which he delivers his outrageous dialogue finally won me over. Please ignore all the stupid stories about Catherine the Great and horses that you may have heard there isn't an ounce of evidence for any of them. Instead relish the opening of this gloriously crazy movie Edward van Sloan in his best DraculaFrankenstein mode reading to the little girl Catherine about Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as we dissolve to fantastic scenes of barbaric torture culminating in a shot of some peasant being used as the clapper of a bell which dissolves to the sweet young adult Catherine of some years later on a swing. In the 18th century swings were considered highly erotic and Sternberg misses none of this. She is called away by a servant and runs breathlessly into the parlor where her parents are receiving the Russian envoys. Her actions are literally choreographed to the music as she bobs and weaves around the room kissing hands and saluting her elders. This is pure cinema and absolutely nuts but glorious. Take a good strong snort of whatever your favorite mindexpander may be a dry red wine with a shot of Stolichnaya under it is my recommendation in this case and blast your brain with a truly strange movie made by real artists.".

This is the decor of The Scarlet Empress furnishings which speak more of the film's themes and ideas than the plot could ever be allowed to. The actors remain intentionally wooden it's as if the world around them was an expression of their suppressed emotions. Shame takes the guise of chairs but chairs in the shape of gargantuan deformed old men hiding their stricken faces in hideous fingers. Masochism is occasionally a clock lust a decorative food display but all perverse leering. And death... Everywhere is a ghastly preoccupation with death icons proudly display decapitation skeletons stretch themselves over boiling cauldrons while ghastly statues of tortured corpses lurk in every shadowy corner. Together this creates a world of painful decadence a disgusting yet fascinating dreamscape of visual pleasure.All this takes form and depth is sculpted by director Sternberg's haunting lighting. It is his light he lords over it and with it anything is possible. He can make a face beautiful or ugly innocent or evil. He can accentuate a certain side of a person's nature or how a specific set piece relates to it all with the proper illumination.If his lighting is astounding equally so is Sternberg's use of the visual motifs in his mise en scene bells veils figures specific set pieces etc... to transport the viewer back and forth through the film. For instance the binding of Catherine and Peter's hands at their marriage is later echoed by an unquestionably similar knot Catherine ties in a napkin she is fondling and then tosses onto the table of she and Peter's last meal together. The initiation of their marriage and the initiation of its end are in this way linked and the audience is forced to take into account the changes in both their characters. Not only does the rhythm of these motifs remain figurative. The movement of the film takes on a distinct rhythm as well. A swinging motif is evident throughout the bells the incense burners Catherine's swing the hoopskirts a baby's basket and so on. In this the film takes the feel of a frenzied but excellently choreographed dance. But in all this there is one thing more noteworthy. Marlene Dietrich radiates! Quite possibly the most beautiful woman who ever lived she begins innocent and virginal seemingly intentionally melodramatically standing out in a world of amorality. She is both the happiest and saddest point of the film. Her wedding to the vulgar Peter in an immense yet claustrophobic cathedral is the most emotional part of the film. As it is filmed entirely in a series of closeups of individuals and long shots that blur their faces there is no discernible eye connection between any of the characters. She is completely alone. As a voyeuristic camera cuts closer and closer to her trembling veiled face we suddenly feel the need to turn away. We know now that this last thread of decency is about to be crippled. Soon enough her innocence begins to fade before her sexuality and the surroundings that once nearly suppressed her she lords over a queen of immorality.The Scarlet Empress expresses the essence of film and why it succeeds as an art form. It creates the possibility of a world almost wholly artificial divorced from anything that ever was. It retains only fragmentary reproductions of something that existed in a prefilmed state combining and distorting them to effect something 90 fake. What's more that seems all it is interested in. No other artistic medium aside from painting is viewed worthy of its visuals and all theatrical literary or other requirements are given little attention. They are flippantly thrown in only to please a narrow minded audience and occasionally but very very rarely to accentuate the films themes. Yet painting ah yes painting. That was a medium worthy of a brilliant visionary like Sternberg and one he transferred to the screen with gusto. The Scarlet Empress is to Dali in its obsession with the bizarre da Vinci in its detail Picasso in its complexity of associations but entirely Sternberg in its conception.".

	schema:reviewBody "Josef Von Sternberg thought very extensively about the effects he wanted in THE SCARLET EMPRESS. He wanted to push the cinematic effects to show the huge Russian Empire and to show the spirituality of the Russo Orthodox Church. Therefore the visual effects of THE SCARLET EMPRESS are quite striking as is the anachronistic sound track the music by Anton Rubinestein is very religious but it is not from the middle of the 18th Century but from 100 years later. His use of candles  literally hundreds to get an idea of the Russo Ortodoxy of 1760  works quite well to display the pageantry of the religion. And note the gargantuan doors used in the Royal palace.In THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT the story line suggested that Elizabeth Bergner's Catherine did fall for a handsome looking but unstable Peter Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. But in reality Peter was an unstable and cowardly figure. Sam Jaffe's performance is far closer to Peter III of Russia although one of his lines when he says I hate my wife is done too crazily to be realistic. He does look forward to ruling Russia in order to send his wife after a divorce to a convent and to marry whomever he wants. But even Jaffe's Peter was not quite the historical one. Peter III may have been insane but he had a tremendous affection for Prussia and it's ruler Frederick the Great. Russian foreign policy in 1760 was that of Tsarina Elizabeth Louis Dresser in this film. The Empress was allied with the French and Austrians against Prussia. One of the major policy changes that Peter III brought was to end this alliance with France and Austria. It affected Prussia's precarious position in the Seven Years War and enabled Frederick to reorganize and defeat the Austrians and French. None of this is mentioned in either of the two films.What Von Sternberg did get right here not as well developed in THE RISE was that SophieCatherine took the time she was married to the Grand Duke to study up on the Russian people their religion their customs. She was a very sharp woman as her handling of the government would eventually show. Also SophieCatherine used her feminine abilities to make inroads with the nobility and military leaders such as the fictional Count Alexei John Lodge and the real Captain Gregori Orlov. Many did become her lovers. One of them may have fathered the boy who would one day become Tsar Paul I of Russia This is hinted at in THE SCARLET EMPRESS the scene where Jaffe is congratulated about his new heir gives that performer a chance to be quite indignant  a welcome change from his insanity characterization. Marlene Dietrich's cool beauty and wits come across as Catherine learns the fundamentals of her new country and becomes fully prepared to take it over from her incompetent husband's hands.I liked THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT but THE SCARLET EMPRESS is a better done movie on all sides.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an absolutely amazing film to watch. I have seen several other collaborations between director Josef Von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich and I think this is the bestmostly due to it being like a giant painting or tapestry that was almost mesmerizing. The film is a rather odd look at a brief period of the life of Catherine the Great of Russia. It follows her from her betrothal when she is a Germanic princess to her ultimately killing her husband and assuming the thronethe space of just a few years.During the entire picture what stood out were the amazing sets. The film begins with some very graphic torture chamber scenes that are definitely PreCode in that they are so frightening and because of the copious amounts of gratuitous female nudity. While this never could have been allowed once the stronger Production Code was implemented around 1935 it is a captivating and bizarre introduction to the movie and it certainly got your attention!! Then throughout the film the sets were magnificent and very twistedalmost like they had been inspired by a combination of LSD Jean Cocteau's version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch! Twisted and grotesque anthropomorphic statues banisters candelabras chairs etc. grace practically every scene inside the palacemaking it look like a combination of Hell and whimsy!! You really just have to see it all to believe it. What was also amazing was how Paramount was able to construct all this without the production bankrupting the company!!! While the dialog and acting is fine they take a definite backseat to the sets. It's very obvious that Von Sternberg really wasn't trying to humanize the characters or shed too much light on the life of Catherineit was really more of a work of performance art. And if you accept it as this and NOT an absolutely true recounting of the life of Catherine then you will be in for a treat.As for the historical side of the film there has long been some disagreement about the coup and subsequent execution of Catherine's husband. While it is almost undoubtedly true she orchestrated it after all they made her their leader after Peter's death what isn't so certain is the character of Peter. Some accounts have described him as halfwitted or insane exactly how he's shown in the film but others doubt if this was exactly the caseit could have just been propaganda used by Catherine to justify her actions. Plus when Peter died some apparently reported this was of natural causes and not murder! Considering everything though the film had to portray Peter III some way and the evil halfwit was an enjoyable choiceas Sam Jaffe looked so crazed and made the part come alive with his insanelooking eyes and wonderful delivery! Dietrich herself was also very good perhaps due to her not being so artificiallooking like she was in some of her other films due to excessive makeup but her performance was definitely overshadowed by the sets and JaffeBy the way I originally gave this film a very respectable score of 8. However after seeing The Rise of Catherine the Great which was made the exact same year and covered the exact same material I saw that this Dietrich film was a lot better by comparison. I especially think that Dietrich and Jaffe were a much better Peter and Catherine than Elisabeth Bergner and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the other film.".

You won't find great dialogue here but don't fret to ME the dialogue is insignificant. This one must be SEEN to be appreciated.Director Josef Van Sternberg dubbed correctly A lyricist of light and shadow by one critic proves this point in Scarlet Empress more than in any other of his films. Sternberg also knew he was losing Dietrich and I like one scene where an actor is made up from a side view to resemble Sternberg. This actor is essentially the only one Marlene refuses her bed to despite having no qualms about bedroom antics with half the Russian court. Sternberg projected himself into the role of Count Alexi a character who has more screen time than anyone other than Dietrich. Alexi is teased by Dietrich and in the end he um doesn't get the girl. Sternberg knew he was no longer getting Dietrich and put this knowledge on celluloid with an aweinspiring even malicious fire. There are two things in this film which I really LOVE. The grotesque replicas which saturate the film are of course indicative of how the film will play out. The replicas I suspect were not easy or inexpensive to makewhich makes them all the more fascinating horrifying and MESMERIZING!The background score. I have never seen a drama from the 1930s which used music more brilliantly than Scarlet Empress. In a scene in a stable when there is a chance that the two principals may make love they are interrupted by the braying of a horse which had been out of sight of the two. According to many historians this scene has much MUCH deeper significance than it seems. I cannot write what the historians have told to me on this board. It would be inappropriate. But before the horse neighs in that scene Dietrich is twirling from a rope and the music in the background lends immense eroticism to the scene as does a straw which keeps going into and out of Marlene's mouth. The music combined with the beautiful lighting is stunning! There is also an opening torture scene which features a man swinging to and fro inside a huge bell his head causing the bell to peal. Then a quick dissolve to an innocent young lady who is flying high on her swing. THAT is a feat of genius!If you can ignore some historical inaccuracies which I suggest you do and allow yourself to gorge on the beautiful lighting  music as well as most scenes I dare you to tell me that the film didn't MESMERIZE you! A TEN!This preProduction code film is a treasure throughout".

The Queen Consort of Czar Peter III of Russia she got the throne from him in a palace coup d'etat and ruled for 33 years. She was also a woman of some lusty sexual appetites just like the woman who portrays her in The Scarlet Empress. It's what distinguishes The Scarlet Empress from the Alexander Korda production of Catherine The Great that starred Elizabeth Bergner and came out the same time.Both tell the same story from young Princess Sophia of AnhaltZerbst chosen as a bride for the Russian Tsarevitch. But Bergner plays her almost as an innocent though you see traces of the lusty woman Catherine became. Marlene Dietrich loses her innocence and you see a woman who used sex to get her way whether it was political gain or sexual satisfaction that she wasn't getting from the imbecile who was her husband. As for Czar Peter though Douglas Fairbanks Jr. gives a fine performance we see a psychotic Czar in him. Sam Jaffe is far closer to the truth the childlike imbecile who was overwhelmed he didn't measure up in the bedroom or the throne room. This film was Jaffe's screen debut a far cry from Dr. Reifenschneider in The Asphalt Jungle or the High Lama of ShangriLa all three very different parts. In fact historians and scholars debate to this day whether Paul who succeeded his mother was Peter's child or was sired by one of Catherine's many lovers. Gavin Gordon and John Davis Lodge play two of her lovers. Lodge was a man like Ronald Reagan who made it big in two different careers. A member of THE Lodge family of Massachusetts the younger brother of Henry Cabot Lodge Ike's UN Ambassador this Lodge left the law for acting and then after Navy service in World War II became a Congressman Governor of Connecticut and Ambassador to Spain.To me it's tossup between Flora Robson in Catherine the Great and Louise Dresser as to who the better Empress Elizabeth. Elizabeth was the daughter of Peter the Great aunt of Sam Jaffe. Her appetites were as big as Catherine's but her ruthlessness somewhat less. Like Elizabeth I of England she never married and produced an heir to the throne but also no one bothered to keep up any fiction about the Russian Elizabeth being a virgin.With some footage from Ernst Lubitsch's silent classic The Patriot Joseph Von Sternberg crafted one of the better efforts from his collaboration with Marlene Dietrich. He also drove the Paramount Pictures bean counters absolutely crazy by going over budget. The Scarlet Empress was expensive and looks expensive. Von Sternberg spent Paramount's money in a way they could only justify with Cecil B. DeMille. Von Sterberg made good use of music to cover many stretches of no dialog. And after seven years of talking pictures he also used title cards and effectively when 99 of films had dropped them for good.Paramount did not appreciate the money they lost on The Scarlet Empress but Marlene Von Sternberg and even the bean counters know now they made a classic.".

It's as if Von Sternberg only seems interested in the trappings of power in the minutiae of court intrigue rather than in the intrigue itself in this respect it's a bit like Sofia Coppolla's MarieAntoinette and of course in Dietrich he has a magnificent Catherine.

	schema:reviewBody "The best directors are adaptable able to turn their talents to the needs of story and stars. On the other hand a stylistic individualist such as Joseph von Sternberg may be excellent at what they do but completely inflexible and as such their work tends to be uneven. However although Sternberg was unable to bend his style to suit the material there is always the chance that sooner or later the material would come along to suit his style. Enter The Scarlet Empress.It may be based on a true story but The Scarlet Empress makes only fleeting contact with reality. It is a macabre nightmarish fairytale imagining of history. As such Sternberg can go all out with his bizarre stylisation and disregard for convention. All those things which made a mess of his other pictures  the odd angles the distracting foreground clutter the hammy acting  they all fit in here. Sternberg was never one to elucidate plot or draw out emotional depth and The Scarlet Empress is the one picture where he doesn't really need to.In this light we can actually take time to appreciate the excesses of Sternberg's technique. The early scenes in Germany are comparatively light and airy. When Count Alexei arrives he introduces a swathe of blackness. From this point on Sternberg literally darkens the picture not just from scene to scene but from moment to moment for example when Alexei's cloak envelops Marlene as he kisses her. The Russian palace is a surreal creation more like a bejewelled cave than a building. We can see the fine craftsmanship of Hans Dreier but he was doubtless directed fairly thoroughly by Sternberg himself. It's shot and lit in such a way that it appears to have no limits its edges lost in shadow. And as for Sternberg's closeups! They are strange wonderful glittering portraits worthy of the painted icons that are such a part of Russian culture. The only pity is that Sternberg treats his cast as merely part of the mechanical process. To him a good actor like Sam Jaffe is simply there to be a grotesque little different to the stone ones adorning every set.The exception is Marlene. Ms Dietrich shimmers under Sternberg's lens. Not only does she stand out more here than any other picture like a shimmering jewel amid the shadows this also happens to be her very finest performance. When we first meet her she is a world away from her familiar screen persona playing the teenage Catherine as timid nave and frail. As the plot progresses she transforms into the smart and confident seductress and finally emerges as the charismatic empressinwaiting and this at last is the Marlene we all know. Her development though radical is absolutely believable and throughout her acting is utterly flawless.And then there is the music. The Scarlet Empress is an almost constantly musical picture with much of the action wordlessly choreographed to a pounding background score. It is a truly symphonic work what Michael Powell referred to as a composed film. And it is reminiscent of Russian music purely in its tone  it has that same cruel stark quality of Mussorgsky and Prokofiev music from a culture who get a lot of ice and not much daylight. And yet the composer whose work is most prominently used in The Scarlet Empress is Tchaikovsky by and large a confectioner of nice but plain melodic pieces. His music fits though especially the Slavic March and in any case Tchaikovsky has a lot in common with Sternberg  pretty but lacking in depth. And Tchaikovsky still had his masterpieces.".

	onyx:emotionText "The best directors are adaptable able to turn their talents to the needs of story and stars. On the other hand a stylistic individualist such as Joseph von Sternberg may be excellent at what they do but completely inflexible and as such their work tends to be uneven. However although Sternberg was unable to bend his style to suit the material there is always the chance that sooner or later the material would come along to suit his style. Enter The Scarlet Empress.It may be based on a true story but The Scarlet Empress makes only fleeting contact with reality. It is a macabre nightmarish fairytale imagining of history. As such Sternberg can go all out with his bizarre stylisation and disregard for convention. All those things which made a mess of his other pictures  the odd angles the distracting foreground clutter the hammy acting  they all fit in here. Sternberg was never one to elucidate plot or draw out emotional depth and The Scarlet Empress is the one picture where he doesn't really need to.In this light we can actually take time to appreciate the excesses of Sternberg's technique. The early scenes in Germany are comparatively light and airy. When Count Alexei arrives he introduces a swathe of blackness. From this point on Sternberg literally darkens the picture not just from scene to scene but from moment to moment for example when Alexei's cloak envelops Marlene as he kisses her. The Russian palace is a surreal creation more like a bejewelled cave than a building. We can see the fine craftsmanship of Hans Dreier but he was doubtless directed fairly thoroughly by Sternberg himself. It's shot and lit in such a way that it appears to have no limits its edges lost in shadow. And as for Sternberg's closeups! They are strange wonderful glittering portraits worthy of the painted icons that are such a part of Russian culture. The only pity is that Sternberg treats his cast as merely part of the mechanical process. To him a good actor like Sam Jaffe is simply there to be a grotesque little different to the stone ones adorning every set.The exception is Marlene. Ms Dietrich shimmers under Sternberg's lens. Not only does she stand out more here than any other picture like a shimmering jewel amid the shadows this also happens to be her very finest performance. When we first meet her she is a world away from her familiar screen persona playing the teenage Catherine as timid nave and frail. As the plot progresses she transforms into the smart and confident seductress and finally emerges as the charismatic empressinwaiting and this at last is the Marlene we all know. Her development though radical is absolutely believable and throughout her acting is utterly flawless.And then there is the music. The Scarlet Empress is an almost constantly musical picture with much of the action wordlessly choreographed to a pounding background score.

	schema:headline " Empress Dietrich";
	schema:reviewBody "This biopic about the rise of the German Princess Sofia to Empress Catherine of Russia from naive and deferential innocent to rapacious predator is accurate only in the broadest outlines. Even the opening credits indicate a loose approach to fact Based on a diary of Catherine arranged by Manuel Komroff.In the first half Marlene Dietrich in the title role overplays breathless awe so emphatically that one can only wonder if she was strictly directed to do so after her sexual awakening after months of resisting the stirring of her passions by a rakish courtier John Lodge and crazed with frustration by her unconsummated marriage to the repellent Tsartobe Peter Sam Jaffe she melts into the arms of a palace guard during a sudden moonlit encounter.It's hard to believe this film passed the 1934 censors given its open suggestions of outofwedlock sex and subsequent pregnancy Dietrich's posturings call to mind preCode Mae West who was a friendly acquaintance of Dietrich's on the Paramount lot where they were working at the same time. Perhaps the keepers of the Code were too distracted by the shimmering vision of the blonde icon as lit by Josef von Sternberg. And make no mistake about it this movie is a paean to Dietrich as a work of art. The Catherine the Great plot scenic design and supporting players are the scaffolding and trappings supporting and surrounding the living goddess.These trappings are highly stylized and elaborate as for example the Lubitschlike ritual of Princess Sophia the future Empress Catherine kissing the hands of all adults present whenever she enters or exits a room when she isn't engaged in strictly supervised activities she is kept locked in her bedroom several flights above the main floor of her house her mother is such a disciplinarian that she scolds the child even when the child obeys. Empress Elizabeth of Russia Louise Dresser is introduced on a grand throne in forbidding surroundings decorated with huge grimacing gargoyles festooned with dripping candles and attended by overdressed lackeys only to open her mouth and jabber like a bilious smallminded housewife. And the future Tsar Peter whom Sophia is sent to Russia to marry is an imbecile and described as such repeatedly in intertitles in case we miss the point.In fact the flow of exaggerations and extremes is more or less constant so that the viewer is alternately hypnotized and amused. If Dietrich is not your cup of tea the movie will repel you because it's all about her.".

Young Catherine arrives in Russia practically a child only to be greeted by the scoldings of another overbearing mother an Orthodox patriarch perched beneath an ungodly gargoyle and a halfmad imbecile for a husband.The whole of the Russian court turns out to be not much different from the vile stories of atrocity she was narrated to as a child one after another a series of machinations at the hands of the halfmad.But of course history was never the purpose for Sternberg these stories at the beginning of the film he visualizes in the manner of pages from a book. So a fiction malformed from history a book of images ostensibly based on the diaries of the real person in turn a history malformed from the real thing with Dietrich stage center shining radiant.It was always Dietrich that validated film for Sternberg the image of seductive beauty that could seduce beauty from the camera. But in several ways I feel that Sternberg deteriorated upon joining up with her much like the hapless professor in Blue Angel. His art was tortured before anguished with emotion but since Dietrich it seemed to be solely consumed by her at the expense of all else.Nowhere is this more evident than here no pretense about it anymore. Dietrich is quite literally queen destined to be and the whole thing around her merely provides the tortured circumstances for the scene of triumph. There is so much cacophony when she does finally triumph that it makes you think Sternberg has finally gone unhinged from so much pained adoration that he doesn't quite know when to separate one feverish fantasy from his own. A cavalcade storms inside the palace and up the expansive staircase a bell rings ringing bells across the country crowds rejoice that were earlier silently praying and Dietrich is finally ushered on shoulders into the church swarmed with banners on all sides to be crowned empress. Ride of the Valkyries clangs away in bombast for the duration.But this is the thing that strikes the most vividly the crowning luxurious decadence of the whole enterprise. Even in the grip of what seems like lovestruck paroxysm Sternberg could envision farther than most at the time. And when he failed he failed more spectacularly than anyone could in the most interesting ways to see.It baffles. It exhilarates with the sheer monstrosity of the caricature. It overwhelms any sensibility that is fine any sense of good taste. You will never see more a outrageous depiction of an Orthodox church ever the frescoes of saints bordering on a surreal that is blasphemous. Or more styrofoam gargoyles in one studio lot palace.So the frame is overflowing with anguished fiendish luxury but everything that is grossly portrayed here was actually taking place on that studio lot. Whatever was going on in 18th century Russia at least this thing was actually happening in Hollywood that would go to such lengths to envision and stage such a dazzling darkness. A cavalcade was made to storm up a staircase. And there was this woman at the center flickering before the camera like the flame of the candle she holds at one scene finally lighting up the place.So it is apt to recast the whole thing as Dietrich's journey mirrored from the other from her faraway home into the court of a foreign country with every spotlight on her every male pair of eyes.The first part is sourced out as a kind of Alice in Wonderland the girl enters a strange world apprehensive fearful a world that would reduce her to size where she must fit through doors too big wait for the queen or lose her head finally descend into a rabbit hole and come out the other end the mother of a heir.But in the second part she becomes the Dietrich we know and have come to see conquer with fierce beauty the Lola that first broke hearts in Blue Angel the whole film around her transforms into the restless dream that men were dreaming about her. The idea is that she becomes that dream operating the image from inside. It is not a good film all else considered the overcooked bombast the intertitles that never shy away from revealing the full implications of the most obvious detail but it's a mess you should see just for how madly passionate.".

	schema:headline " The most stupendous homage ever paid to an actress.";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Scarlet Empress many times. On TV in movie theaters. I cannot simply imagine the world without that film certainly in my Top Ten Favourites list.Style is the first word that came to my mind when I think of von Sternberg he added the von to his name but he clearly deserves it. And The Scarlet Empress' is purely un exercice de style. People often use the concept of Expressionism to describe the photography or the ambiance of the film but it is simply because it is not a classical Hollywood movie in style or in atmosphere. There is nothing strictly Expressionist in The Scarlet Empress as the expression of emotions is definitely secondary to the creation of a style as a raison d'etre. The early years of Catherine the Great before she even become Catherine the Great as described by von Sternberg are not corresponding to a strict historical version. This is not the point. This is about the transformation of a woman from a tender naive and gentle Prussian rose into a Machiavelian merciless prayingmantis cold as steel hot as Hell. It is probably a bit stretched but I find a lot of similarities between the depiction of how Sophia Frederica became Catherine the Great and the personal story of Marlene Dietrich. When she was chosen by von Sternberg for the role of Lola Lola she was active in German show business for years. At that time she was a bit plump more the girl next door than she who must be obeyed. Then Der Blaue Engel. Then Hollywood a few more movies with her creator and the woman became Legend something out of this world.in a way the character played quite well by John Lodge reminds me of von Sternberg in front of Marlene. When Sophia Frederica sees the handsome dashing and fascinating Russian envoy it is Marlene at the time where she was just another actress in the boiling last years of the Weimar Republic. The Count seduces her makes her falling for him easily after she discovered her future husband is a raving maniac looking like a monkey on acid. And then the brutal wakeup he is the lover of the reigning empress! The little princess throws her broken heart in the sewer and decides to reject everything she was previously a bit like what did La Dietrich after she arrived in Hollywood. And this is were I see the comparison between the character of John Lodge and von Sternberg. Von Sternberg tried to keep the evasive Marlene under his spell for years making six more movies with for her. But she was far away already long ago. And the face of John Lodge when he discovers than he will never be Catherine the Great's lover simply because he played with her heart and betrayed her naive love is a kind of symbol of the filmmaker losing his grip on his creature. But was she ever HIS creature?Of course Marlene dominates the film. She is radiant more beautiful and glamorous than in any other movie. She is also excellent. She plays at 33 the young virginal princess very convincingly her great doelike eyes constantly moving from one surprise to another. After the betrayal of the man she thinks she loves she becomes a kind of Nietschian character bigger than life cynical and ruthless. But the closeup of her face after she dismissed John Lodge and now waits for the Count Orlov her new caprice shows a distressed woman. A woman who was betrayed by her first love and whose revenge is bittersweet if not pathetic.The other actors are all brilliant but Louise Dresser as the empress Elisabeth and Sam Jaffe as the Grand Duke Peter respectively mother in law and husband of Catherine are particularly outstanding. Louise Dresser plays herself a cynical and ruthless empress who knows her weaknesses but put the destiny of Russia about everything. Sam Jaffe well was the character actor by excellence able to play a Russian Grand Duke or Gunga Din.

	onyx:emotionText "I saw The Scarlet Empress many times. On TV in movie theaters. I cannot simply imagine the world without that film certainly in my Top Ten Favourites list.Style is the first word that came to my mind when I think of von Sternberg he added the von to his name but he clearly deserves it. And The Scarlet Empress' is purely un exercice de style. People often use the concept of Expressionism to describe the photography or the ambiance of the film but it is simply because it is not a classical Hollywood movie in style or in atmosphere. There is nothing strictly Expressionist in The Scarlet Empress as the expression of emotions is definitely secondary to the creation of a style as a raison d'etre. The early years of Catherine the Great before she even become Catherine the Great as described by von Sternberg are not corresponding to a strict historical version. This is not the point. This is about the transformation of a woman from a tender naive and gentle Prussian rose into a Machiavelian merciless prayingmantis cold as steel hot as Hell. It is probably a bit stretched but I find a lot of similarities between the depiction of how Sophia Frederica became Catherine the Great and the personal story of Marlene Dietrich. When she was chosen by von Sternberg for the role of Lola Lola she was active in German show business for years. At that time she was a bit plump more the girl next door than she who must be obeyed. Then Der Blaue Engel. Then Hollywood a few more movies with her creator and the woman became Legend something out of this world.in a way the character played quite well by John Lodge reminds me of von Sternberg in front of Marlene. When Sophia Frederica sees the handsome dashing and fascinating Russian envoy it is Marlene at the time where she was just another actress in the boiling last years of the Weimar Republic. The Count seduces her makes her falling for him easily after she discovered her future husband is a raving maniac looking like a monkey on acid. And then the brutal wakeup he is the lover of the reigning empress! The little princess throws her broken heart in the sewer and decides to reject everything she was previously a bit like what did La Dietrich after she arrived in Hollywood. And this is were I see the comparison between the character of John Lodge and von Sternberg. Von Sternberg tried to keep the evasive Marlene under his spell for years making six more movies with for her. But she was far away already long ago. And the face of John Lodge when he discovers than he will never be Catherine the Great's lover simply because he played with her heart and betrayed her naive love is a kind of symbol of the filmmaker losing his grip on his creature. But was she ever HIS creature?Of course Marlene dominates the film. She is radiant more beautiful and glamorous than in any other movie. She is also excellent. She plays at 33 the young virginal princess very convincingly her great doelike eyes constantly moving from one surprise to another. After the betrayal of the man she thinks she loves she becomes a kind of Nietschian character bigger than life cynical and ruthless. But the closeup of her face after she dismissed John Lodge and now waits for the Count Orlov her new caprice shows a distressed woman. A woman who was betrayed by her first love and whose revenge is bittersweet if not pathetic.The other actors are all brilliant but Louise Dresser as the empress Elisabeth and Sam Jaffe as the Grand Duke Peter respectively mother in law and husband of Catherine are particularly outstanding. Louise Dresser plays herself a cynical and ruthless empress who knows her weaknesses but put the destiny of Russia about everything. Sam Jaffe well was the character actor by excellence able to play a Russian Grand Duke or Gunga Din. His Peter is an absolute maniac but he manages to make him more pathetic and pitiful than monstrous. In the end he is a poor fellow too small for his own crown. You feel almost sorry for him when he dies.Von Sternberg acted as a real demiurge in this movie controllingcreating everything lights camera angles and moves sets and costumes.

	schema:reviewBody "Josef von Sternberg's overpowering masterpiece is a visual orgy unparalleled in the annals of Hollywood history  the ne plus ultra of ornate production design though Bert Glennon's luminous cinematography occasionally shooting star Marlene Dietrich through a gauze is equally irreproachable. Movie critic David Thomson who had singled out the director among the 11 greatest filmmakers in an essay on Howard Hawks in his indispensable A Biographical Dictionary Of The Cinema wrote elsewhere about THE SCARLET EMPRESS specifically that it is often hailed as the fullest demonstration of Sternberg's geniusin truthout of control  and it is not a picture he talks about very much in his selfserving autobiography. This is an early example of rival productions being setup concurrently on the same subject but it emerges as superior to the contemporaneous Alexander KordaPaul Czinner British production CATHERINE THE GREAT in just about every conceivable way even if it proved a commercial disaster that led to Dietrich being declared boxoffice poison!.Marlene Dietrich shines delivering one of her most nuanced performances as the young ingnue who believably matures into an ambitious Czarina able to lure men into usurping the Russian throne in her name even leading them atop their steeds in full military regalia during the virtually dialoguefree climactic storming of the Palace!. The fact that Catherine was being portrayed by Dietrich made it conceivable that the Empress should have been sexually active outside wedlock  something that is not possible with Elizabeth Bergner  to the point of being impregnated by a soldier I wonder just what the Russians made of this particular turnofevents! Although like the Korda version there is also a soldier named Orlof here he only comes to prominence in the film's latter stages and is even made to murder the Czar he is played by an unrecognizable Gavin Gordon for the most part Catherine's love interest is virile ambassador John Lodge evoking Clark Gable in his one notable role. Even so she repays Lodge's nighttime tryst with the Empress by doing so herself later with Orlof and is seen playing innocent games with her ladiesinwaiting and personal guards as the old Empress lies dying!Remarkably three great character actors appear right in the film's opening scene in which young Catherine played by Maria Riva Dietrich's own daughter is waited upon by C. Aubrey Smith playing Catherine's father Edward Van Sloan and Jane Darwell indeed the last two never feature in the film again! The film's acting honors however are shared between a debuting Sam Jaffe as a perennially wildeyed Peter III and Louise Dresser as Czarina Elizabeth she had previously played Catherine II herself in the Rudolph Valentino swashbuckler THE EAGLE 1925 all three leads offer a vastly different characterization to their counterparts in the aforementioned British film. The old Empress has an effete lover here too but Jaffe's concubine is somewhat less well defined if more insidious she keeps coming back into a room she has just left to collect the Czar's toy soldiers in fact at one point Jaffe has his army march inside the Palace because of the rain and they actually seem like a pack of toy soldiers! incidentally while one would normally scoff at the prospect of a halfwit having a girlfriend there is no suggestion that she was so devoted to him merely out of a desire to secure her own place on the throne we only need to remember that Nero had Poppea and Hitler his Eva Braun! The early montage showing the oppressive behavior of past Russian rulers like Ivan The Terrible takes full advantage of its PreCode vintage one is shown repeatedly and ruthlessly beheading his prisoners another is gleefully ringing a bell that has a prisoner tied upside down inside it! and a bevy of nude girls are being tortured! To alleviate the gloom somewhat we have the odd but effective instance of comic relief the old Empress grabbing a turkey leg from the banquet table instead of her sceptre and Jaffe is shown drilling a hole in Dresser's bedchamber to look for Dietrich! Indeed there is here much less reliance on political machinations making copious use of rather stilted intertitles to further the plot and soulsearching this time around on the part of Peter III. Even so the constant barrage of music on the soundtrack  including such instantly recognizable classical pieces as Wagner's Ride Of The Valkyries and Tchaikovsky's 1812  really adds to the authentic recreation of a past era marked by decadence and violence. Interestingly some of the crowd scenes were lifted from Ernst Lubitsch's THE PATRIOT 1928 at a time when that director was Head Of Production at the studio! since that one is presumed lost outside of a theatrical trailer readily accessible on You Tube it is ironic that the film only survives officially in this 'undignified' manner! Given Sternberg's predilection for shooing in a studio it is possible that Dietrich's involvement in a film not directed by him at this point i.e. Rouben Mamoulian's THE SONG OF SONGS 1933 was due to the time it took to construct the elaborate sets! The print utilized for the Criterion edition I watched is sadly quite weak and grainy in spots one hopes that this film will one day be revisited on BluRay after having undergone the extensive restoration required the film's running time is officially given in film tomes as 110 minutes but it runs for 105 here possibly due to the 4 PAL speedup factor  even if the IMDb states it should be just 104!".

The pacing and filming as conservative as it is compared to its contemporaries from Scarface to Dinner at Eight take your pick or more inventive European films is superbly intelligent and superbly visual. Man the lush sets are framed to excess in a rich beautiful way and when I mean excess it's impossible to imagine a more stylized packed overripe set of scenes one after another in very fast succession. Of course part of these sets and scenes is the incomparable Marlene Dietrich by now a von Sternberg mainstay. He practically worshipped her and this was their seventh film together. For my money she is not her best in this one but she is the main spark of life in all the pomp and layered decorations and astonishing lighting. She is also sculpturally vivid if that's the right word. Take the closeups through a veil about 32 minutes in. Simple moving stuff with a flickering candle and her eyes catching the light. But that's one of hundreds literally great short clips and moments.The story is of course limited by historyit's based loosely for sure on the life of Catherine the Great. Too bad the real horror of a ghastly arranged marriage is dampened by all the cinematic finenessit's to be understood and spoken of more than emotionally felt. Too bad it's generally more interested in its effect than in accuracy. Or I should say good thing. Who needs an accurate story of Catherine the Great anyway? What we have is a glorious bit of Europeaninfluences Hollywood in the vigorous early 1930s a high point for sure in our movie history. Watch for the scenes of Catherine as a childthey are played by Dietrich's daughter. I think if you aren not into Dietrich she doesn't really have to act here just pose or into period movies in general or visual effects over plot you'll find this wearying or even unbearable. The pastiche of endless bits of Russian classical music alone might be overbearing. But still it might all surprise you.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it was during his press conference for 'Excalibur' at Cannes that John Boorman made the observation that his films were the opposite of 'minimalist' in expression. Like Boorman  but even greater in his command of cinema  Josef von Sternberg didn't want to leave anything to the imagination of the audience  it was all there on the screen.I just saw 'The Scarlett Empress' for the first time in almost forty years albeit on DVD rather than on the screen and I saw that of all directors in this great and glorious art of ours von Sternberg knew how to fill the screen with expression. His is a cinema of light and shade of scale and gesture of visual expression on a grand scale.The story of Catherine the Great is perfect for Sternberg's hyper abbreviated style. No messing about here. Catherine has been given a bum steer by the handsome Count Alexei with whom as a cloistered teenager she has fallen in love. Her fate is to be married to the imbecile Grand Duke Peter  heir to the Russian throne Sam Jaffe in an extraordinary debut performance. To triumph over this misfortune Catherine must use all her charisma and sexual guile.The rle of Catherine is perfect for Marlene Dietrich  who alone in actresses of the Thirties was like Marilyn Monroe twenty years later an irresistible melange of innocence and raw sexuality. It is fascinating to see the way in which Sternberg takes her from wideeyed ingnue to worldlywise seductress.But the acting is only a small part of Sternberg's creative methodology. The real genius not a word I use very often in this film is its use of decor  arguably the greatest piece of set design in history  to reflect the great historical forces that were at work in this 18th Century cauldron. Once arrived at the Kremlin Catherine is surrounded by gargoyles and breathtaking interiors  headed by the jawdropping enormous throne of the Imperial court formed as a menacing doubleheaded eagle.The Art Direction was done by the noted German Expressionist Art Director Hans Dreier but Sternberg was noted for having a grip of iron over every part of his productions in this era so I think we can give him the credit for this amazing piece of visual expression.No matter  whoever takes the credit it is magnificent. The film ranks with 'Shanghai Express' as one of Sternberg's greatest achievements and a monument to creativity in studio cinema of the 1930s.".

Like Boorman  but even greater in his command of cinema  Josef von Sternberg didn't want to leave anything to the imagination of the audience  it was all there on the screen.I just saw 'The Scarlett Empress' for the first time in almost forty years albeit on DVD rather than on the screen and I saw that of all directors in this great and glorious art of ours von Sternberg knew how to fill the screen with expression. His is a cinema of light and shade of scale and gesture of visual expression on a grand scale.The story of Catherine the Great is perfect for Sternberg's hyper abbreviated style.

As always the great Master revels in his love for opulence grand settings theatrical acting sex intrigues and violence and since The Scarlet Empress was one of the last pictures to 'escape' the full enforcement of the Production Code he can do so once more without almost ANY restriction.It's nothing like a historical movie of course  except that it goes roughly along the real events in the 17th century the young German princess Sophia is summoned by the Russian empress Elizabeth to marry her halfwit son and bring some 'fresh blood' into the decadent czarist line. And Marlene Dietrich is a WONDERFUL sight throughout all the picture how she 'develops' from the innocent young girl that's still hoping for a beautiful prince into a disillusioned willful lustful woman in the beginning she's almost shocked by the advances of the goodlooking count Alexej who turns out to be one of the greatest heartbreakers of the court  but the longer she's forced to live with her literally abominable demented husband the new Czar the more she gets to like the idea that 'every woman in the court has got her lovers' and so she virtually 'commandeers' all the army officers  something which will help her a lot in the counterintrigue she's forced to spin against the deadly intrigues of her 'husband'...So this is a REAL preCode movie and certainly one of the most pompous and extravagant of all  and it's got a very interesting and unique aspect to it concerning sex here the MEN are the 'sex objects' not only for the formerly innocent Sophia who's become reckless and randy Catherine  but even for the lustful old empress Elizabeth! The only one who'd shown a similar 'attitude' in preCode movies was Mae West... Who'd in fact wanted very much herself to make a movie about Catherine the Great but Von Sternberg beat her to it well she turned her own ideas into a stage play later on... So as far away from any kind of reality as it may be  enjoy it as a Hollywood 'fairy tale' of the 'nasty' kind... it's one of the most entertaining ones ever made!".

	schema:reviewBody "THE SCARLET EMPRESS Paramount 1934 directed by Josef Von Sternberg based on the diary of Catherine the Great as arranged by Manuel Komaroff reunites its director with his star queen Marlene Dietrich for the first time since BLONDE VENUS Paramount 1932. For their fifth collaboration this ranks one of the most stylish visual experience ever presented. Capitalizing on the current trend of historical spectacles based on various crown heads of Europe ranging from Charles Laughton's Academy Award winning performance in Alexander Korda's THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII London Films 1933 to Greta Garbo's take as QUEEN Christina MGM 1933 of Sweden THE SCARLET EMPRESS goes a step further having Dietrich's Catherine the Great competing with Elisabeth Bergner's title role in Korda's own interpretation of THE RISE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT London Films 1934. With the grand scale KordaBergner production no doubt an astounding theatrical success it's THE SCARLET EMPRESS that stands out with its most outlandish flavor of bizarre extravagance.Imitating the basic elements of a silent film epic through its continuous underscoring of classical compositions by Peter Tchaikovsky and Felix Mendelssohn and numerous intertitles preceding upcoming scenes of events opening with About two centuries ago in a corner of the kingdom of Prussia lived a little princess  chosen by destiny to become the greatest monarch in her time  Tsarina of all Russias  the illfamed Messalina of the North before its two minute prologue introducing sevenyearold Catherine nee Sophia Frederica Maria Sieber of Germany in bed being examined by her doctor. With her hopes on becoming a toe dancer her mother has other plans for this future queen. Next scene reveals the adult Sophia Marlene Dietrich swinging on a vine surrounded by other young girls later meeting with her elders with the news of her forthcoming journey to Russia accompanied by her aunt Princess Johanna Olive Tell and young escort Count Alexei John Lodge for an arranged marriage with her future husband. Upon their arrival Sophia is met by the outspoken Empress Elizabeth Louise Dresser who not only renames her Catherine but demands the heir to the throne to be a boy. Catherine's girlish dreams for a tall dark and handsome husband are shattered with the meeting of Grand Duke Peter Fyodorovitch Sam Jaffe a royal halfwit whom she is to marry. The marriage goes on as planned at the Old Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan but the honeymoon is practically over as the couple sleeps in separate quarters. In due time Catherine is slowly driven to affairs with soldiers of the Russian Army while Grand Duke Peter and his mistress Countess Elizabeth Ruthelma Stevens plot for Catherine's murder.In the cast of 1000 players only a few are credited with their names in lower case lettering including C. Aubrey Smith as Prince August Gavin Gordon Gregory Orloff Jameson Thomas Lieutenant Ovtsyn Edward Van Sloan Herr Wagner Jane Darwell Madame Cardell. The one billed simply as Maria is Maria Sieber Dietrich's reallife daughter assuming her role as a child. For Dietrich's performance her role of Catherine resembles of the one played in Rouben Mamoulian's THE SONG OF SONGS 1933 through her interpretation of a shy softspoken innocent convincingly transformed to a strongwilled lady of the world during its second half of the story. Although there's much criticism in regards to Sam Jaffe's portrayal of Grand Duke Peter bearing the physical manner of comedian Harpo Marx from white wig to wide eyes and hideous smile Jaffe in motion picture debut appears to be more believable with this characterization than the much handsomer portrayal given by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in the aforementioned British made version. Had THE SCARLET EMPRESS been filmed as a satire rather than an epic spectacle how amusing or embarrassing this production might have been with Harpo's Grand Duke Peter chasing after Catherine and her ladiesinwaiting throughout the castle. Due to her seemingly more American acting style Louise Dresser comes across as the miscast Empress Elizabeth. While Von Sternberg might have acquired the services of natural Russian born actress as Maria Ouspenskaya who would have been perfect as she was in the story about Napoleon Charles Boyer in CONQUEST MGM 1937 starring Greta Garbo. John Lodge whose acting style and strong deep voice predating that of future actors Orson Welles or Van Heflin blends in perfectly with his character of Count Alexi and nothing more.Often compared to the directorial style of silent director Erich Von Stroheim with use of camera capturing the slightest detail Von Stroheim participation in spectacle finds his actors Dietrich included competing with reproduction of 16th century Russian exteriors sets compliments of Hans Dreier costumes devilish plaster of Paris gargoyles nude statutes and thousands of lighted candles. The Von Sternberg method of super imposing tracking shots over guests sitting by dinner tables and soft focus photography by Bert Glennon of Dietrich's facial expressions are evident and expected. Catherine's clattering up the palace steps on her white horse and climatic finish through 1812 Overture scoring are justly famous.Revived often on television through much of the 1970s and 80s prior its distribution on video cassette and DVD THE SCARLET EMPRESS has the distinction of being was the only DietrichVon Sternberg collaboration ever presented on American Movie Classics 199293.
