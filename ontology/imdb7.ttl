The movie is helped by an unconventional storyline but badly undercut by it's flashback framing which results in a formulamatic abrupt ending.  Father Hood would have worked MUCH better without these bookends.  Nevertheless the movie brings up important issues of family responsibilities and the consequences of state intervention. As long as the foster system rewards state institutions for NOT placing children such abuses will exist.Pick this one up.  It's worth the ride.".

The only person on their side is feisty journalist Kathleen Mercer Halle Berry who tries to convince Jack to give her an interview providing information against the youth detention center and she'll work out a deal for him so that his sentence is reduced. Jack also drops by his mother's Diane Ladd in Las Vegas.Okay so it's not anything new but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Shot in a typical early 90's style Darrell Roodt catches the cross country landscape effectively. The performances are good too. The late Patrick Swayze is brilliant as the reluctant dad. Sabrina Lloyd is cute and vivacious. Brian Bonsall can be annoying at times but then again his character was a clich. Halle Berry is charming in her limited screen time.'Father Hood' holds some nostalgic value for me and it was nice to go back to memory lane for a while.

His wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care. When he got out he thought they were probably better off in foster care  besides he still had to score his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles played wonderfully by Sabrina Lloyd breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids. She hunts down her father tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother Eddie Charles played by Brian Bonsall  just a little 7yearold kid was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him. The three start off on an adventure across country all the while Jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids! Patrick Swayze is really good in this comedy playing a hood probably a little understatement for this criminal character who is similar to his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing except Jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle. Swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes Sawyer's ally.

	schema:reviewBody "Patrick Swayse has always been good at playing a tough guy such as his other movies such as Roadhouse. He does a good job as the tough guy here too actually as an outlaw who's about to do a big illegal deal in New Orleans in a few days. But as he is still in L.A. he is already facing court on other charges of his already pending. So the last thing he needs is his bratty kids suddenly bothering him now. But that is just what they do and they are bratty. Swayse thinks that they've been in foster care but in reality they've been in an institution that the kids claim is very tough and corrupt. That the staff there are being physically abusive to the kids and handcuffing them. However Swayze starts to see that the kids are really telling the truth on this one so he kidnaps them and takes them cross country with him to New Orleans. Now for the kids though they are bratty. The seven year old boy is whiney and annoying and the fourteen year old daughter has an attitude problem and is bitchy. Her attitude makes her not very likable. Now for the story. The set up in the first part of film was good but the road story has some very implausible moments. Moments that anyone with half a brain would never believe the situations they're watching and the kids really get annoying fast. Numerous implausible moments include Swayze making a car run over the edge at Hover Dam and no one seeing him do it. Swayze and the kids outrunning the police in several different scenes where in real life they would've never been able to do it that way especially the scene where they manage to jump from a speeding boat with helicopters overhead and no one seeing them do it. But my favorite implausibility is when they jump on to the back of a boat attached to a moving car talk and yell loudly and even cook a turkey dinner on the back of the boat without the driver ever knowing it. Yeh right. They even at one point after stopping at a gas station where Swayze goes to use the phone Swayze has another car drive up to the back of the boat cause the driver left without him and Swayze jumps from the front of that car onto the boat with them all yelling and the driver of the car hauling the boat still doesn't notice any if it! I mean come on how can anyone believe that the driver would be that deaf and dumb. The owner of the boat finally notices them when he's luring the boat into a river and Swayze and the kids start up the boat and drive away in it. I did however sort of like the little rendezvous between Swayze and the TV reporter Hally Berry who also already had some ideas about the institution being corrupt and needed Swayze who could've gotten information from the kids about the place to fill her in with more info about it. Swayze who was still more interested in his deal in New Orleans kept giving Berry the runaround. This was a sort of good film in some ways if it wasn't for those implausibilities and those bratty kids.".

Possibly that's because as a comedy there isn't a single laugh but the movie had a good dramatic premise along the lines of Rain Man almost. The film's biggest fault besides the dreaful unfocused script is the mediocre acting. Swayze is decidedly wooden a sign that even he knew the film had little hope and doesn't even attempt to breath any life into the bland film. The two actors who played his kids Sabrina Lloyd a 23 year old playing a 10 year old and Brian Bonsall don't fare much better. Though neither of them had roles that had any sense of depth they still manage to disappoint though at times Bonsall does hint that he has the makings of a Culkin like star. The film's sole redeeming performance comes from thenunknown Halle Berry playing a reporter. Though her role is a small one it is pivotal to the story and it's clear why she became such a big star afterward.Another problem with 'Father Hood' is that the lead character played by Swayze isn't the least bit likeable. If their intentions for the movie were for it to be a family film it's unneccesarily dark and violent but as a serious actioncomedy it's just too bland and boring. Pass on this one it isn't entirely bad but it's pretty close. For serious Swayze fans only.".

Or the pregnant girl being forcefully removed from her grandmother's house by the group home goons. And then another goon being shot to death in his car. Not that family films can't contain death or drama. But this was a film that likely would have been granted a TV14 rating had it been an episode of a drama series. Maybe even TVM.All in all is it a bad movie? I don't particularly think so. It's not wretched by any means. It's mediocre but watchable. It's kind of an interesting display of youths that are forced to grow up fast amid shattered families and corruption I'll say that much.

And although there were no men in the cast most of the dialog was about them. The story is rather thin and depended on the fact that divorce in the 1930's was not only difficult but almost impossible in New York. Mrs. Stephen Haynes learns that her husband is seeing a salesgirl at Saks and reluctantly divorces him abetted by her friends all of whom have romantic problems of their own. In the 1930's New York women who could afford it went to Nevada where residency could be established quickly and divorce was relatively easy. The 1939 film starring Norma Shearer Paulette Goddard Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford was a hit. This one with an even better looking cast is definitely not largely because someone tried to move a 1930's situation comedy into the present.";

	schema:reviewBody "First I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times know all the dialog and have read the '36 play which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick theatrical take on gossip adultery and backbiting among a set of wellheeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad grinning style doesn't have any context in this version. She mentions going after Buck which is a key element in the original  then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to overanalyze it but here are a few things that I found unbelievable  Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff I can suck the nails out of a board! Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that  gotten an Oscar nom right?  A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler!!!??? Annette Bening got what she wanted and the movie just sort of withers away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell she was an ignorant spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty ridiculous irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. In killing her off they killed the movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "First I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times know all the dialog and have read the '36 play which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick theatrical take on gossip adultery and backbiting among a set of wellheeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad grinning style doesn't have any context in this version. She mentions going after Buck which is a key element in the original  then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to overanalyze it but here are a few things that I found unbelievable  Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff I can suck the nails out of a board! Right.

When Hollywood first started talking about such enterprise the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable and that's exactly where things begin souring here with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work but that are not suited to the parts and sadly enough have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material.It seems as if there is no focus or direction or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film. This is called an updating as in let's drain the story out of humor snappy dialogue and any interesting premise. Most of all let's prove that women have come a long way except that the problem is that we don't really get at least by watching this film where the women are truly going.For starters casting Meg Ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances even after 20 years of working in the movies. Her Mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz by learning observing and realizing that she had a choice in the matter. It might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays but it was fun ride and part of the fun was the catty silly sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. In here we are down to earth with a thud. By changing the nature of Sylvia the film has lost a lot of its spark and it isn't in anyway Annette Bening's fault. I couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled. Thankfully I entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is wise but flawed and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately Ms. English wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction.Yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. In the original we have Joan Crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman. Her Crystal is legendary with conniving lines incendiary moves duplicitous maneuvers and some very sexy poses. She was the link between the male and the female and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous sexy the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired and most importantly we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes as gorgeous as she is is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing and once again some bad casting.There are more atrocities in the film such as the addition of a terrible role for Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies and the rather annoying lesbian turn by Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie as Bette Middler who is a little unrecognizable in her make up shows the spark of what could have been. Her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken. Her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film and it is exciting to see that it could really fly then she is gone. She is in the film all of six minutes and she fades away in the middle of the muddle.Here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us a film that could have joined the successful Sex in the City who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise. It gave us more bigger and better adaptation. It truly updated what had made it successful before. The Women in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself much like The Hulk did it this year find more suitable performers a really good writer and most of all someone who truly treasures what good movies are about.".

There appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film.Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern having an African American lesbian character but in actuality she is there to just look cool. There is no actual reason why Messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original I take.The side characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters with Mendes portraying the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and Mazar covering the gossip roles.The movie is boring lacking charm humor or sympathy for any characters. It almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved whether in front of or behind the camera.There is one glimmering hope in the film however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film in the small role that she has.".

The only performances that were note worthy we're of Debra Messing and Bette Midler. I wanted more of Bette. There was really no protagonist in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler character had too many sub themes to it. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store encounter with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. Also the pacing was slow as well. Obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated but this one wasn't it. The reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with man problems. A subject by the way which isn't outdated.

	schema:headline " The City of Women";
	schema:reviewBody "The Women 2008 by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning Candice Bergen Bette Midler Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them and Meg Ryan Jada Pinkett Smith Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players Bergen Leechaman Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand Sex and the City which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her? The movies like The Women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name.

	onyx:emotionText "The Women 2008 by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning Candice Bergen Bette Midler Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them and Meg Ryan Jada Pinkett Smith Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at how could the movie be boring predictable embarrassing sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players Bergen Leechaman Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos funny smart and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand Sex and the City which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women it was simply brilliant. At least Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we the viewers together with her? The movies like The Women give the whole genre chick flicks a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships about dealing with marriage motherhood and proving yourself professionally?

I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters did not represent any women that I know they were boring bitter and melodramatic. The movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired poor makeup and hair styling.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this because I know the 1939 movie well and wanted to see how it was updated. I sat through the whole thing but it's really a bad movie.Let me start by staying that I don't think the 1939 movie is a masterpiece. It has some wonderful scenes brilliantly directed by George Cukor and brilliantly brought off by a remarkable cast who knew how to deliver bitingly clever dialogue. But there are also maudlin scenes that kill the pacing. An uneven work.The remake isn't uneven I'll grant it that. It's uniformly awful all the way through.To begin with the characters have no internal coherence which they most certainly do in the 1939 version. In the remake it seems that the director did a survey of what would appeal to modern women and then randomly distributed those qualities to the various women in the movie. The modern Chrystal Allen isn't really nasty unlike in the original she never betrays Steven Haines. Sylvia Fowler starts off being repulsively selfcentered but then varies back and forth between caring and superficial without ever really being nasty. In fact NO ONE is really nasty and that deprives the remake of a lot of the bite of the original.The modern script is also sadly lacking in humor unlike the 1939 version. It just isn't that funny. And when it does repeat lines from the original it is painful to hear how poorly they are delivered.In short this movie has nothing to recommend itself. It plays like a mediocre TV show  it was directed by a TV director so I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise. The 1939 version though not a masterpiece remains miles ahead of this sad excuse for a feature film.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Women uses the same character names and the plot skeleton of the 1939 George Cukor classic with the same title but it is really more an alternate Sex and the City than an updated version the original. I found it neither as bad as its many detractors claim nor as good as its somewhat more limited number of fans make it out to be but it's probably best if you are not terribly familiar with or not a big fan of the classic version. While that film has always been polarizing even its critics recognize it has some of the snappiest wittiest zingers in Hollywood history. Sadly that sharpness is missing from the script of this film.And then there's the cast. I don't envy any group of actresses setting themselves up for comparison with the sensational ensemble of the original. This cast sounds impressive on paper but they never really gel. It took the SATC women several seasons of hard work to develop as individual characters that come together so smoothly. Ryan Bening Messing and Pinkett Smith can't manage the same feat in two hours especially not when saddled playing cardboard stereotypes representing different aspects of whatever the filmmakers think the modern woman is. Not one of these characters for all the talents of the actresses playing them ever actually felt like a real person.That said there's some life here scattered scenes that are amusing or touching. The four leads are ably assisted especially by Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen in beautifully played roles that ring true. And Bette Midler steals the toobrief chunk of the movie she gets giving us a hint of how brass and sassy a genuine attempt at updating The Women might have been. Unfortunately Eva Mendes then comes back on screen reminding us of how beneath Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen her version is and how much this movie pales in comparison. Not that it's all Mendes's fault  true she's no Joan Crawford but her role here is a shadow of what Crawford got to sink her teeth into. If you like chick flicks I'm a guy but I tend to and you're not hoping for anything close to the original then give it a go. Just don't expect too much. Everyone else don't waste your time.".

I haven't seen the original but I'm sure even in the late 30s they would have been more progressive than this. The dialogue is painful and clichd at best and it contains many many cringing moments. Cringing not as funny haha but cringing as in the script is absolutely offensive. Ever heard of the Bechdel test? It asks if a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. Wikipedia Well this movie fails the test and it's a movie with an all female cast. This movie has successfully become my worst movie of all time followed by Adam Sandler's Click.".

Cringing not as funny haha but cringing as in the script is absolutely offensive. Ever heard of the Bechdel test? It asks if a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. Wikipedia Well this movie fails the test and it's a movie with an all female cast. This movie has successfully become my worst movie of all time followed by Adam Sandler's Click.";

First of all it looks like they lit the whole film with florescent lighting and those shots of Annette Bennings hands she should sue! I think this was really a remake of the Valley of the Dolls and they just mislabeled the prints. Meg Ryan has lost her spunk and is completely flat on screen Debra Messing's character is dressed like a bag lady Eva Mendez compared to Joan Crawford need I say more just terrible. Terrible performances it felt at times that the cast was trying to remember their lines. The dialogue was trite and boring. And to top it all off instead of making some adjustments to the story to make it work for the modern woman they left it with Meg Ryan blaming herself for her husbands infidelity and falling wonderfully in love with the cheating schmuck because after all it is not enough to have an extremely successful clothing line a wonderful daughter and tons of money you have to have a man! Nightmare! Rent Sex and the City instead which makes you want to jump on a plane and spend the weekend in Manhatten with the girls.".

Assembling talented actors together with a successful  experienced writerdirector should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English's experience  according to her IMDb bio  is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV and maybe a laugh track would have helped. So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors  the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereotyped role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions  such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s and no one helped Ms. English get the changes  updates or subtleties right. If only she as writer director AND producer had reached out for some assistance I think it could have been good. But it was not.It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time  money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate A few movie execs are having a meeting  the caption reads Let's remake a classic with worse everything!".

Or is the target audience 19year old girls that might grab this excuse of a film at 2 for 1 Sex and the Citynight?What happened to Candace Bergen?  As Meg Ryans mother she provided an intelligent balance in rhetorics and dialog but at the end of the movie she has transformed to a babbling botoxed and victimized housewife. And the Jada Pinkett Smith character as the gay friend who in her womanizer spreadleg shotdrinking self is so over the top trying to portray a lesbian that it makes me think that the director never met a gay woman in her life! Why else would she portray this WONDERFUL actress as a foul mouthed macho man? I can't even comment on the Eva Mendez character. Ms Mendez is a fantastic actress who in her prior roles has done nothing but added Girl Power to the row of the typical Hollywood vamp. She is a sexy beautiful strong Latina who in this movie comes off as nothing but a victim. I think the idea was to portray her as the conniving snake who steal other womens husbands  and that's fine. But she comes off as nothing but stupid with the attention span of a tween. If this movie's target audience are adult women it makes me nothing less than ANGRY. Did the director think that we the women are that uninvolved? Incredibly heavy subjects were brought up but all the director did was throw fluff at it. The subject matter of friendship betrayal for example  the entire movie could have been dedicated to it! You have 4 very different women with extreme circumstances. Each one of them could have developed a different solution or cope with the problem and actually have HELPED someone. Do NOT watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.Please excuse any errors.

	schema:reviewBody "Directorscreenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead because of English's thematic overreach the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcomlevel stereotypes in this movie and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's Sex and the City did this sort of sororitystyle dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like Sex and the City she is surrounded by three best friends  Sylvie Fowler a successful cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada yet another film this echoes perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stayathome wife and Alex Fisher a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with maneater Crystal Allen a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.Looking strangely youthful at 47 Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle. It's not that she isn't ageappropriate here but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scenestealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow transparent shopgirl versus the smart hardedged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the nonnonsense housekeeper.Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes  one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' nightin as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multimarried Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras The Women The Legacy about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play and The Women Behind the Women which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female selfempowerment and selfimage. The irony is that this version of The Women directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.".

Yet for the international audience not acquainted to him one could say he's something like a crude mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman adding a foible for Jazz music and 70s outfits. While his stage performances already are eccentric his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous.00 Schneider is in my opinion Helge's best movie. He stars in the two leading roles  police detective Kommissar 00 Schneider and murderervillain Nihil Baxter and also in a precious smaller role as physician Dr. Hasenbein.In the opening scene we see how modernartloving Baxter accidentally kills the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used Jaguar when a beloved sculpture slips out of Baxter's hands fatally hitting Metulskie. Upon reading about the incident in the newspaper 00 comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick Lt. Koerschgen who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name. They pick up Baxter's track quickly and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion one of the movie's best scenes! but initially fail to gather any proof. The story winds through many turns with several scenes that don't always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny such as a daydream by 00 including the most unusual view on a running man's briefclad crotch in movie history a policedepartment party during which Koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized and a visit at the already mentioned Dr. Hasenbein's. Baxter then is finally caught attempting to escape to Rio de Janeiro on a plane.Always worth special mention is Andreas Kunze who in this case plays 00's wife as he's usually appearing in drag performing women's roles in Helge's Movies.So all you folks out there looking for new laughs I strongly recommend this movie. The catch? You have to understand German as I doubt there's an English version around...".

One instance would be where Nihil Baxter's head is next to his lamp in the first portrayal of his house. Some shots are taken in an almost British film noir manner seen in  some detective movies from the seventies. Even though there is an apparent distortion about the characters Helge plays they are rather  well observed and satirical and heartwarming at the same time. Helge embraces his  characters somehow and a happily floating absence of cynicism makes the movie a  treat you may want to watch more than once.".

Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider's way of seeing things. By the way Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazzmusicions in germany maybe europe. He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him it is ok but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid cheap boring or not funny.

	schema:reviewBody "And this description fits probably all of Schneider's work. His brand of humor and approach to comedy is so unique that it is either exactly your cup of tea or you won't find it remotely funny. I have to say for me it is probably the former. This 90minute film is over 20 years old and was directed and written by lead actor Schneider himself. It also says Brtchen as writer and I am not sure what this means. It's actually the German word for bread roll probably just a joke by Schneider. The movie features him as a police detective and even if the character comes out of retirement to solve the murder of a clown in this one already there was a sequel two years ago almost 20 years after the original movie. And he was only under 40 back then anyway. Here 00 Schneider obvious Bond reference chases Nihil Baxter also played by Schneider just like some other characters.There are some factors which apply to this film and also to most other works of Helge. He does not cast famous actors. He mostly casts his buddies or people that he worked with before even if they are completely unknown. Female characters are often played by male actors in drag. And there is lots of music in his movies. He is a talented saxophone player but the music is mostly goofy and all over the place just like the action. Also you will hardly find a film maker or actor who has more random dialogs than Schneider does. I don't do drugs but I would imagine that watching one of his films under the influence must be one of the weirdest experiences ever. Don't do it though. drugs are bad. And this film is very strange as well without them.Finally I would like to say once again that I like Schneider he has 6 children from 4 different women by the way also saw his comedy show live already. His humor is certainly not for everyone and has almost exclusively to do with personal taste so I won't criticize anybody who does not like his work. It may be especially hard to appreciate for foreigners as the dialogs are so random that they may be difficult to translate without losing the comedy of the situation. recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Leland Fitzgerald Ryan Gosling is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic kid. When pressured with the question 'Why?' he doesn't have an answer. While in jail he meets Pearl Don Cheadle his teacher who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps Leland figure out why he did it. Throughout this film we learn all about Leland's troubled life including his exgirlfriend BeckyJena Malone his famous father AlbertKevin Spaceyand his whole sad life. This film is Matthew Ryan Hoge's second movie and it is spectacular in nearly everyway. This is one movie which will leave you thinking in the end and wondering about how it all works. The movie is quite dark but if you can handle that then you will realize just how good a film it is.In this movie there is no bad guy. There is no one you can blame for anything that happens. There's no stereotyping and the audience does not try to prove Leland guilty. Instead we sit back relax and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the corse of the movie. All the problems depicted in the story are very real. Drug addiction parental expectations overwhelming sadness they all exist in our world.Ryan Gosling gives one of the greatest performances of his career in this movie as the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and doesn't really care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky but she has problems of her own. He knows exactly what he did but as he says in the film 'You want a why but maybe there isn't one. Maybe this is something that just happened.' There is a why but we don't find out about it until the end. As you watch the movie the audience finds themselves amazed that such a young person could know so much about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. A particular thoughtprovoking scene which really affected me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why Pearl replies that he's only human. Then Leland says something which never really occurs to anyone Why do people only say that when they've done something wrong?Another fantastic acting job was provided by Chris Klein. In the film he plays Allen Harris the boyfriend of Becky's sister Julie Michelle Williams. Although he is not one of the main characters I found myself amazed at how deep his character was. You can relate to Allen a lot. You know how much he cares for the Pollard family. It's as if they were his own flesh and blood. By the end of the movie you realize just how far he would go to help them. Overall this movie is a masterpiece which has been overlooked by quite a few people. If however you take the time to watch it you will most likely see that everything I've mentioned above is true. And once you're finished watching it you'll never look at the world the same way again.9.510".

	schema:headline " The critics failed to grasp the meaning of this one";
	schema:reviewBody "I was looking at the external reviews Ebert etc. for this film and they were all pretty much negative. However after reading many of them I noticed that they all made the same point. Critics were upset that the film centers around what appears to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. Certainly this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story that uncovers why the killing happened and squarely places blame on the guilty. They want blame to be cast and resolved. Well that statusquo theme is kind of what the movie is parodying. Just like society the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? There is a whole lot more to what happened then what is on the surface. The film does not seek to rationalize what happens but rather understand the why. What also steams me so much about these inane reviews is that all they look at in the way of performances is Spacey and Cheadle who were both great and generally are. But there are other great performances at work here other than just the two current icons of Hollywood. Gosling gives an incredible performance that really only somebody of his extreme talent could deliver. Somehow Gosling is able to make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. This irritates many I am sure. However if one watches the film they see what Leeland's motivation is it is wrong but it is not evil. Malone is also on top of her game as yet another confused young character. Basically the killing of the child in this film is not the main theme of the movie. The main theme is life itself and how people go about dealing with it the highs and lows and how they attempt to sometimes help others deal with their lives which does not seem to work out very well. There is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each has direct impact on how much more good and bad will take place and sometimes a confused attempt at doing good can lead to a whole bunch more of bad. I think this is one of the more memorable films in sometime and has an ending that is as touching as anything in recent movie history. I strongly believe people should view this film with an open mind.".

But Pearl also wants to understand Leland's motivation and takes him under his wing as a confidante in the prison.The film jumps from the past to the present several times often allowing the past to act as a context to the present and vice versa. Writerdirector Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland's crime  and the events leading up to it  affect the people in his life from Becky to her family to Leland's mother Lena Olin and estranged father Kevin Spacey to Allen Chris Klein a young man who is staying with Becky's family after the death of his own mother.The chief asset in the movie is Gosling who is perfectly cast as the 15yearold pseudopsychopath. Like Bartleby the Scrivener Gosling's Leland just exists he shows little emotion during the film but instead his expressions belie an ocean of guilt sadness love and rage.Each of the main actors offered perhaps their best work to date save Spacey who's not exactly a novice. Special praise is due to Malone and Klein two young performers who are better known for lighthearted comedy fare than the heavy drama of this movie.Another huge benefit in terms of the story is that none of the characters is flawless none are heroes out to save the day.

You really need to follow what Leland says and read his character to figure out the intended why the movie presents at the end. Nothing it solid it's not definite it's about what the individual viewer takes out of it. I think that was the plan from the getgo people aren't meant to all understand it in the same way it's almost about forming your own personal relationship with Leland in order to maybe feel him a little better.The storyline is interesting but its summary could never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and thought provoking a lot of heavy ideas but the pace of the movie is almost soothing even with its more intense scenes with yelling. I think it's probably Leland he's just calm and almost serene even for all of his sadness. The movie personifies Leland in a way.Of course it is captivating and draws you in if you let it but there are some recycled ideas. I mean Leland has a lot of impressive dialogue he is anything but typical but he's not a prophet. Everything he says is not a revelation many people I know have mentioned things he mentioned even I have observed a few things he's observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he is probably mostly for Ryan Gosling's portrayal.In the end the acting is all exceptional there are no real bad guys there is no way to psychologically evaluate Leland only to maybe understand him and life a little better.Comparable to Igby Goes Down I think not comedic but similar in its general outlook on life.".

	schema:headline " Very very strong film";
	schema:reviewBody "Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald Ryan Gosling a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer the brother of a girl he was dating. The issue is not whether he did it or not  Leland admits to it straight away  but rather why. Interestingly rather than a crime drama Leland becomes a character story examining why people do what they do  not necessarily the easiest ground to till.And Leland features the required indie group of screwedup people. Aside from the title character there's also Pearl Don Cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and egotistical father Kevin Spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did. But the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards the family of the retarded child. First there's Leland's girlfriend Becky Jena Malone a drug addict who can't keep herself clean her sister Julie Michelle Williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and Allen Harris Chris Klein a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julie's boyfriend. Lastly there's Ryan Michael Welch whom all the others call goofball who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings.Leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly  occasionally too slowly  burrows into everyone's lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do? While Leland discusses it openly in a journal Pearl allows him to keep examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another's perhaps the most basic choice any human can make. And the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of them.In the beginning of the film you're simply struck by the depth of the cast. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein  these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for a heady brew. For a space in the middle the film seems to stall sputtering along as it unfolds it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers. But when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together Leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of filmmaking. Leland's explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment you've made in the film pays off.Saying Ryan Gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice. At this point in his career it's redundant  this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thoughtprovoking protagonist. Gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite Don Cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he elevates Cheadle's game as well. Cheadle himself is in top notch form imbuing Pearl with a fullyrounded humanity  for good and bad. Spacey is kind of onenote but that's the character and he handles it excellently. I was surprised by Chris Klein with this level of acting I thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far. Terrific work all around.Leland is a bit of a downer and again it's draggy in spots. But it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway. There's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film in Leland's first day in juvenile hall class he's the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled. I wouldn't go so far as to call this required viewing  some might find it too slow or too odd  but I thought it was one of the better films I've seen in a while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there. I'd recommend it  with the above caveats  if for no other reason than to watch Gosling further perfect his craft.".

Actually it's worse than reading junior high goth poetry.I am a huge fan of Ryan Gosling and he was terrible here. It's a minor feat to make Gosling unwatchable but they did it. This film is not deep or profound but indulgent and false. I challenge anyone to find a more clichd role in film than Kevin Spacey's writer character who abandons his son then sits in a hotel bar with a bottle of scotch solo or worse sits in his car with a voice recorder and says there was a time when we moved through life with something like electricity... . Laughable.Here's the story for you Leland a weird squeaky voiced misfit who appears to be missing a few points of articulation in his body Gosling begins to date a super cool hipster music junkie Mallone and then she dumps him. This sends Gosling out of orbit and he stabs to death Mallone's retarded brother. Then Leland goes to juvie and has really deep conversations with Don Cheadle and another detainee. Cheadle is a failed writer who wants to write about Leland because he's so fascinating and who can argue that a semiretarded squeaky voiced kid shuffling his feet and looking like he has to take a dump is not fascinating? Cheadle confronts Leland's missing dad Spacey cheats on his girlfriend because he wants to do bad things and gains Insight. Leland writes a surefire bestseller diary and gives it to Cheadle then gets knifed in the yard by Chris Klein. Klein is the livein boyfriend of Mallone's sister. He gets dumped and then overwhelmed when Leland knifes the kid so decides to get locked up in juvie to have a go at Leland. Wow all these parts these machinations it's like a Swiss watch! Um... no.When Klein finally knifes Leland he says offcamera it's over. But it isn't. You still have to watch some closeups of Leland because he's so profound and tragic and he's like a saint or an angel come to earth to tell us about our sad lives. That's what having your first girlfriend dump you will do. You'll all go out and stab retarded kids in the park because see life is so heavy and we're all ignoring the sadness.Meanwhile the characters all repeat dialogue about making mistakes and doing nothing wrong and somewhere buried in all this is the conceit that we all make mistakes. WOW you didn't see that one coming did you?This movie is not good. Don't waste your time.".

Leland's thoughts are the same thoughts every high school goth kid has. oh. so much darkness and sadness around me i can't take it. so he stabs a retarded kid? and the Chris Klein character. what? are you really supposed to buy him throwing his life away to avenge his exgirlfriends brother? and don Cheadle. he cheats on his girlfriend. furthermore he IS trying to exploit Leland for his own good. he says in the movie that he is an aspiring writer. there is nothing to suggest that he is doing anything to help Leland. and why does he find Leland fascinating? maybe people only see the good so the bad and the bad so the bad and everything is dark and sad and bad so the good is bad. WOW! that kid is smart! and then there's the part where he goes to new york alone when he was 12 and starts to live with another family. who would let their kid do that? i don't care how detached you are thats ridiculous. the main problem i had with this film is that i just didn't care about anyone. i don't care if don Cheadle gets back together with his girlfriend. he doesn't deserve to. i don't care if Leland's girlfriend is a Junky. i don't care if Chris Klein and his girlfriend split up or if he goes to jail. and most of all i don't care what happens to Leland. and the ending was so predictable. it has been a while since i've seen a movie that has bothered me this much. for whoever sees something in this movie a deeper message or whatever good for you. but i can't stand anything about this movie. its unbelievable how much IMDb edits these comments".

	schema:reviewBody "I noted that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe that this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrect.This is a movie about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenage boy to see sadness in daily life as it lies in wait around every corner in advance of the unfolding of the lives that it impacts. A sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others and who while understanding the difference between right and wrong does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who places himself or herself at the center of that subject's universe with total disregard for the impact that the subject's actions have for those around him or her. One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy  lacks the ability to feel that which others feel and does not correlate changes in the moods of others as the result of that sociopath's actions with those actions. A sociopath CANNOT feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not completely formed. A vital chunk is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath rendering the sociopath immune to talking therapy and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never raise a blip on the radar of the criminal justice system although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wakes.Leland Fitzgerald is no sociopath. He is a person who is blessed or cursed with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that for want of a better metaphor things fall apart. People who fall in love and who kiss and cuddle today turn into pathetic elderly couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's mother a wealthy New York socialite who loves Leland and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in New York City alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12 fades as she explains to him on the last of his visits to New York City that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time that she got a divorce that having one's heart broken happens to everybody and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up. Her eyes still reflect light but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone. This scene  this explanation late is it is in coming  is crucial to understanding why Leland commits a seemingly savage senseless crime killing the retarded younger brother of his exgirlfriend. Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy  a lifetime of unattainable goals of being taught only words that signify danger of never knowing the love of another human being of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person. More than any other character in this movie this little boy personifies everything that Leland sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world. Leland's act  killing this little boy  is for Leland an act of mercy committed because this was the one thing that he COULD do in a world in which actions cannot change outcomes. Whereas a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions Leland does care. What most people view as a barbaric and horrifying act is in Leland's eyes the only decent thing that he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one person.It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions  comforting but incomplete. For in the end blame for Leland's actions lies elsewhere. As is so often the case there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the outraged soul. Why did Leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge  that sometimes  just sometimes  people DO remain in love and that relationships DO succeed and that even the saddest lives ARE transformed? For Leland there is no middle ground no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father  the brilliant writer played by Kevin Spacey  for not being there at critical times during Leland's development but given this man's thuggish nastiness that may have been a blessing.In the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland doomed to view the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity to Leland's character  present for example when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him  that is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic in that it is absolutely genuine notwithstanding the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing that he does can change his fate.This is not sociopathy on display. This is if anything its polar opposite......".

A vital chunk is missing from the psychological and emotional makeup of a true sociopath rendering the sociopath immune to talking therapy and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never raise a blip on the radar of the criminal justice system although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wakes.Leland Fitzgerald is no sociopath. He is a person who is blessed or cursed with the ability to foresee what he considers to be the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees sadness written into the eyes and faces of people around him as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is about loss and that people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that for want of a better metaphor things fall apart. People who fall in love and who kiss and cuddle today turn into pathetic elderly couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's mother a wealthy New York socialite who loves Leland and who invites him into the home that she shares with her family when he arrives in New York City alone and determined to remain in the city at the age of 12 fades as she explains to him on the last of his visits to New York City that she learned that her husband had been cheating on her all the time that she got a divorce that having one's heart broken happens to everybody and that such loss is an inevitable part of growing up. Her eyes still reflect light but the electricity that once illuminated them is gone. This scene  this explanation late is it is in coming  is crucial to understanding why Leland commits a seemingly savage senseless crime killing the retarded younger brother of his exgirlfriend. Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy  a lifetime of unattainable goals of being taught only words that signify danger of never knowing the love of another human being of never feeling such love and of never connecting with another person. More than any other character in this movie this little boy personifies everything that Leland sees as being inevitable and horrifying about the world. Leland's act  killing this little boy  is for Leland an act of mercy committed because this was the one thing that he COULD do in a world in which actions cannot change outcomes. Whereas a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change outcomes but does not care about the harm inflicted on others by those actions Leland does care. What most people view as a barbaric and horrifying act is in Leland's eyes the only decent thing that he can do to alleviate the suffering of just one person.It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions  comforting but incomplete. For in the end blame for Leland's actions lies elsewhere. As is so often the case there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the outraged soul. Why did Leland not learn something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge  that sometimes  just sometimes  people DO remain in love and that relationships DO succeed and that even the saddest lives ARE transformed? For Leland there is no middle ground no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is tempted to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father  the brilliant writer played by Kevin Spacey  for not being there at critical times during Leland's development but given this man's thuggish nastiness that may have been a blessing.In the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland doomed to view the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity to Leland's character  present for example when he repeatedly insists that nobody was to blame for his girlfriend breaking up with him  that is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic in that it is absolutely genuine notwithstanding the heated denunciations of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking in that it is born not so much of understanding as of despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the utter certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing that he does can change his fate.This is not sociopathy on display. This is if anything its polar opposite......";

	schema:headline " Like American Beauty plus Donnie Darko minus the quality";
	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who have never heard of the movie until now of which I presume there are many lucky people who haven't I'll summarise it for you. Ryan Gosling plays the titular character of Leland who also serves as the film's narrator a la Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but without the intelligent observations on life. Leland goes to jail for stabbing a retarded kid to death and the movie attempts to figure out why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy if not mentally absent and is portrayed by Gosling with a complete lack of violence anger or agenda and if you're waiting for him to reveal his sinister side later in the movie don't waste your time it's not that kind of movie. Once in juvenile prison Leland goes to classes taught by Pearl Madison ably portrayed by Don Cheadle who is incapable of anything but quality even when in bad movies. Pearl attempts to unlock the mystery of Leland in an attempt to figure out how such a kid could do such a thing and so he could write a book about it later along with being a juvenile prison teacher Pearl is also an aspiring author.The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving narrative behind the film as their talks unveil Leland's past to the audience. However to call it the central focus would imply that this meandering film had one. It does not. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive cast which seems to be to the detriment of the film. It seems as though writerdirector Matthew Ryan Hodge don't worry that you haven't heard of him he's never done anything had to give EVERY character a personal story arc and personality flaw in order to get the actors to play them. Most of these traits and stories are clichd and most go underdeveloped and unresolved.I'll try and break them down here Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the slain retarded boy I love how the movie kept calling the kid retarded never mentally disabled. That part made me laugh inside they apparently have a cold relationship because all suburban marriages in contemporary cinema must be cold. Their other two kids are Michelle Williams who is apparently an aspiring actress about to attend college and Jena Malone who plays the same troubled teenarchetype she always plays this time with a heroine addiction. Malone was also the girlfriend of Leland which gives him his link to his victim. Williams' boyfriend who was orphaned and came to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any of the other bit players managing to steal the movie at times. Lena Olin is Leland's mother who seems to be perpetually sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey also the executive producer is Leland's cold and absentee father who is a famed novelist. Eventually Sherilyn Fenn will show up to put a wrinkle in Leland's story if you even care at that point. Oh yeah and there's a drugdealing exboyfriend a couple of fellow juvees and a coworker of Pearl's with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with played by Kerry Washington.Sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it seemed meaningless and boring then you've just experienced a bit of what I did during the 108 minutes I spent watching the movie. But the unruly supporting cast of overwrought clichs is the least of this film's crimes. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless. We aren't given a fascinating look into a troubled mind we aren't given an effective explanation we aren't given much of anything. Given that it sucked so much I'm gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it Leland stabbed the retard because all Leland could see in the world was sadness and wanted to spare Corky or whatever the victim's name was the sadness in his eyes. It's like the worst emo band in the world made an album and titled it The World Is Sad So I Killed A Retard. Oh and Leland dies in the end in a sequence so reliant of unbelievable coincidences that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didn't already suck. Of course he dies in the end because that made the movie so deep.I'm giving the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels. But to paraphrase the film itself you have to believe that movies are more than the sum of their parts kiddo.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to contrast Ryan Gosling's brilliant performance as the terrifyingly smart aggressive and articulate Jewish Nazi skinhead Danny Balint in Henry Bean's The Believer' with his characterization of Leland P. Fitzgerald the sweet confused middle class child of detached alienated American whiteness who's murdered an autistic kid in The United States of Leland.' And this is probably the only reason to see this new movie. The roles are polar opposites which must have attracted a young actor as talented and adventurous as Gosling. But the movie is a muddle and so inevitably is Gosling's Leland. The best actor in the world couldn't make sense out of Matthew Ryan Hoge's sappy disorganized writing and unsure direction. This is a movie that never decides where it's going and never develops a pulse. It's ill conceived in a whole list of ways. Leland is in special custody for committing this terrible inexplicable crime  which his fellow inmates consider so evil they call him Devil Boy.' Yet he is portrayed as a young philosopher a mildmannered if potentially lethal Holden Caulfield. The disconnect is never explained. The movie purports to be exploring Leland's motives for the killing but it never finds any.The tension is diffused by telling the story out of order with intercut scenes that build up our knowledge of subsidiary characters like Leland's mean famous writer father Kevin Spacey his mother Lena Olin his girlfriend Becky Jena Malone  his girlfriend's little brother and sister and parents a young guy who lives with them Chris Klein and. . . and. . . Hoge doesn't know where to stop. These subplots weaken all the characterizations not just the central one and they rob the movie of any point. Hoge is so interested in the career and love problems of Leland's prison teacher and wouldbe biographer Pearl Don Cheadle in Leland's nasty remote dad in the dilemma of Chris Klein's character and in Leland's girlfriend's drug issues that the mystery of Leland and his crime never gets plumbed even if Hoge knew how to do that which he doesn't seem to. Is Leland some kind of perverted saint or just a mildmannered psychopath? We never find out. All we know is he has come to look on the world as very sad and that's the best explanation we get for the crime he wanted to save the little boy from sorrow. At one point confused vague flashbacks about trips when Leland was supposed to visit his father in Paris but wound up in New York reveal yet another subplot as he's semiadopted by a well off Manhattan family.This all seems either ludicrous or crazy.  If it strikes you as sensitive and deep maybe you'd better check your own pulse. Autism advocates are up in arms at the suggestion that Leland's killing of an autistic boy might be merciful but this is not a portrait of the autistic boy  who's only glimpsed a few times or of the crime ditto. What's even more reprehensible than the slighting of the boy is the suggestion that murder might be seen merely as an expression of teenage angst. The thinking behind this movie doesn't bear looking into and if you want to demonstrate against every badly written film you're going to be awfully busy. Another interesting contrast is to compare The United States of Leland with Jordan Melamed's Manic' where Don Cheadle plays a very similar role as a psychiatrist dealing with a disturbed youth named Lyle Joseph GordonLevitt who's killed a child in a fit of rage. Manic' depicts in concrete terms where Lyle's rage comes from. We understand the rage is going to be a lifelong problem but that with luck he may learn to tame it. There's no nonsense about the sorrow of the world and there aren't a lot of confusing subplots. Manic in fact may be almost too simple but it fairly bristles with powerful authentic emotion. The story moves forward with intensity and the performances really sing. Gosling doesn't shake our faith in his skill as an actor and Cheadle Klein Spacey and the other principals all do respectable occasionally fine work but they can't compensate for how badly this movie is conceived written and edited.".

	schema:headline " A bad hair day for the middle classes";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite tackling such weighty subjects as murder drug addiction and depression 'United States of Leland' manages to have all the pain of a TV movie about a slight weight fluctuation. The problem does not lay with the excellent cast but with the fact that they don't have anything to do other than look miserable and spout some portentous dialogue now and then.The film is about the travails of the dysfunctional middle class and is aimed squarely at the self same middleclass but this isn't a mirror to reflect their complacency merely a gentle panacea so they can congratulate themselves if they haven't had to deal with this many problems in their lives and nod concernedly as the wonderful Anne Magnuson looks a bit miserable at her son's funeral.Maybe the director wanted everyone to seem as though they were just drifting through life unable to feel a thing but I for one wanted one of the characters to let rip like Kevin Kline at the end of The Ice Storm when all the pain and rage pours out of him in a drunken moment of despair and pain. All the way through the film I was waiting for the bland exterior to be ripped away to reveal the raw beating heart of the movie but this alas is never to happen. Even prison isn't too bad in this film  just an inconvenience which means that the characters can't get to feel the sun of their faces as much as they'd like.

	onyx:emotionText "Despite tackling such weighty subjects as murder drug addiction and depression 'United States of Leland' manages to have all the pain of a TV movie about a slight weight fluctuation. The problem does not lay with the excellent cast but with the fact that they don't have anything to do other than look miserable and spout some portentous dialogue now and then.The film is about the travails of the dysfunctional middle class and is aimed squarely at the self same middleclass but this isn't a mirror to reflect their complacency merely a gentle panacea so they can congratulate themselves if they haven't had to deal with this many problems in their lives and nod concernedly as the wonderful Anne Magnuson looks a bit miserable at her son's funeral.Maybe the director wanted everyone to seem as though they were just drifting through life unable to feel a thing but I for one wanted one of the characters to let rip like Kevin Kline at the end of The Ice Storm when all the pain and rage pours out of him in a drunken moment of despair and pain. All the way through the film I was waiting for the bland exterior to be ripped away to reveal the raw beating heart of the movie but this alas is never to happen. Even prison isn't too bad in this film  just an inconvenience which means that the characters can't get to feel the sun of their faces as much as they'd like. The director never manages to convey that the characters are repressing their feelings nor that they are really suffering they just stoically trudge around in their designer gear looking a bit put upon.The United States of Leland is directed with all the drama of a headache advert  sure Jena Malone's hair goes a bit lank and stringy every time she has some heroin but that little fashion crisis is about as much insight into her suffering as we ever get.

I love this movie because it examines life the way I examine it myself. The question about God and the Devil it was dead on with what some people really experience in life. Is there a God is there a Devil? People do like the idea of the Devil because it gives them a reason for why they did something bad. The Devil made them do it or they were tempted or something else. God exists to redeem them after their inevitable mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes everybody does something wrong but everybody at one point or another will use an excuse and not blame it on somebody else and not even blame it on the Devil they blame it on being human. People do only say that after they do something bad. It's their excuse for messing up for making a wrong choice. People do mess up but sometimes it's because they want to. Pearl is a perfect example of this in the movie. He can use the excuse that he is human all he wants but the truth is he did what he did because he wanted to. Leland is the only character who makes no excuses and that is what I love about him. He is so different from anybody else in the movie. This movie questions life love and people. It makes you think. It's the best movie I have ever seen because it has stayed with me. I can never forget some lines from the movie or the overall message I got from it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0 I wasn't really expecting much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like The Devil's Rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed Satanic horror films. I couldn't' have been more wrong. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast I really enjoyed. Speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s. The Brotherhood of Satan doesn't beat you over the head with plot points and explanations. A lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks. As a viewer you know something is amiss but for the longest period you're just not sure what it is. The unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films. The ending is effective with its surreal imagery. I sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll. Those wanting a big slambang finale will be disappointed with the ending's simplicity. A lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would most likely have failed miserably.There are moments in the film where it's easy to forget the director Bernard McEveety had primarily worked in television before The Brotherhood of Satan. There are a few scenes that are so well setup lit and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two. For example I've seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors. Not here. The scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff's office is amazing. We see all five men at once  each doing their own thing as in real life. In a lesser film we might see all the men at once but each would be motionless quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue. It's a small scene but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it's one of my favorite moments of The Brotherhood of Satan.Finally I mentioned the acting in my opening so without going into a longwinded speech I'll just say that The Brotherhood of Satan features Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones. Any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me.".

	onyx:emotionText "Every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0 I wasn't really expecting much with The Brotherhood of Satan. I hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like The Devil's Rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed Satanic horror films. I couldn't' have been more wrong. What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast I really enjoyed. Speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the film's style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s.

Strother Martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars Martins good friend L.Q. Jones and Green Acres Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore helped produce this film as well. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and Enter the Dragon beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at! Film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and I really liked the way the film ends. Great atmosphere interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. Martins performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of Doc.

It has plenty of disturbing moments and the film really shocked me at times plus it's extremely well made on a low budget!. This is one creepy underrated gem with chilling performances and a fantastic finale! i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Bernard McEveety does a very good job here with great camera work creating a lot of creepy atmosphere and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. Ther is a little bit of blood and gore.

On the back of the pack it read in so many words....plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows you are saved.....but if a red flower grows you are doomed!!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven year old kid I did not plant the seeds for fear of what may pop up. Here is the spoiler As the movie starts out you see a small toy tank moving about in the dirt. On a small road a family is leaving town and suddenly the camera turns to the tank again and it is full size. It rolls over the car and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage then just as sudden the tank is small again.The reason this movie stuck with me for that long was because I had a exact toy tank as the one in the movie!!!! Unfortunately I don't know what happened to it but I did keep a wary eye on that thing ever since!!!Turn out the lights put in the DVD make a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good!!!".

	schema:headline " THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan Bernard McEveety 1971 ";
	schema:reviewBody "I had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition however I kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive pricetag and utter lack of relevant supplements. When it went outofprint earlier this year I finally gave in  but the entire order which included a number of other highlydesirable titles got lost in transit! luckily the DVD has been reissued at bargainprice  and I'm sure glad I picked it up! Anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding smalltown atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goingson. A small cast responds perfectly to a terse absorbing and intelligent script lead Strother Martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctorhead of the witch's coven L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore both of whom also produced the film! offer solid support as the nononsense sheriff and his comicstrip aficionado assistant.The plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in Luis Bunuel's sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962! the 'possessed children' angle was borrowed perhaps from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED 1960 there have been many films  especially of a recent vintage  where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown from THE CITY OF THE DEAD 1960 to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modernday America albeit in remote surroundings and revolve around elderly witches seeking a 'renaissance' the film they recall most of all is ROSEMARY'S BABY 1968.The occult scenes accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishlydecorated house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matteroffact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective  particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car! the rampage of a devildoll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an undeniable frisson a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they can't be buried! a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven a beheading committed by a horseriding medieval knight! and the lengthy 'black mass' finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over' all dressed in red  except for a blackclad Martin presiding over the ceremony which culminates in ritual mass suicide! The film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain' it's so refreshing to come across a title albeit a lowbudget production from a major Hollywood studio Columbia that contrives to go so completely against the grain like I said the film is quite weird  extending also to the editing and the score! It's odd too that such a classy  and cinematic  horror offering sic should come from a TV director most often associated with Westerns and other family fare! By the way the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth Christopher LeePeter Cushing collaboration NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT 1972 which Lee produced himself!  a film I foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local TV and which has been M.I.A. ever since!!

	onyx:emotionText "I had been interested in this film for a long time especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition however I kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive pricetag and utter lack of relevant supplements. When it went outofprint earlier this year I finally gave in  but the entire order which included a number of other highlydesirable titles got lost in transit! luckily the DVD has been reissued at bargainprice  and I'm sure glad I picked it up! Anyway this is one strange film and a genuine sleeper initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding smalltown atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goingson. A small cast responds perfectly to a terse absorbing and intelligent script lead Strother Martin in particular makes the dialogue sound better than it actually is with his nuanced performance as the town doctorhead of the witch's coven L.Q. Jones and Alvy Moore both of whom also produced the film! offer solid support as the nononsense sheriff and his comicstrip aficionado assistant.The plot merges elements of various earlier films dealing with witchcraft and the supernatural and not only the obvious titles the fact that the town is held under a spell which can't at first be identified for instance brings instantly to mind the similar affliction of one specific bourgeois household in Luis Bunuel's sublimely surreal THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL 1962! the 'possessed children' angle was borrowed perhaps from VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED 1960 there have been many films  especially of a recent vintage  where the satanic rites of a witches' coven are shown from THE CITY OF THE DEAD 1960 to THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968 but since the proceedings take place in modernday America albeit in remote surroundings and revolve around elderly witches seeking a 'renaissance' the film they recall most of all is ROSEMARY'S BABY 1968.The occult scenes accentuated as much by foggy exteriors as by the shadowy lighting of the garishlydecorated house where the diabolical events take place are presented in a completely matteroffact way as to make them unsettling and extremely effective  particularly the opening sequence involving an army tank crushing a car! the rampage of a devildoll a concept which has been done to death over the years but here it raises an undeniable frisson a surreal dream sequence set inside the ice chamber where all the victims are kept since they can't be buried! a sequence where the witches attack a doubting member of the coven a beheading committed by a horseriding medieval knight! and the lengthy 'black mass' finale with the witches accompanied by the respective child they will be 'taking over' all dressed in red  except for a blackclad Martin presiding over the ceremony which culminates in ritual mass suicide! The film also has the guts to deliver a downbeat 'curtain' it's so refreshing to come across a title albeit a lowbudget production from a major Hollywood studio Columbia that contrives to go so completely against the grain like I said the film is quite weird  extending also to the editing and the score! It's odd too that such a classy  and cinematic  horror offering sic should come from a TV director most often associated with Westerns and other family fare! By the way the same theme was dealt with almost contemporaneously in the nth Christopher LeePeter Cushing collaboration NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT 1972 which Lee produced himself!  a film I foolishly missed out on some 20 years back when it was shown on local TV and which has been M.I.A. ever since!! P.S. This review of THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan will certainly contain spoilers but then the synopsis and artwork featured on the DVD cover manage to give everything away anyway!";

Right from the indescribably bizarre intro showing a couple of eerie children turning toys into reallife war machinery you just know this become an uncompromising and gritty shocker. Brotherhood of Satan soon appears to be another installment in the alleged  unofficial creepy little town hiding a dark secret sub genre. A young widower traveling with his new yummy girlfriend and 8yearold daughter stops in a remote little town to report a car accident they witnessed on a nearby highway. The villagers behave very hostile and insist the visitors on leaving right away. The town clearly bathes in an ambiance of fear and panic as local children vanish inexplicably vanished and unnatural forces maintain everyone within the boundaries of town. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult apparently ruled by the elderly members of the community. I really liked Brotherhood of Satan a lot. The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul but I can't remember the title. It also dealt with a cult of elderly people abusing youthful villagers for their own greedy merits. The film mainly relies on creepy scenery like dolls and witchcraft relics but a slightly more involving and coherent screenplay would have been nice. The subject matter often raises a lot of issues and questions and director Bernard McEveety can't always provide us with answers. The climax is terrific very seventies meaning shocking and unforgettable. Beautifully shot film too.".

	schema:reviewBody "For some reason in the 1970's it seemed to be a requirement for every former cast member of The Wild Bunch to appear in a lowbudget satanicthemed horror movie. You had Ernest Borgnine in the ridiculous Devil's Rain Warren Oates in the underrated Race with the Devil and of course William Holden in the the overblown sequel Damien Omen II. The weirdest one though was probably this one which features both Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones Jones who would later write and direct the cult classic A Boy and his Dog also contributed to the screen play.It starts out promisingly enough with an entire family somehow being compacted in their car all except for the young son who wanders off and runs into a strange group of other children. For awhile it is unclear whether this movie is ripping off Village of the Damned or Rosemary's Baby as you have this group of orphaned and kidnapped children wandering around after their parents have been done by a bizarre murder spree AND you have a coven of decrepit oldsters led by Strother What we have here is failure to commun'cate Martin. The main protagonists are a goodlooking but bland couple and their young daughter who are only passing through town but become involved in the weird goings after they discover the remains of the compacted family. Jones plays the good guy sheriff and Martin has a second role as the seemingly kindly town doctor. The satanic scenes are very weird with a lot of freaky shots of children's dolls and people violently convulsing and dropping dead. The pretty blonde wife also has a Rosemary's Baby style hallucinatory dream that is like Coffin Joe on particularly bad acid. The end finally ties everything together sort of but this remains one of those 70's movies that is a lot longer on style than on logic. Still I guess I'd recommend it if you go for these sort of films at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "If it's not already considered something of a cult classic then The Brotherhood of Satan certainly should be. It's one of a few interesting genre items produced by actors L. Q. Jones and Alvy Moore the others are The Witchmaker and the justly famous A Boy and His Dog. Joined by director Bernard McEveety a veteran of mostly TV cinematographer John Arthur Morrill Kingdom of the Spiders and other talents they're wise to concentrate mainly on an escalating sense of danger. In fact the whole film has a memorable atmosphere of weirdness not to mention some effective imagery.Its opening is one of the most memorable things about it as the filmmakers switch between shots of a toy tank and a real one as it crushes a car beneath it. This leads us into a story written by William Welch with story credit given to Sean MacGregor director of Devil Times Five about vacationers Ben Charles Bateman his girlfriend Nicky luscious Ahna Capri and K. T. Geri Reischl Bens' daughter from a previous marriage. They come upon a small town whose citizens are scared silly. It seems that no one can enter save for Ben  company and no one can leave. Adults are dying and kids are disappearing. The frustrated sheriff Jones doesn't understand what's going on and it's driving him crazy.This is creepy from the start and gets under the skin due to a deliberate pace and some deeply committed performances from bit players as well as main cast members. Jones and Moore are great value as always and Charles Robinson not to be confused with the actor from 'Night Court' is good as the priest who comes to figure things out. Strother Martin is wonderful as the cheerful Doc Duncan who's hiding a LOT from some of his fellow citizens. There's also a very fine music score by the under rated Jaime MendozaNava The Town That Dreaded Sundown '77. The nightmare sequence in the latter half of the picture is stylishly done. And there's one noteworthy scene where a member of the coven Helene Winston is confronted for going against the ways of their Dark Lord.Horror buffs should give this one a try if they're not already aware of it. It just makes this viewer more impressed with Jones and Moore that they gave genre fare a go during this period.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Brotherhood of Satan is a singularly creepy movie. I'm surprised I haven't heard more about it. The opening sets the tone. A toy tank clicks and spins. A car is crushed flat by a very real tank the family inside screaming. The two are cut together no explanation provided. After the car is reduced to burning wreckage a little boy in a cowboy hat calmly walks away soon joined by a group of other quiet children. There is no music and the whole sequence is shot in either extreme closeups or wide long shots. The effect is deeply creepy.Brotherhood of Satan is actually packed with spooky imagery like that. A little girl is awoken by her baby doll. Downstairs her father reads solemnly from the Bible unaware that his wife is having silent seizurelike spasm right next to him. On its own accord the doll enters the room. It doesn't spring to life and attack the man. Instead the toy simply stares him down shaking with glee the man bleeding from the mouth. After the parents are dead the little girl joins a group of other children walking off into the foggy night. The doll cries a murky tear.The movie is disinterested in plot. There is a story. A stoutchinned man his girlfriend and eight year old daughter are on a road trip. While stopping through the town of Hillsboro California they are attacked by crazed locals. After escaping their car breaks down outside the town forcing the three to return. Over a nightmarish pace we are made privy to a plot by the town's devilworshipping elderly to kidnap children sell their souls to Satan and take up residence in the now lifeless young bodies. The dad and town priest realize this slowly unaware that the kindly old doctor is the ringleader of the cult. The story is purely functionary and the film outright ignores it at times focusing instead on eerie imagery. Like a man decapitated in shadow by the sudden a blackclad rider. A child's birthday party cut together with pictures of dismembered bodies. The red face of a painted devil appearing slowly over a man reading a book. So on and so forth.The satanic lodge reminds me of Suspiria with its checkered floors and The Masque of the Red Death with the way the camera glides through the '70s pukegreen painted walls. The movie is largely without music. Actually there might not be any music before the fiftyfive minute mark. The direction is frequently intentionally askew creating an otherworldly feeling. There's even a sick sense of humor when an elderly couple enter the lodge pledge allegiance to Satan and then chitchat and tell jokes like this is an afterchurch bingo party.Like many of the Satanic cult films that followed and Rosemary's Baby before it The Brotherhood of Satan has a downbeat ending. Character actor Strother Martin screams madly about the devil while his cultists are stabbed to death by blackrobed men with flaming swords. Evil triumphs and good arrives too late to stop it. It's hard to decide if the loose plotting was intentional. Either way the film sustains a freaky atmosphere of seventies dread and packs a visual wallop.".

There is a PostSixties Drug hangover that lingers here and it is quite unsettling.The ending is shocking as is some of the hallucinatory dreamlike imagery and the indoor ritual Scenes have a setting of plasticism and play as a Children's demented Clubhouse. This is an underrated undiscovered and ultimately quite the quirk that helped issue in the Screen's Satanic Seventies.".

There is a PostSixties Drug hangover that lingers here and it is quite unsettling.The ending is shocking as is some of the hallucinatory dreamlike imagery and the indoor ritual Scenes have a setting of plasticism and play as a Children's demented Clubhouse. This is an underrated undiscovered and ultimately quite the quirk that helped issue in the Screen's Satanic Seventies.";

Even those who think of it as a classic will agree that it takes a long time for anything significant to happen. However for those with a metaphysical bent once the film gets moving it resonates at a very deep level of the psyche.Someone raised in a mystical or semimystical religion taught doctrines of transubstantiation resurrection of the body the power of prayer the importance of surrender to the almighty and the necessity of worship will find striking parallels here though the object of adoration is the Powerful Evil One. God needs the Devil good needs evil life needs death the old need the young in a dualistic world. When attraction is balanced by repulsion in the mind of the viewer the effect is powerful. Strother Martin in the role of doctor and devil's surrogate is superb.The use of toys and dolls to symbolize elements that exist on different levels of size or importance is ingenious. This multidimensionality suggests to our subconscious mind that nothing is just what it appears to be. In science fiction and horror this powerful tool stimulates the imagination.

Martin especially chews the scenery in his role. I can't explain exactly why I sort of like this movie but it did work on me. It's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore.

The town's children have been disappearing families have been butchered wholesale and in the blink of an eye Bateman's daughter vanishes too... Although the Maltin book claims that this is a horrifying little terror tale I didn't find it overly chilling. This is the kind of film that almost demands a second viewing during the first you won't know what the uh hell is going on for the first 23 of the picture. Scenes seem to peter out without making their point. While a repeat viewing does clear up some of the confusion many questions remain unanswered. Can anyone explain to me for example that little dolly that suddenly begins to cry? Strother Martin as the coven leader overacts shamelessly and it works somehow. But as geriatric covens go while the one here IS a tad creepier than the one shown in the Joan Fontaine film The Witches 1966 it cannot top the one led by Sidney Blackmer in the shuddery Rosemary's Baby 1968 and most viewers I think will be left with the feeling that this film could have been so much more.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it the first day of its first run release at the Chicago Theater in Chicago in 1952. 'Bwana Devil' was the brainchild of radio director Arch Oboler.  best known for the radio and early live TV series 'Lights Out'. Oboler's brotherinlaw was Milton Gunzburg. Gunzburg was I believe the optician who connected the use of Polaroid lenses to the making of stereoscopic films. In 1952 television was stomping out movies and movie theaters the way rogue elephants could destroy villages. Hollywood was searching for any gimmick it could use to bring people back to the theaters. Cinerama a cumbersome early widescreen process had come on the scene. It produced an 3D like effect. That opened the door for Gunzberg and his brotherinlaw. They called their process Naturalvision raised some money to demonstrate the process and produced 'Bwana Devil'.While the story and production values took a back seat to the illusion of depth the picture was a hit. It was quickly followed by 'House of Wax' and others. Most producers opted to exploit the stereoscopic effects rather than make good movies. 'House of Wax' was one of the rare exceptions. After about a year audiences tired of the shoddy productions and Naturalvision eventually disappeared. Into the void Fox introduced CinemaScope a flat widescreen process and helped stem the sinking theater system.I imagine seeing 'Bwana Devil' in flat projection would be painful. But for those of us who saw it with pristine prints and quality projection it was something to behold. Lions leaping off the screen into our laps was something few of us would forget.It has taken another fifty years for 3D to return. Today's producers seem not to be making the same mistake as those in the early fifties. I hope so. After all 3D is so much more fun than flat.".

This tale of a Great White Hunter hired by the English railroad companyto hunt down and kill two lions that are killing off workers is slow to start but the 3D action picks up later with many shots of spears being thrown at the screen oncoming trains heading stright for the camera and of course leaping lions jumping from the screen.  This movie can still be screen on television in 2D of course and is interesting to see the shots that had audiences jumping in their seats back in 1952.".

The film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore but I went to see it for the 3D process. It had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the Post theater.The film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3D films.I don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but you've been warned if it is. In many films of the time actors would often work in front of a rear projection screen where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage. This works well on regular films but when seen in 3D they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it didn't work well in the theaters. If seen in 3D it will constitute another disappointment.The film's only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind.".

I had read no reviews nor had I talked to anyone who had seen it. Believe me I will never make that mistake again. It was being touted I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process. That was what enticed me to make a 170 mile round trip.There was a waiting line two abreast that stretched I kid you not 2 or 2 blocks long and moving very slowly. I could hardy wait to be seated. If I had only known at that moment what I soon would know I could have been  of the way back to Youngstown by the time the feature started.By the time the first 3D scene was shown I was already nodding off. The novelty quickly wore thin and from then on it was pure agony.Without going into excruciating detail I can only offer the following advice.  If you have ever seen the famous film PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE supposedly the worst movie ever filmed it in my humble opinion stands head and shoulders above this garbage.I don't know if this has ever been shown on tv if it has I don't know why. If you ever get a chance to see it do something else.  Take a walk cut the grass wash the dog have someone flog you with a rubber hose.  ANYTHING. Your time will have been better spent.This has been my first movie review.  It might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and I wouldn't make book that will happen.Bill".

The HUGE plus is that this film was made mostly in Africa and looks so much better than the tons of schlocky African films of the 1930s50s.The story is a dramatization of a real story of a couple maneating lions and the man who ultimately killed them. It's the same story you'll see in the newer and better Ghost and the Darknessso my advice is see this film instead.

	schema:reviewBody "The first film shot in 3D finds an inebriated Robert Stack pining away for his fianc and trying to get a railway constructed in the heart of Africa at the turn of the last century. He's in British Equatorial Africa which later became Kenya colony and where the Sahara meets the veld. What's stopping the progress of the colonial British dream of a railway from Capetown to Cairo is a pair of lions.These two lions have the natives scared out of their wits. Lions are not known to attack humans you leave them alone and they'll leave you alone unless they're hungry. But these two a male and female have developed a real taste for human flesh. Showing no fear of man or anything man made they attack humans indiscriminately at will. No one wants to work until this lion problem is solved.Stack's got both a lion problem and an unsatisfied testosterone problem. The second is remedied by the arrival of Barbara Britton no one it seems can deal with the first.Bwana Devil was shot in Africa and it's writer Arch Oboler owes a lot to Moby Dick. These two lions and Stack's obsession with them are taken from the Herman Melville classic. Good thing Barbara Britton arrived when she did she provides something Captain Ahab didn't have.Best scene in the film and it's almost laughable was when these three white hunters best in their line of work are imported by the railroad to kill these lions. So what do the lions do but actually enter the private railroad car where the hunters are hoisting a few with Nigel Bruce who plays Stack's sidekick and a doctor and proceed to kill them all and carry the cadavers off for a later snack. Presumably based on a true story according to the credits don't you believe it. The 3D jungle scenes are nice but it's attached to one ridiculous story.".

In this movie Africa had automagically become the lessdark ergo more acceptable India! I wonder how the previous reviewers missed this salient feature. Hm.What is there to recommend this movie? Well perhaps as an example of bad acting writing plot special effects production values... It is a relic of what killed the movie industry in the 1950's and 1960's.Hint. It was not television.".

While mencia talks about black people not being able to swim yawn Chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist. You don't have to be scathing to be edgy. You have to be original. Mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities.

His main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word beaner as many times as he possible can. I have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on IMDb before but I really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes. It is obvious right down to the rip of Chapelle's intro blues guys vs. mariachi band. However Mencia has absolutely no attitude and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time. Instead he sticks to a small number of hardlyshocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes jokes about immigration. Every once in a while he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else like middle eastern cultures. These jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture and perhaps some incredibly old topics such as 911 in a watered down standup style while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style. I think he's too afraid of really offending anyone so it just makes the viewer feel awkward. He also beats jokes to death. If you've ever seen Why the f is this news? you'll know what I'm talking about. It's funny at first but he just rambles on and on and becomes Captain Obvious at some point.

I love to hear the raw thoughts of the standup on stage as they are appealing to an audience of their peers different life experiences they have had or things they have thought up or seen that they just thought were so ing stupid that they had to share it with someone. There used to be standups who took on a persona that everyone could relate to Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind or were just so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others Richard Pryor. And then there were the thoughtprovoking comics like George Carlin who despite pretending to be a loon was the smartest guy in the room who appealed to people to rethink things they saw when they walked around and realize just how screwed up things were and how easily they could change things.Now this might seem to not have anything to do with Mind Of Mencia which as I agree with most commentators here is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of Chappelle's Show but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing standup bits for his audience sometimes on popular topics most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of standups. He makes a stage character an everyday Mexican named Carlos who despite stereotypes is just your runofthemill normal guy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others people he calls racist or just those that disagree with his opinion. And then finally he presents skits to the studio audience and the viewer telling them that it will help them see his point of view.Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a point of view that people don't see yet what he is really doing is not only promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about to death but he stupidly encourages people to hear them and do the one thing that helps keep them aroundlaugh.Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest yet easiest way to get laughs in standup. The best comedians which I fear Carlos Mencia feels he is in good company with don't have to resort to them. They talk universally and ask you to laugh AT absurdity rather than with it like Mencia encourages. As he creates more skits or reallife situations that call for racism or the bashing of others with the use of it he tells us rather than asks us to laugh and actually presents these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes of it. His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia doesn't give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take from it what we want something that as much as I hate to compare the two was Chappelle's Show's finest quality he tells us exactly how we should view it and react to itwhich according to him is to make a stupid face and say Dee Dee Dee! This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about The Mind of Mencia. It's Mencia's mind through and through and as such is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailormade to give life lessons to its core audience 1424 year olds about how stereotypes are bad but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia and therefore should be alright to you!".

Firstly his birth name is Ned Holness and was known that until he was 18 when he switched his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras though he acts like he's from Mexico. He grew up in the United States as well.I might be able to forgive all that crap but...He's been caught stealing other peoples material. Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. The Stereotype Olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of DJ's from Miami. He has stolen jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole George Lopez's material in his own HBO special 13 minutes of it.He thinks what he's doing is so original but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot amoung others.This show will crash and burn. The word Beaner can't last that long before it gets old. He hasn't done anything new since the first episode.Wanna hear a joke? A Beaner jumping a fence!! That's funny for 3 Seasons! Not.Awful.".

Helmed by controversial director Michael Moore the show would begin in the exact same manor as this show with Moore interacting with the audience and introducing segments namely short documentaries and skits which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues. The difference? Mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary. What he says and does is often pandering and rude and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. There's a difference between being edgy which I have no problem with but Mencia tries too hard to accomplish this and ends up coming off as arrogant and with little backing. He does however make points occasionally but often in order to get to them one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor.".

What's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming or gay guy named Sparkles that wins a banana eating contest? Neither of these concepts is particularly novel insightful or amusing. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode? That movie came out like 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw a few beaners in there and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money. Pure comedic genius.Then he blatantly ripped off Jeff Foxworthy on a second show I watched with a Your gay if... bit. You could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a RyanSeacrestisgay joke. It's not like either of those has already been done to death.Unless you're a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer movies please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful.".

In reality Mencia is a sycophantic idiot who likes throwing out lines to get people to applaud and somehow mistakes that for his comedic skill. Instead of making genuinely funny and revealing facts about American life he simply reinforces the bigotry of his audience and by doing so approves of it. It plays into the whole 'if they're laughing it's not offensive' mentality that seems to be everywhere today and in vogue. Mencia likes to think his 'brutal honesty' is breaking down the walls of what he thinks political correctness is. The sad reality is that he's not stopping anything but encouraging it to go on. The only thing he seems to genuinely care about is getting approval from the audience to continue playacting for them. As an entertainer and performer he comes off as pathetic because he's not there to entertain but to gain some selfesteem which will never last. And compared to the far superior Dave Chappelle's illfated show Mencia comes off as being incredibly substandard pathetic and a cheap knockoff. One gets the feeling that Mencia would do anything in the world to a Comedy Central executive just to get a camera on him.His reliance on racial slurs is also very interesting. Given the name 'Carlos Mencia' is a false one and he's presumably not Mexican his attempts to fit into the MexicanChicano mold in order to make fun of it provides the basic hypocrisy of both him and his show. It seems he's trying to market his show on some kind of acceptance that relies heavily on ignorance broadly proclaiming everybody accept themselves while bashing down people who break from the norm while pretending that this schism of logic is a completely normal thing. But how can one accept everything and then bash it down? The only conclusion is that Mencia is a classic example of a bully he bashes down to build himself up through his show which reinforces his esteem to continue with this. And while bullying can be done to humorous effect see Bill Murray it also reflects on the bully itself. Mencia doesn't have the chops for this selfreflection. Given how the show is an example of his already poor selfimage what you get is a cheap Chappelle knockoff without the social commentary and is just meaner than the applause would have you suspect.In short it's easy to slam any criticism of Mencia's show and label those who do as racist. The reality however is that Mencia's show is inherently racist without any insight which is the true sum of any comedy endeavor of this nature. Furthermore it showcases its host in a very poor light and shows him not to be a comedian as much as a person who needs more selfreflection to see what exactly he's putting out. Perhaps he could be a better comedian but he just comes out as being a very sad and bitter individual who wants to bring the world down to his level.".

And what suddenly has made Carlos Mencia this huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning  Dave Chappelle cancels his show which became UNEXPECTEDLY popular and controversial and Comedy Central is looking around for someone new to push. They hire this guy named Ned who claims to be a Mexican even though he isn't. They splatter his face on a few TV ads and make it look like they're being daring by unleashing him upon the public.I've seen a lot of hateful topics on the forums for this show and I don't agree with Mencia's detractors. This is not an awful show. It had me crying in laughter a few times. When it's funny it's very very funny. Yes it's juvenile  but so was Chappelle's.The problem with Carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over. And he's too obvious. The overt marketing put aside Carlos has now said beaner so many times I have lost count. He's trying to make it the next famous line like I'm Rick James b! but it's way too obvious.In terms of repeating himself Carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over. For example on one episode he said he'd love it if all Mexicans disappeared from America overnight. He'd wake up and an American guy would be saying Room ser'vuce! in a southern accent.He used this exact same joke  verbatim  when he appeared as a guest on Adam Carolla's talk show. It was a great deal less funny the second time around because he seemed more desperate.Is Carlos funny? I think so. There are some outrageous moments on his show. But he focuses too much on TRYING to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress. Repeating silly little catchphrases over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fast...I just hope Carlos  or his writers  can give a new edge to this show because right now it's starting to dwindle in repeat hell.".

They got a minority marked him controversial and then gave him his own stand upsketch show. The only difference though was that Chappelle's Show was funny. I laugh at the fact that he thinks he is offensive he fails miserably. He stole Lewis Black's delivery but he can't even do that right because he just ends up screaming the punchline like an idiot.

Dee dee dee for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase I've ever heard. It lacks any creativity at all and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dimwitted on Mencia's part.Though every one compares this fool to Chappelle their is no contest. First off they had very very different shows. I think all in all Menica's show on average had only about 2 short 5 minute skits in between his 10 minute rants about god knows what. Chappelles show came off more as sketch comedy with 24 skits that occupied all the show. All chappelle did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that he talks about on his standup specials would be a beneficial idea? Does anybody really want to listen to a bit George Lopez pioneered years before Mencia but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead? Snowflake's chance in Hell.My point is even though most people hate this guy for his rascism I just cant stand him for his imcompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority they could brand as controversial and then leave him to follow Chappelles path. The problem is this guy made it very clear he doesn't want to be Chappelle. So instead he conducts his crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground. Does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday I know sure as hell I don't.I cant express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot's show is done. Personally after watching his standup I don't know how he got his own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan Zach Galifinakis etc...

I told myself maybe he isn't THAT bad.. But no he is. I completely zone out when I watched his show. I tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but I couldn't. I zoned out again I think I was thinking of something more interesting like remaking my bed vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it the show was over. Yeah it's that bad.Here's my final thought  There's so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour. Don't watch a show that tries to shove racism in your face in vain. I can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it.".

The truth is Comedy Central was in need of a replacement Chappelle's Show and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss Dave so much they'll cling to any minority variety show or are satisfied with the plain Mexicans love tacos jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels in every week.

However if you are indeed out there I ask only that you never enter into my housing district and read these major differences between Carlos and Chappelle's Show 1 Dave was funny. You may want to highlight this one. 2 Chappelle's Show was FIVE TIMES as edgy as Mencia could ever hope to be. Yet every time a promo for his little show airs it's all about him tooting his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before. You've got that right Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny. We all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves.3 Chappelle actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures things that some people didn't know about. Like his I know black people game segment. The grand prize was some hair cream that black people use. That's deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive. So how dare he call himself edgy? If Mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and koolaid. And my accusations have some merit. I saw a promo for his show which I have affectionately come to call 'My T.V. Monitor Taking A St For Thirty Minutes' a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept. Then I saw that the Mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize. That's it?! That's as close to the fire as you wanna get? Who COULDN'T think of that back in 7th grade? For you fans of the show if you're ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how DuhDeDurr never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway green card tacos border jumpers lawn mowers and of course duhdedur. Just rememberwhichever it was it was screamed. Enjoy!4 Kind of relating to number two. Every time he says something that gets a laugh he'll pause to tell people while laughing at his own joke that he thinks he went too far with that last one. Then don't say it for God's sake. Or let the people decide by themselves. He and Comedy Central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that he's this tellitlikeitis show that is more controversial than The Da Vinci Code. You're not. You never will be. I've never been offended by the show's content. I would never give it that much credit. I'm offended that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. Yeah...

	schema:reviewBody "Thats right I can't watch Comedy Central anymore just because I can't bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show. I'll tell you the truth this is a terrible show not because I'm offended by it but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I have ever seen. I rather watch Carrot Top do a George Bush impression than watch this noskill hack. And to believe he calls himself the greatest. Even if he didn't steal the jokes he is still bad at telling them he's way offtiming and unoriginal. I remember in one joke he said Why do white people go camping? to pretend there poor for a week?

I'll tell you the truth this is a terrible show not because I'm offended by it but because Carlos Mencia is one of the worst comedians I have ever seen. I rather watch Carrot Top do a George Bush impression than watch this noskill hack. And to believe he calls himself the greatest. Even if he didn't steal the jokes he is still bad at telling them he's way offtiming and unoriginal. I remember in one joke he said Why do white people go camping? to pretend there poor for a week?

Carlos Mencia never heard of him but I find some of his jokes funny and why not because they all carry some hint of truth in them.Yes he makes a lot of white jokes but then again so do Chappelle Eddie Murphy Tommy Davidson and other comedians. One thing that Mencia does do well in my opinion is show the racist country that we still live in. Like for example his opening skit of the show I watched had him as a Mexican astronaut but before he was picking up illegals in a truck asking for tile help. lol Well lo and behold when he is on a spaceship as an astronaut what does he do? Yes put it right on the wall. It's extremely funny because it shows how the white society still practices racism on minorities including Latino people of which I am and can verify with many experiences. In this scenario Mencia's joke while being politically incorrect drives it home that even our country brags about everyone being free and everyone has an equal opportunity to go far deep down that's a bunch of crap because people are still being discriminated even in 2005.Other skits that I liked were a couple of skits involving dogs  yes anime humor is old but it works.He also tells jokes to the audiences this also does foreplay on the audiences as Mencia pushes the envelope of good taste but again he battles and makes fun of issues that that do arouse laughs.For instance the significance of slutty tattoos on women which seek only to attract the unwanted attention of disgusting men and pigs. This tattoo on my lower side is to hold a drink Mencia says making fun of the whole issue and he's right because what he's trying to say which people who are too busy bashing the show miss is why get a tattoo in the first place and then bitch later about it? Simple.True he does get into his audience and this is something he definitely must tone down but for the critics who say he ain't as good as Chappelle please Chappelle is a joke doing jokes that have been done before him. The Rick James jokes for examples have been done many times on In Living Color with Keenen Ivory Wayans before little Dave came along.Anyhow this is a somewhat funny and I would recommend it if you need a quick laugh or two and for those who don't like it just don't watch it simple.".

	schema:headline " Okay Cooper Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper masquerades as a lanky fishoutofwater U.S. Marshal dressed in a stovepipe hat and a fancy frock coat in Along Came Jones director Stuart Heisler's tongueincheek western Dallas that depicts our protagonist's efforts to track down the filthy lowdown varmints that torched his Georgia plantation and killed his wife and son. Raymond Massey Steve Cochran and Zon Murray are suitably cast as the dastards that destroy our leading man's life and turned him into a hunted man with a price on his head. Warner Brothers released this postCivil War oater in December 1950 before High Noon came out in 1952. Although this Technicolor horse opera lacks the brooding gravity of High Noon Dallas qualifies as respectable lightweight horse opera that offers enough thrills and frills to keep Cooper fans and western fanatics occupied during its brisk 94 minutes. An interracial romance between our former Confederate officer and a beautiful Mexican senorita highlights the narrative about the lawless days that followed the end of the Civil War in Texas.Colorado Territory scenarist John Twist enlivens this routine shoot'em up with some flavorful dialogue. The scene in the stagecoach when a former unreconstructed Confederate trades places with a woman who champions the cause of the carpetbaggers benefits from the spicy dialogue. Massey makes a good conniving villain but his plans unravel because he cannot control his triggerhappy siblings. Moreover Cooper outsmarts him at every turn. Most of what transpires in this western is thoroughly unbelievable. The famous frontier lawman Wild Bill Hickok puts in an appearance during the first quarterhour. The romance between Gary Cooper and Ruth Roman generates only minimal sparks. The funniest scene occurs before a gunfight when Cooper spooks one of the villains by stepping on a cat's tail. Of course Heisler doesn't show Cooper squashing the cat's tail. Anyway the feline cuts loose with an eldritch screech that flushes the villain step out in the open to blast away at our hero. Predictably Cooper drops the bad guy in his tracks. King Kongcomposer Max Steiner's score incorporates a great deal of traditional Warner Brothers' soundtracks.Dallas opens with the villainous Marlow family rustling the cattle of Mexican rancher Don Felipe RoblesAntonio Moreno of Seven Sinnersbut Bryant Marlow Steve Cochran of White Heatdoesn't understand how stealing Robles' steers will help his older brother Will Marlow Raymond Massey of Desperate Journey get the money back that he has loaned Don Felipe. I don't buy mortgages to get paid back. I buy them to foreclose. Will assures Bryant and Cullen Zon Murray of Hurricane Island that the black soil of Dallas County will make them wealthy. Will reminds them that they have to restrain their use of violence so his evil plans can succeed. There'll be no killing here Will dictates. Things won't be like they were in Georgia. Bryant and Cullen out as Don Felipe and his son Luis Gil Donaldson of Treasure of the Golden Condor ride up. Don Felipe openly accuses Will and his family of rustling their cattle. You're blaming me for all the warbred scum in Texas? Will is appalled by Don Felipe's implication. It isn't my fault that Texas isn't back in the Union. Luis sees through Will's doubletalk. Bryant and Cullen rein up nearby and Cullen shoots Luis in the thigh against Will's orders. Don Felipe spews venom. Brave strong . . . just like lizards in dark corners. The Mexican warns Will that his lawless day are numbered because a U.S. Marshal is in route.Bostonbred dude Martin Weatherby Leif Ericson of Carbine Williamsis the new marshal. His primary reason for heading to Dallas is to impress his fiance Tonia Robles. He is hopelessly out of place in the West. He is dressed outrageously like the tinhorn and doesn't even tote a sixgun. The U.S. Marshal's badge that he pins on isn't even a star but a name tag. When he arrives in Springfield Missouri Weatherby finds himself caught in the middle of a shootout between Blayde Hollister Gary Cooper of Sergeant York and the legendary Wild Bill Hickox Reed Hadley of Now Voyagerthat leaves Blayde in the dust. As it turns out Blayde and Wild Bill staged the duel so Blayde doesn't have to worry about bounty hunters. Blayde accompanies Weatherby to Dallas but he swaps clothes with him and impersonates him. Blayde is after Will and wants to lull him into a false sense of security. No sooner than he rides into Dallas Blayde blows holes in Cullen and takes up with Weatherby's girl Tonia Robles Ruth Roman of Champion who doesn't quite understand his motives. Meanwhile a sympathetic Weatherby secures a pardon for Blayde but jealousy prompts him to withhold it until his conscience bothers him.Predictably Blayde exacts his revenge on Will Marlow. Martin acquires a pardon but he hesitates to hand it to our hero since he is stealing his girl. Inevitably Blayde's real identity slips out when a former member of his Georgia regiment hits Dallas. Marlow light out on horseback for Forth Worth and Blayde pursues him. Marlow reaches Forth Worth first and convinces the authorities to incarcerate Blayde. Blayde starts fire to get out of jail and chase Marlow. The John Twist screenplay is about as farfetched as a western can be. The characters here make wellnigh impossible shots blasting the sixguns out of the hands of their opponents. Cooper seems to be having fun impersonating a dude and making a fool out of the chief villain. This is the earliest western where the hero uses the outlaw's horse to lead him to the villain's secret hideout. Dallas is nowhere as good as either High Noon or Vera Cruz but it is still an aboveaverage opera with a sense of humor.".

An inept Marshall arriving from Boston gets in Hollister's way attempting to arrest him when interrupted by a street shootout between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shootout is staged to get the law off Hollister  he takes the back East Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas as they switch identity. That was a great beginning and the picture holds up all the way through. Will Marlowe has positioned himself in Dallas to run for mayor while his men steal cattle to force foreclosure on the Robles ranch. Brian Marlow the younger brother is a loose cannon that keeps getting in the way. Hollister consistently makes a fool out of him and eventually tosses a black cat across his path which was truly bad luck.Action may be a little slow by today's standards but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.That's your last bullet Will.".

Hollywood abounds in those carpetbagger rule in Texas and the men who do something about it. Red River is the best example.Gary Cooper is outlaw and former rebel Blayde Hollister who is gunned down by Wild Bill Hickok so he can operate undercover and get a particularly loathsome family named Marlow who burned his former plantation in Georgia.

Massey's villains are always shrewd and are usually done in by circumstances beyond their control. Steve Cochran fresh from his stint as Big Ed in White Heat is the vicious but stupid underling brother.It's a good plot and a lot's been edited out badly. For instance at one point you see Gary Cooper in hot pursuit of Massey to Fort Worth. Then it cuts straightaway to the Fort Worth jail and no explanation of how Cooper got in there.Leif Erickson never made it to the top. He usually was the second lead who never got the girl. Television gave him the stardom that eluded him on the silver screen with High Chapparal.Steve Cochran usually played villains with a kind of snakeoil charm like Big Ed in White Heat or as Doris Day's KKK husband in Storm Warning. Same here although the twist is he's not the sharpest knife in the Marlow drawer.Today's generation thinks of Dallas and they think of the Ewing family of the 80s.

Two years before his Oscar Winning role in High Noon Cooper played a variation of the same role and in studying the two films you really can see the difference as to what makes a film tense High Noon's clock is as much of a character as the human beings in the film while Dallas has little or no tension at all and what makes it simply routine.

This just isn't it.I understand why some might rate this rather mediocre film highly as it is difficult to downgrade any film in this nowadays under appreciated genre.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most ridiculous westerns that Hollywood ever made. Gary Cooper plays 'Reb Hollister' a former confederate officer wanted by the law.  He meets up with a moron named Weatherby played by Leif Erickson who is a U.S. Marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee Tonia Robles played by Ruth Roman.  Senor Robles Tonia's father has plenty of men but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers.  Will Marlow played by Raymond Massey has financed the loan on the Robles estate making things completely absurd.  He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they're due simply because he feels like it.Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can't fight since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee Tonia Just another instance of more plot nonsense.  Are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job?  Wait a minute this guy couldn't pass the written test either. he switches identities with Reb  Hollister who of course is an expert gunman.  Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby's girl with a passionate kiss while Weatherby looks on like an idiot.  Gary Cooper Hollywood's number one stud is in fine form here as Reb.  Before the movie's done not only does he take Weatherby's job he steals his fiancee also and Ruth Roman as Tonia falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brushoff before the films little more than half over.There isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film so despite the good cast and lush photography the film is a dud.  And Cooper's character is a complete heel to boot.  The film also stars Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow's girl a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances unfortunately by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons.  I strongly suggest you pass this one up.".

The person he is after is Bryant Marlow and he has gone to Texas where his brother Will is now a respected Dallas businessman. In order to avoid trouble he fakes his own death... only to end up travelling with the new US Marshal Martin Weatherby. Weatherby isn't cut out for the job and the two of them end up switching places when they get to Dallas Reb claims to be the marshal and introduces Martin as his brother Daniel the only person to know the truth is Martin's fiance Tonia. It isn't long before he crosses paths with Bryant but it turns out he is after the wrong brother and when Will learns the new marshal is Hollister things get more dangerous! Of course it isn't all gunfights and chases on horseback the film also finds time for some romantic jealousy when Reb gets close to Tonia and Martin isn't too happy about it.This might not be 'High Noon' but it is an entertaining western with some good action sequences a couple of nasty villains and even a few laughs... just seeing Weatherby's original getup is enough to raise a chuckle. The story of revenge is fairly standard but there is nothing with that. Gary Cooper is very much the star of the film in the role of Reb Hollister but he is ably supported by Leif Erickson as Weatherby and Raymond Massey and Steve Cochran as Will and Bryant Marlow. Ruth Roman does a good enough job as love interest Tonia Robles although her role is nowhere near as big as her second billing would suggest. The action was well directed especially the jail break scene where Reb flees a burning jail and the final shoot out. Overall this isn't a classic western but it passes the time nicely if you are a fan of the genre.".

The story isn't as contrived as it sounds and there is some excellent humor in the situations the performers mine like gold without overplaying. Ruth Roman was never photographed more beautifully than she is in this picture and it's easy to see why two strongwilled men would be vying for her attention. Raymond Massey is on hand as the villain and this time he enacts wicked schemes with an equally villainous younger brother Steve Cochran. Cochran's role is written with less comedy than the others but even he manages to bring out the more humorous aspects of his character's situation without being too gimmicky.

He plays Blayde Hollister who travels to Texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a buckskinfringed shirt and packs two ivoryhandled six shooters. He speaks with a countrified accent  A feller could get hurt doin' this. Cf. Sergeant York. The gang is led by sneering Raymond Massey who buys and sells land usually by underhanded means whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran who cannot play a Westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general. The requisite woman is Ruth Roman daughter of the Mexican plantation owner who looks and speaks about as Mexican as a Boston brown betty.I don't think I'll bother too much with the plot. No doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention. As in any 1939 Western it's labyrinthine. Everyone except Cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets.Everything is retro. The plot the dialog the wardrobe even the music. The score is by Warner's stalwart Max Steiner. He's the guy that scored King Kong. That was 1932. This movie was released in 1950.Cooper's name by the way  Blayde Hollister  prompted me to look through the records of the RACA  the Real American Cowboy Associaton  to see if that name cropped up in their archives which date from the beginning of time to February 4th 1911 when the last Real Cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. There has never been a Real Cowboy with the name Blayde. Hollister yes but not Blayde. As a matter of fact there is no record of any Real Cowboy named Wade Luke Cole or Matt either. The most popular names for genuine cowboys in descending order of frequency were Clarence Mortimer Noble Nebukadnezzar Plautus Pinchbeck and Hortense.If this movie had been released in 1939 it would have been routine. In 1950 it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.".

Everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939 a larger budget applied and this production its issue.Gary Cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times  the displaced Southerner fast on the draw and firm with honor though kinda easy going whenever possible.

	schema:headline " Pretty weak western starring Gary Cooper";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Stuart Heisler and written by John Twist this needlessly complex and talky Western with a B movie feel that includes some comedy intentional or otherwise might please only fans of its lead actor Gary Cooper who plays a familiar role as a wronged man waging a solo battle of revenge.Coop plays Blayde 'Red' Hollister a Confederate army officer who'd headed west after the Civil War to find and kill those responsible for torching his home and killing his family in Georgia. He's pretty sure it was the Marlow brothers but he needs proof to satisfy his personal code before he can exact his revenge. Steve Cochran and Raymond Massey play Brant and Will Marlow respectively Zon Murray appears uncredited as the third.The Marlows have setup shop in and around the growing relatively new titled Texas city. Will has established himself as the town's banker while his brothers and their henchman rustle cattle to prevent Will's clients from being able to pay their mortgages so that Will can then seize their lands. One such family that's falling prey to Marlow's land grab scheme is the Robles patriarch Don Felipe Antonio Moreno his lovely daughter Tonia Ruth Roman and son Luis Gil Donaldson who'd been shot and injured by Brant the brother that 'respectable' Will can barely keep under 'control'.The story actually begins in retiring Marshal Wild Bill Hickok's Reed Hadley town where the lawman come actor stages a shootout with his 'friend' Hollister in which he pretends to kill him enabling the rebel to assume another identity in order to freely pursue those that killed his kin. Lucky for Hollister an eastern dandy named Martin Weatherby Leif Erickson had just arrived on the stagecoach from Boston to become Dallas's U.S. Marshal. Since the real Weatherby is hardly qualified for the job at hand he allows Hollister to pretend to be him for a time which causes complications when it inadvertently begins a love triangle with his fiance Tonia.Several chase sequences on horseback and requisite shootouts are included in the action but there's no real drama nor question as to whether Cooper's character will get his manmen and the girl. The showdown between Hollister and Brant is ludicrous enough  he uses a cat to force the killer to reveal himself  but the final showdown is exceedingly tedious in a darkened fireplace lit room Hollister throws objects taunts and counts bullets while Will fires wildly until he's out whereupon he rushes the prelocked door so the two can wrestle until guess who prevails.Barbara Payton plays Brant's girlfriend Flo who's not only frustrated with having to live in a dusty remote hideout with a bunch of bandits but also with the lack of brain power her man exhibits when he enables the captured CooperWeatherby character to talk his way into an escape. Jerome Cowan plays a townsman Matt Coulter and Will Wright appears uncredited as Dallas Judge Harper.".

I kept thinking about that as the story progressed and it was a major source of distraction. But I tell you what I'm going to use my summary line from the flick more than once when I hook up with friends looking for a watering hole.You know what else was distracting? How about that getup Weatherby Leif Erickson was wearing when he first came on the scene. And he was a U.S. Marshal?!?! Gee he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a broom the first time he handled a six gun. I wonder how he passed the U.S. Marshal exam.But Cooper is Cooper and he does his best with a story line that takes the odd twist here and there. The whole dynamic between the Marlow brothers was a bit sketchy to me it seemed like they deliberately went out of their way to confound each other. Then there was the dynamic between Ruth Roman's character Tonia Robles and the way she threw over her fianc Weatherby once Blayde Hollister Cooper came on the scene.I must have seen this a dozen times or more in Westerns and I still find it not very believable. Consider the time Hollister is up in a tree and lassos Bryant Marlow Steve Cochran off his horse. I mean how is that possible when all you have to do is throw the rope off before it tightens. Shouldn't be that tough but then again I've never tried it.The other thing I got a kick out of was when the lookout on the rock yelled down to Pete at the Bryant Marlow hideout when he saw Hollister sneaking around so then the guys in the camp began whispering. Wouldn't it have been too late by then? Well I guess even as late as 1950 these Western flicks didn't have to rely much on believability made for a simpler audience during a simpler time. Though I'm surprised that the principals wouldn't bring stuff like this to the attention of the director. I mean if I thought of it why wouldn't Gary Cooper think of it too?".

Some of the scenes where the high school kids are using ecstasy made me very uncomfortable because I have a kid that age and I could picture her using it. As parent of a teen I found the depictions of the parentchild interactions to be deadon accurate.I enjoyed the film's many little jokes and I enjoyed the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all the issues were resolved by the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is required to stick to that which is possible while truth is not.This is a film which plays with the viewer allowing us believe that people are what other people think they are only to allow us later to realize that the folks we assumed were right were completely ignorant of the real situation. One of the film's strongest scenes a scene about which we feel very relieved and sympathetic about what the character is doing turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption and the character while admirable is totally wrong. It's very subtly done I think. Very realistic.I liked the score a lot  I thought it really aided the film really helped set the mood  the film has a couple of screwball moments and the background music helps establish that.The valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half  got a big laugh! The movie is really in my head right now  saw it this morning. Will try to see it again time allowing. Tens are hard to come by but a solid nine in my book.".

Very realistic.I liked the score a lot  I thought it really aided the film really helped set the mood  the film has a couple of screwball moments and the background music helps establish that.The valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half  got a big laugh! The movie is really in my head right now  saw it this morning. Will try to see it again time allowing. Tens are hard to come by but a solid nine in my book.";

You can hardly believe seeing this film which is not only a mature piece of work professional and deep but also with some of the defects of routine specific to older directors.The setting is the American suburb too familiar from 'American Beauty' or 'Desperate Housewives'. As in 'American Beauty'the film turns around a suicide but here it happens at the beginning of the movie and we are left watching a midclass family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother Sigourney Weaver is the mother both are excellent trying to cope with the loss to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a sure hand and the first two sections of the film there are four in total as the seasons of the year build a wonderful tension with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly it looks too tired and conventional and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young scriptwriter and director trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. That's how this film fails to be a somber version of 'American Beauty' with a different focus. I am sure however that we will hear a lot about Dan Harris in the coming years.".

	schema:reviewBody "It occurred to me while watching Imaginary Heroes that any screenwriter attempting to make a drama about family relationships should seriously consider killing off a kid or two in the opening reel as a way of getting his characters to open up and reveal themselves. There must be something to this storyline for it seems as if every other family drama that comes down the pike uses this device in one form or another Paradise and Moonlight Mile are just two of the more recent examples that spring immediately to mind although one could reach back to a golden oldie like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to make the point as well. It's not that the death of a child is an illegitimate subject for serious films to explore. Far from it. It's just that like any topic it can be so overused that it becomes just another movie clich a convenient bit of narrative shorthand to get the ball rolling and to give the characters something to grapple with for the remainder of the time we get to spend with them.The latest such work is Imaginary Heroes a film that borrows heavily from what is one of the earliest and perhaps best known examples of the family coping with the death of a child genre the Academy Award winning Ordinary People. Like the characters in that earlier film the Travises seem on the surface to be the ideal suburban family until one fateful day their oldest son Matt who is the golden boy athlete and thus the apple of his father's eye kills himself with no explanation one minor difference is that the son in Ordinary People dies as a result of an accident not a suicide. It is Matt's younger brother Tim who winds up finding the body and who assumes the role of protagonist in the film. Each of the remaining family members copes with the tragedy in his or her own way. Matt who has always lived in the shadow of his older brother becomes more and more estranged from the father who has virtually ignored him all his life and begins to turn to drugs for surcease. Ben the father becomes swallowed up in feelings of remorse and guilt turning away from both his job and his family. His wife Sandy is the most complex character in the film a freespirited child of the '60's who feels oddly adrift in the role of mother and wife as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbia. She spends most of her time after the tragedy trying to reconnect with her potsmoking past.As written and directed by Dan Harris Imaginary Heroes emerges as a wildly uneven film. For every scene that feels real and authentic there is another that comes across as arbitrary and inauthentic. One sometimes has the sense that Harris would like to cram every possible life situation he can think of into his screenplay an admirable goal perhaps but one that makes the film unnecessarily melodramatic in the process. Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their plight we often find ourselves thinking Oh come nowwhat next? For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hotbutton topics covered in this film the screenplay also touches on drug and alcohol abuse physical abuse sexual identity conflict lifethreatening illness even inadvertent gay incest. It is this everything but the kitchen sink mentality in the writing that robs the movie of much of the credibility it needs to really make us care.That is not to say that Imaginary Heroes is a bad or unrewarding film. Much of what it has to say about familial relationships and values in the 21st Century is insightful original pointed and profound. Prime credit for its success goes to the actors Emile Hirsch Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels who deliver incisive sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over the narrative excesses to stimulate our brains and touch our hearts. Moreover Harris in his direction achieves an effectively melancholic tone throughout but one that is frequently augmented by some badlyneeded flashes of daring dark comedy.Imaginary Heroes may appear unfocused and derivative at times but its fine performances and subtle mood shifts make it a film worth watching.".

	schema:headline " A Kind of SalingerLynch Sundae with the Cute Emile Hirsh as Lead";
	schema:reviewBody "As Salinger's A Perfect Day for Bananafish ends with the suicide of a prodigy this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend Matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy his brother Tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question What am I going to do?When he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped watermelon the Travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation heartbreak issues of sexuality and friendship. Tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises but these are not the only injuries to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of Tim scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. Two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red spinnable playground saucer Tim asks Penny What am I going to do with the rest of my life? The scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home filmed from a bird's eye view because with every character Tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red spinnable playground saucer complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil from above. After advising him curtly to pass the joint Penny tells him Tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love. And you have to do that for the rest of your life  And you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail. This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the movie's central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does one person have a talent he cannot stand like Matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices Tim's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know Tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of Tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. This is the other side of the film the failure of those who should  parents friends teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love.

In an emotional scene Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his dad is going to hit him he grabs for him to embrace him. Not letting him go he tells Tim I am your father and you're are my son and I'm here okay but you've gotta talk to me. I don't know how to do this by myself. It is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son you have to tell me what's going on inside of you you have to tell me who you are I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment the visual movement from Tim angry and alone to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell. Tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis especially when you consider the mistreatment manipulation disregard violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses. I recommend this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "As Salinger's A Perfect Day for Bananafish ends with the suicide of a prodigy this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend Matt who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene. But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy his brother Tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question What am I going to do?When he finds his brother dead his head broken like a dropped watermelon the Travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying domestic abuse family alienation heartbreak issues of sexuality and friendship. Tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises but these are not the only injuries to his person as we slowly come to realize as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of Tim scars. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays out the character quite well revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent. Two siblings sharing a doobie curled up on a red spinnable playground saucer Tim asks Penny What am I going to do with the rest of my life? The scene is framed in a familiar recurring image of the film the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home filmed from a bird's eye view because with every character Tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red spinnable playground saucer complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil from above. After advising him curtly to pass the joint Penny tells him Tim well the secret to the success of life is to find something you love. And you have to do that for the rest of your life  And you better hope to hell that you're good at it because if you're not then you'll probably fail. This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the movie's central theme the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure. Why does one person have a talent he cannot stand like Matt who hated the attention his swimming fame brought but no one notices Tim's talent  no one  because no one bothers to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know Tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome sad guy in our intimate understanding of Tim as it progresses we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be. This is the other side of the film the failure of those who should  parents friends teachers  whoever  to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love. Not even his mother Sandy played by Sigourney Weaver sees Tim's gift despite her love for her son. Weaver does a deft job of a middleaged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support. When Tim is found to be bullied at school she storms the boy's trailer threatening his life You can tease torture punch drive drunk with me I can forgive you.

	schema:reviewBody "Viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same. Story is about the Travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of Matt Kip Pardue who was a very promising high school swimmer. Ben Jeff Daniels is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son Tim Emile Hirsch as well as Matt but he does communicate of some sort to his mother Sandy Sigourney Weaver who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it.SPOILER ALERT Sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the checkout cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail. She doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben has taken a leave of absence from work. After all this happens Sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces Ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family.This film is written and directed by Dan Harris who has worked with Bryan Singer on X2 and also the upcoming Superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story for me just has too many things thrown in. The script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs sex love infidelity abuse neglect experimentation with homosexuality and a life threatening illness. If all those scenarios weren't enough for you Harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. While I did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another I must admit that I didn't hate this film and I have to credit the actors for that. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but I wish the story would have concentrated more on Weaver and her character than Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an Oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. Harris shows he can be a good writerdirector but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived.".

The story focuses on the Travis family in the wake of the eldest son's suicide. I say that loosely because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother because if the father WAS supposed to have the story focus on him too they edited the movie pretty poorly. The acting on all parts was very good particularly Emile Hirsch as the surviving confused son. The characters were all very interesting and I didn't mind watching them until late in the film when it just seemed to drag. My big complaint however was the story. The son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot. However it really wasn't. It was something that happened at the start of the story but then everything went every which way. Then they'd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread. The other thing was that the big plot twists of which there were plenty were never really explained or built up to but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field. In fairness the ending was very very cool. But it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from about half of it the half that wasn't padding was pretty much lifted from the story in the Pearl Jam song Alive. Which reminds me... There was a poem in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself. I could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted word for word from that very same song. I dunno this was a movie I had hope for and they really really dropped the ball.".

	schema:headline " So life is nothing more than a tragedy? spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that in light of recent dramas such as these the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. I would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counterproductive this conclusion is even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. But instead I realized that these films have made the very determination of the great tragedy trivial when the same boring situations the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle supplanting it instead with the reality of how things actually are. That in fact what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional but in fact a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus have ignored or at least denied.Only problem is that too many films have been trying to make this point. And by doing so in nearly identical form. When I had read the synopsis for the film I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm.' While watching the depressing lifelessness of the Travis family which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating I immediately recalled 'American Beauty.' And in some regards the interactions between the parents and the middle child Tim I drew similarities from 'Igby Goes Down.' 'Imaginary Heroes' may be a novel experience maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that as said before is often not permitted to exist in the films of family which is idiotic to think anyways considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'Ordinary People' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that. But to the wellversed viewer these films may offer nothing new. They have in fact become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to outdo the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family and here it extends to neighbors and friends. In fact 'Imaginary Heroes' the latest in this genre I do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre' crams so many disasters and surprises into one family that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. It is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion.

	onyx:emotionText "I just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that in light of recent dramas such as these the only ones who could be considered abnormal are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic. I would suggest how nauseatingly defeatist and counterproductive this conclusion is even if relationships and outlooks like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree. But instead I realized that these films have made the very determination of the great tragedy trivial when the same boring situations the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous distortions of family life much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character aberrations being made ever so subtle supplanting it instead with the reality of how things actually are. That in fact what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional but in fact a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus have ignored or at least denied.Only problem is that too many films have been trying to make this point. And by doing so in nearly identical form. When I had read the synopsis for the film I immediately thought of 'Ice Storm.' While watching the depressing lifelessness of the Travis family which seemed to endure repeated emotional berating I immediately recalled 'American Beauty.' And in some regards the interactions between the parents and the middle child Tim I drew similarities from 'Igby Goes Down.' 'Imaginary Heroes' may be a novel experience maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that as said before is often not permitted to exist in the films of family which is idiotic to think anyways considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like 'Ordinary People' as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that. But to the wellversed viewer these films may offer nothing new. They have in fact become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who may try to outdo the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can pack into one family and here it extends to neighbors and friends. In fact 'Imaginary Heroes' the latest in this genre I do think there have been enough films to accurately declare it a 'genre' crams so many disasters and surprises into one family that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host. It is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the eldest son a talented and decorated swimmer who hated the sport with a passion. The youngest son knew this the father was in a daze and blinded by the push for competitiveness in his allstar son. And it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man.Granted it is no less entertaining to some extent for those who find this material exhaustively depressing after a while and the performances are quite good especially by Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels.

The comedy is accentuated by the light musical underscoring though the song selections throughout are also excellent and unusual particularly in emphasizing that life goes on after a family tragedy.Some unnecessary clichs creep in such as the school bully living in a trailer park even though this was mostly shot in Glen Ridge NJ.

Oops we've created a taboo...now let's not address the situation because that wouldn't really be P.C. Otherwise a spectacular film";

	schema:headline " Man of the Year is a very good political thrillercomedy that will suffer at the box office because of its misleading marketing campaign.";
	schema:reviewBody "Man of the Year tells the story of Tom Dobbs Robin Williams a political comedian like Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert who has his own television show. On his show he talks about all sorts of things but his main focus are political issues which he is very opinionated about. One day on his show a fan from the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for President of the United States. After that episode aired millions flocked to the web to create various petitions and voice their opinions on why Dobbs would make a great candidate for the President for the United States. A few weeks later Dobbs decides to run for President and low and behold wins the election. Everything seems to be going as planned until a woman by the name of Eleanor Green Laura Linney shows up and starts some controversy regarding his position. A funny yet serious political thriller ensues Man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film marketers when I see how misleading their marketing campaigns. Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from the poster to the trailer to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 13 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. I kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues inbetween its comedy routine.But enough about marketing lets get down to the film itself.I really liked Man of the Year even though I was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film. One of the many things I will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward. I really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it. Some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don't understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right.Man of the Year talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn't about candy coating them. I also think the whole political subplot while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing was very good. The idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic. Also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed.As far as acting goes I think everyone involved did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but I personally still think he is funny and he's a good serious actor as well. This is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. Also it's nice to see Lewis Black costar in a decent film. Again I like Black when he appears on The Daily Show and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful. This was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit in with the story that director Barry Levinson was trying to convey. Laura Linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them.Man of the Year was written and directed by Barry Levinson the man who has brought us such films as Rain Man Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog. Levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it. Like I said I know a lot of critics didn't like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but I thought it fit in nicely. It was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a fine job with this film.In the end don't go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you. It does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama. It's not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe. I really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn't a typical Hollywood film. It tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me. I like the fact that the film didn't really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical Hollywood ending. I was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn't end the way I thought which made me happy. It's a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what's going to happen next. I think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing.".

The supporting actors give great performances especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was a delight each time on screen. Lewis Black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here. There is also a fun turn by Jeff Goldblum. The movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well.

	schema:headline " It's all just very frustrating";
	schema:reviewBody "Man of the Year reviewed by Sam OsbornFrustrating is a good word to describe Man of the Year frustrating because one half of this film shines. This half moves with ease and works off the unshakable glow of Robin Williams. The other halfthe evil half if you willworks more like an infection relatively harmless at first but fatal and sort of repulsive when left untreated. What could have been a sweetly charming comedy is left suspending all means of reality to turn this wickedly funny political affair into a silly farce of a thriller. Robin Williams plays Tom Dobbs a kind of fictional counterpart to Jon Stewart. Like Mr. Stewart Dobbs hosts a nightly comedy talk show that discusses the absurd nature of current political news. In Dobbs' worldand more than likely in oursmore people obtain their knowledge of current events through Dobbs' nightly sketch than from valid news sources. He's so popular in fact that when one member of the audience suggests that he run for president in the upcoming election Dobbs takes it seriously. His campaign is fostered through a grassroots internet movement that manages to put him on thirteen of the fifty states' ballots and into the last of three national debates between the two partyaligned candidates. This segment requires that yes we suspend some belief in DirectorWriter Barry Levinson's vision of reality. Could a talk show host with no political background really rise to such presidential heights? Probably not. But it's plausible enough. The true deception comes with the ornery subplot that Levinson plunks down like an anchor into this prim and simple tale. A new voting system has been implemented into the upcoming election created by the corporation Delacroy. Eleanor Green Laura Linney an employee for Delacroy happens to find a glitch in the voting system only weeks before the national election. Her alarm is muffled by the legal head of the corporation Alan Stewart Jeff Goldblum and her reputation put to tatters by a cocktail injection of illegal drugs a shadowy man sent from Delacroy gives her. And so when Dobbs wins the presidency by way of the glitch in the Delacroy voting system Eleanor must evade assassination from corporate hit men and alert Dobbs to his undeserving position. I think it must first be said that I'm rarely one to penalize a film for lack of realism. In my opinion a suspension of reality must align with the function of the film. Spiderman for instance doesn't require many laws of physics while a film like Apollo 13 does. With Man of the Year I have no issue overlooking Tom Dobbs rising to Presidential Elect if it's a concession needed for the film to exist. At the same time however I find it difficult to believe that Ms. Green discovered the glitch in the Delacroy voting system by inadvertently testing the program at population volumes similar to those used during actual elections. The glitch is an alphabetical problem candidates with pairs of letters that appear earlier in that alphabet will inevitably win the election Dobbs beat Mills for instance. Don't you think that the American Government might have tested this little gem of computer programming before relying on it to monitor the nation's votes? I think so. Should I be easier on this small puddle of disbelief? Well I would if the subplot seemed at all necessary which it doesn't. The Delacroy plot begins as an annoying thread but weaves itself into the delicate fabric of the entire tale. Soon instead of following Mr. Dobbs' witty rise to power we follow Ms. Green as she partakes in car chases whispered phone calls and FBI posturing. It's not exciting it isn't thrilling and it's certainly not tragic. Don't even ask if these segments are funny. When Dobbs could be grappling with the American political system and driving the film into a quiet and smarmily hilarious character comedy Director Levinson chickens out and plays it dumb with this Delacroy farce.It's all just very frustrating I suppose. Christopher Walken Lewis Black and Robin Williams are a comedic force. And allowing Williams to drift off into his own standup material was an ingenious creative decision. Mr. Levinson even has a convincing grasp on current politics and manages dozens of jokes surrounding them. And so why fall back on this Delacroy nonsense? Bah! i say. What a shame. Rating 2 out of 4Sam Osborn".

When he eventually get's elected it's a pity that is because of a computer glitch you'd want him to win fair although that is unrealistic.But after that this movie goes completely downhill. I thought we'd get a great movie like 'Dave' 1993 in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country. Instead the movie turns from comedy into a thriller a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good. The computer glitch becomes the main storyline which really sucks. Boy is this disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the premise and because I actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it which is usually a good thing with me.".

Suspense in a supposed comedy movie? I know that I as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this. A character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater. In all fairness after the movie was over there was smattering of applause.

The first half hour are hilarious. Don't get me wrong the movie has its moments. But after the first half hour it takes a turn for the worst. It becomes less of a comedy and more of a thrillerdramalove story...which is pointless. the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs interspersed here and there but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning. at one point the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene. Williams gives a great performance right on par with his comedic style. Walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can. I think the one character that goes underrated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political its funny to see him tone it down for a PG13 rating. Overall I would not pay to see the movie. Afterall I saw it for free and even I was disappointed. The first half hour is solid and its all downhill from there. Not really fitting into a category the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a onehour comedy central special. 4.510".

	schema:reviewBody "How is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? Were they forced into it? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president. They don't even try to give an impression of that. Just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on DC politics the first five minutes the movie runs off the road and into Bfilm drama about 1 a computer voting error 2 the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history and 3 a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this. She's soon the victim of the evil Xfiles masterlords of the computer company who  instead of killing her  drug her to make her seem untrustworthy. But when she gets to DC she doesn't tell him. In fact the movie then changes from Bfilm drama to idiotic Bfilmlovedrama. Up to now we are so far off the original starting point of the movie that most people turn it off. I almost did. If it just could've been INTELLIGENT love drama but no! It's not! It's the kind of oops I'm so nervous I'm being stupid all the time so please love me for itkind of love drama. All with a slow slow pace that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie the Xfiles plot of the movie or the comedy plot of the movie. All plots fail on all levels which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of. The love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking binge hey there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female programmer yeah that'll work! Stick it in there!Meanwhile Lewis Black is castrated and put into a role where he doesn't come up with one single Lewis Black line. The Lewis Black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film which it never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the President's closest aid in Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken being castrated like Lewis Black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and Westwingish but fail like Titanic every time is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach. Heartbreaking.And then enter the low point of the whole movie It raises the mindbogglingly enormously difficult ethical question Should Robin Williams go on to be president knowing that he got elected because of a computer glitch? The American Dream And All Good prevails as he turns down the presidency on live TV like Lassie the dog would. With the usual Patriotic Glamor Of The Presidency and the we'resosmartthatwe'remakinghistoryatmosphere that Westwing cultivated in sickening abundance for the next million years.The director and screen writer Barry Levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors I'm staying away from forever. This film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process where people inlcuding Barry Levinson got to spend production money due to their personal relationships and not their skills. This is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled people's wish for career success and the formerly mentioned great actors were tricked into participating in it. That's the only explanation there can be. PS The voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in Dobbs Kellogs and Mills. Of course it was what else could it be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dishwashing machine.".

	schema:reviewBody "Man of the Year is an enjoyable film that should leave you at least somewhat satisfied. Yes it's mostly a drama and partly a thriller but it pulls it off better than many other films in the past few years that have had Presidential themes most notably the very bad Mike Douglas film 'The Sentinel'.Comedian Tom Dobbs Robin Williams is the host of a talk show in the vein of The Daily Show who is prompted by an audience member to run for the Presidency. He takes her advice throws one of the wildest presidential campaigns ever and eventually wins the election to many people's surprise. All the while Eleanor Green Laura Linney is a computer analyst who works for a new voting company I'm not 100 sure but I believe it was called Delacroy that has supplied the entire country with their new voting machines. In the early stages she finds it malfunctioning and tries to get the head honchos to listen to her but they won't budge. After she gets fired she is determined to tell Dobbs about his wrongful election all the while getting chased by corporate goons. I feel the movie focuses too much on her and not enough on Dobbs. If anything she should have gotten top billing over Williams she gets far more screen time.However the film has comedic moments and they succeeded at making me laugh. Most of the funniest bits were already in the trailer but there are just enough left in to recommend this to those looking for comedy. For those looking for a Political Dram Thriller it comes close to succeeding at that and the overall feeling when you leave the theater is mostly satisfying.Man of the Year could have been much better given most of the cast and crews' previous outings however it is good enough for me to give a mild recommendation with a rating of 6 12 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Two Very Different Stories In One Movie Seemed Awkward To Me";
	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie to be ... awkward. It wasn't bad. There are parts of it that are actually quite good. But it struck me as what you might call overly ambitious. There are basically two movies here. They're certainly connected in fact in the context of this movie they're inseparable. But they're very different stories and the combination of the two was  again  awkward.After what I thought was a pretty slow start with what was a rather lengthy narration style opening from Christopher Walken playing Jack Menken who was the manager for Tom Dobbs Robin Williams the movie started out really well. Dobbs is a political satirist a la Jon Stewart. On his TV talk show he skewers politicians and rants against the system and then suddenly and unexpectedly declares his candidacy for President of the United States. Starting out as a serious campaigner he cuts loose as the political satirist he really is during a televised debate his campaign catches fire and he gets elected to everyone's surprise. This was working for me  and it was working really well. It wasn't outrageously funny but it was a wonderful poke at the system and I was seriously looking forward to seeing Dobbs poking the system from inside as he takes over the Oval Office.Then comes the awkwardness as a completely unnecessary storyline gets introduced. The United States was trying out a new computerbased voting system. Now I may not be an American but I'm familiar with the American electoral system. That's almost impossible. Each state runs its own version of the presidential election in its own way according to its own rules. To expect that every single state would sign on to this system is ridiculous. But that's the story. It then moves on to the fact that a computer glitch is what got Dobbs elected. You know what? I really wanted him as the legitimately elected President  a poke in the eye to the system from the voters. But he's not. The company that developed the computer voting system wants to cover the glitch up of course. So what if the glitch screwed democracy  it will hurt us in the pocketbook if people find out. But Eleanor Laura Linney  who works for the company  doesn't agree wants to go public and so the company sets out first to discredit her and then to eliminate her. So what started out as an enjoyable and lighthearted political satire becomes a political thriller about an electoral conspiracy. That could make for a good movie on its own but to tie it in with the first part of the movie where Dobbs gets elected in a huge upset was  I'll say it again  awkward. Both stories had a lot of potential. Because of the hybrid nature of the movie neither story reached its full potential.To give credit where credit is due though Robin Williams was I thought superb in the role. He seemed credible sincere and completely believable. I'm not always a big fan of Robin Williams this movie was one of the best performances I've seen from him. Linney was good Walken was probably underused. The movie's not bad. I just think it tried to do too much and it would have been more fun and more interesting and maybe more thoughtprovoking if the whole political thriller angle had been dumped and we could have seen Dobbs actually and legitimately behind the desk in the Oval Office. 510".

I don't know if there was a script of focus change but it fails to deliver what it offered. Otherwise it is simply a bythebook film with a predictable conspiracyminded plot. This left me puzzled more than anything else. Why would the comedian Robin Williams star in a comedy film where the real main character probably had just as much screentime who gets less than 3 seconds of air time in the trailers. This movie must've taken a turn after Rob signed on. This movie does not know what it's doing with itself which is disappointing when there are funny Rob scenes you don't want them to end but you're forced to watch a disgruntled employee try and figure out what she's doing instead of having fun with the Comedian for president ZOMG pull. Good idea that reeks of getting mucked up by producers and the like.".

	schema:reviewBody "Surprisingly bad work from Barry Levinson and Robin Williams. I hadn't read any reviews of this movie from the TV commercials I expected it to be political satire like Wag the Dog. It is not that its political commentary never gets beyond oneliners though a few of those are funny. It seems to want to be part thriller and part romantic comedy but doesn't succeed at either. Laura Linney's character Eleanor Green was especially unbelievable her motivations were consistently unclear and her acting was often excessive well over the top.The list of plot holes could go on for days. Some of them have to do with computer programming. Having done computer programming I can state from experience that this movie is completely wrong about almost every aspect of the process. One other example not to give too much away there is a scene in which Eleanor is in a shopping mall pursued by a Known Bad Guy. Rather than making a scene in the mall with people around she waits until they're alone in the parking garage to make a break for it. When she gets away instead of going back into the mall for help she gets into her car and apparently drives around at random for some time until she doesn't know where she is. She can't use her cell phone because the battery is dead yet the Bad Guys are somehow using GPS to track her. Nearly every scene of the whole pursuedwoman plat has similarly contrived and implausible incongruities.Several of the scenes between her and Robin Williams also seemed pointless painfully boring and far too long. Their interactions may have been intended to show that the two were developing feelings for each other but I didn't feel that at all. Williams and Linney together seemed to be entirely devoid of chemistry.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents Helen Kushnick in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value but for fans of these two late night superstars this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen's strongwilled manipulations of some of NBC's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who despite having Carson's support was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno respectively but it is the razorsharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best if not so wellknown performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years I've watched this movie many times from seeing it on HBO and I now own a copy on DVD. I must say it's very memorable and entertaining in the meantime it's interesting and educational too. As any TV fan can relate to the time of the early 90's when the time came up to replace Johhny Carson the TV living legend of The Tonight Show who's it gonna be Jay or Dave? This original film from HBO The Late Shift stays true to form and depicts the real events very well showing the behind the scenes battle between networks heads of NBC and CBS and even ABC they were all fighting for the services of Jay and Dave. The acting makes it seem real as very little actual TV footage is shown with real life people as the actors portraying Leno and Letterman make it seem so real. I haven't read the Bill Carter book so I don't know if it stayed true to the pages but I have highly enjoyed this film over the years. From the moment when it starts showing CBS entertainment heads watching Leno sub for Johhny and they decide they want to get in on the late night game. Yet when Carson announces his unexpected retirement NBC wants to stay loyal with Leno yet conflict arrives when Letterman wants a crack at the slot at 1130 too. It was fun to watch the wacky meeting with Michael OvitzTreat Williamswho makes all networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny telling Letterman by phone in a direct way to walk from NBC and consider CBS. And by the way Rich Little was terrific as Johhny Carson his portrayal couldn't be matched. And plenty of tense moments were provided by showing the bickering and firing of Leno's talent manager Helen which NBC heads pressured him to do. Overall great film that showed what TV is really like and it proves that networks are power and money hungry while showing that's it's a cutthroat business. Clearly there's no business like show business. Great work from HBO very memorable and a watch anytime it showed the true story of the late night wars.".

The two lead actors John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck two actors I never heard of before and haven't heard of since play Leno and Letterman convincingly despite Letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. They play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. I wasn't as interested in that. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates playing Helen Kushnick IS this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national TV show. Yikes! There should be a sequel!!".

The two lead actors John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck two actors I never heard of before and haven't heard of since play Leno and Letterman convincingly despite Letterman's dismissal of his portrayal as being poor. They play the parts quite well despite a lot of people looking for an imitation of the two. I wasn't as interested in that. The story is what counts. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates playing Helen Kushnick IS this movie. She plays this evil bitch of a character so menacingly you realize how on earth can this woman control herself much less a national TV show. Yikes! There should be a sequel!!";

	schema:reviewBody "I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this movie is based many years ago. The book is certainly stronger than the movie. It provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that I thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items. All things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90's to host The Tonight Show after the retirement of Johnny Carson.The highlight is clearly the performances. I can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who is still alive and wellknown and on TV on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins nailed the part of Letterman perfectly. Watching him really was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck tried valiantly to be Jay Leno but somehow didn't pull it off as effectively. His whole look seemed fake and he just didn't seem natural in the role. In a less central role Rich Little not surprisingly nailed the voice of Carson although the look was a bit off. In the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent Helen Kushnick. In the movie Kathy Bates was perfect in the role although not quite as out of control as Carter's portrayal of the woman in writing.In the end this is light and entertaining viewing. The subject matter isn't especially important in the overall scheme of things but it's a fun behind the scenes look at a memorable time in the entertainment industry. 710".

Depending on your view of the world the film a docudrama may leave you forever seeing Jay Leno as a petty ambitious and ruthless and as having forced Carson's premature retirement. You may also come away with the conclusion that Jay a hardworking professional entertainer fought for and won the jewel of his profession that unsympathetic NBC executives dangled before him at the expense of David Letterman who had faithfully served them for years on their implicit promise of the highest prize they could givethe job of hosting the Tonight Show.As a result of the wellpublicized and over dramatized war for the Tonight Show job Jay no doubt gained many fans but lost many more. Surely millions of Americans even with the recovery in ratings Jay enjoyed after the drop that followed his initial installation as host continue to blame him for the loss of their nightly guest into the bosom of their homes. But to truly understand Jay's campaign for the hosting position you must view his fight after seeing him in the Jerry Seinfeld documentary Comedian. Viewing Jay's life and the life of the standup comic from the behind the curtain standpoint the documentary provides will permanently absolve Jay of any perceived wrongdoing in connection with the Tonight Show.Comedian ostensibly follows Seinfeld's foray back into the world of the working standup after ending his record setting television series. Since everyone knows Seinfeld could have easily and expected that he would rest on his laurels from leading the best comedy in television history its easy to think a film documenting his return to standup as an attempt at selfaggrandizement. The film shows that Seinfeld's return to stand up does not come from a desire to give a gift in return to a first love that gave him more than it ever could have promised.And the film itself is much more than an homage to his love. The film is a window into the craft itself and a sometimes brutal exposition of the people who love her. That love is no more evident in any of the films' participantstruly the legends of the artthan in Jay Leno. His love for his art exonerates Jay for any hurt or jealousy remaining from his ascension to the throne of comedy and raises him to a national treasure in American entertainment. Although Jay has announced his own retirement from Tonight Show host I can only pray his departure is on his own terms and not accelerated by illness. Good luck Jay.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't tell whether this movie would be interesting to people who are wheelers and dealers but it interested me precisely because I'm not. If I'd paid half the attention to ploying the system squeezing the cow as these characters do who knows what dazzling heights I might have reached? The story is probably familiar to most viewers by now. When Johnny Carson announces his retirement from The Tonight Show NBC has to choose between two replacements  Jay Leno and David Letterman who can both claim to be qualified. They choose Jay Leno which annoys Letterman. Not that Leno and Letterman aren't friends but their socioeconomic interests are in conflict. All sorts of wheelings and dealings go on which end with Leno keeping The Tonight Show and Letterman moving to an opposite spot at CBS.Godzillions of dollars are involved of course so it behooves everyone to act rationally. The problem faced by these characters  not just the two stars but everyone else  is defining rational. Reason ought to lead you to achieving a goal. But suppose you have several goals equally important and contradictory? Is success measured in dollars? In selfsatisfaction? In security at the expense of self expression? How much is friendship and loyalty worth? These are hard decisions to make but fortunately for millionaires it's not lonely at the top. There's plenty of advice.The most reasonable person  in the sense that he is least influenced by fear or sentiment  is Michael Ovitz played by Treat Williams. As someone says jokingly about him talking to him is like talking to the Godfather. You have a problem? We can solve it. Ovitz went on as I understand it to head Walt Disney but has recently been involved in some sort of contretemps. I think they're kicking him out of Walt Disney and giving him two million godzillion dollars to ease the pain of his passage.The most interesting character I thought was Helen Kushnik Kathy Bates. She was Jay Leno's totem person. And  the book is more explicit about this  she was evidently one of those people who once in power go completely berserk and believe that limits don't apply to them. It goes beyond pushiness. They become tyrants. I don't want to sound sexist but Kushnik's behavior takes a distinctly feminine form. The monster sacre hiding behind the stage props. Judy Garland's stage mother. They protect and advance their clients as if the clients were some rare marketable commodity. Kushnik self destructs as everyone predicts but I'd have liked to know more about her.But it's also fun watching the sparring that goes on between the players. Here is Jay Leno host of The Tonight Show sneaking around through a garage and eavesdropping through a crack in the doorway while a discussion takes place that will decide if Leno is kept on or fired.The Late Shift isn't about a subject that occupied much of my life space at the time this was going on but it held my interest because it's one of those minor inexpensive kinds of projects that cable especially HBO does so well from time to time. If it's not quite up to the standard set by Barbarians at the Gates it's because it wasn't written by Larry Gelbart and it doesn't have James Garner's outrageous lead performance. The Late Shift sees some irony in the story but not much in the way of laughs but that's okay too.It's a intensely thoughtprovoking movie too. Here is the thought it provoked. Where in the hell was Michael Ovitz when I needed him?".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a surprisingly faithful adaptation of the book so if there are any inaccuracies they trace to the book not the movie. The only thing that I noticed was left out of the movie was some of the background that took place in the 80s and even 70s  the book opens by explaining that Carson wanted Letterman to follow him and going into why Leno was so loyal to Kushnick. The film gives very abbreviated versions of this background two thirds of the way in which I think would be confusing to viewers who hadn't read the book making them wonder for most of the movie why people were behaving the way they were.Sequencing aside the movie is a quite good job of adapting the book. I do wish the film had done a better job of explaining Carson and Letterman's friendship and the rather vile emotional manipulations the book alleges Kushnick used on Leno. However most of what was left out wouldn't really have worked in film formanyway. In so far as the book was an accurate story of the late night wars the movie is too. If you're wondering what happened with Leno and Letterman this movie will do in a pinch if you don't want to read the book.If you don't care about Leno and Letterman this is a decent drama full of intrigue that probably would be worth your time if you catch in on TV but it's not really worth renting or buying the movie kind of assumes you already know and care about the Leno and Letterman saga. Only Leno's background is hinted at and again not until late in the movie and I think the entire movie manages to not mention Letterman is from Indiana had a longtime friendship with Carson and it fails to really explain why Letterman was even worth fighting over in the first place mostly he comes off as an egotistical jerk in this movie.This movie is mostly for fans of either of the latenight shows. It didn't have to be with some better editing this could have been a fascinating story even if you'd never heard of El Chinno or the Gaptoothed one.".

A DVD rerelease with opinions and such from those involved could be interesting though I suspect the days when late night talkshow wars captivated the nation are gone and not returning soon.I preferred the Letterman impersonation to the Leno but could never buy in to either. They never rose above caricature and I never simply accepted them as actors. For comparison Paul Sorvino as Kissinger in Oliver Stone's Nixon comes to mind as an impersonation which may have seemed laughable in the first few moments but which seemed at least plausible after the first moments of amusement wore off.The highlight of the show for me was Treat Williams as Michael Ovitz. Williams' speech to Letterman was not as great as but reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's entrance and quick exit as Blake in Glengerry Glen Ross.They could have done more with Johnny's role in all this. I know he was mostly uninvolved in the events portrayed in this movie and most audiences will be familiar with his reputation such that Johnny Carson needs no introduction. But more context about why Dave and Jay and all comedians revere Johnny would have given this flick the substance it lacks in being a gossip film.Guess I should read the book...Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson unfortunately came across as nothing more than Rich Little imitating Johnny Carson.I tell you what after watching this movie then watching either the Letterman or Leno show all I want to do is crack open my Johnny Carson DVDs and see the real thing.".

I've been a loyal fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years and think he's one of the funniest most talented comedians out there.  And David Letterman is one hell of a comedian as well though I only watch his show unless Jay's a repeat during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show.  Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are both fine actors and they very much resembled Jay and Dave but did they disappear into the characters?  Nope.  Roebuck barely nails down Jay's voice and expression mumbling at a high pitch sounding like a castrati Marlon Brando.  Higgins nails down David's facial expressions for example his trademark squirm but he doesn't nail down Dave's voice.  Those who aren't big fans of late night TV might be a lot less biased.  There's a couple comedians who can do deadon impersonations of Jay.  Why couldn't they have selected one of them for the part?  And the same goes with Dave.  I'd rather they had Norm McDonald play the part.  Norm doesn't look a hell of a lot like Dave but he did a great impersonation of him on SNL.  Hey...you got any gum?  That was so hilarious!However I learned a lot about the late night wars which I had very little knowledge of at first.  I never watched The Tonight Show prior to when Jay Leno was host so I didn't know about the struggle to finally replace Johnny Carson and the countless negotiations that finally convinced Dave to move to CBS.  I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes and found the film very enlightening.  And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as the foulmouthed former executive producer of The Tonight Show.  She basically steals the film.  My score  7 out of 10".

Now former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President who is running for reelection. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan and he taunts Horrigan telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government  Leary was removed from the CIA and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around and he's more than willing to take a bullet.

	schema:reviewBody "'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit but although I've seen it a few times I usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. Why?  It's GOOD!   Clint Eastwood is great as usual and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. The character Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However the film doesn't make him a depressed brooding and obsessed character. He's charming and personable and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer played by John Malkovich at his best is cerebral deliberate and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin John Booth.  The film is consistently enjoyable and it delivers all the goods  suspense action romance and drama  all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!".

Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received anOscar for it But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue action and a dollop of romance along with The Gauntlet Firefox and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one he's taciturn and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise it's above average. Clint is Frank a Secret Service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink which drove his family away and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch calling himself Booth who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual. And he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building grasping Booth's hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIAtrained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. Later Clint even has a short speech talking to Renee Russo about his failure to save the president in Dallas. If I'd have reacted quickly enough I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me. It's underplayed but his voice chokes slightly his eyes water and his lip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called moving. We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they carved a nation out of the wilderness. Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It isn't true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous.Talk about disillusioned. Okay he can ham it up a little sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes but he's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson as the chief White House aid is now back in politics a relief for moviegoers. If Clint's acting range is limited Thompson's is something less. In every film he's been in he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder.The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in Das Boot which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful crosscutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor  not only the usual garments but handcuffs guns beepers palm pilots Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted Clint lies back on the bed and sighs Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.Well written and worth watching.".

The clever use of a doctored photo by Hollywood whiz kids shows the actordirector stood at the side of JFK. A nice touch which is well worth looking out for.To be honest ITLOF is a cliched thriller the sort of story which crops up most weeks as a glossy no brain offering on Channel 5.However both director and stars took the well worn material and gave it a fresh spin upping the tension several notches with each passing scene resulting in a spectacular finale which is great value for money.Rene Russo is so good she could play the part in her sleep. The former model adds a degree of mature charm to her role of an agent who Horrigan believes is mere window dressing' for the department.As with all of Wolfgang's movies believability is everything. A rare degree of authenticity was achieved during the crowd scenes when the German filmmaker integrated his fictitious President with the crowds from the Clinton and Bush election campaign. The cost? A cool 4million.The script had been knocking around Hollywood for a decade before it was dusted down and given a green light. It was originally to star Dustin Hoffman who signed up for Petersen's follow up Outbreak. British director Michael Apted The World is Not Enough was due to direct the Hoffman version but when David Puttnam took over as the head of Columbia in 1987 the movie was put on hold.Producer Jeff Apple a man more known in the trade for his interactive shopping shows than films brought in Jeff Maguire to polish up the script.The idea of Horrigan as an agent who failed to stop JFK's untimely death gave the movie a twist that Hollywood execs found delicious.Before long there was a feeding frenzy over the new improved script and eventually Rob Reiner's Castle Rock company snapped it up for a million dollars with Clint Eastwood on board.Petersen had wanted Harrison Ford but eventually cast him as the President in Air Force One which you may remember was the film of the week a couple of weeks ago.As any Clint fan knows he's a jazz fan  a passion shared by Horrigan in what seemed to be a tailor made role adapted for old Mr Squinty after he signed on the dotted line.However Frank's love of piano and jazz was already on the page  a happy accident which helped turn Horrigan into one of Clint's most likeable big screen characters.Top drawer stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a wacko. As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into Booth's world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleonlike enemy who can get to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any.".

I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits.In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure but that I thought Malkovich was better.Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich a professional with a real or imagined grudge is the most dangerous kind of foe.Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff and would be president in real life Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm John Mahoney as the Secret Service head Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy GregoryAlan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.".

There's a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay but I don't deem their performance to be memorable.

Yet several other actors were considered for the part before him including Robert Redford. Eastwood who is now in his late 80s was a virile 63 when this picture was released and still believable as the love interest of younger costar Rene Russo.The biggest plot hole  if one can call it that  is that everybody wants Frank off the case because he is as his boss says too old for this sht. Even his girlfriend seems only to want to keep him around because she feels sorry for him. Nobody except for the wiretapping technicians seems to recognize the fact that since the self proclaimed assassin keeps calling Frank his presence somewhere in the vicinity is indispensable to protecting the president.In one of his more accessible and memorable screen performances veteran actor John Malkovich plays Mitch a villain whose intensity makes you believe he is capable of anything. Although he has been in over sixty movies and TV productions most moviegoers have probably seen Malkovich rarely usually in supporting or even cameo roles. He is almost anonymous despite having appeared in such popular movies as Con Air 1997 and the eponymous cult film Being John Malkovich 1999.There is a scene in which Mitch meets two hunters who see too much and right before he kills them Mitch confesses that he plans to assassinate the president. Why would you want to do that? asks one of the hunters in stunned horror. It does not matter what these men think of the president who is portrayed as a vapid chameleon. This movie belongs to a quaint time when the idea of assassinating any president of the United States struck the overwhelming majority of Americans as plain wrong even if you thought the occupant of the White House was an execrable son of a bitch.".

	schema:reviewBody "As much as I like Clint Eastwood I have to say this was not his finest hour. This film was filled with way too many mistakes that also took one too many liberties with the facts. Clint Eastwood plays Frank Harrigan a Secret Service agent that at one time was assigned to protect President Kennedy. When President Kennedy was assassinated frank felt he did not do his duty by protecting the President and has carried the guilt ever since. Now 30 years have passed and Frank Harrigan is still a Secret Service agent again assigned to protect the President and this time he will not make the same mistakes. Here is the first problem I have with this film. Frank had a lot of health problems being an old man now and at one point while running along the President's Limo he can be seen coughing and gagging barely able to keep up. Now do you really think that such an old tired sick man would be allowed to protect the president? I don't think so. The second problem is Rene Russo's character as Special Agent Lilly Raines. She serves no useful purpose except to look sexy for the camera and there is even an absurd scene where she is on duty in a tight dress which the secret service would have never allowed and Frank asked here where her gun is hidden and she replies  Wouldn't you like to know. Give me a break. Of course we know there will be an attempt on the President life in which sick tired old man frank with redeem himself.The only standout in this film was the performance of John Malkovich as the would be assassin. Other than that avoid this mess...".

	schema:reviewBody "In the cinema as in most areas of life one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences. Two years after Dances with Wolves one of the two great Westerns of the early nineties Kevin Costner its director and star appeared in The Bodyguard a film about a former Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination attempt on President Reagan and who now has to try and prevent another assassination. A year after the other great Western of the early nineties Unforgiven its director and star Clint Eastwood appeared in In the Line of Fire a film about a Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination of President Kennedy and who now has to try and prevent another assassination.There are of course differences between the two films. In The Bodyguard Costner's character Frank Farmer has left the Secret Service and now works as a private bodyguard for a female showbiz star. Eastwood's character Frank Horrigan still works for the Service. Whereas Farmer is still a comparatively young man Horrigan is an elderly man approaching retirement worried about whether he is still physically fit enough to cope with the demands of the job. Eastwood was sixtythree at the time. Just as Unforgiven was Eastwood's final entry in the Western genre in which he made his name in the fifties and sixties so he seemed to be using In the Line of Fire and A Perfect World made in the same year as his farewell to the cop thriller another genre which he had come to make his own in the seventies and eighties.In In the Line of Fire Horrigan must thwart a plot to murder the current President by an assassin. There is also a subplot about a growing romance between Horrigan and a younger female colleague Lilly Raines. Rene Russo thirtynine at the time the film was made was often regarded in the nineties as one of Hollywood's glamorous older women but this did not prevent her from being cast here as the loveinterest of a man old enough to be her father.This may seem like the plot of an ordinary political thriller. Although there is plenty in the way of thrills and excitement it is raised above the level of the ordinary by Wolfgang Petersen's taut direction and by the standards of acting particularly the duel between Eastwood and John Malkovich as the assassin who calls himself Booth after the murderer of President Lincoln. Unlike the real John Wilkes Booth however this man is no political fanatic. He is a psychopathic former CIA operative named Leary with no ideological motive for killing the President who always remains an anonymous figure. We never learn whether he is a Republican or Democrat or even his name. Leary's motivation seems to be taedium vitae a belief in the purposelessness of life and a desire for notoriety at all costs even the cost of his own life and he gets a thrill out of taunting Horrigan to whom he has announced his intention to assassinate the President and playing psychological mindgames with him. He knows that Horrigan's weakness is his sense of guilt stemming from the Kennedy assassination and plays on it ruthlessly. Malkovich plays him as intelligent but unhinged at times insinuating at others raving and he contrasts strongly with Eastwood's decent but haunted Horrigan. The result is one of the more intelligent political thrillers of the nineties on a par with Eastwood's later effort Absolute Power. 710".

It has all the prerequisites for an exciting thriller an oddball assassin planning to kill the President a Secret Service agent determined to stop him a long cat  mouse game between them a beautiful woman the agent has an affair with... all tried and true plot devices. The Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan is a hardheaded loner the last surviving member of the detail that guarded John Kennedy when he was shot and killed. All these potentially exciting elements never really come together and the film has a cutanddried paintbythenumbers feel to it. The various subplots come across as clichd for instance we instinctively know early on that Horrigan Clint Eastwood will fall out of favor with his superiors. We know he and the beautiful Secret Service agent Lily Raines Rene Russo even though she apparently can't stand him will have an affair. We know the nutcase assassin John Malkovich will come within a hair's breadth of killing the President. And of course we know Horrigan will prevent it on duty or not. Granted the movie delivers all this competently Eastwood as always is fun to watch and some of his dry dialogue is effective. But an air of the routine permeates the film. There is nothing particularly scary about Mitch Leary he's more annoying than anything in his phone calls to Horrigan when he taunts the agent for failing to protect Kennedy all those years ago. Nothing in the film is very subtle or mysterious. It is suggested that Horrigan is too old for his job and sure enough in the next scene he is running alongside the presidential limo obligingly huffing and puffing to show his age. The film wants to be a cross between 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'The Manchurian Candidate' but has none of those films' layered textures or rich characterizations. It plays like a decently produced TV movie and taken on that level is moderately entertaining.".

Wolfgang Petersen a director always more at home at sea rather than on land displays little enthusiasm for the material but wrings the usual thrills out of the premise only failing in some ludicrously cheesy slowmotion shots.There are roles for a whole bunch of familiar faces and John Malkovich is allowed to get his teeth into his turn as a psychopath although it has to be said this is one of the less memorable villains that Hollywood's thrown our way.

	schema:reviewBody "Wolfgang Peterson's In the Line of Fire is cunning and occasionally a truly whiteknuckled ride even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before. How could one not when Clint Eastwood right after allegedly closing the book on his western legacy likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures don't count Blood Work in there. But there's more than that because Eastwood's character here a hardbitten demonridden and hard as nails secret service agent has a slightly charming side to him even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines. There is some complexities going on here that don't rely on just the usual swagger and it's noteworthy for how such a possibly contrived back story didn't save Kennedy from being assassinated in 63 is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona which more than likely hides his wounds most of the time. Eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film however and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him.But there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional we still get the 'Harry' type scenes of him being smarter and as smartass over everyone else in the room and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass here a chief of staff including here protecting a president that wisely we never really see or know at all. Even the romantic subplot which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs would make the picture a little subpar if the other quasiDirty Harry aspect didn't come into the picture an indelible villain. This time there's some extra Hollywood suspense however brillaintly intelligent suspense almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves with the John Booth character played in an Oscar nominated performance by John Malkovich as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin. There's ways this could go wrong with the Eastwood character but Malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and uncollected there's that devastating cringeworthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate and as his past is revealed there's still that element of 'what the hell is with this guy' that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism.It's also aside from the conventional points just a sleekly made picture from Peterson and company and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of Don Siegel. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to Vertigo jumping from rooftop to rooftop hero dangling from the ledge the 'twist' it still provides some shivers down my spine. There's also the phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game probably another kick in the ribs to Hithcock. But in the end even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over at least in the suspensemovie sense. Eastwod's a great lead Russo plays the female possible loveinterest sincere and mature and Malkovich is top of the pops. There's also a few notable supporting roles too and a fine studio score in there. One of the better films of 1993.".

Horrigan felt that he could have done more to try to prevent Kennedy from being assassinated and continues to blame himself for this tragic occurrence. 30 years later Horrigan finds himself being taunted by a man who tells him that he is going to kill the president. In order to prevent another assassination Horrigan sets to work in trying to discover the identity of the would be assassin whilst doing his utmost to protect the President.I've mentioned in my summary that there were some minor plotting problems with this film so I will address these issues first it's established early in the film that Horrigan blames himself for Kennedy's death and sees this assassination attempt as a means to prove to himself and to everyone else that he can adequately protect the President. OK that's fine but I wasn't completely taken with the way that the story was setup it came across to me as Horrigan being on some kind of selfpitying guilt trip. This is only a minor problem because despite this Horrigan is still focused on the job at hand and therefore it's still very easy to develop a rooting interest in his character  I only wish the story would have been setup in a different way. I also felt that Leary's John Malkovich motivations were a little thin and not entirely believable. The pacing of the film is also a little uneven. Now for the good bits....Where the film is at its strongest is in the various scenes between Horrigan and Leary. In these scenes a slowburning psychological battle of wits begins to develop between the two men Leary clearly has the upper hand at the start but Horrigan's dogged determination soon sees him begin to close the gap. Director Wolfgang Peterson makes many of these scenes cold and menacing by not showing all of Leary's face at the start  yes it's not original but it's simple effective and helps to create tension. The screenplay is also relatively clever and had enough intelligence and depth to make sure that my interest never truly waned.The performances across the board are variable but once again it's John Malkovich that steals the show from everyone here. Malkovich is one of my favourite actors and his sociopathic performance here was wonderful to watch. Eastwood is also good here and I liked the way that the writers made his character feel believable  he was in his early 60's when this was made and therefore his character is human here rather than super human he has heart problems and fitness issues which makes sense given his age and his lengthy career in a somewhat stressful job.In The Line Of Fire is a very good film that is exciting suspenseful and intense. There are also very few dull spots which isn't bad considering its running time. It's a race against time filmpsychological thriller and the two elements mix well together creating a very impressive film.".

You'd think the idea of an arrogant millionaire businessman heading off to win the war against the Nazis with his own small private army of subservient employees would be boring wouldn't you? Well only Jerry Lewis would dare try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works I have to say brilliantly.I think that as with 'The Nutty Professor' and most of his other films this movie is testimony to his comic genius both in concept and execution. I think Buddy Love might have said You know true comedy can not only make a six year old hysterical it'll do that for his Dad too. Maybe a few nutty Nazis generals with monocles and a limp would dislike this movie honestly. If you only see one more comedy in your life see this one. Be careful though you might die laughing.

So it rankles him that he's declared a 4F something around the time that this film came out many young men would have sold their souls for. As he and three fellow 4Fs Jan Murray Steven Franken and Dack Rambo sit and commiserate about their fate Lewis has a brainstorm. He's rich enough he'll form his own army and equip it. I will say he designs some snazzy uniforms for his troops which also include his butler John Wood and his chauffeur Willie Davis of the Los Angeles Dodgers.Those flashback sequences involving Murray Rambo and Franken are the best part of the film. Even for an audience in the middle of the Vietnam War those guys all have excellent reasons for wanting to leave their current situations. Unfortunately the rest of the film isn't as good. The guys train on Lewis's palatial estates get the best chow any army ever had and then decide on their own mission which is based on Jerry Lewis's resemblance to Field Marshal Kesselring. If you believe their account they actually break the stalemate on the Italian front and later participate in the bomb plot against Hitler.Hitler was played by Sidney Miller and his scenes with Lewis as Kesselring are taken straight from The Great Dictator. I'm not sure Charlie Chaplin really liked this particular homage.A lot of World War II film clichs are dealt with here.

	schema:reviewBody "Which Way to the Front? is a hugely disappointing films...even for diehard Jerry Lewis fans. I personally WANTED to like the movie as ever since I got to see Lewis in person a few years ago I have really come to respect and enjoy his films. But no matter what I think of the guy I cannot in good conscience give this film a positive review because it makes the biggest mistake of any comedy...it's simply not funny. Additionally the film is set in WWII and looks as if Lewis didn't even bother trying to make the film look as if it was set in the 1940s. The hair clothing and sets look straight from 1970!The film COULD have been funny. It seems that the richest man in the world Brendan Byers Lewis wants to fight in WWII but has been declared 4F. So he decides to create his own tiny commando unit and he and his men plan on kidnapping a German Field Marshall who looks exactly like Byers. Each member of the team seem about as manly and menacing as a cannoli and one guy played by baseball star Willie Davis is black...and they go behind enemy lines dressed as German soldiers. I mention that it COULD have been funny. The biggest supposed laughs are when Jerry pretends to be the German Field Marshalland this mostly just consists of him screaming. It looks like a 7 yearold's idea of what a German SHOULD sound like. As for the Japanese late in the film Jerry dons big teeth and does an impression that is not only racially offensive but cheap and unfunny. But with no real laughs and the men dressed in what look like 1970 Armani uniforms of orange and bright blue it just comes off as bizarre and illconceived. Even Lewis' worst comedy Cracking Up has ONE hilarious scene aboard the discount airline...Which Way to the Front has nothing...absolutely nothing that will elicit a laugh in anyone. I truly think that if the audience had no idea who Lewis was they'd think this movie wasn't even supposed to be a comedy! A film best skipped...especially by Lewis fans. It's so unfunny I can understand why Jerry didn't make another starring vehicle for a decade following this one aside from the never released and reportedly godawful The Day the Clown Cried.".

	onyx:emotionText "Which Way to the Front? is a hugely disappointing films...even for diehard Jerry Lewis fans. I personally WANTED to like the movie as ever since I got to see Lewis in person a few years ago I have really come to respect and enjoy his films. But no matter what I think of the guy I cannot in good conscience give this film a positive review because it makes the biggest mistake of any comedy...it's simply not funny. Additionally the film is set in WWII and looks as if Lewis didn't even bother trying to make the film look as if it was set in the 1940s. The hair clothing and sets look straight from 1970!The film COULD have been funny. It seems that the richest man in the world Brendan Byers Lewis wants to fight in WWII but has been declared 4F. So he decides to create his own tiny commando unit and he and his men plan on kidnapping a German Field Marshall who looks exactly like Byers. Each member of the team seem about as manly and menacing as a cannoli and one guy played by baseball star Willie Davis is black...and they go behind enemy lines dressed as German soldiers.

When he started writing and  directing his own films what little talent he possessed was  overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his films would fail and  deservedly so in the American market they made money in France Lewis always  blamed everyone and everything but himself for example he blamed the  failure of this film on the fact that it was according to Lewis  released on a doublebill with the porno feature Deep Throat. If  anyone should have complained about that situation it should have been  the producers of Deep Throat. This is an absolutely idiotic comedy  about the world's richest man Lewis who is rejected for military  service during WW2 and decides to outfit a special squad to go to  Germany and capture Hitler himself. Besides the many faults this film  has the script is mindnumbingly unfunny Lewis' direction is  nonexistent the film has the look of a cheap home movie Lewis  apparently thought that surrounding himself with notalent  overthehill Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller was  a good idea he must have figured that they would be so bad they would  make him look good. He was halfright they are embarrassingly bad but  he comes out even worse than they do. For a comedy Lewis' character  is sullen angry and pushy the way he heaps abuse on his underlings  makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this  on a dangerous mission like trying to capture Hitler.  The fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding. It is  by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I have ever seenI've heard that  Slapstick is even more pathetic but I can't bring myself to see if  that's true or notand is to be avoided at all possible costs.".

He then decides to start his own privately funded army recruiting other 4F's.Decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds' they go into training.

Wishing to learn German Brendan plays a longplaying record called 'Songs To Mein Kampf By'. When this army sits down to eat instead of being in a draughty mess hall they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier.John Wood is very funny as 'Finkel' Byers' everso English butler. His best scene is when he blackmails a Mafiatype gangster into teaching Byers' brigade to kill.The script was not by Jerry himself but by Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso author of a number of episodes of 'The Monkees'. 'Front' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laughtrack.Where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when Byers replaces a top Nazi commander and after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front gets involved in the plot to kill Hitler  and Tom Cruise is nowhere in sight! . As the commander Jerry delivers a performance of such mindnumbing ineptitude as to defy description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the 'loudest man alive' stakes. It comes as a relief when the end credits appear.Perhaps the timing was just wrong  bringing out a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea.

'Don't Raise The Bridge Lower The River' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture.As the '70's got underway the new comedy icons would be Woody Allen Mel Brooks and Monty Python  fresher more biting and in Allen's case more human styles of comedy replaced Jerry's brand of slapstick.

A bigger problem is that the movie is simply not that funny especially in the first half. The movie starts off very slowly taking both forever to set the situation up and then to get Lewis and his team into the field. And while this is going on one attempted gag after the other lands with a thud.The second half of the movie is a bit more successful. There is an injection of serious energy by both Lewis the star and Lewis the director. And this energy does end up generating a few mild giggles. But I certainly didn't laugh at the offensive last scene you'll see for yourself when you watch the movie. While there are worse comedies out there both with or without Lewis it's easy to see why Warner Brothers only gave the movie a limited release in North America.

Non Lewis fans and critics only seem to notice Nutty Professor as being any good  They are so wrong it disgusts me. Everyone of Jerry's Paramount movies from 5765 were financial successes not just in Europe but in the USA  some reviewer claimed Jerry had failures at the box office during this period in the USA but again they are very wrong. There were only 2 Lewis films that didn't make bank from this era and none of them were Paramount they were Don't Raise the Bridge and This film  not that they weren't good films but Columbia and Warners never distributed them correctly but out of 30 films only 2 is a pretty good run in his home country the USA.Now to this film yes the first 20 minutes or so are very slow and tedious with all the little stories Jan Murray and the other 2 4Fs shpill  but as soon as the credits are done 20 minutes in it is as funny as any WW2 comedy made during that period.Jerry's impersonation of the German Field Marshal with the high pitched accented voice is funny as all get out  it makes for true genius in sound and film  his presentation of awards to 3 Nazi soldiers is truly slapstick at its very best His getting through the checkpoint with a Black German soldier driver played by Dodgers star Willie Davis is hilarious Echoes of Mel Brooks The Producers Dick Shawn are brought to mind and Hogans Heroes Truly a time capsule classic  NO you don't have to be a Jerry only fan to like this film but you must have patience as the 20 minute lead in is quite tedious...I say 10 out of 10 because the foolish reviews giving it 1 out of 10 are truly misguided and just wrong. A MUST SEE yes  watch it and pay attention and you'll agree a Classic  If you don't like Jerry Lewis loud voice then why are you watching any Jerry Lewis movie to begin with ???The supporting cast is superb  Jan Murray leads it  Appearances by great comedians Kaye Ballard Fritz Feld and Benny Rubin are just some of the highlights of this one of my favorite Jerry Lewis movies ever ...".

And the Twisted Sister references that no one picks up on are laughable the we're not gonna take it sign that the angry mob is holding and Dee's character Capt. Howdy. Yes it's in the Exorcist but it is also a Sister song. On a good note Dee Snider is a creepy looking character. The first time you really get a good look at him he's intense. And there are a few gross sadist scenes one involving piercing an unwilling man in the most dreaded of all places. That part made me wince. And that's fairly hard to do. Also I loved the fact that Robert Englund plays a character that is the exact opposite of his role in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Instead of playing the killer he is the leader of the mob going to find the killer. Krueger fans will know what I'm talking about. It's a brilliant and appropriate piece of casting that genre fans should appreciate. Overall the good outweighs the bad and I would recommend watching it at least once. You have to give Dee some credit there are a lot worse movies out there.".

Even though it deviates from it towards the end the original setup is pretty great. The ending is also pretty great and pretty exciting with a great bit of action in there as well. Most of the focus on this film is the discomfort one gets when exposed to extreme forms of scaring and skin piercing and it is a subject most get uncomfortable viewing. This is mostly played out in the psychical form of Captain Howdy who does look pretty creepy. His look though drives the film so I won't spoil it but it is a really disturbing and shocking look that will definitely get you a little crept out the first time his full appearance is shown.The Bad News This film basically relies on the belief that extreme piercing fullbody tattoos and scaring are scary images for the average person. If none of them are scary or frightening then most of the film's power will be lost. Besides that there really isn't a whole else in the film. It's not a traditional horror film in the slasher sense so for some it can be quite boring as there's no real jumps suspense or anything similar.The Final Verdict If any of the acts or ideas featured in this one are fears of yours this could be a pretty scary film. If not this can be a pretty dull experience. Otherwise it's pretty middle of he road and pretty forgettable.

Strangeland would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. As it stands the running time is only an hour and a half.ExTwisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for neardeath experiences. Hendricks is no pushover he's a pumped up sixfoot modern primitive. Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme. When he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sight.Hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims. He visits Internet chatrooms under the name Capt. Howdy and then invites people over to his house. They believe they're going to a party. Instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body. If it sounds sick it's because it is.One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her but arrests Hendricks as well. Four years later Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself actor Robert Englund decide to kill him. They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old self.The rest of the film I'll leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers. With the exception of Snider the acting isn't too good but it's serviceable. The direction is okay too. There are some humorous parts in Strangeland and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock. Overall this is a movie worth watching. If you love lowbudget horror films with a sense of humor check it out. You'll probably like it.".

A tortureloving maniac who seeks victims in chatrooms and calls himself Captain Howdy yep The Exorcist torments a detective when he takes his daughter. Then the maniac is arrested rehabilitated let loose after four years huh? in a nuthouse picked on by Robert England hung by Freddy and his hick buddies but then he's not really dead. So maniac goes back to terrorizing said detective who arrested him in the first place and promptly rekidnaps his daughter. Yow. I enjoyed this movie. The pace is all over the place but it never leaves you bored. Dee Snider Twisted Sister remember I Wanna Rock or We're Not Gonna Take It? Hell he was in PeeWee's Big Adventure is the loon who is obsessed with torture and flesh ripping and you don't get to see him for the first 45 minutes but when he does finally show his face you say to yourself oh yeah Dee Snider. The first 45 minutes plays like a freaky detective horror thriller with main characters then Robert England comes out of nowhere for about 20 minutes in a starring roleofsorts. The movie is fun for the average fan. It's an assault on the senses blended with cheese. Two good things at once. Features breasts punctured with torture devices flesh hanging by hooks and of course the Twistedest Sister of them all. Three stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wholly wow never thought I would see a horror movie that would have a story that would stagger around as badly as it happened in 1987's Grotesque. But here it is. A tortureloving maniac who seeks victims in chatrooms and calls himself Captain Howdy yep The Exorcist torments a detective when he takes his daughter. Then the maniac is arrested rehabilitated let loose after four years huh? in a nuthouse picked on by Robert England hung by Freddy and his hick buddies but then he's not really dead. So maniac goes back to terrorizing said detective who arrested him in the first place and promptly rekidnaps his daughter. Yow. I enjoyed this movie. The pace is all over the place but it never leaves you bored. Dee Snider Twisted Sister remember I Wanna Rock or We're Not Gonna Take It? Hell he was in PeeWee's Big Adventure is the loon who is obsessed with torture and flesh ripping and you don't get to see him for the first 45 minutes but when he does finally show his face you say to yourself oh yeah Dee Snider. The first 45 minutes plays like a freaky detective horror thriller with main characters then Robert England comes out of nowhere for about 20 minutes in a starring roleofsorts. The movie is fun for the average fan. It's an assault on the senses blended with cheese. Two good things at once. Features breasts punctured with torture devices flesh hanging by hooks and of course the Twistedest Sister of them all. Three stars.";

It's also in no small part inspired by The Silence of the Lambs from which it steals at least one scene and Se7en and as with other movies that have taken inspiration from those movies such as 8mm Feardotcom and Saw took some flak for that too. The title is a stumper I don't know what it means and it doesn't seem to suit the movie well. The shocking cover image is well chosen though it might surprise some that a person's mouth sewn shut could be found in the opening scene of a movie from the early 1930s Murders in the Zoo.In truth it's not all that bad. A young woman is lured to a party through an online chatroom and an IM from Captain Howdy and her friend turns up dead with signs of body modificationinspired torture. A large septum piercing found in the trunk of her car provides a clue I didn't understand how it could have been accidentally left or why it would have been planted. The cop learns a bit about modern primitives I think there's a shot from the RE Search book of that name and online chatrooms still a danger to the unwary today.Somewhat surprisingly partway into the movie we get a four years later intertitle and the discovery of a second set of victims seems awfully convenient. The ending confrontation is disappointing.There are nods to other movies as well as when a group of neighbors tries to lynch the bad guy led by Jack Robert Englund. This is quite reminiscent of the lynching of Freddie Krueger Robert Englund again by his neighbors in the Nightmare on Elm Street backstory.I saw the version on video and am not sure how the unrated DVD might differ.".

When it comes down to it she doesn't even have any lines in the entire film and her part is just a tiny piece of the puzzle.  The detectives in this movie are fake and both of them can't act for nothing.

Not much in the movie is scary and most of it is just a way for Snyder to try to freak you out with horrible scenes of girls tied up naked with hooks going into their bodies etc.  I wouldn't waste my time on this movie.

This is a good lesson and a good message so for that the film at least has something to be proud of.

There comes a point in the film where a particular thing happens to him for a particular reason by some particular people. I don't dare to reveal what but somehow this causing him to not only pierce but rape and kill.

I just happen to think that one of the most attractive people in the movie making business is Linda Cardellini and she is in this film. But she is wasted and used and her body is shown being distorted and destroyed in this terrible film. I think that it is awful that she was used that way in a film like this.

	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who don't know or maybe just don't remember Dee Snider was the head of the famous old school metal band Twisted Sister. Snider brought us such great anthems as We're Not Gonna Take It and I Wanna Rock. Now brings us to 1998 where Snider has began to write again. But he has shifted gear this time he is writing a movie. Dee Snider's Strangeland a movie he not only wrote but produced  and starred in as well. This is a fairly unknown movie because the NC17  rating didn't give it much help at the box office and lets admit it people SM doesn't exactly make for good clean family entertainment. But all that aside it is the story of two girls who one night meet our antagonist Captain Howdy  played here by Snider himself.  Well of course Howdy being the strange and sick person he is invite's the two girl's to a party where he later inflicts all kinds of disturbing pain and torment. Well after the girls go missing the one girls father Inspector Gage played by Kevin Gage goes on a search for his daughter. Through the help of his niece Amy Smart he tracks down Howdy and takes him into custody. Four years later Howdy is released a new man. But the towns folk want nothing to do with him and want to see him dead. Along comes Robert Englund as a redneck beer drinking slob who decides to take matters into his own hands. Wanting to see the demise of Howdy an angry mob breaks into his house and take him away. As fate would have it Gage sees the whole thing happen. Well the death of Howdy is unsuccessful and Howdy becomes his same old self again. Target 1 for Howdy seek revenge on Gage who could have stopped the whole thing but decided to just sit back and watch. So again Howdy goes after Gages daughter and Englund. What we have here is a trip through Sniders sick and twisted mind. There is something here to make just about everyone turn there head in disgust. Some may not even make it past the movie's box which features a picture of a girl with her mouth sewn shut. Definitely not for the faint of heart of the squeamish. With every good horror movie comes a good soundtrack and this is no acceptation. The soundtrack combines today's great metal acts with yesterdays classic styling. The soundtrack and movie starts with a dark and dim solo outing from Snider that sets the mood of the movie. It ends with the first new Twisted Sister song in a long time with all the original members. If you are a fan of the music or just looking for a good horror movie  a thing quite hard to come about these days this movie is for you. We ask the question does it have a cast of top notch actor? No. Will everyone enjoy it? No. Is it an entertaining ride. that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat? Yes.".

Strictly for those who enjoy human on human nastiness without much background.";

It's starts off really steady and talkative but still remaining effectively compelling within its moody and fearful superstitious framework but then it goes off the rocker becoming a ghastly if typical little shocker with some very well executed icky makeup FX for such a cheap budget. The deaths are few but they bestow imagination and atmosphere  however it's the underlining surreal creepiness that's held throughout which makes up for it.Dual director's Steven Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow's who brought us the hokey slasher The Dorm that Dripped blood and monster carnage of The Kindred minimalist setup is tidy even with its gritty look but they do a decent enough job with their touches of brooding suspense and jarring visuals. Limited resources and amateurish acting although Lisa Erickson was fair don't distract too heavily as the creative and unusual story is well thought out in its context of forbidden power and the temptation of it that simply attracts evil. There's just a sense of doom that just won't waver but while it might be a mystery to the characters it's not so for the viewer. Sometimes slightly muddled and random as there much to gather but it comes together in an ending that's nothing more than a final cheap but lasting shock. The eerie score accompanying only adds more to the mystical edge demonstrating an intense ripplelike grip. Susan Stokey's clueless character is somewhat grating in her selfabsorbed attitude and Warren Lincoln gives the film much needed energy as his erratically idealistic character investigating the idol to only fall under its corrupt spell.It would actually make a good interesting double viewing with The Returning 1983. Trivia note One thing I found somewhat unnerving is a scene in the film which I don't know if it was purposely staged or not. In the sequence we catch a reflection less than a second in a mirror of a bearded man dressed in black just standing there watching Stokey. I never saw this character before nor does he even reappear in the film. Nothing is mentioned. If it was one of the crew accidentally getting in the shot it was a strange place to be standing and boy did he look scary. Just look at the face!".

A young man named Jerry played by the bighaired Warren Lincoln is really intrigued by their story and becomes determined to get his hands on this idol which leaves him vulnerable to getting possessed by this Destacatyl. This leads to nightmares for Jerry's exgirlfriend Sandy Susan Stokey a journalist and various otherworldly occurrences.Noteworthy components include the moody lighting by Carpenter the excellent music by Christopher Young enjoyable visuals arms shooting out of a mattress and pretty good makeup effects by Matthew W.

After making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing three teenagers wind up finding it and can't figure out what it is except that since they found it strange and dangerous things are afoot. They offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual bologna. Although it is her producer who wants to investigate further especially if it means he can get control of the idol I presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol. It is a story told a thousand times particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare.This one was at least for me able to sustain some interest. Though low budget it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the lowbudget comeandgo horror fare of the earlier decades had nowadays they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets. We are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth despite a story of clichs. And though not terribly gory the special effects were done nicely.Again it is routine horror tale especially with the ending which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused but one that is not so embarrassingly bad.

	schema:reviewBody "The directors duo Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow released three divergent lowbudget horror movies during the 1980's before their paths separated. Perhaps they really ought to have stuck together for a little while longer as the quality level of their work improved with each film. Their first feature The Dorm that Dripped Blood is a horrendous and suspensefree slasher that is better left forgotten. This one  Evil Power  is a nonsensical but fun thriller about psychic possession and their last collaboration entitled The Kindred and dealing with a genetic monster even is a slick but heavily underrated mixture between horror and SciFi. Maybe if they had stayed together they would have fabricated some hidden gem of horror during the 1990's who knows? Evil Power knows a promising and very exciting start but sadly suffers from an overlong and dreadfully boring middle section. Pivot element of all the horror is a small statue made of clay representing an ancient Aztec deity with a hardly pronounceable name. The statue provides tremendous amounts of power to whoever possess it. The only problem however is that the power isn't a very useful one The statue brings out your darkest side and eventually causes its owners to transform into horribly deformed maniacs. The little Aztec bastard comes into the hands of three highschool students that learn about its powers during a sance held at an old abandoned graveyard. They wisely decide to give the statue to a newspaper reporter for further research but she's a firm nonbeliever of the supernatural. Her boyfriend Jerry on the other hand quickly becomes obsessed with the thing. Evil Power is well worth checking out in case you're a sucker for 80's horror nostalgia. The special effects especially during the first ten and last fifteen minutes are delightfully cheesy and gruesome. They're fairly wellhandled for being a lowbudgeted flick and include some gooey melting parts and impalement. The atmosphere is relatively sinister as well with two memorable sequences in particular. One in the graveyard and the other in the remote Mexican desert. There are some massive holes in the plot and quite honestly it's a bunch of senseless nonsense but I definitely don't regret watching this littleseen oddity of the early 80's.".

This one  Evil Power  is a nonsensical but fun thriller about psychic possession and their last collaboration entitled The Kindred and dealing with a genetic monster even is a slick but heavily underrated mixture between horror and SciFi. Maybe if they had stayed together they would have fabricated some hidden gem of horror during the 1990's who knows? Evil Power knows a promising and very exciting start but sadly suffers from an overlong and dreadfully boring middle section. Pivot element of all the horror is a small statue made of clay representing an ancient Aztec deity with a hardly pronounceable name. The statue provides tremendous amounts of power to whoever possess it. The only problem however is that the power isn't a very useful one The statue brings out your darkest side and eventually causes its owners to transform into horribly deformed maniacs. The little Aztec bastard comes into the hands of three highschool students that learn about its powers during a sance held at an old abandoned graveyard. They wisely decide to give the statue to a newspaper reporter for further research but she's a firm nonbeliever of the supernatural. Her boyfriend Jerry on the other hand quickly becomes obsessed with the thing. Evil Power is well worth checking out in case you're a sucker for 80's horror nostalgia. The special effects especially during the first ten and last fifteen minutes are delightfully cheesy and gruesome. They're fairly wellhandled for being a lowbudgeted flick and include some gooey melting parts and impalement. The atmosphere is relatively sinister as well with two memorable sequences in particular. One in the graveyard and the other in the remote Mexican desert. There are some massive holes in the plot and quite honestly it's a bunch of senseless nonsense but I definitely don't regret watching this littleseen oddity of the early 80's.";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film once somewhere around the year 2002 during a period in which I wasn't really in touch with the horror genre anymore  Now hey don't give me that look a man's entitled to have other interests in life and explore a wider range of cinematic wonders right? I'll admit I was much more into artfilmsauthorfilms and 'critically acclaimed masterpieces' at the time so when I stumbled upon a copy of The Power I was amazed at how utterly bad this film was. Annoyed by all the ineptness is perhaps a better description of my initial reaction. But during the last five years I've had myself regularly wallowing in horror obscurity again and have seen my fair share of irredeemable low budget rubbish. So I guess it was kind of inevitable that I would give The Power another watch at some point to try and reevaluate things. A friend of mine also an avid obscure movie hunter in his free time had not seen it yet. Reason enough for both of us to sit ourselves down and watch it over the weekend.For an earlymid 80's horror film The Power has a mildly intriguing and not too unoriginal setup Destacatl is believed to be an ancient Aztec demon able to control the dark sides of the human soul. According to pagan believes his powers are locked in an Aztec idol a little statue that looks like a Mexican salt shaker a student at a lecture 'wittily' remarks. The best parts of this film are actually the beginning and the ending. The first 15 minutes contain the awesome death scene of a professor who has been meddling with the evil powers of Destacatl some native mumbojumbo in the desert and another cool killing of a graveyard caretaker. The whole middle hour has the statue coming into the hands of some students and nothing significant happens during that hour aside from a lot of talking attempts at investigating the history of the statue things flying around in a student's dorm room and one guy concluding he'll be able to handle the powers contained within the idol. Of course he will be proved wrong because this is a horror film. But all these goingson are snooze material really. Then during the last 15 minutes of the film the guy who thinks he can handle it inherits the Evil Power  I never really figured out if it's the power that transforms you or if it's actually the demon Destacatl that possesses you  and we're treated to a short but amusing stalk  slash routine in some house featuring our two leading ladies vs. evil poweredup deformed guy. Plus an amusing  typical horrortwist at the end.So you get the idea here I'm sure. Cut out the middle section and you end up with an amusing 30minutes low budget short horror deformity. The low rent special makeup effects are bound to amuse any diehard fan of the genre. But in the end I don't even have to revisit my initial conclusion from 8 years ago. It's still a bit of a task to sit through this Bmovie with the painfully uneventful midsection the inferior acting the clumsy  rather pointless plot etc. So I guess I still retain my sanity after 5 years of shooting up 'quality' Bhorror drivel on a regular basis since I'm not going to yell Awesome movie! and rate it like your average Stanley Kubrik film. The suffering may have gotten a bit painful at moments but there were actually some benefits to this experience. For one thing I learned about this interesting duo of genre filmmakers from the 80's called Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow. From the looks of it these guys are really spirited genre lovers that started their careers by making films together. And their efforts got consistently better. Just watch their third film as a directingduo The Kindred 1987 and then compare it to this The Power and you'll see what I mean.In the years following The Kindred Obrow  Carpenter both expanded their horizons individually though still occasionally working together on genre outings. They collaborated on the pretty decent Dean R. Koontz adaptation Servants of Twilight 1991 with Carpenter scripting  Obrow directing. Jeffrey Obrow wrote and directed They Are Among Us 2004 which is a pretty cool little 'alien invasion' film. Reminiscent of the classics from the 50's  done in the spirit of the 80's with regards to most of the special effects. They Are Among Us is actually a better film than most people seem willing to admit. Or maybe the wrong people have been renting it so far or since it was made for TV maybe it has been caught by too many people who normally don't watch this kind of stuff. Either way worth a watch if you're into this particular scifihorror blend. As a director Stephen Carpenter revisited the horror genre in 2001 with Soul Survivors. Again a film not too many people seem to like but regardless it had an interesting concept recycled from the right movies I might add and was a modest hit on rental VHSDVD at the time and it features an interesting cast of young talents too such as Wes Bentley Casey Affleck  Eliza Dushku. I wonder what Obrow  Carpenter might be up to these days... If they'd ever revisit the horror genre in a collaborative effort again I for one would sure be very interested to see what they would come up with.And then there's the whole notion of Aztec myths and their use in horror movies. It's basically another obscure subgenre but when you look into it you'll be surprised how many films you can find revolving around such topics. Mostly sinister hardtofind titles so this opens up another path leading to yet another netherregion of horror history. A path I'll be most willing to try out some day.".

At the end one of the possessed men meets his death by melting away in front of two girls but it's not very interesting and definitely not gory.I wouldn't recommend The Power to any horror or slasher fan as there's little to be gained from it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yep you guessed it another deservedly obscure nobudget cheesy American horror movie which is almost totally worthless as a film. I usually don't mind watching these kind of films but I found myself unusually intolerant of this one maybe because it's so tiresome. I don't really know how someone can make a film about a man being possessed by an evil Aztec doll uninteresting but the makers of this movie manage to. It's not that the film is lacking in action or that it's totally worthless it's just so similar to a hundred others and the merit to be gained from watching is hardly worth the ninety minutes.The film does have a good beginning I'll grant it that. It starts off with the usual stuffy college professor being heckled by his braindead class but the twist here is that HE is possessed by the doll and causes one of them to have a major nosebleed. Soon afterwards he is levitated into the air by the presence and is gorily impaled on a flag pole jutting from a nearby wall. After lots more messing around in the dark and confusing plot points we are introduced to what look like the main characters a trilogy of nerdy teenagers who decide to hold a sance in a deserted warehouse at night. This of course ends in death with a security guard being crushed by a huge crate. It's all very unimpressive.The film's main characters as if there weren't enough all ready  damn are now ready to be introduced. First of all we have an irritating female reporter who is sceptical of the whole thing and also happens to be a really bad actress to boot. Her geeky boyfriend however takes an interest in the idol. Cue a possession which takes an age to actually get anywhere lots of dialogue and people wandering around in the dark so you can't see what's happening. It goes without saying that the amateurstyle acting is bad pretty much from the whole cast. There isn't a single character to care about either. The plot is clichd and trivial and the film as a whole forgettable and worthless. The only thing good about it is the music which at least manages to be spooky. The only reason horror fans would bother watching this is I guess the special effects and I'm sorry to say that they disappoint also.Most of the gore is saved for the finale in which a girl has her hand chewed by a waste disposal unit ouch! and a man turns into an ugly demon and pulses and disintegrates in what looks like a scene ripped off from the end of AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION. Probably my favourite special effect in the whole film is when a boy sees all manner of objects on his desk being attracted to his Aztec doll as if by a magnetic force. A simple effect yes but the simpleness and unexpected nature of it is what impressed me most and it's much more interesting than the tiresome yucky blood scenes. In any case give this nohoper a miss or risk wasting ninety minutes of your life.".

Dinan Myrtetus as the obsessed Francis Lott. Carpenter's proficient cinematography provides a fairly polished look. Christopher Young's spirited shivery score hits the stirring spinetingling spot. A cool little fright flick.";

Groucho did not think too highly of Keaton's ideas and embarrassed him at a script meeting. And though some of Keaton's gems still appear in the finished film such as the gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun the film was one of the weakest the Marx Brothers ever made.A better film but also affected by dueling comic egos was W.C. Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE which jettisoned the script for a series of duels of one liners between the leads. But the one liners were equally funny so the film remains a success.But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six film comics who worked well together. The reason is simple it is really three comic teams working together Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland George Burns and Gracie Allan and W.C. Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were paired in about half a dozen comedies during the 1930s usually with Boland as a somewhat bossy wife and Ruggles as a nervous wreck of a husband. Fields usually a single act was paired three times with Skipworth TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were the other two times. Skippy always figured out how to control or counter the larcenous activities of her man  it the present film she takes action into her own hands with the stolen money that is being searched for she knows that the local sheriff Fields is not the one to trust with this. As for Burns and Allan they manage to effortlessly involve themselves with the put upon Ruggles and Boland on their crosscountry trip by car.Ruggles quickly gets to realize what a mistake it was to agree to travel with Gracie  at one point she manages to cause him to fall off a cliff and dangle from a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1 photographing him on his perch and 2 correcting his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's humongous dog Ran Tang Tang is it's name does not make travel arrangements easier for Charlie and Mary.Fields has some choice moments. When he insists on shouting at the quartet he says he's allowed to do so  he's the sheriff! He also explains during a pool game the improbable story of how he got his undeserved moniker Honest John. You have to listen carefully to the tale as it is interrupted with his attempts to play pool a few times once getting accidentally beaned by a billiard ball but it does show that there were items that even Fields would have had no reason to steal.Oh in the Summary Line I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page  he was the man who is responsible for the trouble that Charley Ruggles is suspected of. Bradley has to have a reason to leave town in order to catch up with the unwary Ruggles and Boland so he telephones his girl friend. He tells her to call back his job and say that he has to leave town because somebody has died. There is a pause as he apparently hears a question shot back by the girlfriend. ANYBODY! he says  clearly annoyed. Although the bulk of the humor in the film is carried by the sextet of performers Mr.Page happened to have the most amusingly unexpected line in the film.".

A couple George Burns Gracie Allen agrees to go but it's just one disaster after another especially when they get to a small town with a mixed up sheriff W.C. Fields. Considering the cast you'd think this Leo McCarey comedy would be much better known but it's pretty much been forgotten over time. While it's far from a classic comedy there are enough good moments to make it worth sitting through and especially with a 62minute running time. The biggest thing going against the movie is its screenplay which really isn't all that good. At just 62minutes it seems as if the movie is broken down into six tenminute vignettes and it really gives the movie a somewhat uneven film. With that said enough of those vignettes work thanks in large part to the cast. Ruggles and Boland are very good together and share some great comic timing and especially in some early scenes dealing with how much she paid for the ad. Burns and Allen really don't get too much to work with as the screenplay pretty much keeps him in the background while she gets to play dumb. Even Fields role isn't the greatest but the comic legend does what he can with it. The real star of the film goes to the wonderful dog who is downright hilarious during his scenes and especially the ones where he's pushing Ruggles around.".

Fields and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland are the central characters Burns and Allen take the back seat as the secondary couple along for the ride while the final twosome Fields and Skipworth arriving during the its final half acquiring less screen time than the others all gathered together for this one of a kind comedy.The story revolves around J. Pinkham Whinney Ruggles a teller at the Second National Bank and his wife Flora Boland of twenty years preparing for their two week vacation second honeymoon on a road trip to California. Flora who has placed an advertisement in the Daily Morning Globe for another couple to accompany them and share expenses acquires the company of George Edwards and Miss Gracie DeVore Burns and Allen along with their great Dane RangTangTang. To make matters worse Pinky unwittingly has 50000 of stolen bank money placed in his suitcase by fellow bank clerk Ferguson Bradley Page with the intention of taking back the cash at Whinney's first stop at Glen Falls Hotel in Glen Falls and leaving town with his girlfriend Goldie Grace Bradley. With George and Gracie doing some back seat driving Whinney ends up taking another route to Philipsburg getting themselves lost robbed by a couple of tramps Walter Long and Leo Willis and ending up in the small town of Nuggetville Nevada where the Whinneys register at the Palace Hotel run by Mrs. K. Rumford Alison Skipworth. Because they are unable to pay for their rooms having Whinney and George sharing one room and Gracie and Flora in another Mrs. Rumford decides to take Whinney's suitcases as security. Going over the contents with Honest John Huxley W.C. Fields the town sheriff who is anything but honest acting as her witness she encounters 50000 hidden inside. Further complications arise for Whinney when detectives James Burke and Dick Rush hired by the bank enter the scene suspecting him of stealing the money with plans of going away with Goldie which leaves Flora in a state of shock.At 62 minutes SIX OF A KIND has all the ingredients of a tworeel comedy in feature length form. With Ruggles and Boland doing what they do best their scenes are nearly overshadowed by the annoying antics of Burns and Allen whose very presence makes it totally impossible for the Whinney's to have a moment alone together. One scene finds Gracie taking Flora's picture as she stands by the ledge causing her to fall over when told to move back revealed in a harrowing predicament resting on a limb over the Grand Canyon. Another scene taking place in a store has George falling victim to Fields while attempting to buy a sweater. Nothing could really compare with the best known sequence of all with Fields attempting to play a game of pool and asked repeatedly by a character named Busby Tammany Young How did you get to be called Honest John? While SIX OF A KIND is notable as a W.C. Fields film this being his third and final opposite Alison Skipworth whom he affectionately calls Duchess this time around the movie was distributed on video cassette in 1996 as part of the Burns and Allen comedy collection commemorating the 100th birthday of George Burns. A decade later SIX OF A KIND was placed onto DVD triple featured with other lesser known Burns and Allen 1935 releases LOVE AND BLOOM and HERE COMES COOKIE preceded with theatrical trailers. Out of the television markets since the 1980s SIX OF A KIND was given a rare screening on Turner Classic Movies in June 2001 as part of its tribute to Star of the Month W.C. Fields. A silly comedy at best made credible by the six pack accompanied by a deuce with half a deck named Gracie. 12 jokers".

It's better. Much better! What we have here is actually the best of both worlds. All the sequences mesh together rather well  even when W.C. Fields seizes center stage and tries to monopolize the proceedings he is eventually brought into line. All the gags are so superbly timed it's hard to believe that with one exception they were rehearsed on the run. Director Leo McCarey obviously allowed the players free rein  and only once did he come to grief! The one exception is the Fields sequence in which the blowhard added a few more lines to a sequence that now runs just a jot too long. But I'm not complaining and nor is anybody else except Alison Skipworth of course!. Available on an excellent Universal DVD.".

Gracie whose proudest moment is the three glorious years she spent in the fifth grade owns the humongous canine who insists on sitting in the front seat then shows his gratitude by pushing driver Ruggles over a cliff! That's one pooch that can forget about his milk bone.Troubles erupt not just because of Gracie being always in the wrong place at the wrong time but an embezzler Bradley Page at the bank Ruggles works at who switches suitcases with him in order to get the money out of the branch. But Ruggles leaves with it and Page must get it back in order to pacify his moll Grace Bradley. On the road the gang encounter a group of road robbers then check into the motel owned by suspicious Alison Skipworth who along with her dipsomaniac sheriff pal W.C. Fields learn of the embezzling. Amusing complications occur throughout with Ruggles yearning for time alone with his beloved wife.This extremely short comedy has six stars and lots of opportunities for them to do what they do best. Fields shows off his pool routine the same one he did 10 years later in Follow the Boys which I ironically saw again only a few days after this! while Allen tells Burns about her wacky family including an infant with three feet. Page with his thin mustache and dour personality was a typecast villain with a voice that instantly gave him the image of smarmy characters who whether criminals or businessmen you don't trust from the minute you see them. The ending wraps the film up very nicely with a conclusion that couldn't have been done a few months later thanks to the strict production code that came into effect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The gimmick as it were of this 1934 Paramount comedy is the six comedy performers paired off into three manandwoman teams who all appear together. W. C. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as a smalltown sheriff and innkeeper. Fields seems to have been given the latitude to inject plenty of his own oneofakind brand of misanthropic surreal comedy into his part and it works wonderfully especially where he is allowed to do his famous pool table routine a digression that is totally welcome since it is hilarious.At first thought it might have seemed like a mismatch to conceive of a film to be carried by the subtle domestic comedy of Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland next to the broad jokey Vaudeville patter of the great husbandandwife comedy team of George Burns and Gracie Allen but here it works perfectly because of the parts George and Gracie are given in the script. They are there are freeloaders hitching a ride to California on Ruggles' and Boland's honeymoon trip and consistently find ways to annoy them at every step including brilliantly while they are each holding on to the side of a cliff for dear life.Making Burns and Allen comic annoyances to two sympathetic characters turns out to be a perfect way to fit their farout largerthanlife comedy characters into a real world setting  the comedy of people reacting to them in a believable way turns out to be as much as a goldmine as Gracie's famous naive delivery itself.Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy banker Pinky Whinney. He's marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard.The script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor Whinneys who can't get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more firstrate comedy material from Burns and Allen. For the precode watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as Whinney tries to get across to George just WHY he and his wife want to be alone for a while.There are a few signs of a rushed production here  the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with W. C. Field's own short The Golf Specialist and the knot in Field's tie is constantly changing in shape. These don't bother me though and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film.Six of a Kind is a real littleknown gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. If you're thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes.".

He's marvelously subtle and underplayed and draws laughs from lines that in another actor's hands might not even have been heard.The script is wonderfully witty all through and most of the way it's a perfectly extended comedy of frustration in which our sympathies are with the poor Whinneys who can't get a moment alone and the extra bonus is that what frustrates them is just more firstrate comedy material from Burns and Allen. For the precode watchers out there there is some rather suggestive material in some of the most amusing scenes as Whinney tries to get across to George just WHY he and his wife want to be alone for a while.There are a few signs of a rushed production here  the occasional jump cut one of the most obvious drop sets you will ever see in a movie right up there with W. C. Field's own short The Golf Specialist and the knot in Field's tie is constantly changing in shape. These don't bother me though and they shouldn't bother anybody who is enjoying the film.Six of a Kind is a real littleknown gem and one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. If you're thinking about whether to watch it the answer should be yes.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film stars Charlie Ruggles and it's pretty easy to enjoy his nice laidback persona. And later in the film W.C. Fields becomes an important character...so there is a lot to like. However I didn't welcome the addition of Burns  Allen as their characters inexplicably seemed a lot more selfish and nasty than normal for them. This combined with only a tepid appreciation of the team made this a harder than expected film to watchthough it did have some nice moments.The movie finds Ruggles and his wife the perennially perturbed and scatterbrained Mary Boland planning on a second honeymoon. This is in the form of a marathon drive crosscountry to Hollywood where they'll enjoy a single day! Now the idea of this being a second honeymoon is a bit farfetched to begin with though Boland makes this trip a lot more unbearable by seeking out another couple to come along and share expenses. Here not surprisingly is where Burns  Allen come into the picture. Now having the ditsy Gracie come along could have been cuteespecially when paired with Boland. However she and George came off as boorish and selfish instead of funny. First when it's time to leave they arrive with a 150 pound dog who takes up half the car. Couldn't George have warned them? This seemed less funny than pushy. Then throughout the trip the pair pushed Ruggles and Boland to dramatically alter their plansincluding sleeping arrangements when they forget to mention that they are not married and George will need to room with Charlie and Grace with Mary.In addition to the fun of watching Burns  Allen ruin the trip there is another unexpected wrinkle. It seems that a coworker of Ruggles is an embezzler and decides to use Charlie and his wife as part of his schemehiding the money in their car and diverting suspicion to them. The plan is to follow them and steal the bag with the moneyleaving the police to arrest Ruggles for embezzling his employer's money. But when George and Gracie insist on going a different route the embezzler cannot find them and is afraid he'll never get the cash.Now into this mess comes Fields in a nice small role. He plays his usual selfand that is always wonderful. What will happen next? Will Charlie go to the hoosegow? Will they ultimately murder Burns  Allen I sure hoped they would? Tune in to see...but don't expect magic. I'd have much preferred a Ruggles or Fields film...not this odd combination.".

I am so glad I bought the used VHS at a flea market.It is clear there was a great deal of choreography in this which is another reason I love it so much. It takes great skill talent and genius to move around the scenes like Mercedes Ruehl Dean Stockwell and Matthew Modine do from scene to scene Note the scene when the grocery carts converge the rolling on the floor during the shootout in Miami the Chicken Lickin' debacle the foot massage the salon hairwashing. There is a very theatrical feel to this film which may be the turnoff for so many whose poor reviews follow I know some viewers who don't quite understand this style mistake the exaggerations and overthetop performances for poor acting and worse direction. Not so. Jonathan Demme does a great job bringing to life the entire company and their respective roles.The opening credits and first scene rank among my alltime favorites as well another favorite opening creditsfirst scene Fly Away Home.Too bad Matthew Modine so ardently skipped out of the public eye I really like him and found his casting PERFECT in the role of Mike Smith. Actually this film is wellcast from soup to nuts everyone is believable and true to his role. As for the question of expecting audience to accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as Italians  why not? I thought they pulled it off perfectly well.Charming fun exciting... what is there not to like? If you want a little fun watch this quirky colorful adventuremoblove story.

The chemistry between Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine is impressive but Mercedes Ruehl steals the show. There is cameo participation of famous people and this movie is still attractive and has not aged after being watched many times along almost thirty years.

Here's the trick  the film is not meant to be just a comedy.  It's got some depth to it.  Like many Demme films it deals with people living in some of the odd corners of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves. Unfortunately the movie and home video industries don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the COMEDY bin.  It IS funny but a lot of the humor is offbeat.  However the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it.It may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining. And the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art unto itself. Michelle Pfieffer is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty.  Mercedes Ruehl is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can in a role which requires it. Throw in Oliver Platt Joan Cusack in smaller roles and the talented Dean Stockwell ... and even Chris Isaak and you've got a great cast throughout which here as usual makes a great difference.Matthew Modine is fun but more important he's a major hottie in this movie.  Hot cute and sexy.Sit back expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time.".

	schema:reviewBody "First don't be fooled by my family name. My mother was full blooded Italian so I really know Italian families and I LOVE mobster movies even the funny ones like this.For those people who have bad rapped this film you know who you are you should have your movie privileges taken from you because you don't know what good is. This is a damn funny and wellstyled film. The fact that almost nobody is Italian in it is part of the joke so far as I can see. And what redblooded straight male could complain about spending an hour and something with the likes of Michelle Pfieffer? Puhlease! When I saw this film it won me over with the opening song by Rosemary Clooney who was as Irish as one can get but her pronunciation of the Italian words in Mambo Italiano is flawless and sets the tone of what is to follow perfectly. Hell I even bought the record the next day because of it. Just the look of every garish thing in the apartment that I have personally seen in my relatives houses though not in the same place which I found hysterical sold it for me.This movie is like Goodfellas on laughing gas. I just wonder why there are no Burger Worlds and what happened to the food these guys were supposed to get? My guess is the crew ate it. The Fries are crispy. The shakes are creamy. My mouth is watering almost as much as it is thinking of the gorgeous Ms. Pfieffer. And I never trusted clowns anyway. And the three best things about this film are Mercedes Ruehl's achingly funny mob wife spurned Dean Stockwell as her philandering husband Tony The Tiger and last but DEFINITELY not least the great mugging by Oliver Platt who should get more comic roles. And note to myself find out where that black chick went. Ouch! Why does she work so infrequently? This picture is right alongside the great mob movies as it should be.".

Anyone looking for validation of Pfeiffer's dramatic abilities need look no further than her work in 1991's Frankie and Johnny or '92's Love Field a personal favorite of mine those looking to see what a splendid comedic actress she can be when given the right part should check out 1988's Married to the Mob. In this one she plays Angela Demarco the widow of a recently iced Mob hitman who moves from her garishly tacky Long Island home to start a new life for herself and her son while being pursued by Mob boss Dean Stockwell and FBI man Matthew Modine. While this movie has lots going for it a very amusing script offbeat characters sudden sharp turns to unexpected violence as in director Jonathan Demme's previous effort Something Wild and hilarious yet menacing performances by Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl as his jealous wife from hell Michelle steals the show easily. Notice how perfectly she nails Angela's undereducated Long Island Italian accent and the many fine mannerisms that she brings to the role to really flesh out this spunky and surprisingly bright character.

	schema:reviewBody "In my attempts to catch up with films I did not see during their original theatrical release I have reached the point of viewing Married to the Mob a film that I have heard about but have never seen until today some 22 years postrelease. Was in no hurry to see it and did not know what to expect. On the VHS cover it was called ...Godfather on laughing gas...by one reviewer. Well it was hardly that intense. The comedy in this film is rather subtle for the most part...because this film is not necessarily populated by comedians. But...I was pleasantly surprised. Michelle Pfeiffer gave a pretty good performance as a vulnerable mob wife who is very deep inside a decent caring person. Her husband is whacked by a mob boss who immediately begins to make moves on Pfeiffer despite the fact that he is married. His wife is a jealous insecure basket case who would rather see him dead than see him with another woman. Pfeiffer moves away and tries to start all over...but to not much avail. But she does not know that the mob boss is the target of the FBI and other agencies who want to nail him...and at first they wanted to also nail her until she unknowingly falls for one of the agents who discovers the truth about her innocence. The film has its moments and I guess there are some funny moments in this piece of celluloid but not enough to really qualify it as a comedy. No sidesplitting humor just funny characters and situations that are not fully taken advantage of. Pfeiffer's portrayal is one of the reasons to watch the film...and the jealous wife of the mob boss has to be seen to be believed. Not a bad flick overall and I did not think I was going to like it at all. But I did like it...mind you I said Like...not Love. It is a worthwhile watch...and you don't need to be Married to the Mob to have a little fun...thank goodness it has not come to that just yet.".

Numerous luminaries just off the Highest Paid rack appear Ally Sheedy Isabella Rossellini Dudley Moore and the everwillingtomakeafoolofhimself Little Richard in a hysterical turn as the President of Cleveland don't worry it doesn't make much more sense if you've seen the film.I love Danny Aiello and it isn't often I get to see him in a lead role so I was inclined to like this movie from the getgo. Danny's great as an aging director who's reviewing his life and his work and finding himself coming up short from his childhood expectations. We follow the two days leading up to the premiere of Harry Stone's new movie The Pickle.

He reassesses each of his relationships with his first wife played nicely by Dyan Cannon his current girlfriend an Englishlanguage debut by the stunning Clotilde Courau his daughter and her husband both perpetually short of cash after growing accustomed to their father's celebrity lifestyle even one of his many brief exwives Patti whose Chinese accent is hysterically strong when she talks but disappears when she sings.The people in Harry's life are truly funny stereotypes exclusively played by talented people who happen to fall outside Hollywood's AList though a few have been there in the past.Ultimately the path of Harry's life leads him to realize that yes indeed he himself is the Pickle there it is... the Human Pickle who with warts age sourness and all is still a valuable person cue inspirational music.".

Dyan Cannon Jerry Stiller Shelley Winters. Stephen Tobolowsky Ned from Groundhog Day! Lots of little sight gags... the film crew is wearing pickle T shirts. Stone even has his own stalker Bernadette. I think this story is a drama with comedy bits thrown in here and there. Unfortunately the title and the summaries all lead you to think its going to be a comedy with some drama thrown in. It's also a little confusing since we keep flashing back and forward... sometimes it's back to Stone's childhood and sometimes it's back to when he was filming the movie. The film within a film is pretty funny and has some GREAT people in it... Little Richard is the singing President Isabella Rossellini and Dudley Moore. Some funny oneliners Pickle juice is now pressurized. and Let's get this pickle off the ground! My personal favorite is It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a pickle! The bible on VCR tape has some funny updates! Shelley Winters is Stone's mom in some type of nursing home and still has faith in her son but calls him out for selling out to pay his bills. That seems to be the point of the film  coming to terms with himself kind of a midlife crisis. People keep telling him how they liked his older films. He also has or had big plans for the films that he never made. Stone has a strange relationship with his much younger girlfriend Sometimes they are loveydovey but every now and then he lashes out and yells at her to go back to France. Odd scene in the nightclub where he visits yet ANOTHER one of his ex wives and she sings Goodbye Heartache. or someone does. Visiting all these exes is one of the running gags. Like everyone he meets wishing him good luck on the movie preview when it was supposed to be a big secret. He seems to learn little lifelessons from all the ex wives and friends he bumps into. Has an upbeat ending. Not sure why it got such a low rating. It IS a little offbeat but some funny stuff in here. Similar to Funny Bones with Jerry Lewis. another offbeat drama with lots of humor. If you liked that one you'll like this one! Written and directed by Paul Mazursky who was nominated FIVE times four for writing one for Best Picture. Dead you know. but still has two projects in postproduction as of February 2016.".

MAJOR discovery of a formerly hidden gem Claudia Black as Aeryn Sun.Having said all this of course includes the foregone conclusion that it's purely a matter of taste in the end.

It embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from.With such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where Farscape really comes into it's own element...It succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of Star Trek a universe with practically zero Kaos element! They ran out of ideas pretty quickly  kept rehashing them! Over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole. This structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues. I happened to see the pilot Premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if Crichton would ever Get the girl after seeing them all on television I was delighted to see them available on DVD  I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst I had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia...Farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights...Do yourself a favour Watch the pilot and see what I mean...Farscape Comet".

The characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force. As they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them bearing in mind that this is only a TV series and they are fictional.However it isn't the PC world of Star Trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with. Indivual story lines mixed in with an overall multiple storyarc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another.This strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut John Crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy strange alien creatures different cultures being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling. As he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate strongwilled and brave character is a joy to watch.I have watched only seven episodes of Farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons twofour and the miniseries. Maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five. Highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch. Buy and enjoy! 1010.".

The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.In short we start out with John Chrichton an astronaut who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black ironically known as Peacekeepers.Other colorful characters consists of D'argo big dude with a short temper and a swordlaserrifle. Aerun Sun former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan who's a plant. No really she is. She's also a priest but with a mean streak. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.Later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television namely Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley which is a name you should remember.One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake he keeps giving references to Real Life. Namely when John is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years one of his many complaint is that when he returns Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead.So Frell all the other series get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you SciFi as you know it will change forever.This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape".

The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admiration.In short we start out with John Chrichton an astronaut who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black ironically known as Peacekeepers.Other colorful characters consists of D'argo big dude with a short temper and a swordlaserrifle. Aerun Sun former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in buttkicking. Zotoh Zhan who's a plant. No really she is. She's also a priest but with a mean streak. There's also Dominar Rygel XVI an fat lazy bastard who farts helium and generally does more harm than good.Later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television namely Chiana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. She is played by Gigi Edgley which is a name you should remember.One of the many things I love about these series is that since John Chrichton ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake he keeps giving references to Real Life. Namely when John is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years one of his many complaint is that when he returns Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead.So Frell all the other series get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you SciFi as you know it will change forever.This series has it all. It's sexy. It's actionpacked. It's hillarious. It's Farscape";

The second season started out okay but towards the end you could see that the writers were starting to forget what they were trying to achieve.The good side Engaging characters at least in the beginning and an interesting premise. Star Trek meets the Fugitive. Excellent puppeteering and good makeup. The lead Ben Browder is an excellent actor and the female lead Claudia Black is also good. The first season was a standout season which isn't the case with many shows which improves over time.The Bad As I said most TV shows improves over time but Farscape seems to have gone the other way. While the First Season was outstanding the second was mediocre and now Season Three has begun and things could be a heck of a lot better. For one interesting characters are killed off and annoying and utterly infuriating characters are introduced and apparently going to stay on. These characters like the Jool and Rygel character have nothing to contribute to the storyline or the show as a whole but only exists to be utterly annoying and try the viewer's patience. As you'll notice it's tried this person's patience so much that he's stopped watching Farscape.Another bad point is the meandering stories. Episodes are now going nowhere with weirdness thrown in for weirdness's sake. Where Season One had a coherent story thread and Season Two was also fine in this regard Season Three is seemingly going for the weirdness factor which though not bad in itself weirdness for weirdness's sake is just...stupid. The show no longer has any focus and even the familiar characters are being annoying and trying the viewer's patience. I could no longer stand it and hence have turned this show off.If they keep going in this direction I fear what's ahead. But hopefully things might get better. Hopefully but until then I'm staying off the ship.".

I ride the adrenaline and emotional rush during the great episodes and suffer through the lackluster ones. However I endure regardless because of the core storyline that ties all the episodes together. What I'm talking about is the growth of the main characters and their love for each other. Let me warn you it is something that is absolutely irresistible to watch. I cannot recall any other TV series Babylon 5 Buffy Angel etc that smartly and intelligently put together such a heartbreaking at times and suspenseful ride.I think that at the end of the fourth season things were finally becoming tightly focused and I am shocked at the decision to cancel the series.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSThe entire purpose behind any show is to grow and change into something that it wasn't when it first began. I got hooked on Farscape when I accidentally wandered onto the Pilot the first time it aired. I was a few minutes in but that was when Scifi had an encore of all the Friday shows on Saturday morning. I didn't understand then what had me hooked about the show  all I knew was that I was indeed hooked. For life.It was new it was engaging it was delightful with a thoroughly entertaining type of humour and a singularly engaging sense of the ridiculous. Of course I loved the puppets but with the Jim Henson company doing them how could you not? but all the characters were wonderful. At the beginning they were flat and virtually emotionless but that is normal for both real life new acquaintances as well as on TV. But then they get to know each other and as they get to know each other they begin to change both as a direct result of getting to know each other and because of the things they get into as a result of meeting each other.John Crichton Ben Browder is a wouldbe hero who thought himself in his father's famous astronaut shadow. Then he gets the chance to go into space and gets launched through a wormhole. All of a sudden he's so far out of his father's shadow that he has no idea what to do with himself. So while the minitapes last he records his thoughts and feelings onto them as if he were talking with his father. Then he discovers he's being chased by an insane captain named Crais Lani John Tupu who has a personal vendetta because John got into a...spaceship accident when he landed on the other side of the wormhole. He's a Captain of the Peacekeepers who just happen to have this thing about intense racial purity. So when Aeryn Claudia Black happens to get sucked in with Moya's crew she gets branded irrevocably contaminated by Crais she sticks with Moya. Originally merely because she has nowhere else to go  being a Peacekeeper is all she's ever known  then however is when change comes in. Every single character has grown and changed over the last four years to become all the more likable. Even the most annoying characters Rygel Jool and most especially Sikozu have changed and grown to become something more. It seems to be a habit with Moya's crew  they've changed two big bads over to their side even if somewhat reluctantly.And they've added wonderful characters along the way. Chiana Gigi Edgley was a gorgeous temptress who had a dark past with a dangerous secret and a connection to another universal power the Nebari but then isn't found out 'till later. A Clockwork Nebari Jool Tammy McIntosh was probably the most annoying character to ever grace the show...but she ended up being fun and a lot more tempered by the time she left Moya. And Sikozu Raelee Hill was all books no common sense. Ironically it ends up being Rygel who takes her down a peg by telling her that he was centuries older than her and what he had learned the most was that he knew virtually nothing. It sounded better out of Rygel's mouthEach episode was an enjoyable storyline in and of itself but virtually all of them had a continuous arc. Some of the story arcs started in the early first season and still hadn't been closed at the end of the fourth. Some lasted through the season and finished when the season finished but they were all delightful.When the Scifi Channel cut it off after the fourth season they angered a lot of people. They gave a multitude of reasons for the cutoff none of which were truly valid. When they finally decided to get it together and make the miniseries to close out the story lines the fans were ecstatic. At least now we can get some closure.If you haven't gotten Farscape yet I suggest that you find some way to watch them all. I have never gotten into any show the way I got into this one don't ask me why it could be any number of things. The stories the characters the actors just the allaround cultlikability of it I just don't know. Whatever it is...it worked and I truly am ridiculously preposterously deliciously delightfully hooked for life.Wickedness".

The story follows John Crichton played by Ben Browder a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion. However during the first test his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners on the starship Moya and the Peacekeepers human enforcers. He is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners Ka D'argo a Luxom warrior Pa'U Zhaan a Delvian priestess Rygel XVI a deposed ruler and Aeryn Sun a Peacekeeper who has reluctantly joined the crew. With excellent special effects moderate makeup and puppets and robots that exceed the Henson standard of perfection as well as a very well written story and character driven plot FarScape looks to be a fantastically original creative and clever science fiction series.".

I haven't heard dialogue this good since Blake's 7.  In fact Farscape feels a lot like a Blake's 7 with good special effects and a bit more romance.Everyone enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I saw this series advertised just before it first aired I initially wrote it off as 'Muppets in Space' but decided to watch the first episode anyway I'm glad that I did as I soon realised I'd misjudged the series it may have been made by Jim Henson but it was clearly aimed at an older audience.This opening episode sets up the premise and introduces us to most of the key characters. The protagonist is American astronaut John Crichton he is involved in a test flight to prove a new craft that uses the Earth's gravity to slingshot it away at high speed. Something odd happens though and he enters a wormhole that takes him to the other side of the galaxy. When he emerges he is in the middle of a battle where a large ship is under attack. He is pulled aboard that ship and learns that it is under the control of escaped convicts who are trying desperately to release the ship's control collar and escape. When they do escape they bring one of the attackers with them a woman named Aeryn Sun who unlike the rest of the crew looks human.The ship is Moya and she is alive controlled by a being known only as Pilot her crew of escaped prisoners is comprised of a blue priestess named Zhaan a large warrior named Ka D'Argo and Dominar Rygel XVI a deposed emperor. John and Aeryn are initially treated with suspicion although it looks as though they will live or die together as Aeryn can't return to her people as she is now considered contaminated. Her people are the 'Peace Keepers' and one of them Captain Crais has made it his mission in life to kill Crichton because he holds him responsible for his brother's death.This opening episode did a fine job of introducing the main characters and their situation. The acting from was solid throughout even from the puppet characters! For a show made over ten years ago the CGI didn't look too bad it might not have been as good as the latest Hollywood blockbuster but it was still decent and didn't have a video game feel to it. The way they got round the problem of his understanding aliens by using 'translator microbes' may be as far fetched as using a 'babelfish' but it quickly solved the problem without spending an excessive amount of time explaining something that isn't that important. The characters are varied and interesting some seeming dangerous others mysterious and others comically. When I first watched this series on television I really enjoyed it and now I'm looking forward to watching it again on DVD... seeing this opening episode again reminded me just how good it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape I had no idea what to expect. I was immensely impressed and satisfied with Premiere. Subsequent rewatches however have made numerous flaws apparent to me that I missed initially. Premiere is not a great Farscape Episode but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular characters.The episode begins with John Crichton Ben Browder an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module a small space ship perfected by Crichton and his friend DK. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father Jack Crichton and then begins his test flight in space. Of course everything goes wrong and Crichton is shot through a wormhole and winds up in a distant part of the galaxy.After exiting the wormhole Crichton's module is pulled on board a living space ship. From here the characters and story line for the Farscape series are introduced in an entertaining albeit rushed manner.The regular characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. Of course there is Crichton played well by Ben Browder. He offers a the audience a sympathetic character to identify with. He's lost and has no idea how to do much of anything. In Premiere Crichton has to choose between joining the prisoners or the Peacekeepers. He knows nothing at all about either side but in helping Aeryn a captured Peacekeeper pilot it becomes clear that he intends to help the Peacekeepers. He probably would not have ended up siding with the prisoners if it hadn't been for Crais a Peacekeeper captain declaring Crichton to be the murderer of his brother. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation he's stuck with bizarre violent escaped prisoners in a faroff galaxy about which he knows nothing at all. Crichton's total lack of knowledge of the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during Farscape's first season.The supporting cast is just as compelling. There's Zhaan a blue Delvian and former prisoner. She's peaceful and reasonable as opposed to fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo a powerful and hardheaded warrior. Virginia Hey is totally covered in blue makeup allowing her character of Zhaan to appear cool and convincing. D'Argo's megamakeup in contrast is belowpar. He looks kind of silly with his giant tentacles and strange nose and there is something peculiar about his eyes. They look as if they have had some sort of allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape would give some improvements to his makeup in Season 1 but the overall costume would for me at least remain as a problem until Season 2.The puppetdigital characters of Rygel and Pilot are to put it simply excellent. Rygel is a tiny Hynerian Dominar who floats around on some sort of hovercraft. In Premiere he is given some good dialogue but not much else. Pilot nearly steals the show as the liaison between the living ship Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode Pilot gives off the appearance of being a real living alien he never once in the show seems to be a giant expensive machine.The Peacekeeper characters introduced are quite interesting as well. The Peacekeepers are made up of a race called Sebaceans who look just like humans. The chief antagonist is introduced in Premiere as Captian Crais who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In reality Crais's brother's death was merely an accident resulting from an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun a pilot who Crichton helps escape tries to explain that the death was an accident but Crais just claims that she is irreversiby contaminated and refused to change his mind. Crais obsession for revenge warranted or not it should be clear to Crais that Crichton isn't responsible is mysterious in Premiere but would be explained later in the season. Aeryn herself provides an extremely interesting character. By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers she changes her whole way of life and is in that regard in a similar though less severe situation as Crichton.The actual episode as mentioned earlier feels somewhat rushed and clunky. So much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. Also D'Argo for now looks kind of silly running around in his mediocre costume trying to appear menacing. Still Premiere is solid entertainment. The special effects such as in the starburst sequences are impressive. Most of the costumes and the sets on board Moya are original. Despite its flaws Premiere is a mustsee for Farscape fans. 34".

The movie starts off good but soon travels downhill. It takes a while for the movie to actually get going but it finally does. Oh and it has the one thing in movies that bugs me the most it starts off showing what will eventually happen. That irks me to no end. I mean I knew what was going to happen but it still frustrates me when that occurs.So it drags on and it drags on and it drags on. It's entirely too slow.I feel bad criticizing the acting here but it has got to be done. I liked Ariana Richards in 'Jurassic Park' no matter how minor her role was. She is just awful here. Seriously I haven't seen such bad acting since I went out and rented a Bette Midler movie. Oh yeah I don't like Bette Midler. Richards is just so...so...boring. She puts absolutely no emotions into her words which results in her character being not likeable. I at least didn't like the character. Susan Blakely on the other hand is really good. Good acting good character development no complaints from me in that area. William Bumiller wasn't anything great.This plot has been done so many times that it needs to be put to a rest. 'Race Against Fear' is slowmoving predictable and has some very very bad acting. I would not advise anyone to watch this. I'd suggest another TV movie 'She Fought Alone.' It's basically the same idea and I know that I said that all movies along this line need to stopped but it IS good a lot better than this horrible thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Broken Silence or Race Against Fear1998 Starring Ariana Richards William Bumiller Susan Blakely Tracy Ellis Ross Teryl Rothery Scott Vickaryous Marissa Rudiak Ken Camroux David Neale Bruce Dawson...Director Joseph Scanlan Screenplay Sara Charmo Jean Gennis Phyllis Murphy.This is another Lifetime channel film made exclusively for television released in 1998 directed by longtime TV series director Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by true events it's a lot like the majority of Lifetime movies a cautionary tale for women raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family a mother father wife husband and mentor teacher in this case track coach. The young and little known actress Ariana Richards she played the small girl in Jurassic Parkdelivers a highly convincing performance as high school track athlete Mickey Carlyle who is raped by her coach Kurt Ansom William Bumiller and must suffer in silence as no one believes her story except for of course her own mother Susan Blakely. Together mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film drags on quite a bit is ultimately predictable at times far too melodramatic for the sake of drama itself but is genuinely powerful in the end. Ariana Richards' performance is of the daytime soap kind but she is the strongest in the entire cast. Her facial expressions body language and overall acting is realistic in terms of how she as an aspiring athlete idolizes her coach is in turn violated by him and must now live with the shame trauma and further fight him in court. William Bumiller plays the part with a nasty sort of duplicity though he is far from subtle. He has abused other star athletes before who have remained silent and made it to the top and appears outwardly innocent. William Bumiller a lesserknown actors like the others has has never done a role like this but but he does a believable and strong performance overall. It's especially disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy lead actor in everything else he does including some lesser known films and on the soap opera Guiding Light. The only real problem I had with this film is the manner in which the film is structured. As the film opens we watch Coach Ansom about to rape Mickey letting us know right away that this guy is no good. But this makes for weak character development and story. If the first scene had instead been the sequence with the opening credits in which we see Mickey runningjogging in the city across a lake we would have better character development because we don't know that Coach Ansom while seemingly interested in the success of his star athlete is really a nasty piece of work and we would have seen Mickey idolizing a person whom she thought she knew and then received a rude awakening when she realizes she was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to drama for TV Knott's Landing Star Trek Quantum Leap The Outer Limits Lois And Clark Earth Final Conflict and movies like La Femme Nikitta. In 1996 Scanlan had directed another Lifetime movie similar to this Stand Against Fear 1996. He manages to convey the gravity of the event. We are genuinely disturbed by the coach lurking around the showers where he rapes his own student. These scenes are graphic and ought to be viewed by mature audiences but its message is clear sexual predators and rapists are not always a stranger and can assume different forms and their preying grounds can even include a high school. This film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and urges women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that rapists will cause no further harm to others. Despite other negative reviews this film does a great job in expressing its message and ought to be given to mothers daughters high school students including both male and female. As bad as rape is staying silent when it happens is even worse.".

There are so many great scenes and lines in The Book of Life it would be impossible and unfair to list them all and I couldn't do it justice anyway. Jesus is portrayed as happy to be back among human beings helpless as they we are he's compassionate but weary of the job he's been charged to do. Who wouldn't be? And God's kicked him out of heaven for some reason which was not clear or perhaps I missed. Another reason to be weary! Jesus and the devil have it out in a most amazing scene. Listen carefully there are some great lines that are almost thrown away. I have one complaint that has to do with a common and incorrect reading of Scripture. Mary Magdalene was not a prostitute. She was possessed by demons which Jesus cast out but she was NOT a prostitute. That was another woman.. .This was also my first Hal Hartly film and while I loved the antics and interesting movements of the actors the soundtrack P.J. Harvey singing To Sir With Love in the record store with music blasting in the background! I was a little put off with the ethereal camera work. It definitely worked for certain moments but I felt that it was somewhat distracting and I wish this technique had been used a little less. I'm one of those whose optical nervous system can't handle broad sweeps or quick jerky movements of camera work. Otherwise I give this film top rating and am a new Hal Hartley fan.".

	schema:headline " The Gospel According To Hartley";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on December 31 1999.  In The Book Of Life' writerdirector Hal Hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve 99.  The story examines the task of the Son of God who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life now contained in a Mac laptop computer in which there is also the names of the onehundred and fortyfour thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day.  Jesus Martin Donovan along with Magdalena P.J Harvey arrives in New York City to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his Father's will but he begins to have second thoughts must he judge the living and the dead?  Do they deserve what must befall them? It is a cup He would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment which gives encouragement to Satan Thomas Jay Ryan who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams. An artistically rendered high concept film Hartley presents the story in an intelligent thought provoking manner taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist.  The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city.  It's an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of Man's fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the Revelations of St. John in the Apocalypse the last Book of the New Testament.  And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality.  Christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie effectively blending in with the populace while Satan's attire is a bit more casual his appearance somewhat scruffy he sports a bruise above his left eye. Donovan is well cast as Jesus lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective.  It is of course a unique portrayal of The Saviour and possibly the best since Max von Sydow's in The Greatest Story Ever Told.'  He successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility of serenity that is the essence at the very core of the character.  And Ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the Prince of Darkness he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch.  His eyes are darkly penetrating a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares.  He's the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you.  It's a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's portrayal of Jesus. The supporting cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn Martyr Miho Nikaido Edie Dave Simonds Dave D.J. Mendel Lawyer James Urbaniak True Believer Katreen Hardt Lawyer's Assistant and Anna Kohler Hotel Clerk. In his own inimitable style with The Book Of Life' Hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting entertaining and truly unique.  He has a way of capturing life as it is just off center a method which works especially well with a film like this.  Comparatively short for a feature film running time of 63 minutes it nevertheless is one of Hartley's best and more than worth the price of admission.  It's a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later.  And that is part of the attraction of this film it makes you realize that later' most likely is now.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Hal Hartley's 'The Book of Life' and while not outandout my favorite Hal Hartley film it has all the charm one can expect from his work.Another reviewer complains of predictable and unbelievably straightforward not sure what he means jokes and a plot that rumbles on from one event to the next again not sure how that is bad but this is not a plotdriven or jokedriven film. It is ideadriven and brilliantly so as most of Hartley's films are. The film is only a few minutes more than an hour long but it has more ideas contained within it than most feature length films. Even though he claims that Hal ought to have known better and relays his experience that acting in Hartley's films is peculiar the other reviewer does not seem to truly be familiar with this director. If this person was it would seem less likely that they would denigrate the performances in the film which are quintessentially Hartleyesque. Martin Donovan who is a treat to watch in any film but particularly in his element when working with Hartley plays a disillusioned Jesus who has arrived in New York with his assistant Magdalena on the eve of the millenium to open the final three seals on the book of life and reluctantly unleash the Apocalypse. Satan played by 'Henry Fool''s Thomas Jay Ryan is also lurking about in NYC continuing to trap souls and grousing about the coming apocalypse albeit for different reasons than Jesus. Although Jesus and Satan are iconic characters this film as one would expect from a Hal Hartley scenario chooses instead to base it's characterizations of them on their human qualities placing them under rather than outside the influence of humanity. I believe that anyone who appreciates Hal Hartley's work or who appreciates  smaller more thoughtprovoking films would find plenty to rejoice about in The Book of Life.".

Dramatic pauses unique camera work off beat score memorable oneliners Satan Natural disasters...very profitable.Even Martin Donavon as the tortured J. Christ who suddenly realizes that revenge is not redemption. There is a humorous scene where Satan and Jesus meet at a bar do a couple of shots and discuss the future of the world. To some Christians this movie may seem a bit blasphemous.  But that is because they are too busy putting Jesus on some pedestal while forgetting that the Bible says he was just as much a man as a god.

	schema:reviewBody "In The Book of Life Martin Donovan plays Jesus who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with Thomas Jay Ryan Satan and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds Kurt the accountant from Amateur as a compulsive homeless gambler.As usual Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfullyframed scenes and urbanindustrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow. As usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contextsthe humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible. Hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous. As usual he creates a tone that is jaded and worldweary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest.  He moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poeticthe kind of writing that is so deadon and perfect that it's difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another awesome and highly entertaining film. The Book of Life is shot a digital camera? with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial handinhand with impending doom and a hyperawareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in it's last moments.  All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it. The final shot is spectacular. All this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon Judgment Day and urbanity.' Although it is actually quite profound moving and lifeaffirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful. The acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people don't get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollowthe same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway. As always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scornpeople put off by Hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniques but who has time to consider the opinions of such dull and callous fools? Anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this filmif they can get a chance to see it that is. It's hard to say what it would be like on video.".

Even to audiences new to Hartley I would definitely recommend this movie over the sophomoric Dogma. This movie is more intelligent truer to its source material the Bible and more fun than any of the other premillennium apocalypse movies. This movie is actually part of the French 2000 As Seen By.  2000 Par Vu series as such it is perhaps even a lowerbudget film than Hartley's other works. While the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate overuse of the blurryjittery effect. I'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable. But overlook this flaw and you'll be treated to a fine film. Especially notable is Magdalena played by P.J. Harvey relating how Jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene I found surprisingly moving. Despite the fact that it was NOT Mary Magdalene that this happened to the woman in the Bible was unnamed.".

Sure some of the humor in the film is of the carcrash can't look away variety but I feel underneath that they really admire the guy and his dogged tenacity. Another thing is I think Mark does show some skill as a director. Remember he has zero money shooting this stuff and Coven was conceived as a moneymaking venture so he could make Northwestern.  I think some of the samples they were showing from Northwestern actually looked very good.  Now I don't think Mark writes the best dialogue in the world but looking just at his photographic eye I'd say if the guy had any kind of schooling he might be shooting movies for someone right now. And finally I think some of the people making negative comments about this movie need to look in the mirror and think about themselves a bit.  OK you don't like the movie that's fine.  But I've seen enough smug superior comments on here to make me want to puke.  I love how as long as you're a poor lower middleclass white in America people love to throw around terms like white trash redneck and other such pleasantries.  I believe some scribe from Orange County at the beginning of the reviews even called them inferior.  I'm sure most of the people making the comments consider themselves liberals too as if they have any concept of what that word means.".

American Movie which commenced production not long after accurately portrays the person that I knew although in greater depth than I expected or believed existed.

Working menial jobs Mark lives at home in his parent's basement. He's deep in debt. And he has no professional experience. What he does have is idealism enthusiasm supreme confidence and enormous determination and zeal. The question in my mind was does Mark have ... talent?Reminiscent of Michael Moore's Roger  Me 1989 American Movie is both funny and depressing. We watch Mark write a script cast players direct edit and especially crucial in Mark's case find funding. With every one of these tasks Mark plods along frustrated but determined. All of these activities involve other people including his mom his spacedout friend Mike and other locals. One of these locals is his reallife Uncle Bill who looks to be in his eighties.At one point Uncle Bill sitting in his cluttered trailer demands to be fed before he will consent to being filmed. Later Mark being a perfectionist requires more takes since Uncle Bill can't seem to get it right. Mark to Uncle Bill You have to believe in what you're saying to which Uncle Bill responds Well I don't I don't believe in nothing you're doing. After take 31 Uncle Bill rebels Isn't that enough now? That's all for me.Some reviewers of American Movie have criticized it as pointless voyeurism into the life of a notalent loser. They refer to Mark and his cohorts as trailer park white trash. Certainly that is one interpretation and along with it the conclusion that the film is a sad commentary on the impossibility of achieving Hollywood's idea of the American Dream when you have no money to work with.But other reviewers find the film to be inspiring a cinematic pep talk for the underdog and brutally honest about the realities of indie filmmaking. These viewers point out that despite the fact that Mark had no money to speak of he still completed his film Coven and got it shown at the local theater.My own conclusion is that American Movie is a wellcrafted documentary useful for first time indie filmmakers. It's similar to a TV reality show but without the competition. The cinematography and the editing are excellent. Although I found Mark to be irritating at times and overconfident of his skills I admired his optimism and determination. Coven included as an extra on the DVD may be a cinematic train wreck. But Mark's overall experience is no less valid as a guide to others. In essence the message of American Movie is don't let this happen to you.".

I found the movie fascinating in the way people are fascinated by car wrecks and I found it funny in the way one might uncontrollably burst out a laugh at the sight of an eldelry person slipping on an icy sidewalk. It's a sick and guilt ridden enjoyment. The lives of most of the people this movie brings you in contact with are so pathetic that you can't help being intrigued. But lives hardly worth living do not a good movie make. No there was more to it than that. What sucked me in to this documentary was the perserverence and tenacity of the characters that carry on day after day in an existence that would drive most people to jump off the nearest bridge. People standing around in robes in  a forst in the dead of winter for hours on end to help a friend that will no doubt produce a film only 400 locals would pay to see. A barely coherent old man who's too cheap to use the phone for local calls lends 3000 to his nephew for a project he is certain is doomed. A mother who is as clueless as her heart is big sticks by her son through thick and thin. These things tug at the heart and despite all the pity and head shaking they provoke reveal a humanity that one can't help but be in awe of.Oh and the comedic moments are priceless. Uncle Bill steals the show in that department but many others contribute. The kitchen cabinet door scene nearly rolled me off the couch. Yep there are some priceless laugh spots in this film that almost make you wonder whether this isn't truly a mockumentary in the style Christofer Guest Spinal Tap Best In Show. But it's not it's real life making you laugh and that makes it funnier.Yes I enjoyed the movie quite a bit but probably for the wrong reasons. But so did countless others.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie about supremely untalented American filmmaker Mark Borchardt and his attempts to make a short film in order to make a small amount of money which will launch him into fame and fortune as a filmmaker is riveting. As they say fact is stranger than fiction. That is certainly borne out by this picture. Borchardt uses his friends family and assorted local actors to try and complete this picture.Borchardt is a character who could drive a novel or inspire cult members. One sometimes wonders why so many of the folks who people his film work for as long as they do with him. But in truth it's not hard to tell. Borchardt however misguided has vision. He doesn't have much talent and he has a drinking problem but he has a vision. He has determination and perseverance that others can only dream of. He has charisma. It makes him a compelling leader but unfortunately he is devoid of many great ideas. His lack of focus and alcoholism extend the length of the production almost indefinitely. He does complete Coven and even gets a premiere in his hometown theater but it takes him a long time.He never makes the movie Northwestern which he dreams of making. Perhaps he didn't have the vision to bring that movie to fruition but he did want to make epic films and leave the everyday grind of life in the US. He had his dream. Unfortunately he didn't have the vision to bring his dreams to life but he had an awful lot of determination. If people take potshots at Borchardt for his supposedly being white trash then I hope they are living lives of total sophistication and order because if they aren't they're total hypocrites. Yes Borchardt might exhibit characteristics of being whitetrash but the purity of his belief in getting out from under the life he had is absolutely inspiring.".

American Movie is a documentary following the unforgettable Mark Borchardt pronounced orchard I believe a highly articulate  charismatic Wisconson lad as he struggles to write direct and produce MidWestern a gritty lowbudget Horror movie on which he has been working for years. In Mark we discover a young man filled with contrast. His appearance is of the classic trailertrash stereotype  skinny bumfluff mustache '80s heavy metal styling mullet hairdo etc. To camera however Mark reveals startling wit  insight as he philosophizes upon life love movies  the American way. As the movie unfolds it sadly becomes clear that Mark's lack of discipline  heavy drinking are relentlessly sabotaging his creative efforts. American Movie is a charming watch filled with hilarious moments  vivid characters. Chief among these is Mark's lovable buddy Mike Schank a softspoken reformed stoner who having conquered an addiction to scratch cards is now dependent on soda pop. I absolutely loved American Movie. It generates real empathy between the viewer  principal characters and provides hilarity without feeling exploitative. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.".

But it shows someone however debatable his talentfollowing a dream a passion a desire to do something. To break out of his hellish life of debts and child out of wedlock and dreary 95 job. The camera captures wonderful moments of human behavior and just like project Greenlight it shows what happens when people get in over their heads with trying to just film a simple scene or a scene where someone's head has to go through a cabinet or an old man has to clearly say ONE line and can't etc. BUT a much better documentary about the same world is the much earlier 1975 documentary Demon Lover Diary  where someone tagged along as these Michigan guys tried to make their horror film.

At one time in my life I was trying to make films and experienced many of the same problems Mark Borchardt did in trying to make HIS film. And I also went through a protracted period of selfabsorbed arrested development where I refused to grow. But then miraculously I got married and had kids. I realized that being a struggling filmmaker was in all likelihood not going to feed my family. So I got a decent job and did what I felt I needed to do to make that happen. That is what an mature responsible adult does. Mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet and so in that sense he is a retarded adolescent. For this reason there is a hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote he seems so inept and selfdeluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has kids and an exwife and bills to pay but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision. Despite this Mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. Unfortunately Mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity responsibility education knowledge life experience prioritization financial clout etc.. Yet he trudges on much like Ed Wood apparently without any semblance of a clue. I guess we are supposed to feel encouraged by the spectacle of the never say die attitude of this noble individual struggling against the odds. And man what odds there are! Kiefer Sutherland Colin Hanks Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are all offspring of bigtime film or TV people no doubt they will all want to direct some day if they aren't already. How much room is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a guy hit himself in the head with a board over and over again. Come to think of it that is pretty close to what happens to one of Mark's actors with the kitchen cabinet door in one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie.Despite these misgivings and seeming criticisms I truly enjoyed this movie and would heartily recommend it to anyone. Uncle Bill is amazing. I have a friend who met both Mike and Mark and he told me that in real life these guys are just exactly the way they appeared in the movie.".

While most of us grow out of our pipe dreams the main character of American Movie Mark has yet to let go of hisand at a thirtysomething age too to become a wealthy acclaimed director.  Despite the fact that Murphy's Law won't leave Mark alone and something always seems to go wrong Mark is able to persevere during each deterring incident with an even greater drive to reach his goals.  His desire to be a director so controls his character that he sees any person or thing in his life as something to exploit to reach the goal.  While I noticed other IMDB commenters are lambasting Mark's selfishness I think it's an almost justified sortof selfishness because for Mark not becoming a famous director is equivalent to death.  He talks incessantly about leaving some kind of mark on the world and he sees filmmaking as a way to do this.Unfortunately any viewer of this movie picks up early on the fact that Mark has a nearzero chance of ever achieving his dream.  Is he aware of this? No not in the slightest and none of his family or friends want to let him in on the secretin fact even some of them believe in him.  Strangely enough though the disappointing future the viewer feels is sure to occur for Mark doesn't impede the ability to find humor in the film.  This is a very very funny documentary.  Most of the laughs come from when Mark is filming scenes for Coven. There's a scene where an actor has to have his head break a cupboard and it's just not working.  Another scene has Mark's very old uncle Bill saying a few lines to the camera needless to say after 20 takes of a lot of headscratching and linestumbling Bill finally decides he's had enough.  A lot of humor sadly comes from Mark himself.  His screenwriting which he seems to think is worthy of a Pulitzer is laughingly bad It's alright it's ok there is something to live for Jesus told me so.American Movie is contrary to what people might think a documentary that anyone can enjoyeven though my sister who watched some scenes seemed to think it was downright bizarre.  The fact that Chris Smith can successfully bring to the screen a film that inspires both sadness from Mark's depressing lifestyle to hilarity with scenes with Billwho unfortunately passed away before the film was released says quite a lot about him.  I wonder how the dreamer Mark regards this documentary.  Does he realize that it casts him in a bad light?  Or that it sets up to show him as a fool in many scenes of the film?  Or does he see it as something that will be shown prior to his own AE Biography segment?  It's an intriguing subject of wonder and I hope the latter comes true for him some day.I highly recommend this movie 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I deeply enjoyed the first 45minutesorso because I'm an aspiring filmmaker and it's both amusing and insightful to behold the mishaps that go on when making a low lowbudget film.  But past that point the movie drifts off fixating on Mark Borchardt's family life which isn't very interesting.  Hell neither is my family life but you don't see me releasing my home videos for the whole viewing public to see.  Borchardt's rantings are often funny sometimes you're laughing with him other times at him but sometimes they get annoying.  I would compare Mark to Ed Wood in his perseverance but other than that and the fact that both their films are beyond terrible they're quite different.  Mark is very paranoid and if he doesn't get the shot the way he likes it he throws a fit.  Ed was very confident and if the first take would turn out halfway decent he'd yell Cut and print!  I mean if you're gonna be a bad filmmaker act like a bad filmmaker.  Don't pretend like you're Stanley Kubrick.  But those are my criticisms about Mark and not the movie.  The movie isn't bad but the first 45 minutes are the best and the rest is pretty much downhill.  I don't care about Mark passing out on the couch watching the Oscars or watching the Green Bay Packers play on television while he sips beer like no tomorrow.  In a way documentaries are good because they hold a mirror up to reality and we don't see enough reality in mainstream film.  But reality isn't always interesting.  If you want to see a consistently interesting documentary watch Roger and Me which contains a wide variety of characters who are each quirky and amusing in their own ways.  All I really cared about was Mark's pursuit in making the great American movie no matter how far from great it really is.  So if the movie concentrated on that and the running time was trimmed I would've found it much more fascinating.  My score  6 out of 10".

Mark is a movie devotee who clearly has at least put in the time watching and studying film. He has grand plans to become an established filmmaker in his own right he just needs to make his debut short film to drum up some money so that he can make his name with a full length feature.The film will be called NorthWestern and while early goings of this documentary introduce us to many people already associated and indoctrinated into the process it is clear early that this won't be a tale of cinematic triumph against the odds.Even Mark's most ardent supporters admit that years have passed with little or no progress. Mark is idealistic ambitious passionate and sincere. But he is also delusional at times ill equipped and has a chasm between his ideas and capabilities.Low budget is low budget and it worked for Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell but Mark is an ideas man without a clue. In any case the intrigue isn't what the film will be like or even if it will be finished it is the people dragged into Mark's life because or at times despite the film.Mark's Mum is his biggest supporter his Dad seems to be hopeful but doubting and resentful of Mark's open animosity and hatred of a 9  5 existence seeing as that is what his Dad himself did. Mark has kids exes a girlfriend cast and crew to deal with day by day. But it seems only one true friend in Mike Shenk who deserves his own movie  I'll get to him and dear old Uncle Bill.Bill is an elderly man who Mark nags incessantly for money ahem film financing capital with tales of future Scorcese style glory and Snyder sized box office returns until poor old Uncle Bill gets exhausted and relents again fully expecting never to see a penny for his outlay.It seems Mark's unerring sense of self belief and endless optimism convinces others to get involved without the slightest assurance or inkling that anything will ever eventuate.But even Mark has doubt at times it is obvious to all that when he drinks his resentment of authority and a more hardworking existence rise quickly to the surface and he lacks the ability to say no to alcohol allowing it to set himself further and further behind both financially and cinematically.But enough with the serious stuff. American Movie is a well made doco about a man trying to make his own personal Citizen Cain with a Troll 2 budget and skillset. Mark is enigmatic and at times compelling but it is Mike Shenk who provides the reason to watch American Movie.Mike is a self confessed unemployed former habitual drug user. He never seems there even though he is right there. His dazed expression and half breathed high pitched voice continually suggest a room with the Vacant signs up and his bizarre stories to nowhere only provide further assurance.In limited screen time Mike steals the film with his rambling stories acoustic guitar noodlings and tales of personal punishment suffered through his previous drug abuse all laced with a familiar blank smile and a shrill girlish laugh.When Mike steps to the mic Beastie Boys style late in the film and lets loose with the most bloodcurdling scream I can recall on film for audio looping it is simultaneously incredible bewildering and hilarious that this deathwail can come from such an unassuming stoner.Final Rating  6  10. Mark Borchardt is a walking drinking profane bespectacled dichotomy and evidence that film smarts don't necessarily mean smart films. On this occasion it does make for compelling viewing  albeit perhaps more about a man triumphing over his limited abilities.".

Borchardt's got the Milwaukee drawl they play off in 'Fargo' and he refuses to accept that Coven isn't pronounced CoveAnn.

It takes a lot of attempts to get this money shot for 'Coven' while Tom's head steadily gets softer on top.Yet that cupboard scene moment is actually a good indication of why 'American Movie' is a real good 'un. Tom takes the repeated bashes on his head with good humour. There's a real sense in the movie that people are pulling together to try to make a film. Borchardt is a bit of a jerk when he's drunk but he's got a dream and he's going for it.But the star of the movie is Uncle Bill a curmudgeonly 83 year old who fronts the money for 'Coven' and occasionally busts into a song about his life Goodbye dear hope you're in heaven where you belong  I was wondering if they had cigarettes in heaven I don't think so  I still love you I'll visit your grave every day  Not every day but I'll visit it sometimes if I ever find it.And... you know what...

	schema:reviewBody "Menomonee Falls Wisconsin.  Mark Borchardt dreams about becoming a famous film maker.  He is trying to produce a low budget horror flic using whatever he can at his disposal friends frustrated family members etc... Problem is Mark has great ideas but can't seem to focus on one thing as his mind races at 500 miles an hour.  Enlisting his zombie druggie friend he tries to produce 'Coven' which Mark continualy pronounces KOVEN instead of CUVEN in order to make his dream.This documentary is BIZARRE!  Mark's ambition is totaly blind to the fact that he is totaly in debt has 3 kids to support trying to make a film to get him on the road to the 'American dream'.  His family and his zombie friend in particular produce a lot of laughs but the film is also sharp in showing the problems Mark faces.  The camera is there when he's fighting with his exgirlfriend when he's trying to borrow money again from his uncle and so on.A lot of reviews have called this a riot of a film but even though it has some very funny moments most of the film is bleak.  It's funny seeing Mark taking one of his actors and slamming his head through a cupboard door over and OVER again then realising he's actualy broken his moms kitchen and has to repair it yet I kept feeling really bad for Mark and at times became very depressed watching his failures.  But the movie is full of hope as he is DETERMINED to get this film done so he can get make something better of his life.  But that's what the chase for the American dream is all about. As a documentary its pretty slow paced compared to others I have seen but it is OK.Funny Note  Mark's zombie friend plays guitar and a lot of times the film has his music playing in the documentary.  The key one that keeps playing over and over is his rendition of Metalica's 'Fight fire with fire' acousticaly.  That was a riot.Rating 6 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Menomonee Falls Wisconsin.  Mark Borchardt dreams about becoming a famous film maker.  He is trying to produce a low budget horror flic using whatever he can at his disposal friends frustrated family members etc... Problem is Mark has great ideas but can't seem to focus on one thing as his mind races at 500 miles an hour.  Enlisting his zombie druggie friend he tries to produce 'Coven' which Mark continualy pronounces KOVEN instead of CUVEN in order to make his dream.This documentary is BIZARRE!  Mark's ambition is totaly blind to the fact that he is totaly in debt has 3 kids to support trying to make a film to get him on the road to the 'American dream'.  His family and his zombie friend in particular produce a lot of laughs but the film is also sharp in showing the problems Mark faces.  The camera is there when he's fighting with his exgirlfriend when he's trying to borrow money again from his uncle and so on.A lot of reviews have called this a riot of a film but even though it has some very funny moments most of the film is bleak.  It's funny seeing Mark taking one of his actors and slamming his head through a cupboard door over and OVER again then realising he's actualy broken his moms kitchen and has to repair it yet I kept feeling really bad for Mark and at times became very depressed watching his failures.

Donald Richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gutwrenching recent Hollywood fare as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 1998.FIRES ON THE PLAIN is universally considered to be one of its director's top efforts and out of the several films of Ichikawa I've watched the closest to it in spirit are THE BURMESE HARP 1956 another characterdriven war film but with a spiritual tone and which is also available on DVD from Criterion and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION 1958 which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally as part of a foreignfilm week a couple of years ago. Personally I also have a particular soft spot for the director's stunningly stylized color extravaganza AN ACTOR'S REVENGE 1963 which I've actually caught twice at the NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned 2002 retrospective.".

Tamura begins to care for the wounded girl but pushes her out of the way when he discovers a hidden cache of salt. He soon continues his journey to no real destination. Fires on the Plain is a brutal film which depicts the remnants of the once powerful Japanese army struggling to survive but without any hope of ever being truly rescued. These soldiers just want to live for a few hours longer their primal instincts to survive much stronger than dieing in service of the Emperor. A will to survive that will even make some of them eat Monkey Meat. However even in this bleak film there are some signs of humanity. Tamura although tubercular and emancipated willingly shares his few rations and his precious salt even when he has little. There are moments of semi friendship between Tamura and the stragglers and also between Tamura and another soldier named Nagamatsu however the outlook is bleak for our pleasant spoken Tamura.

Well this happens just in the first five minutes of the moviea lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender yet they are starving. Plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier DOES try to surrender but is gunned down. This happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering Japanese soldiers boobytrapped themselves to blow up when they came near. In addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film I have seen. In addition cannibalism cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty realistic and depressingly realistic film. You simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. Horrible but great because it IS warnot a sanitized Hollywood version of war.".

Fires on the Plain shows a different reality troops pathetically undersupplied demoralized and starved to the point of cannibalism. They euphemistically refer to human flesh as monkey meat. The movie and novel on which it was based also put to death the myth that Japanese soldiers all preferred death to surrender They had good reason to believe that their enemies were in no mood to take prisoners.

	schema:reviewBody "Nobi or Fires On the Plain is a film that is so excellent on so many levels that not enough good things can be said about it. My only regret is that I was not able to see this 1959 film sooner.Being something of a film purist I tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume. Ultimately I want to know if the film is truthful enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think.Fires on the Plain is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe.Ichikawa's film is a condemnation of war on all levels  as any good war film should be. War is horrifying bloody destructive. It is also murderous on the psyche. However what is fundamental about Fires on the Plain is its unapologetic look at the Japanese soldiers. It shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior American firepower and their nation's inability to wage a war of its own making. A fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness.I was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of Japan's military misadventure made just 14 years after the end of what the Japanese call the Great Pacific War. Ichikawa reveals what the Germans called the war life the plight of the common soldier.Ichikawa's film is interesting since even today Japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism its subjugation of conquered peoples the racism of its war against the Chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another but against Allied prisoners of war.Ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures.This stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear brilliantly laconic humor dialog enriched by its sparseness and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim wilderness setting.Ichikawa's portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men. The tubercular Tamura played as a woebegone and gentle soul by Eiji Funakoshi is a good soldier who can't abandon his humanity though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades. Before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy Tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who recognizing the hopelessness of their situation advises Tamura to kill himself.Why Tamura's hopelessly illsupplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling. Ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die. As Tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter. They appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave.We later watch as the overworked hospital's medical staff abandons the dying patients to an allconsuming American artillery barrage. The pathetic patients who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive appear like pathetic serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force. You know they won't survive.Ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades. As Tamura staggers through the jungles of Leyte we encounter the noble the dying and the exploitive. Cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to American corned beef.When the men do talk of surrender the propaganda of how Americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldlywise soldier who reveals that the approaching Americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they unlike the Japanese respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up.It is the Japanese who intend to die fighting for the Emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning. Those willing to fight to the death will be killed. It is the calculus of war.After shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade whom he earlier offered his own body to as food the fatalistic Tamura's careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide. His death is a lonely image. Was Ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but who is still trapped by his nation's suicidal cultural codes?If someone watches this film carefully he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy. The Americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power  a lesson that transformed Japanese postwar society. Ichikawa's film isn't so shallow that it indicts America. Ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of Japan's destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost.Ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon Nagasaki and Hiroshima. He doesn't have to. The slowmotion destruction of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines reveals the seeds of Japan's immolation.".

We wade with the stragglers though puddles and marshes as sick as the land around them. Nameless cadavers are strewn everywhere. Every now and then one can not tell if they are bodies rocks or corn. Apparently there is no difference here all is dead and sick. All is dying.

Hence when Nagamatsu is dissecting a soldier for consumption he shoots him because of it. Tamura may be used to the killing but to the sickness of killing and pillaging he can't decipher. He is neither a good man or a bad man. He wishes to survive but will not go the extra mile beyond simple straightwarkilling. His self belonged dead on the battlefield he isn't happy here to wade and wipe the weak for his survival.The sickness he carrys he sees everywhere in everyone and sadly he lacks the ethical rationale of thinking either thinking entirely about others since he can't give up his body for them since of his contagious malady or thinking entirely about himself since he sees the sickness in everyone though still killing them even if they do no harm. Seen in his attack on the two Philippians's in the hut. He can't see anyone. No one can see anyone.

	schema:reviewBody "A harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war Fires on the Plain Nobi is not going to be to everybody's taste this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term one that resorts neither to flagwaving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality. Nobi cuts deep it's ugly tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. This is war behind the cannons with no triumphs or heroes no moral victories or defeats to be had just a handful of gaunt and terriblelooking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Pitting one's will against the other's in a battlefield arena. The loser is simply removed from existence.Tamura soldier in the Japanese Imperial army is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon. He's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. Which it does. The hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine. It is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. As the area is carpet bombed by American planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods. Moments before the hospital is blown to pieces the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture dressed in their sickly white robes as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth.That is Nobi's greatest success the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images without melodrama or pseudoheroism. Soldiers cross a marsh wading kneedeep in mud move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark. A procession of injured soldiers dirty and halfmad crossing a road dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes. Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. An abandoned village. A mad soldier that believes himself to be Buddha sitting under a tree covered with flies and his own excrement offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he's dead. These are the images Kon Ichikawa conjures for our eyes merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw.Nobi doesn't rush to get somewhere. It is content to follow Tamura's travels through the wartorn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of Palompa and observe the madness and obscenities of war. The movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war slow and brooding just like the characters it follows. The final thirty minutes with Tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on 'monkey meat' are the closest Nobi comes to adhering to conventional narratives and they're no less powerful for that matter. Strikingly photographed in black and white with great performances from the cast and Ichikawa's assured direction Nobi is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of Japanese cinema.".

	onyx:emotionText "A harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war Fires on the Plain Nobi is not going to be to everybody's taste this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term one that resorts neither to flagwaving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality. Nobi cuts deep it's ugly tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be. This is war behind the cannons with no triumphs or heroes no moral victories or defeats to be had just a handful of gaunt and terriblelooking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster. The characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature. War and survival. Pitting one's will against the other's in a battlefield arena. The loser is simply removed from existence.Tamura soldier in the Japanese Imperial army is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon. He's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him. Which it does. The hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he's capable of walking he's just fine. It is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place. As the area is carpet bombed by American planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods. Moments before the hospital is blown to pieces the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture dressed in their sickly white robes as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth.That is Nobi's greatest success the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images without melodrama or pseudoheroism. Soldiers cross a marsh wading kneedeep in mud move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark. A procession of injured soldiers dirty and halfmad crossing a road dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes. Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies. An abandoned village. A mad soldier that believes himself to be Buddha sitting under a tree covered with flies and his own excrement offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he's dead. These are the images Kon Ichikawa conjures for our eyes merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw.Nobi doesn't rush to get somewhere. It is content to follow Tamura's travels through the wartorn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of Palompa and observe the madness and obscenities of war. The movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war slow and brooding just like the characters it follows.

Ichikawa had one of the finest careers in Japanese film but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near contemporaries such as Ozu and Kurosawa he was a little younger than them but not by much. He is one of those directors who defies auteur theories  its likely that his wife who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was. But at his best he was as good as any Japanese film maker at the time. In particular he had great technical skills allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner. But in terms of theme this movie could hardly be simpler  war is hell. No really its seriously hell.Fire on the Plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules. There is no real beginning  we start as the wretched Tamura who is a regular private although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others  at one stage it is shown he understands English but he clams up when the others ask him how he knows it is ordered to hospital as his unit is already in an appalling state. The soldiers are defeated and starving to death. They are no longer an army just a rag bag group of refugees  hunted by the locals and pretty much ignored by the Americans who have bigger fish to fry. Hunger and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness.In typical Ichikawa style its not all just grim  its oddly funny in parts a very black humour of course.The high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography. The characters in all their humanity but also their complete loss of humanity are all too believable. This is that rare film  one which will refuse to erase itself from your head even if you want to forget it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fires on The Plain 1959 You don't see films like this anymore. 'Fires on the Plain' is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura a soldier with Tuberculosis as he wanders around the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back. His CO tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is refused again but meets up with a band of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day they are shelled by American troops and Tamura flees choosing not to kill himself and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to Palompon. He discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive while others trade as much tobacco as they can for whatever they can get back.The film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and desolation with a hint of insanity. Everyone we see is skin and bones covered in dirt wearing torn and tattered rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the destructed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are bitingly hilarious. Take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water a soldier walks but and asks himself aloud if that is how they will all end up to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies what was that? and then drops his face even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail. He takes the boots replacing them with his old ones. Another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots. The scene continues until finally Tamura finds the exchange spot and examines the boots left without hardly any sole. He looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground and deciding that they're both kaput he removes his own and goes barefoot. The film is filled with incredible scenes one after another. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures. There are many stunning shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night all crawling on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above. The film gets its name from the columns of smoke rising up from fires on the plains seen throughout the film. They represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary the lives of Japanese farmers back home burning husks of corn. Their beacons of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands.The film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself. Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima while it is a very good film comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in Fires on the Plain. Eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film seeing as he claims to be such a classic Japanese film buff. Many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. In Fires on the Plain we're shown that war is even more hellish when you're on the losing end 44".

	schema:reviewBody "Kon Ichikawa had lived through world war two and saw what its effects it had on his people in Japan. But so did novelist Shohei Ooka whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film Fires on the Plain. It's a film about the men in this war or perhaps more universally in wars in general who lose their humanity. The soldiers trudging along through these fields and jungles of the Philippenes in this story are almost completely without hope if not already just that. It makes Stone's Platoon look like a picnic at least they had certain things like food after all.They have little to no reserves or supplies or ammunition no backup no sense of anything going their way in this combat that they've been thrust into. They can't even get some proper hospital care unless if they can no longer walk at all or have lost limbs for example say if you have TB you're on your way. But its really through the prism of one soldier a private Tamura that we get a full sense of the futility of war both in its bleak scenes of nothingness and boredom and decay and those flashes of intense and brutal violence.In the film Tamura just wants to get some medical care. This is right at the start and his told by his superior officer already he is with eyes that stare off and an expression that has been drained by years of battle that he will die if he doesn't find a hospital. He doesn't really but does end up in with some soldiers at first with a platoon that seems to sort of have their act together but is really led on by a powerhungry brute who just wants Tamura's stash of salt and then later with two other stray soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed while crossing a road at night.The story isn't entirely a straight line but it doesn't need to be. Tamura's path in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes little stories like when he comes upon a seemingly deserted enemy village. Two of the populous comes back to get some supplies and Tamura sneaks up on them. It's an excruciating scene since so far with Tamura we haven't seen him do anything outright wrong but he does so in this scene not even so much out of evil but out of fear and desperation this is also without spoiling it how he gets a stash of salt. Little scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation like a simple task of finding a pair of walkable shoes which there seem to be none. Or when Tamura later in the film discovers his teeth are becoming torn apart and falling out from lack of total hygiene. So much for food so it goes.It should also be mentioned that this is a hauntingly realized film from Ichikawa shot in a stark black and white view of the fields and woods the cinematography filling everything we see in blackblacks and whitehot white. Ichikawa also makes sure to get everything authentic from his actors not simply emotionally but with their own emaciated look and looks of desperation right on them. It's as if Ichikawa has to have them all surviving the film as well as characters surviving out in the wild by wild by the way I mean also cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold first is the way that a soldier says halfjokingly early on about eating other soldiers to Tamaura who asks if it was true and only in response getting a don't ask word of caution and the second with the depiction of cannibalism itself from the crazy starving man on the hill who pulls out guts out of his lap and says with a straight face to our hero that You can eat me when I die. This makes thing especially more brutal when it comes to the director filming the brief 'action' scenes. These are I would argue more brutal than 'Private Ryan' in their depictions of violence in battle the carnage that is completely random. A scene I would point to and that contains just a shot that is excruciating to watch is when from a high angle we see a group of about twenty soldiers walking slowly along a hail of gunfire comes that kills only four or five but it just happens so fast and the soldiers just keep walking along at the same crawl. This isn't the only shot of horrible carnage that's shown  when needing to be bloody its there but splashed across the screen like something completely of the macabre  but it drives the point completely.All of the acting is staggering Funakoshi especially who looks to be both most at peace and most horrified by what he sees in the subtlest of looks most of the time all of the major setpieces provide something else to the gruesome experience and it all amounts to the ultimate question with an antiwar film how can or why do people fight in wars like these? It's almost too depressing to put into words and so Ichikawa pushes our noses right up into the muck and filth and blood and demands for us to take it in so maybe some day it will never happen again. Or one can hope this by the end of such a bleak and great film as this.".

	schema:headline " Darn Good Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "When people think postwar Japanese cinema they automatically think of Akira Kurosawa. His exported samurai epics have done a good job creating a sense of history nobility and grace among the art cinema crowd. Yet arguably more important to Japan's unique cinematic history during that era are the humanistic war stories brought to life by the likes of Masaki Kobayashi Nagisa Oshima and Kon Ichikawa. Comprising a portion of the Japanese New Wave these war dramas challenged their viewers headon illustrating the ugliness of war in all it's absurdity and horror. These movies were noble in their own way by angrily confronting the attitudes tolerated by Japan during it's peak nationalist period. Fires on the Plain is just as incendiary as it's title would suggest and serves as a prime example of such a film. It may also just be the most engaging and accessible war tale Japan has ever produced.Set during the closing days of Japan's dominance in the Philippines our sick fatigued and jaded hero Private Tamura attempts to survive the oncoming slaughter. Tamura is forced out of his unit due to tuberculosis if he's not well enough to dig trenches than he's useless according to his superiors. He treks to the hospital just past the hills only to be rebuffed by the hospital who tells him if he can walk he's not sick. Before he can return and presumably commit suicide via grenade Tamura's unit is wiped out in a fierce battle with allied forces. He then wonders aimlessly through the countryside staving starvation fatigue death and worse still fellow brothers in arms.If Kurosawa is considered the Spielberg of Japan than director Kon Ichikawa is it's Martin Scorsese. Known less for an allpermeating thesis that seeps into his oeuvre Ichikawa gives his work an idiosyncratic style and a visceral veneer.

There's a dark sense of realism that makes Fires on the Plain stand out from other contemporary works such as The Human Condition Trilogy 19591961.

The film was adapted from Shohei Ooka's novel of the same name. Much ado was made at the time about Ichikawa's radical ending change which is surprisingly antithetical to the traditional Hollywood ending we're all so drearily used to. With Ichikawa's ending however there is no absolution no completion no sigh of relief. Much like All Quiet on the Western Front 1930 the film's resolution comes with a simple message about the inhumanity of war.Fires on the Plain is a frightfully good film that tells it's story through imagery both stark maddening and sublime. Powerful in every sober sense Ichikawa should be on everyone's short list of most important Japanese filmmakers. He's got a style full of contradiction yet permeating with an excess of feeling. I promise that once you've seen this provocative bleak heartwrenching picture you won't soon forget it.".

	onyx:emotionText "When people think postwar Japanese cinema they automatically think of Akira Kurosawa. His exported samurai epics have done a good job creating a sense of history nobility and grace among the art cinema crowd. Yet arguably more important to Japan's unique cinematic history during that era are the humanistic war stories brought to life by the likes of Masaki Kobayashi Nagisa Oshima and Kon Ichikawa. Comprising a portion of the Japanese New Wave these war dramas challenged their viewers headon illustrating the ugliness of war in all it's absurdity and horror. These movies were noble in their own way by angrily confronting the attitudes tolerated by Japan during it's peak nationalist period. Fires on the Plain is just as incendiary as it's title would suggest and serves as a prime example of such a film. It may also just be the most engaging and accessible war tale Japan has ever produced.Set during the closing days of Japan's dominance in the Philippines our sick fatigued and jaded hero Private Tamura attempts to survive the oncoming slaughter. Tamura is forced out of his unit due to tuberculosis if he's not well enough to dig trenches than he's useless according to his superiors. He treks to the hospital just past the hills only to be rebuffed by the hospital who tells him if he can walk he's not sick. Before he can return and presumably commit suicide via grenade Tamura's unit is wiped out in a fierce battle with allied forces. He then wonders aimlessly through the countryside staving starvation fatigue death and worse still fellow brothers in arms.If Kurosawa is considered the Spielberg of Japan than director Kon Ichikawa is it's Martin Scorsese. Known less for an allpermeating thesis that seeps into his oeuvre Ichikawa gives his work an idiosyncratic style and a visceral veneer. Throughout his career Ichikawa was known for taking on all popular genres all of which balanced his knack for realism and expressionism. His worlds always have a beautiful wholeness and lets the pathos from each situation dig into the audiences cranium through all sides. Sometimes he accomplishes this with shock other times with a mischievous sense of humor.

Even in this hell hole some culturally inculcated Japanese traditions survive as depicted by Ichikawa such as a semblance of politeness between those of the same or unknown rank. The three leading actors deliver excellent performances. Actor Eiji Funakoshi is a standout with unusual facial expressions that add greatly to the feeling of expecttheunexpected as events unfold. The Director occasionally resorts to voice over for scene clarification but this lowcost expository crutch seems to diminish rather than enhance. The movie could benefit from some judicial reediting. It is a bit too long and drags now and then. Reediting might also allow the impact of the film's war horrors to progressively build rather than continuously run flat out.

Cinematography wide screen black and white and lighting are excellent. Ichikawa confidently and fully fills the wide screen providing an epoch panoramic feel.

	schema:reviewBody "1853. US Navyman Commodore Matthew Perry makes his way into Japan and forcibly opens the country up to international trade. After two and a half centuries of selfimposed peaceful isolation Japan henceforth begins emulating Western powers. After the Meiji Restorations of 1868 Japan not only conclusively shifts from a feudal society to a market economy but embarks on an endeavour to assimilate Western ideas technological advances and customs. To the chagrin of the Western Empires it also spends the next few years aggressively expanding into neighbouring territories encroaching upon Korea Taiwan China Vietnam Burma and the Philippines all countries which had themselves been taken over by Europeans and Americans. The apple in Japan's eye is China though which Russia France Germany England and the US are busy dividing between themselves via Open Door Policies. These policies grant multiple international powers access to China all to the detriment of China itself.Ticked off that the big Imperialists aren't letting Japan get down to some sweet Imperialism of its own Japan launches the First SinoJapanese War 1894 and the RussoJapanese War 1904. Ironically these expansions are funded by British and American bankers Jacob Schiff famously provided 200 million in loans to such an extent that Japan's outstanding foreign loan indebtedness grows from near zero in 1896 to 421 million yen in 1904 and then 2600 million yen in 1913. After about two decades of further pressure cooking a complex cocktail of forces andor contradictions eventually lead to all the world's major nations getting their collective grooves on. In Japan's case a mixture of nationalism exceptionalism racism stupidity economic competition mounting debts the need to open up foreign markets to prevent local markets from collapsing historial J.A Hobson would famously call capitalist oligarchy rather than national pride the taproot of imperialism blockades Western bullying and sheer confusion leads to a state of Total War. The end result of WW2? The two Imperialist upstarts  Japan and Germany  get bombed back to the stone age whilst the old Imperialist Empires go broke and are forced to scale back their domains. The United States emerges as top dog.Two of the major war films in Japanese postwar cinema were Fires on the Plain and The Burmese Harp both by director Kon Ichikawa. Released in 1956 Harp follows Private Mizushima a lowly member of Inouye Company. Mizushima plays a lute whose music becomes Ichikawa's metaphor for a humanity which is suffocated during war time. The film's awash with bleak landscapes craggy wartorn and steeped in death a canvas which the lute attempts to hold back with an aesthetic of its own. But it's no use. Soil is bloodred a titlecard reads so are rocks.Harp finds Ichikawa drawing parallels between Japanese and British soldiers the fighting class on either side identical in their humanity. Its climax points to Japanese concentration camps the scientific barbarism of the atomic bombs and finally to monastic Buddhism Mizushima's newfound path. It's a path which divides Mizushima from both his comrades and an increasingly secular Japan.

Whilst Tamura's countrymen prefer death to the dishonour of capture Tamura rejects the nationalism and indomitable Yamatodamashii spirit of the army. He sees no dishonour in staying alive and will do anything to survive. Fire thus offers the reverse of the spirituality and positive affirmation of Ichikawa's Harp. It stresses the corporeal the physical its tone is nihilistic and Tamura will cross any barrier in the name of self preservation unlike Mizushima who challenges himself and others to live humanely even within evil circumstances. Lost in a nightmarish odyssey Tamura stumbles upon burning hospitals corpses and vampirelike soldiers who cannibalise flesh his narrative serving to undermine any measure of value or nobility wrongly ascribed to warfare. The film climaxes in a scene evocative of Sam Fuller's Big Red One with Tamura shot whilst trying to surrender to an American soldier. His life's been lost for nought.Aesthetically Harp and Fire are similar. Both are melancholic at times shocking and carefully juggle impressive wide screen photography with blunt closeups of haggard faces. Both also feature dated scores dip into excessive sentimentality and feature soldiers who are more dirty dispirited and exhausted than was typical of Western war films of the era. This is not surprising. Before the revisionist andor counterculture movements of the 1960s British and American war films tended to be upbeat.

	onyx:emotionText "1853. US Navyman Commodore Matthew Perry makes his way into Japan and forcibly opens the country up to international trade. After two and a half centuries of selfimposed peaceful isolation Japan henceforth begins emulating Western powers. After the Meiji Restorations of 1868 Japan not only conclusively shifts from a feudal society to a market economy but embarks on an endeavour to assimilate Western ideas technological advances and customs. To the chagrin of the Western Empires it also spends the next few years aggressively expanding into neighbouring territories encroaching upon Korea Taiwan China Vietnam Burma and the Philippines all countries which had themselves been taken over by Europeans and Americans. The apple in Japan's eye is China though which Russia France Germany England and the US are busy dividing between themselves via Open Door Policies. These policies grant multiple international powers access to China all to the detriment of China itself.Ticked off that the big Imperialists aren't letting Japan get down to some sweet Imperialism of its own Japan launches the First SinoJapanese War 1894 and the RussoJapanese War 1904. Ironically these expansions are funded by British and American bankers Jacob Schiff famously provided 200 million in loans to such an extent that Japan's outstanding foreign loan indebtedness grows from near zero in 1896 to 421 million yen in 1904 and then 2600 million yen in 1913. After about two decades of further pressure cooking a complex cocktail of forces andor contradictions eventually lead to all the world's major nations getting their collective grooves on. In Japan's case a mixture of nationalism exceptionalism racism stupidity economic competition mounting debts the need to open up foreign markets to prevent local markets from collapsing historial J.A Hobson would famously call capitalist oligarchy rather than national pride the taproot of imperialism blockades Western bullying and sheer confusion leads to a state of Total War. The end result of WW2? The two Imperialist upstarts  Japan and Germany  get bombed back to the stone age whilst the old Imperialist Empires go broke and are forced to scale back their domains. The United States emerges as top dog.Two of the major war films in Japanese postwar cinema were Fires on the Plain and The Burmese Harp both by director Kon Ichikawa. Released in 1956 Harp follows Private Mizushima a lowly member of Inouye Company. Mizushima plays a lute whose music becomes Ichikawa's metaphor for a humanity which is suffocated during war time. The film's awash with bleak landscapes craggy wartorn and steeped in death a canvas which the lute attempts to hold back with an aesthetic of its own. But it's no use. Soil is bloodred a titlecard reads so are rocks.Harp finds Ichikawa drawing parallels between Japanese and British soldiers the fighting class on either side identical in their humanity. Its climax points to Japanese concentration camps the scientific barbarism of the atomic bombs and finally to monastic Buddhism Mizushima's newfound path. It's a path which divides Mizushima from both his comrades and an increasingly secular Japan. If warfare remains the music of the gun Mizushima's Buddhism embodies the music of the lute an aural flame which he dedicates his life to fanning.Harp's overriding tone is one of sadness.

These soldiers are once again pawns of a government lustful for power making them expendable. This is the film equivalent of a man hanging on a cliff hoping for one more hour of life.

	schema:reviewBody "I think it's incredibly hard to write any kind of fullscale review to Giorgino merely because it's one of those viewerdependent complex poetical and philosophical films that are impossible to be watched enjoying their visuals and their story while cracking their artistic core at the same time yet there are several things which are quite certain and beyond any doubt about the movie for any man of art which I hope I am.The first it's a certain masterpiece even of that kind of art that is able to stand the test of time the second it's one of those rare dark movies in which the darkness is poetic even romantic attractive and much more sad than depressing just like many of the Pieter Brueghel the Elder or Caspar David Friedrich's paintings. As to the core of the movie its artistic aspect someone called it Kafkian though I don't agree with that hasty attitude because actually it's far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like Edgar Poe's parables dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls. Actually on the poetic side which is much more important here than the narrative Giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved solely through saving oneself's inner child or to be more precise the childhood of one's soul. It is no secret that such childish people are usually branded as crazy or at least misfits by our society ignoring the obvious fact that they all have a virtue all the other grownups have lost the virtue of true love the kind of love that is called a God's love by Christian scholars.Indeed Giorgino may be called a very Christian movie with Be like children Mt 183 as it's real hidden tagline though the film never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates solely on the Christian philosophical aspects. Though I think Boutonnat was too harsh portraying grownups as some sort of demons incarnated as wolves trying to kill childhood in the rare survived hearts but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so. While watching Giorgino don't try to look for hidden symbols and meanings though there are some better try to understand and learn from at least some of the fables Boutonnat had hidden in the twists of the movie plot.I have to admit that the movie greatly impressed me with excellent photography especially I was happy to see the rational use of color filters incredibly smooth and apposite editing wonderful acting of all the actors and of course the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains which reminded me of the Brueghel's Hunters in the Snow. Also interestingly enough one scene where Death itself shown in the form an old woman with sunken blackringed eyes instantly reminded me of Pesta Plague by Theodor Kittelsen the Norwegian painter who made a series of drawings to the story of how the black plague swept out the population of a small town in a mountain valley. Is it a simple coincidence?".

As to the core of the movie its artistic aspect someone called it Kafkian though I don't agree with that hasty attitude because actually it's far beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic and much more like Edgar Poe's parables dark and scary but through that touching the most gentle strings of our souls. Actually on the poetic side which is much more important here than the narrative Giorgino is a tale about eternal peace and love which can be achieved solely through saving oneself's inner child or to be more precise the childhood of one's soul. It is no secret that such childish people are usually branded as crazy or at least misfits by our society ignoring the obvious fact that they all have a virtue all the other grownups have lost the virtue of true love the kind of love that is called a God's love by Christian scholars.Indeed Giorgino may be called a very Christian movie with Be like children Mt 183 as it's real hidden tagline though the film never deals with any kind of moral and concentrates solely on the Christian philosophical aspects. Though I think Boutonnat was too harsh portraying grownups as some sort of demons incarnated as wolves trying to kill childhood in the rare survived hearts but it's his point of view and he has a right to think so. While watching Giorgino don't try to look for hidden symbols and meanings though there are some better try to understand and learn from at least some of the fables Boutonnat had hidden in the twists of the movie plot.I have to admit that the movie greatly impressed me with excellent photography especially I was happy to see the rational use of color filters incredibly smooth and apposite editing wonderful acting of all the actors and of course the atmospheric beauty of winter mountains which reminded me of the Brueghel's Hunters in the Snow. Also interestingly enough one scene where Death itself shown in the form an old woman with sunken blackringed eyes instantly reminded me of Pesta Plague by Theodor Kittelsen the Norwegian painter who made a series of drawings to the story of how the black plague swept out the population of a small town in a mountain valley. Is it a simple coincidence?";

The storyline seemed slightly contrived but seeing a newcomber so talented Corina Marie made it all worthwhile. Rod did a wonderful job as well as Michael Pare and Jamie Farr. It was a pleasant surprise to see those talents acting so well in a film that would have crumbled without Rod Michael Jamie and especially Corina. I don't recall this playing in theaters but I did stumble across it at Blockbuster. It's worth checking out and Corina Marie if you read this... Where have you been????? You're probably a star on Broadway by now or London's West End. Either way I'm sure you're successful as your ability shines like no young star I've seen since a young Jodie Foster!!!!!!!!".

They both show a great range of emotion humor among tragedy and chemistry with each other as actors. The story is told in a unique fashion using flashback and dream sequences.

The only good thing about this film is that it is so bad it's truly hysterical.  Look for the flashback scene where Rod where's a JorEl wig from Superman and a big black porno mustache.

It's mainly aimed at a teenage audience although some might find the plot a bit difficult to understand especially when it tends to be overshadowed by sex scenes.

Who cares about the lack of scriptplotpremise? This movie came out in 1984 but it had more of a 70s feel about it especially the hairstyles the special effects and the geeky best friend! Anyway I enjoyed this movie a lot and I'm trying to get a copy of it as we speak.".

The situation they were in was quite terrifying and I really felt nervous for them. I found the whole film quite nerve wracking because of the sheer helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival.The crocodile effects were handled surprisingly well for such a low budget film and believe me I have seen my fair share of dodgy croc movies. The creature moved well and had real menace and although the audience I was with didn't seem too keen on the film as a whole they still jumped and gasped whenever the crocodile appeared.Scriptwise I would have made a few changes particularly towards the end but this was not a major problem. For fans of slowburning survival horror set within the realms of reality this will be an engaging film but unfortunately I think for many audiences seeking a thrill ride and higher production values from their cinema experience the point will simply be missed.".

This movie is surprisingly spectacular and I loved every second. The story is about a boat ride down a river in Australia. It seems safe enough until their boat is ambushed by a croc who's ready for some food. When I looked at the back of the case I thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in Lake Placid 2 and a lot of others but when I first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real! Don't laugh when I say this for I am being serious but this is one of the most creepiest films I've ever seen. It really knew how to build up nailbiting tension and suspense with it's intense situation I mean think about it You're stuck in a tree nowhere to run nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below. You can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little. It even managed to give me a few chills down my arms like when Adam was taken by the croc and Grace and Lee are left baffled. I jumped at two scenes also.This is a very appealing movie to me. There were maybe one or two parts where I found myself slightly uninterested but other than that I would say this is my favorite animal attack film that I have seen and is an excellent film overall. It was a job well done by all the staff and I commend it for being so suspenseful and impression making.".

	schema:reviewBody "There was some good build up of suspense throughout. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget. We witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. Silence would have been golden here. There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother... Something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. You decide.

We witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. Silence would have been golden here. There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother... Something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. You decide.

Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. From the opening setup I've never been so entrenched caught up and finally exhausted like I was when watching this limited budget Independent Australian horror film about three people in Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them. What really brought the film alive was how realistic it managed to be in transporting the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. Semidocumentary camerawork with a disquietingly eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody allout creature feature onslaught. Think of Open Water 2003 where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay lowkey but this minimal barrier enhanced the experience.The slowgrinding story might be black and white but it never seemed to become disposable or succumb to formulaic patterns. Well not largely and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare straightforward script. Although you can say less is more with the actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds. The ordeal is utterly terrifying because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up. This is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline and in which it lasts even when its kept buried through to the very end. Writers  Directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich's economical guidance alienates and smartly strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits. In certain patches the notch goes up with pressure induced suspense and startling images. The way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. The menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its freshmeat in a distressingly suspenseful approach. Sure some moments felt unlikely but never does it get in the way or distract. Sound FX is the key and at times the lack of any just eats away at you. Rafeal May's musical score is unassuming and doesn't really enter the mixture much but when it does it builds an organic sounding quality. The cinematography of John Biggins is beautifully devised and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes. It was always on the move and claustrophobic but none of this jerky movements. The editing was sharply handled and the effects were professionally catered by superbly combing live crocodile footage. Something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it. Diana Glenn Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are persuasively good. A lot of the responsibility falls on Dermody and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn. Now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film Rogue 2007 but the two couldn't be any different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to pick though I'm leaning more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you.A remarkable effort on all fronts with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for.".

The setup is rather basic Grace her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee are touring some mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and leaves them stranded in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is lurking below waiting to strike.Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue another killer croc movie released earlier in 2007 Black Water is not about the audience having fun guessing who's gonna be eaten next it is about hoping and praying that the three people will get out safely. The three unknown actors do a great job with pretty demanding roles considering it was filmed on location with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters act realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. Suspense is built up throughout the entire film we do not see a lot of the creature but just knowing it is near is terrifying enough. This is edgeofyour seat stuff and highly recommended if you enjoy original and most importantly scary horror films.45".

More often than not when danger was near we were being told it was near by an omnipresent soundtrack. Our senses weren't allowed to detect danger by an image or an escalating event like seeing a crocodile jump in the water then seeing the characters jump in the same water. I find animal attack movies very entertaining from Jaws to cheeseball ones like Razorback and I even really liked Open Water. But there wasn't a single tense moment created in this movie.It's clear in the first five minutes that a typical plot and character development are going to be absent in the story. That's absolutely fine. But without the film's ability to captivate the senses the flatness of plot stands out all the more. I think the film's intentional absence of bplot is the culprit in another film you'd cut away from the characters to show the croc jumping into the water then cut back to the characters instant tension you'd think don't go in right now guys the crocs in the water!.While I understand the neorealist intent this movie really underwhelmed me intellectually emotionally and in my senses. Maybe if I had a big screen the creaking trees and thrumming river would deliver an elevated experience and a different reaction. As it was almost every shot seemed held for too long tensionless and kinda pointless. How many times can you show someone scaling around in a tree and expect them to keep watching? Or better yet create an expectation that something so bad is about to happen that I don't wanna watch? This movie did that zero times.For comparison a movie in my People who liked this also liked... is Windchill. That movie scared the bejeebus out of me. This movie didn't come close.".

	schema:reviewBody "Black Water 2007  out of 4 Australian horror film about two sisters Diana Glenn Maeve Dermody and one of their boyfriends Andy Rodoreda who decide to take a guided tour down a river where they can fish and see crocodiles. Once out in the water and far away from land their boat comes under attack by a large croc and soon the guide is dead and the three friends are stuck in a tree without much hope for survival. This film was clearly influenced by Open Water even though this film too is based on true events. I enjoyed Open Water but thought it had several problems which could have been fixed and the problems I had with that film aren't in this one and I must say I think this film is the best horror movie I've seen in many many years. off the top of my head I can't think of another movie that had my blood ice cold throughout it. There are at least five long scenes in this film where my blood was cold the hair was standing up on my neck and I was curled up on the couch in actually terror. I've never had a movie effect me this much as I've seen so many that very few are able to get to me but this one actually did and boy was it a great feeling. I must say this film is a real joy as this genre has forgotten about scares and now basically goes for mindless gore. That's not the case here because each minute of this movie is meant to make you feel worried and put you in suspense. The execution is topnotch and the direction is downright flawless and never hits a bad note. The film runs just over 90minute and there isn't much time given to the viewer to let them breathe because the film builds suspense every minute from start to finish. The film has a simple but very effective music score and the cinematography is great as well. Another big plus are the performances which are excellent by the three leads. We don't get to spend too much time with them before the attack starts but it doesn't take long to really fall in love with all three characters and you can't help but want to see them make it out alive. Caring for them so much is another reason the suspense works because we don't want to see anything bad happen to them. Dermody really sticks out and I hope to see her in future movies. I really went into this film not knowing what to expect but it turned out to be one of the most memorable films I've seen in recent memory.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things I have seen that they all have in common are boring and unrealistic.First of all they used real bloody crocodiles! How much more real can you get? No CGI no animatronics no miniatures. Just a croc and a piece of meat.There is however no question that this film gets off to a slow start. Character development what little they had plodded at best and I think this is primarily where this film is lacking.However when the film gets going the action picks up dramatically. I don't mean to say that this is action packed. If you're looking for a Michael Bay gorefest you'll be sadly disappointed. If anything there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all and the people are just waiting. We know though that there won't be any relief. The croc is just biding its time. This had a similar eerie feel to other films that set to achieve terror through inaction. Open Water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring certainly comes to mind. Personally I think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but that's just me.Finally the characters though rather undeveloped feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances. Furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it's a little tough to watch.All in all this one's a winner.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've read many unflattering comments regarding this film and the only things I have seen that they all have in common are boring and unrealistic.First of all they used real bloody crocodiles! How much more real can you get? No CGI no animatronics no miniatures. Just a croc and a piece of meat.There is however no question that this film gets off to a slow start. Character development what little they had plodded at best and I think this is primarily where this film is lacking.However when the film gets going the action picks up dramatically. I don't mean to say that this is action packed. If you're looking for a Michael Bay gorefest you'll be sadly disappointed. If anything there are more moments where the croc can't be seen at all and the people are just waiting. We know though that there won't be any relief. The croc is just biding its time. This had a similar eerie feel to other films that set to achieve terror through inaction. Open Water another film that has been criticized by some viewers as being boring certainly comes to mind. Personally I think that viewers who find themselves incapable of feeling the suspense have had their attention spans surgically removed at birth but that's just me.Finally the characters though rather undeveloped feel real and the situation is such that it really could happen to anyone in the right circumstances. Furthermore the deaths are completely real and at times it's a little tough to watch.All in all this one's a winner.";

Every standard by which we set our social and cultural clocks was either turned inside out or thrown away completely and reinvented. For American cinema the 1970s was an era during which a new generation of filmmakers created work for a new kind of audiencemoviegoers who were hungry for stories that reflected their own experiences and who were turning their backs on aged old studio formulas. As a result emerging filmmakers influenced by foreign directors such as Godard Kurosawa and Fellini coupled with the social climate and a struggling studio system converged to create a new kind of moviemaking.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great compendium of interviews and excerpts form the films of the late sixties and early 70s that were a counter movement to the big Studio Films of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme it is obviously a labor of love of the films of the period but it gives short shrift to the masterpieces of the times.Many of the filmmakers of this period were influenced by Truffaut Antonioni Fellini Bergman and of course John Cassavetes. Unfortunately the documentary logging in at 138 minutes is too short! The film is rich with interviews and opinions of filmmakers. Some of the people interviewed are Martin Scorsese Francis Coppola Robert Altman Peter Bogdonovich Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman Bruce Dern Sydney Pollack Dennis Hopper and Jon Voight.Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson may not have been as good looking as the other stars that came before them but they were interesting. This summarizes the other areas of this period of filmmaking in American history.The filmmakers were dealing with a lack of funding from the Studios because they were expressing unconventional attitudes about politics sex drugs gender and race issues and Americas involvement in overseas conflicts like the Vietnam War.There is a great interview with Francis Coppola saying that he got the chance to make The Conversation because the producers knew he had been trained by Roger Corman to make a movie with nothing so they bankrolled his film.Another interview is with Jon Voight who was directed by Hal Ashby in Coming Home a clear antiwar film about a crippled soldier immersing himself back into society after his facing battle. Voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve an emotional telling point when Ashby said that they were doing a rehearsal take and it ended up being the take used in the film it was better because it was so unrehearsed and not drained of its freshness by being overrehearsed.There are also many fine excerpts from Al Pacino's breakthrough film The Panic in Needle Park and interviews from Dennis Hopper on the making of Easy Rider and interviews from Sydney Pollack about making films.All in all the documentary is a fine jumping off point for any film lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in film were like in the Seventies. Many of the Sundance Folks where this film made a big splash are unaware of just how much the Independent Film Maker today owes to the films of John Cassavetes Milos Foreman William Friedkin and Roger Corman.Rent it from your favorite shop. It will at least perk you up to some films you may not have seen before and can enjoy today. Amazon.com has it for as little as 11.50 if you want to buy right out.".

	schema:reviewBody "A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected. Demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. From 'Easy Rider' and the collapse of studio influence through all those introspective 'real life' movies where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically sexually and artistically through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. As someone who saw the 'real life' movies of Britain and the rest of Europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary US films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day this was a most fascinating film. The interview clips are measured thanks to DVD the full interviews are available as extras! and the film clips well considered. Also as someone who has only just caught up with 'Joe' I am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here.".

	onyx:emotionText "A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise was mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I assumed this was about the influence of the drug culture on film making but no it is a much more far reaching and intelligent film than could have been expected. Demme has done a great job in encapsulating the period from the late 60s to the late 70s. From 'Easy Rider' and the collapse of studio influence through all those introspective 'real life' movies where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically sexually and artistically through to the beginnings of the blockbuster and the return of the reigns to the money men and their studios. As someone who saw the 'real life' movies of Britain and the rest of Europe through the sixties and then the revolutionary US films of the 70s and is sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much the order of the day this was a most fascinating film. The interview clips are measured thanks to DVD the full interviews are available as extras! and the film clips well considered. Also as someone who has only just caught up with 'Joe' I am impressed that this important little film gets its well deserved entry here.";

	schema:headline " Interesting But Slightly Snooty Documentary On Seventies American Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "A documentary dealing with American films made in the nineteenseventies with major emphasis on experimentation with new styles of cinematic expression and departure from the traditional style of film production.It's tough to generalise but I think the seventies is my favourite decade of film. This is a quality documentary about that period which correctly identifies my reasons for feeling that way  the waning big studios giving rise to the auteur nonprohibitive costs and the first moviebrat generation of film school graduates. However it then turns into an all too predictable film critics' textbook examining how cinema reflected the social upheaval of the period and champions the usual directors  Altman Hal Ashby Bogdanovich Coppola Pollack Scorsese and so on  and their deHollywoodised Europeaninfluenced approach. It even goes so far as to hint that the huge successes of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who had the temerity to make imaginative exciting crowdpleasing genre pictures killed artistic creativity and put the studios back on top a suggestion which pisses me off to no end. Everybody has different tastes  I love Coppola and I can't stand Altman  but I find it ironic that although the films discussed and the interviewees are almost always championing antiestablishment stances by doing so the documentary is virtually a propaganda film for cinema's Critical Establishment. Some of the comments are spoton Dern's analysis of the difference between his acting generation and the preceding one Schrader's synopsis of the big studios' transition from factories to banks some are wildly inaccurate MASH was not the first film to treat war as comedy by a long chalk but all are interesting and almost all the talking heads are witty and erudite particularly Corman Friedkin Grier Lumet Mazursky and Platt. At the end of the movie there is a politely amusing slide which reads I can't believe they didn't mention insert filmmaker here.. I could insert specific filmmakers Ralph Bakshi Mel Brooks John Carpenter Larry Cohen Michael Crichton David Cronenberg Walter Hill Peter Hyams John Landis many others but what I'd rather insert is Anybody who was either vaguely disreputable made scuzzy genre movies didn't have artistic pretensions or didn't receive critical approval.. If you evaluate the movies of the seventies which still show up constantly in revival houses and on TV they are all genre movies horror sciencefiction crime action and comedies. This documentary completely ignores them and says that the films we should be remembering are things like McCabe  Mrs Miller and Shampoo. I'm sorry but no way. A pivotal seventies movie like George A. Romero's Dawn Of The Dead has just as much social relevance as any of the movies discussed in this documentary but unlike them is bloody good fun too and what's more people still want to see it today. All this narking aside though this is a very wellmade and intelligent film featuring many interesting filmmakers and not to be missed by moviehounds  just remember that it only reflects a very small criticallyapproved niche of seventies cinema. Sadly codirectorcoproducer Demme who made some nice offbeat flicks The Ref Snitch Blow died of a heartattack not long after production wrapped.".

	schema:reviewBody "...and my reasons for which are simple there are so many great films presented and discussed here most of them by their own directors and stars so many clips of infamous moments in 70's movie history and in fact a number of films I have yet to see that it wouldn't be fair to grade this work. By this logic I shouldn't have given grades to other movie documentaries like Martin Scorsese's Personal Journey through American Movies and My Voyage to Italy. But while those films were on the basis of one man's view of cinema narrating through most of the way Richard LaGravanese and the late Ted Demmes' A Decade Under the Influence lets the films and the creators speak entirely for themselves. What makes 'Decade' worth at least one watch for film buffs or just anyone who likes the films of the late 60's70's in America are the levels that it goes to that in the uncut version three hours not the theatrical version which I have no comment on plenty of ground is covered. Interviews include the likes of Scorsese Robert Altman Sidney Lumet Julie Christie Jon Voight Francis Ford Coppola Paul Schrader Pam Grier Bruce Dern Peter Bogdanovich Roger Corman Dennis Hopper Robert Towne etc and there's a constant flow of insight from start to finish. The way the clips and directorsactors pop up edited together in a flashy and quick style is also fascinating. The one down comment I have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported on in various books like Easy Riders Raging Bulls and though I haven't seen the movie version of that book yet I'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents as here in fact the book of that is one of the best I've ever read. HOWEVER this documentary serves as something special for film buffs and occasional movie goers of the future they can look at this and learn not only about such well known pictures as Easy Rider The Last Picture Show Annie Hall Coming Home and lessor knowns like Scarecrow Panic in Needle Park The Landlord Joe They Shoot Horses Don't They. They can also learn about who influenced them new waves of Europe and Asia who they served as influences for and how the subject matter that created controversy after controversy still serves as intriguing and chancy material for the contemporary crowd. Seek this out!".

Christie and Burstyn are only two out of four women interviewed for this documentary  the others being Polly Platt and Pam Grier  and it makes you wonder why Gena Rowlands Faye Dunaway Diane Keaton Liv Ullman Shelley Duvall and Fonda herself either declined or weren't even approached.The best thing about ADUTI is its nevergivenitsfulldue undercurrent in how most of today's filmmakers and actors are confronted with the same b these mavericks were in their struggle for personal vision and expression.

	schema:reviewBody "As I am a teenager I have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on. I try to see a mixture of classics mainstream arthouse and other movies. The 70's is one of the most important decades for films it's when the average common classical films changed into full of messages and antisocial behavior. It became like nothing anyone had ever seen before. What A Decade Under the Influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around The Graduate to about Star Wars.Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary which interviews such people as Dennis Hopper Francis Ford Coppola Martin Scorsese Robert Altman and Jon Voight among others about how those few years changed cinema forever. It's a very professional polished documentary and it's even financed by IFC films. However as this is a very professional one I would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing. To me that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was.On the other hand it's a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it. Of course they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant. I don't know much about film but I want to be involved around it when I become an adult so I feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset. I have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned like Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest but a little more insight into those movies were very informative.The main reason however I didn't love Influence is as slickly as it was edited it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show. They crammed in Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes when they were two of the most important. It seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips and that's fine but some of them were unimportant such as an extended one from Network.Overall though Influence is a very enthralling informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about a second golden age' in American cinema.My rating 710Rated R for language and images of sexuality violence and drug use.".

	schema:reviewBody "This documentary is based on the idea that the 70's was the most influential decade in American cinema history seeing as this is an opinion that I have always agreed with I am essentially onboard right away. The subject matter more specifically is about the emergence of the New Hollywood. Strictly speaking this was a period that began about 1967 it was in full bloom until the early 70's but didn't properly die out until round about the dawn of the 80's. The period was characterised by personal directorled films. These were quite a lot less commercial and a lot more leftfield than Hollywood had produced previously. They were effectively a response to the boxoffice disasters of several big budget studio pictures that had failed to find an audience in the countercultural times of the late 60's. Once Bonnie and Clyde The Graduate and Easy Rider were released to huge success the studios figured that these types of films were the new way forward and would make them a lot of money. It turned out they were only partially right as while many of the New Hollywood movies were successful in critical terms not many made a lot of money. And once Steven Spielberg and George Lucas released Jaws and Star Wars respectively the age of the blockbuster arrived and it has been thus ever since.As a fan of this period of films I naturally thoroughly enjoyed A Decade Under the Influence. It does have to be admitted though that it is hardly an even handed examination. The view clearly stated is that this was a great time for movies and there is very little in the way of critical counterviews. I don't consider this to be a major problem as this is about shining a torch positively on an interesting period of cinema but it is at least worth acknowledging it. It might have strengthened the documentary overall if there had been some examples of the failures of the movement.Pleasingly there are clips from many films. It made me realise how many of these films I haven't even seen yet and the segments are certainly well chosen which is not a given in these types of docs. The structure is of the talking heads format. We hear the views of directors actors and writers from the period. We learn a lot about their motivations and about the historical context that informed them like Vietnam and Watergate. These were turbulent times in the United States the upshot is that a lot of great contemporary art was produced not just in movies of course but also in books and music too. I think all these things came together at one time and the results are there for all to see. If you are interested in the subject then may I suggest also reading Peter Biskind's excellent book on the subject 'Easy Riders Raging Bulls'  there was a documentary made of that too and while it was good for my money this one is better.".

In fact it really excels in an area in which most film documentaries failit gives plenty of time to the subject and you don't feel shortchanged. My only real complaint is that although the people and films are OFTEN identified this is not always the caseand unless you are very familiar with these people you may forget who is who. This is not a problem for advanced film students and cinemaniacs like myself but for the more casual viewer it might pose a minor inconvenience. Still it's like sitting in an advanced film class where you learn at the feet of the masters.

	schema:reviewBody "In 2003 the Independent Film Channel produced a nearly three hour long three part documentary called A Decade Under The Influence a nod to the 1974 John Cassavetes film A Woman Under The Influence about American cinema during the 1970s. The general posit of the film codirected by Ted Demme and Richard LaGravenese is that the 1970s were a 'tweener period between the collapse of the old Hollywood film studio system and the rise of the Lowest Common Denominator summer blockbuster mentality ushered in by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg that destroyed the template of directors having control and authorship of their works.Now anyone that has even a passing interest in film American or otherwise cannot disagree with this premise. The problem is that the documentary itself is all style including a great opening musical track and no substance. In short it's an MTVlike hyperreal and scattershot take on the films from that decade which were anything but hyperreal and scattershot. Imagine Steven Spielberg bemoaning the loss of Orson Welles when his career is the utter antithesis of that man's. Hypocrisy is a word that floats to mind. That or an ironic streak beyond sharp. Go with the former people!The film starts out with an homage to the European greats of the 1960s who helped inspire the younger Americans. It also has the usual 1970s crowd of filmmakers from greats like Woody Allen Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese to oncegreats like Francis Ford Coppola and Hal Ashby to hasbeens like Peter Bogdanovich and William Friedkin to never weres like Monte Hellman. And there are some classic clips from Easy Rider The Godfather Bonnie And Clyde Chinatown One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest Midnight Cowboy Taxi Driver The Graduate Annie Hall Network and others but it's all perfunctory surface and vain. Not a single film nor scene is really looked at analyzed put into a blender and studied for why it worked why it worked in the context it did nor why such scenes are absent from the films of the Peter Jacksons and Michael Bays.This film lacks any real insight and is too fawning as if a study of a small group of adepts who have a secret they don't want others to know. The problem is that their secret is well known and their acting like they can keep it is just plain silly.A critic like Kenneth Turan or Roger Ebert would likely have remedied those sorts of shortcomings but as with many possible fruitful avenues it could have gone down such as viewing the decade through the lens of a dozen or two key films and analyzing scenes for what they meant and how they expressed their points the whole film fails. It lacks the substance and edginess that it claims for its very subject matter even though some good insight is provided by of all people the British actress Julie Christie.Then there is the smugness. Don't get me wrong guys like Coppola and Scorsese made great films in that decade and while Scorsese's only gone downhill in the last decade Coppola's artistic drought is nearing thirty years since Apocalypse Now. And while Scorsese is not totally condemnatory of modern Hollywood Coppola seems to buy in to the 'Evil Suits' theory of American film destruction. No doubt that that is mostly to blame but many of these young directors got big egos and vanity took over resulting in critical and financial disasters like Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate or the crash and burn personal lives of filmmakers like Peter Bogdanovich whose career never recovered and Roman Polanski whose career did. The only person in the film who even comes close to telling these truths is a production designer from Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show Polly Platt who blames the loss of the edginess that the 1970s films had on just this fatness and sassiness claiming that the young auteurs especially got old rich and lost touch with the very things they and their films once were icons for.A Decade Under The Influence is a soso attempt to reveal the depths of a subject better left for a ten or twelve hour PBS documentary by one of the Burns brothers. That's because the two directors of this film are too soft and intimately related to the subject matter as example Ted Demme's uncle Jonathan Demme was one of the young 1960s auteurs. A more objective approach to the film was needed and this lack of objectivity is the underlying problem that results in all the film's aforementioned problems. In short while they are the symptoms a lack of objectivity is the cause and the best documentaries always strive for objectivity lest they become Michael Moorean agitprop. And that's a fate and storyline as bad as any lame Hollywood suit could brainstorm.".

It lacks the substance and edginess that it claims for its very subject matter even though some good insight is provided by of all people the British actress Julie Christie.Then there is the smugness. Don't get me wrong guys like Coppola and Scorsese made great films in that decade and while Scorsese's only gone downhill in the last decade Coppola's artistic drought is nearing thirty years since Apocalypse Now. And while Scorsese is not totally condemnatory of modern Hollywood Coppola seems to buy in to the 'Evil Suits' theory of American film destruction. No doubt that that is mostly to blame but many of these young directors got big egos and vanity took over resulting in critical and financial disasters like Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate or the crash and burn personal lives of filmmakers like Peter Bogdanovich whose career never recovered and Roman Polanski whose career did. The only person in the film who even comes close to telling these truths is a production designer from Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show Polly Platt who blames the loss of the edginess that the 1970s films had on just this fatness and sassiness claiming that the young auteurs especially got old rich and lost touch with the very things they and their films once were icons for.A Decade Under The Influence is a soso attempt to reveal the depths of a subject better left for a ten or twelve hour PBS documentary by one of the Burns brothers. That's because the two directors of this film are too soft and intimately related to the subject matter as example Ted Demme's uncle Jonathan Demme was one of the young 1960s auteurs. A more objective approach to the film was needed and this lack of objectivity is the underlying problem that results in all the film's aforementioned problems. In short while they are the symptoms a lack of objectivity is the cause and the best documentaries always strive for objectivity lest they become Michael Moorean agitprop. And that's a fate and storyline as bad as any lame Hollywood suit could brainstorm.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like many western Pennsylvania history buffs I had been really looking forward to this muchheralded PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED. However I must say now that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the socalled French and Indian War. In particular its presentation of the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting although it certainly was at time overemphasized. Also on the positive side the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of experts interviews and picture stills a la Ken Burns. On the negative side many of the battles did have a somewhat staged look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. Most of all I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success. Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run that started as a rerun of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Colonel Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.".

Maybe it was the climate in which the war was fought temperate northern forests  green dark humid in the summer dreadfully bare in winter. I went to college in Iroquois country in upstate New York. Some nights were so bitterly cold that the sap froze in the trees and the trunks split open with loud cracks. I remember wondering why the Cayuga just didn't give up and move to Florida.But this is a good documentary. It fills in the gaps for one thing and spells out the dynamic of the competition for resources hello? involving the three principal players  the British in the south the French in the north and the various Indian tribes in between.George Washington was a colonel in the Virginia militia who fought for territory on the side of the British. But there followed disagreements with the mother country over exactly how to pay for the monstrously expensive adventure. Britain at the time was also involved in what was called The Seven Years War busy annexing territories that belonged to the French and Spanish. And Britain imposed some taxes on the colonials  not ruinously high  expecting that Americans would help pay for the war that saved them from the French. The Americans weren't too happy about that because they had no representatives in Parliament and viewed the taxes as alien which led to the Boston Tea Party and all the rest of it.It's an admirably candid and honest history. Washington was friends with some of the Indian leaders but he went ahead and betrayed them to acquire personal land in what is now the Midwest. The Indians aren't portrayed as saints either. They were adept at playing one side against the other and weren't bothered if they had to tomahawk a few innocent heads to get what they wanted.Eventually the French gave up. Montcalm was in charge and HIS mother country starved him of troops and supplies because France's political structure was fragile and somewhat disorganized. His Indian allies deserted him too once they saw which way the wind was blowing.There are maps  just enough of them to make the geographical dynamics a bit easier to follow. Mostly we watch reenactments which are well funded and adequately staged. The acting on the whole isn't bad but the poor guy playing Pontiac  yes Pontiac  has a voice that suggests not an Indian but a nice Jewish kid from Brooklyn.

It's just too bad that PBS aired it late at night in the region where many of the Native actors from NY live. There was little or no publicity about the show in Central New York. I do hope this film is made available to schools and public libraries and will be rebroadcast if it hasn't been already.I also noticed some mistakes on your list of cast members. One actor is actually Elmer John Jr. and Curtis D. Fishinghawk was completely omitted. Many of the same actors met on this film and became friends then later worked together on other projects. Through these projects I met John Bert who is very talented organized and professional. John I wish you well in future endeavors and appreciate your kindness toward me. Let me know if you need to go SU ball cap shopping again! I will promise not to get you killed on the highway!".

	schema:reviewBody "The War That Made America is an interesting look at a conflict that doesn't get much attention. Although known as The Seven Years War it should be recognized as The First World War. But you wouldn't know that from this series. Other than a few passing paragraphs the war seems confined to New England.A friend of mine pointed out one major fact. If this is indeed to be the war that made America the series is much too small. If it is to be the war that made George Washington it is too big. I found myself watching the story and learning some small items I didn't know about. But when Washington leaves our story after Braddock's Defeat in 1755 the writers seem obligated to try and find some way to return him as if it were a drama where the main character dies in the first minutes of the movie. What we end up with is a machinegunned history lesson about the politics of the era for the first three hours followed by a lead up to the American Revolution in the final 50 minutes.This story would have been better laid out by describing the events leading up to the war and how the Indians were as much a part of the politics as the two kings were thousands of miles away. Instead they are regarded as helpless pawns in this worldwide chess game a fact that is absolutely untrue.The look is fantastic. Great locations with great action. I could have done without the characters looking at the camera and Graham Greenes walkthru. But all in all it should serve as a great icebreaker to those interested in The French and Indian War. However if you want a better story go to the library.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tempo Di Uccidere Time To Kill by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange film but it's good in it's own way.I won't bother with a summary of the plot. Most that I've read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didn't really understand the film. And you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what it's actually about. This film is strange in a Once Upon a Time in America way only shorter.Many 'Hollywood' stars whatever that may mean... have played in lesser known Italian productions. It's known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly rising to it do this. Cage was not yet a real star when this was made. I'm not a fan of him. He's very good in some roles Raising Arizona Bringing out the Dead and weak when he plays the hero. I don't really know what to think of him in this one but he sure doesn't portray the typical hero main character. This film could have done without him but the fact that he starred may be the only reason this one ever made it to DVD.The supporting cast is good. Not one of them looks fake and they act as if they are really there. Solid support.I have seen 3 films by Montaldo Marco Polo SaccoVanzetti and this one and I think he is one of the greater directors of this time. Unfortunately nobody knows him. This movie was his last in a long time a break of 19 years. I think that this movie might have failed at the office but from the way it is done I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked.The production is great. It's always enough. The dusty army camps the claustophobic cities and the magnificent landscape all play a great part. It all feels very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special but the music by Ennio Morricone is very good. It's not a piece that you will whistle when in the shower but it sure works great.So this movie looks feels and sounds just right. It doesn't serve the lessons learned from it on a golden platter but that may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and eurocinema all around. It might sound strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people but that is what I do. If you are looking for action avoid this one! If you are looking for a well made Apocalypse Now in a different time and setting but with a bit of similar journey into a 'state of mind'sorry if this sound corny but I don't know what else to call it you just might enjoy this one a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to know the hard mechanics the mathematical underpinnings and other details behind string theory look elsewhere. If you want to know what physicists are up to these days then you've found your documentary.The film makes no attempt to explain the equations behind string theory but instead gives a synopsis of science history and thinking followed by the theories developed from that history in a very plain and simple way most people read that as people who are not into physics can understand.There're no incredibly long differentials strung out on a chalk board or butcher paper for the more educated viewer to scrutinize copy and hence play with. What this film is is a presentation of how the scientific community and specifically high energy physics is dealing with explaining the basic and fundamental mechanics of existence. If you thought otherwise and are into physics and were subsequently let down by the program then maybe you're not as bright as you thought. That's just some food for thought. I think Einstein once remarked that he believed the universe at its core ought to be elegant simple and easy to understand. That's the whole point of this documentary To explain to people how and why the world around us is the way it is.Myself a person who's trained in science and who's read some literature on the more theoretical fields of physics I found this miniseries to be very entertaining and hope I get to see another special about the next big breakthrough in physics. I learned about things that quite frankly I had no idea existed.If you're just an amateur scientist or just have a passing interest in scientific things then this small series should entertain. Heck even if you're an undergrad you might learn something. Enjoy ".

The level of detail it went into was minimal and I always got the feeling the audience was being patronized  there was a lot of what seemed to me as This is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway. Let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you. The host would drop interestingsounding words such as sparticles and supersymmetry without any attempt at explaining what it was. We had to look it up on Wikipedia.Furthermore I know quite a bit about superstrings for a layman and I found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better. They could have chosen MUCH better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject.Additionally I got so sick of the repetitiveness. They could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition. They must have shown the clips of the Quantum Caf about 8 times. The host kept saying the same things over and over and over again. I can't remember how many times he said The universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings. It's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread.Finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between Fermilab and CERN clearly biased towards Fermilab. This is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that was part of the patronizing  Audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested. Please. Give me a little more credit than that.Overall 2 thumbs down ".

	schema:reviewBody "Many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a Physics course  I know I didn't. But after watching this program I surely wish I had.This documentary is a guide to the 'Holy Grail of Physics'  the quest to unify all the fundamental forces of the universe into one 'master equation' that eluded Einstein during the last years of his life. Brian Green a professor at Columbia University introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in.We start with the tantalizing possibility of a 'master equation' that could unite and explain everything... everything! in this universe including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist electromagnetism the strong nuclear force the weak nuclear force and gravity. Green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of Newton then Einstein and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level.But it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued physicists for years and one that no one has been able to solve just yet. How can we unify all these forces that we know together? We find as Green constantly points out throughout the problem  that the answer to this perplexing problem could be in the theory of strings. However if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory there is a very big price to pay.It turns out that out of the mind numbing mathematical equations of string theory that as a consequence we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with not just 3 dimensions that you and I see every day plus 1 for time but rather that we may actually live in a universe of 11 dimensions. But the math that arises out of that theory doesn't stop there  the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel universes some of them right next to you and me! Could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously? As Green points out we have yet to fully find out but we do know that the math that has arisen from these equations are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us.For those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program  fear not. Professor Green does a wonderful job of doing away with the math and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the concept  which when you take away all the math from it transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and as Green constantly points out 'elegant' concept. Viewers of this program need no prior background in science the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them.When you finish this program you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I myself am a physics student and I have to say I think this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to string theory that's out there. The Elegant Universe manages to make the entire topic of string although it's actually M theory accessible to a wider audience.Some 'popular science' programmes feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience in at the deep end throwing technical jargon at them without so much as an explanation and presenting the theory in a boring stale style. This programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.I suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes but the thing is that's against the point. Explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base and the way it's explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining.Whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that Greene presents extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life are they? But if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics well it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!".

This programme goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two so we have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and small scale.I suppose some could say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting stuff like extra dimensions and wormholes but the thing is that's against the point. Explaining string theory from the start is nigh on impossible without at least mentioning the physics at its base and the way it's explained in The Elegant Universe is clear and entertaining.Whether you'll like this program really does depend on if you're willing to perhaps be initially dumbfounded by some of the ideas that Greene presents extra dimensions and warping of spacetime aren't exactly prevalent in everyday life are they? But if you persevere with some of the more exotic concepts in this programme you'll find that it will give you an insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you're studying physics well it's great entertainment as well as you'll be likely able to follow this and appreciate it even more!";

Starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a Universe of pure magic  and dimensions beyond. I have always had a huge appreciation of Mathematics. This movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.The show is repetitive at times as the original format was a miniseries split over three shows.

	schema:headline " R.I.P. Paul Naschy  Legends Never Die!";
	schema:reviewBody "The World of Horror has lost one of its last remaining icons. I was deeply saddened to learn that Paul Naschy born Jacinto Molina a true deity of European Exploitation cinema and one of the last living legends of the Horror genre died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 75 in his native Madrid last week. Maybe best known for playing the Werewolf Waldemar Daninsky in thirteen films between 1968 and 2004 Naschy was a multitalent who scripted and directed many of the films he starred in himself and doubtlessly the most charismatic and influential leading man in Spanish Horror cinema. Not all of the films in Naschy's career may qualify as 'good' in a traditional sense though some such as the nearbrilliant El Jorobado De La Morgue of 1973 doubtlessly qualify as great but they are almost entirely highly entertaining and impossiblenottolove gems of European Horror cinema and they all have a certain inimitable charm to them that can not be found anywhere but in a Naschyfilm. The world of cultcinema is a lot poorer for the loss of this great man but it is oh so much richer for the wonderful films he has given us. So what would be a better way of mourning this icon than to celebrate his work by watching as many of his films as possible? I had delayed the viewing of this film several times for the reason that I generally prefer my Horror to be old and therefore rather watched the films Naschy did in the 70s and 80s. These preconceptions were unfounded as one of the most wonderful films Naschy ever was in was the 2004 film Rojo Sangre which was directed by his son and which basically was a giant tribute to leading man Naschy. Carlos Gil's School Killer of 2001 is indeed not one of Naschy's best films but it s still a highly entertaining Naschy onemanshow that none of my fellow fans of the man should miss. The main attraction of the film is of course Paul Naschy who stars as the eponymous School Killer. The film starts out pretty unimaginative when a bunch of kids decide to spend the night at an abandoned old boarding school set in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. Strange and supernatural things soon begin to happen and when it turns out that the school was the site of a massacre in 1973 things begin to get out of hand... The film begins unspectacular and gets a little ridiculous when the first supernatural events occur. However it really catches up in the second half and once one has acquired a taste for the rather farfetched premise of the film it actually becomes really creepy. Naschy is once again awesome and wonderfully creepy in his role which basically carries the whole film. The rest of the cast aren't memorable and their characters are pretty forgettable however even though the young characters are a little annoying at times Naschy's creepiness makes it possible to actually feel for them.Overall School Killer is no must see but it is a decent little film and especially now it is mandatory for us Naschy fans to see the master in as many of his later roles as possible. There are dozens of Naschy films to recommend over this one such as El Jorobado De La Morgue The Hunchback of the Morgue 1973 La Orgia De Los Muertos The Hanging Woman 1973 El Espanto Surge De La Tumba Horror Rises from The Tomb 1973 Latidos De Panico Panic Beats 1983 any of the Waldemar Daninsky films like La Noche De Walpurgis The Werewolf Vs the Vampire Woman 1971 or more recently Rojo Sangre 2004. However once one has seen many of the films Naschy has been in this is yet another worthy addition to his oeuvre. Once again The World of Horror has lost one of its last icons. My deep condolences go to Paul Naschy's family. Rest in peace Hombre Lobo. You were a legend and you always will be. And legends never die!".

The rest of the cast aren't memorable and their characters are pretty forgettable however even though the young characters are a little annoying at times Naschy's creepiness makes it possible to actually feel for them.Overall School Killer is no must see but it is a decent little film and especially now it is mandatory for us Naschy fans to see the master in as many of his later roles as possible. There are dozens of Naschy films to recommend over this one such as El Jorobado De La Morgue The Hunchback of the Morgue 1973 La Orgia De Los Muertos The Hanging Woman 1973 El Espanto Surge De La Tumba Horror Rises from The Tomb 1973 Latidos De Panico Panic Beats 1983 any of the Waldemar Daninsky films like La Noche De Walpurgis The Werewolf Vs the Vampire Woman 1971 or more recently Rojo Sangre 2004. However once one has seen many of the films Naschy has been in this is yet another worthy addition to his oeuvre. Once again The World of Horror has lost one of its last icons. My deep condolences go to Paul Naschy's family. Rest in peace Hombre Lobo. You were a legend and you always will be. And legends never die!";

Unfortunately for them the person responsible for the slaughter still lurks the halls of the derelict school and he is not happy with their presence.This film is not like most modern teen slashers we've seen. It's much darker much more suspenseful no wisecracking murderer etc. and I liked it for those reasons. From a filmmaking pointofview it's not great. The acting is below average. The writing was pretty bad and quite full of clichs containing randomly tossedin references to American horror films some that didn't even make sense like. . . Have you seen Scream 3? a girl asks. Yes I have and it had nothing to do with walking through the doors of an old school so it in no way relates to this film. But hey it's a slasher flick those are part of the fun. Also the underutilization of characters was heavily exhibited in this film. There were six main characters not including The Security Guard and to be honest only three or four were really used. Two characters the token black guy and some other girl that wasn't important enough to get a label barely spoke Between them I'd estimate about five or six lines total. Also the girls other than one weren't formed well enough to differentiate them from one another. They could've replaced each of the girls with one another repeatedly throughout the film and I wouldn't have noticed the difference. The pacing however works well as the horror begins right from the start and rarely ceases. The atmosphere is utilized well and the direction reveals some truly chilling moments. . . although the overall appearance is a bit cheaplooking due to what I assume is lowgrade camera equipment and operation. The ending though I liked the idea they were going for was fairly poorly done. It felt rushed and without explanation enough to make it effective. With the amount of time they spent running around looking for nothing they could've spent a little bit more time on the conclusion to make sure it didn't feel like some random event thrown in for no good reason which is a flaw many modern horror films are afflicted with. However ignoring a few irksome issues and trying to focus on the first 98 of the film rather than the ending this is actually a rather good modern slasher that should be checked out especially if you're a fan of Spanish andor atmospheric horror.Obligatory Slasher ElementsViolenceGore There's a good bit of blood and gore realistically done but not buckets. The violence is extremely well done not to excess but pretty brutal at points.SexNudity Little bit and with the hottest girl in the film.Cool Killer Well security guards are hardly considered 'cool' but this guy is pretty wicked. His creepy smile was chilling.ScaresSuspense The suspense is topnotch. . . very tense very well done. There are also some extremely creepy moments that fused jump scares and the spooky atmosphere.Mystery None at all really.Awkward Dance Scene Of course between a couple of guys and a halfunwilling female in the flashback.Classic Quote of the Film 'One more trophy.' Final verdict 710. This may be stretching it but fans of Session 9 might want to check it out simply for the similar tone and atmosphere.AP3".

Director Carlos Gil relates the intriguing story at a brisk pace and does an adept job of creating a compellingly spooky and mysterious atmosphere. The witty script by Tino Blanco and Mercedes Holgueras offers a clever and inspired blend of slasher and supernatural elements that keep the viewer guessing to the very end. The slick cinematography by Fernando Arribas makes expert use of light and shadow. David San Jose's moody score likewise does the trick. The attractive and appealing young cast all contribute lively and engaging performances with especially praiseworthy turns by Carlos Fuentes as ringleader Ramon Olivia Molina as the panicky Maria Zoe Berriatua as obnoxious joker Jordi and Carmen Morales as spunky goth chick Sandra. The murder set pieces are every bit as bloody and brutal as they ought to be. Terrific whammy of a surprise dark ending too. A solid and satisfying shocker.".

	schema:headline " Does more than the usual slasher fare";
	schema:reviewBody "Spain has produced a number of good horror films over the last two decades with directors such as Alejandro Amenabar lex de la Iglesia and Jaume Balaguer making some truly standout films. School Killer stars one of the main players of seventieseighties Spanish horror films in the form of the great Paul Naschy but overall I'm not surprised that this film doesn't get mentioned alongside the likes of Tesis Rec and Day of the Beast as one of the better modern films to come out of Spain as despite some good ideas there's far too many things wrong with it. The plot is not particularly original and focuses on the common horror film ideas of a bunch of kids getting into trouble and an old abandoned building harbouring a maniacal killer. The kids decide to go to the old school building where one of their dads stayed twenty seven years earlier for a party but it soon becomes apparent that there's something strange going on inside the building and they soon learn that the boy's father was the only survivor of a massacre the night that he and his friends stayed there.The best thing about this film is undoubtedly the atmosphere and director Carlos Gil succeeds in creating a truly foreboding feeling that suits the film very well and excellently compliments the plot and the building at the centre of the story. I went into this film expecting a slasher and thus without any high hopes but to the film's credit it actually tries to be more than that and it could be argued that the film is more of a psychological thriller. This certainly gives the film an extra element of interest and it manages to take a mysterious plot and blend it well with the gore you'd expect from a slasher. Paul Naschy is obviously the main standout of the cast and he still has a good screen presence despite his advanced years and provides an extremely effective villain. As mentioned the film does feature some good gore and although it doesn't feature all the way through what we do get works well within the context. The film is rather slow to start and it doesn't really get interesting until the final third. However despite this the film doesn't end very well and there's too much left unexplained for this to be an effective film overall. Still School Killer is better than a lot of modern horror films and is at least worth a look.".

Some witty exchanges between the characters..layered in their dialogue are popculture references to American horror films which might annoy some viewers. A demented Naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully..quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish. I found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience. I don't think these tricks are necessarily needed but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks. A minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them. Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot.

The twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt but this might..or might notwork considering how the story plays out regarding why Ramn's father is shown amongst those ghosts reenacting those grisly events two decades prior.

The security guard Naschy kills 5 of them but the last man alive gets Naschy in the head with an ax and throws him down a well. 27 years later the son of the man who killed Naschy comes to the abandoned school with his father's diary and the ghosts of the 6 people murdered are seen by the 6 who are there now. The father is trying to tell them Naschy is alive but by the time they figure it out they are all killed and become ghosts too. Paul Naschy gives this movie both class and makes the ghost story which is somewhat old fashioned really work. A lot better than the Blair Witch or the slasher side of the film do. The only thing I didn't like was the foreign rock soundtrack. If you have to use rock do like Argento and use Iron Maiden or Motorhead. Maybe these guys are big in Spain I don't know. For great Naschy look for Frankenstein's Bloody Terror or Night of the Werewolf The Craving or at least Horror Rises From the Tomb.".

	schema:reviewBody "School Killer 2001  12 out of 4 Extremely creepy Spanish film about six college students who go and spend the night at an abandoned school where six kids were killed 27 years earlier. This film from director Carlos Gil is without a doubt one of the best horror films I've seen in quite some time. The film had me on the edge of my seat throughout and that's saying a lot because I don't normally get creeped out by any film. Not The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Exorcist were able to scare me but this one here did. The film is neck deep in atmosphere and the direction is terrific throughout. The screenplay is also very good and gives us characters that we care about and know. These characters just aren't there to be slaughtered like so many American horror films. The film is smart about the genre and smart in the way it plays out. Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy plays the security guard and gives a very good performance as does the rest of the cast. The theatrical trailer makes it seem like this is an outright slasher but it's more in the ghost genre and certainly one of the best I've seen. The only negative is some heavy metal music that is played during a few scenes.".

I thought there will be at least another 2030 minutes to go and the credit rolls already!

The acting is so bad the plot so non existent and the ending so completely baffling it will have you laughing the whole way through. There are scenes in this film that take comedy to a new level. Do not expect an Oscar winner but believe me for the small price you will pay for this disaster it is worth every penny.".

The men were particularly annoying and mostly made sexist comments though a few of the women were also annoying and crass. Eventually the killing began but it took way too long! This film is obviously a semiprofessional sort of film. The acting is fair the writing is abominable and it all looks like it was filmed with a home video camerawith sound that ranged from very good to almost unintelligible.

Once the story involves into granny things go wrong. But it's already too late. The first ten minutes destroyed this flick. You couldn't care about any person. When the killings start the first one was rather okay for a no budget. But from then on it becomes ridiculous. The stabbing of a girl has no red stuff flying around and the knife used is bloodless. What a mistake. Just before the girl is stabbed it again takes ages before she's ready making herself beautiful. By having all killings offcamera and only seeing the result it degrades to a turkey. But clocking in under a hour makes it watchable. The plot was a good thought although seen it before in April Fool's Day 1986.

The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the innermost paranoia the protagonist. Pavlosky's selections of mise en scene furthermore enhance the unnerving and manical atmosphere of the nights events combining with the Oscar worthy performances to create a chilling and thought provoking masterpiece.

The message came through loud and clear about God's love for us and Jesus's sacrifice. The movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be Pete's anger of the blond girl's sneers or the guy that asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear Gospel message. The mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. Nicky D showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer without Christ it doesn't matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to Christ.".

The movie was realistic and showed actual human feelings whether it be Pete's anger of the blond girl's sneers or the guy that asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and that attracted my eye. But what I liked most about this movie was the clear Gospel message. The mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a godly example to others. Nicky D showed that no matter if you have all the world has to offer without Christ it doesn't matter. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the mark. I loved this movie and think that it will bring many teenagers to Christ.";

Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the nice cars in the film or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you as a movie AND witnessing tool Lay it Down hardly delivers. Most good opinions of the movies are supported by Christians agreeing with the message. While it's easy for a Christian to agree with the points delivered the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a clich. The fighting scene between Ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. And there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.I encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. It really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. The director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a moviegoer's needs he shows a pedantic understanding of Nonchristians as well as some points of religious conflict most of the editing he admits was rushed but satisfactory he thought the overused transitions and themes to be effective and was completely happy with the acting. He also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of All read most of the names are significant. Ben Destin  Been Destined Gus Pelman  Gospel Man Nicky D  Nicodemus. The car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without Christ. When Ben leaves on Pete's motorcycle he crosses his crutches to form a cross.I'm not making any of those up. He throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like blow their brains out with guns and how God is in control when your born and when your die. Yes that was not a typo. He really says that.I have little forgiveness reserved for this movie. The cool cars and good message don't do jack to make this movie good. However the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1100th of The Fast and the Furious's and the time limit was unforgiving. With that in mind I give it a score of 210 instead of the 110 I so dearly think it deserves.".

The two stars Edmondson taking his usual backseat this time due to the fact that he adequately directs never really get into first gear Mayall only sporadically showing the foulmouthed mania that makes us love him on the small screen. Indeed the writers' presumption that we are already familiar with the characters leads to them being underdelivered to the audience. The slight hints of depth seen in the series Richie's effeminate failed socialclimbing for example are not present here and instead we are left with parodies of parodies.The Fawlty Towers accusation does pass water complete with drunken chef and unseen calledfor waiter Pasquele which uncannily rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a childrens' swing hanging over a cliff face are very very funny but ultimately the frenetic pace is stolen the two constantly looking for a studio audience that isn't there and all the dead laugh areas patched up with incidental comedy music that would have been dated in a Carry On film two decades ago.Paridiso's brand of puerile sadistic perverse humour IS funny and I feel sure it will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.".

Its nearly the dumbest thing I've ever seen him do it doesn't even compare to The Young Ones when he tried to kill himself with laxative pills. How he got from talking to a love Goddess to blowing up in an oven while still having the underwear on I have no idea.In the long run yes this is definitely one of those plot doesn't matter films so sit back relax and take an hour and a half of Ade and Rik nearly killing each other while running a hotel it makes Fawlty Towers' service look like The WaldorfAstoria.

As if that wasn't reason enough to avoid it the owners Eddie and Richard are about the least competent or hospitable people in the hotel trade  making Basil Fawlty looking like the best manager in the world. When a disaster in the kitchen proves to be the last straw for the few guests living there Richard and Eddie finds themselves alone in the hotel. The blissful peace doesn't last long though because a young family The Nice's turn up with the Paradiso being the only place they can afford. This is bad enough but things are only going to get more complicated when an Italian film star rubber swimwear and a dish called fish surprise come into play.It is not always possible to say that a film is bad or good because sometimes they are aimed so specifically at a particular audience that if you're not in that group then it is likely that you will hate it while they think it is fantastic. In these situations it is possible that the majority rule is not necessarily right but Guest house Paradiso is an example of where you really want to be trusting the majority. Of course you could fall into a very small group of people who find uninspired crudity funny but if that is you then you probably have more important things to sort out than to be watching this film. Those who like Bottom will love this but I would be surprised if anyone else found much to enjoy in this thing the violent and crude slapstick is basically copied from that TV show which is a problem because as you might guess I'm not a fan of it at all.The narrative here is pathetic though and makes Bottom's plots about sex etc look like highly polished works of literature. Here we have plots about Italian film stars video tapes of rubber cavorting nuclear fish and when all else fails vomit lots of vomit. The script doesn't offer anything other than crudity to work with and by the end of the film I had been worn down by shoddy jokes crudity for crudity's sake and an endless feeling of being rather soiled by the whole affair. Normally I would sorry for the cast in this sort of film but since Mayall and Edmondson wrote and directed this they have nobody to blame. They can take a punch but they cannot make this tired old filth feel fresh or funny by the time they are swimming in green vomit I really worried that they must have actually thought this was a good idea and worth doing. Support from Pegg is sad because he has shown himself to be much smarter than this with his various projects and this must have been like a low point for him. How on earth Casell Nighy and Mahieu got involved is beyond me.Overall if you think Bottom is the funniest thing ever then you will enjoy this film. For the vast majority of audiences though it is endlessly crude and constantly just aiming for the lowest form of humour that it can get the big climax of loads of vomit just made me wonder what on earth the funders of this rubbish were thinking. I apologise to all the teenage boys who think this film is brilliant but I gotta call it like I see it and this is sht of the highest or lowest order.".

Bad acting bad jokes. Faecal humour which I simply cannot stand. Sorry but snot pee and scat are not funny. You have seen the title picture? That scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and mutilating each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. It is not.Apart from body fluids violence and crossdressing I do not remember much about this. At least not much good. I was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage.

Rik And Adrian edminson are two fine comedians who deserve another shot at Bottom and maybe even a guest house II.

Unfortunately these laughoutloud moments make you realize how lessthanbrilliant the rest of the movie is. The slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.The end of the movie the 'green' scenes for those of you who've seen it was... perhaps the worst ending I've seen in the past decade. Honestly. It was one joke repeated about thirty times followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense which didn't bother me and wasn't funny which did.To sum up I was sorely disappointed by this movie. I shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it to retain the fondest memories that I can... but I have to warn you if you're about to overpay for your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer don't.

	schema:reviewBody "...it is still entertaining and interesting. Many people have complained that this is Don on autopilot. Nothing could be further from the truth. Granted the FILMMAKERS were on autopilot. The overt kiddie flick tone of Figg was obviously an attempt to counter the perceived flack the studio got from the mild sexual overtones of Knotts'previous film the classic The Love God?. And Figg is a goofy childish film in many wayssimilar to the worst of Disney's live action romps like Herbie Goes Bannanas or The Million Dollar Duck..But the film does do one thing rightit changes up the standard Don Knotts film character. As everyone notes the standard character in Knotts' five classic Universal flicks is basically Barney Fife. But it's more complex than that. In the first four films the Knotts character was invariably a naf loser who is put upon becomes an undeserved success gets a big head is brought down again and eventually perseveres. Through it all however he is always a nice guy. This however is only half of the Fife persona. The other half is what I like to call the Dick Barney as in The Barney Who Acts Like a Dick. This angrier Barn is evident in the Andy Griffith episodes in which Barney is in charge of Gomer or Goober. Seeing them as inferiors the inferioritycomplex riddled Barney is always compelled to order them around yell at them and call them stupidin other words to just treat them like a dick. This kind of interaction was the source of many hilarious slow burn Barney tantrums.The Knotts we see in Figg is not the Nice Barney it is definitely the Dick Barney. So even though the plot of Figg is pretty much a cookiecutter slice of the standard Knott's formula the lead character is a definite change for the film series. The substitute Gomer in Figg is Knott's best friend Prentiss played by voice artist Frank Welker. And Prentiss makes Gomer look like a freakin' genius in fact Welker's performance is so over the top childlike that he seems literally retardedbut no one really seems to notice. Knotts' Figg character verbally rails on Prentiss without mercy eyes popping veins bulging his whole body vibrating with rage. IT IS A RIOT TO BEHOLD!So even though the script supporting cast and direction of Figg were all substandard Knotts himself did at least try to give us something different instead of simply rehashing the same ole same ole. Gotta give him credit for that!".

Among them are Kermit Sanderson Joe Flynn the mayor Edward Andrews and the towns' elderly bigwig Charley Spaulding Parker Fennelly. One method employed by our comedic villains is to reward Figg with a do nothing job and a smoking hot secretary Yvonne Batgirl Craig.Knotts is in typically fine form even if he's had better material before and after this one. He still knows how to do a great comedic over reaction. Here his flamboyant style is complemented by a young costar and it is here that How to Frame a Figg has its greatest value a rare substantial on screen appearance by the legendary voice over artist Frank Welker a guy whom most people have to have heard in SOMETHING. He's had tons of credits over the last several decades. He's good as a cheerful endearingly annoying type. It also helps Figg look smarter by having a sidekick who's even more dense and who is prone to constantly reference classic movie moments.The very fine supporting cast helps matters a lot. Elaine Joyce is appealing as a waitress and love interest for our hero. Craig is tantalizingly sexy as the temptress with lots of doting uncles. Fennelly is a hoot as the irascible ringleader who refers to his underlings as poop heads. This IS rated G.Like a lot of comedies it can get pretty silly and tiresome at times but it's still impossible to truly dislike.Directed by Knotts' frequent coconspirator Alan Rafkin The Ghost and Mr. Chicken The Shakiest Gun in the West with appropriately goofy music by Vic Mizzy. Knotts shares story credit with Edward Montagne.Six out of 10.".

My verdict I found most of it pretty hilarious what with Don Knotts' usual persona of a nervous easily upset reluctant hero.

	schema:text "    The modern suburbs have ultimately become an unsustainable way of living. They were originally developed in an era of cheap oil when the automobile became the center of the way people lived and an era when people wanted to escape the inner city to a more pastoral or rural way of life. However the suburbs quickly evolved into a merely a place to live that had neither the benefits of rural or urban life and where one was reliant on an automobile both to travel elsewhere and even travel within the neighborhood. The suburbs are not only dependent upon cheap energy but also reliable energy. The reliability of energy is becoming less so as demonstrated by the multiday blackout of the North American Eastern Seaboard starting on August 14 2003. Part of the problem of getting out of the suburban mentality is that a generation has grown up believing it to be a normal way of life and a life of entitlement which they will not give up without a fight. But many developers and planners and ...";

A lot of the topics are plain common sense and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them. But you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this film is meant to scare people. It's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead and maybe to encourage you to think twice about commuting 100miles to work and leaving your lights on all day long.After watching this film I was no longer able to look at the cars and buses zooming by quite the same.

Oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on farms. When the inevitable oil shortages hit a lot of things  air travel many drugs plastics life in the suburbs  will become impossible. But the craziest insight from the documentary is this oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange postoil world which the documentary claims could be starting NOW.Despite its gloomy message the documentary is often highly entertaining. It contains fabulous historical footage sober images of dark urban factories and campy funny stuff from the 1950's which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place. It also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place.My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now. How can this be a big emergency all of a sudden? We knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a postoil world  and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our failure to follow through on President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a postoil world why was no one shouting about it on soapboxes?In the end I found the documentary highly persuasive and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream.

As we extract oil and power we come to a peak in production. More oil is demanded less oil is generated. The inevitable outcome is conflict and major change. This film will be disturbing and alarming if you're new to the topic. You may react at first with anger and denial because the implications are so grim. It should be required viewing. Beyond politics beyond optimism the math is undeniable. Suburbia is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the communities most impacted when the price of energy skyrockets. While intuitive logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis the spread out nature of suburbia will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us. Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. This issue will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. This film is a lucid coherent look at it.".

What I got was a bunch of antioil doomsaying fearmongering talking heads who as far as I could tell had no association with any universities government organizations or thinktanks.

Each person featured in the film either had a book to sell on the subject of antioil or otherwise had an interest in the field.That said I find this film more in line of those by Michael Moore and less of actual documentaries. Fair and balanced this was not. Now I do enjoy Moore's films but calling them American History is a bit out of line the same way this film stretched it's educational worth. The amount of fearmongering and doomsaying involved was enough to seriously anger me at the film. I was severely upset at how low these pundits stooped to get an emotional reaction.And they barely made you feel any better about the future. Between a depression we will never escape to visions of a oildepleted Holocaust they really didn't give the viewer any hope about the alternatives. Personally I feel that rising oil prices will make environmentally progressive energy sources look more appealing to the energy companies which is a very good thing. Needless to say this film didn't affirm my positive views of the future.So if you want an emotionally charged propagandaesq film filled with holier than thou individuals who probably also believe JFK was killed by aliens this may be for you. But if you want a serious educational film about the how's and why's of suburbia's eventual decline stay away. Needless to say this film pushed my buttons and not in the ways I wanted.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been most fortunate this year to have seen several films at my university's art museum. On occasion well more like half of the time I am unable to watch the films there. I have systematically attempted to view each of the films that I have missed. So far Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea and Who Killed the Electric Car? are the other films that I have had to watch this way. The film covers an intriguing subject matter and is welltheorized emphasis on this later but not as successful as Plagues and Pleasures but far superior to Electric Car. The film's thesis concern's the future of the American concept of suburban living. It questions the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. So the film discusses the origin of the suburb and it's evolution until the early 2000s. One theme the film discusses at length is the alienation the suburb creates among its inhabitants. While several people may live together they do not know each other as we define the word. This to me represents the strength of the film its appeal to actual human emotion. We are able to understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of their argument's legitimacy. This is also one of the reasons Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. Unfortunately Suburbia loses its message in firebrand explanation in support of its central argument. As those interviewed speak their arguments become progressively more akin to those made by militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade but are given no scientific evidence professional reports statistics graphs etc in support of this claim. We are given little information as to how this date was calculated. Fortunately this was the only significant flaw that I was able to detect in the film's argument yet it's a glaring one nevertheless. Another lessimportant discrepancy I noticed was the liberal political bias which could polarize some viewers. However this bias is revealed thorough clips of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. The clips especially those from the 1950's seemed a tad unnecessary to me. The film was no better with their presence and would have been more concise in their absence. As I thought more of this film before composing this review I thought about why I found its argument more convincing than other documentaries that I'd recently viewed. Finally I realized that the filmmakers actually offered analysis to the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized villagesystem where pockets of people would live together. They posit this practice would lower the necessity for fossil fuels and reduce wasted space. They define wasted space as the long stretches of parking lots between shopping areas for instance. What is incredible about this supposition is that it's actually conceivable. Most documentaries vaguely state that some problem should be ended but offer no method of doing so. Thinking more about the film I decided that this analysis is what saved the film for me and why I give it a favorable review. While neither perfectly convincing nor fluid in presentation The End of Suburbia is a worthwhile investment of one's time. It not only addresses the contemporary problem of sprawl but it also provides realistic insight on how to amend it. The audience can also enjoy the high production value with various clips from the 1950's spliced with the modern arguers. People living in Atlanta Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will particularly enjoy this documentary as sprawl is the most established there.".

	schema:reviewBody "My review covered the documentary 'The End of Suburbia'. This documentary is about the end of the modern suburbs thanks to the end of cheap oil. It covers many different aspects of this topic. These topics are layout for the viewer to understand the issues. I want to begin the review with an analysis of quality of the film. The first topic is the about how suburbs come about. Then the next subject is the unfortunate fact about oil. Finally the documentary talks about 'New Urbanism' as a way help ease the issue. I found the documentary to be very interesting.I think the film is well produced and setup. It is highly organized with a chronological movement. The video does features abstract shots of television and particular the news with the interviewees talking over it. Various music tracks are used in the film. The music is used to make light of certain situation and a creepy soundtrack is used to express the direness of peak oil. The film is well shot in the best way a 'Talking Head' documentary can possible be. It features many interviews with several important people in the peak oil field. This includes Matthew Simmons Richard Heinberg Michael Ruppert and James Howard Kunstler. Their interviews are cut throughout the documentary. They seem very 'Dooms Day' oriented. All of their predictions are apocalyptic in nature and I can clearly see their negative ideology. The film kept my interest with its content and pace.The first topic is the about how the suburbs come about. According to the documentary suburbs came about because the city had a low quality of life and technology gave people a way out. First it was the train then the street car and followed by the automobile. The automobile has helped to bring about the suburban dream. The government and the auto companies worked to together to help make the car the new form of mass transit. Then the next subject is the unfortunate fact about oil. The way we built the suburbs are entirely depend on cheap oil. Cheap oil is the blood in the veins of America. The movie provided several fun facts about oil like when oil was first discovered in Texas it was cheaper than drinking water. The unfortunate reality is that oil peaked in the 1970s and this was predicted by the geologist Dr. M. King Hubbert. He saw it coming and people ridiculed him. They said his predictions were a joke because that year oil production was at its highest. The people who doubted Hubbert's prediction were in the year of peak oil. This peak oil stuff is very scary and really sent shock waves down my spine. Finally the documentary talks about 'New Urbanism' as a way to help ease the issue of peak oil. The 'New Urbanism' is a movement that started in the 80s and seeks to create more walkable cities setups. The ideas want to bring back the old style of planning which the great American cities were built upon. The demand is actually higher for these areas. The documentary talks about a new development called Stapleton which was developed along the lines of 'New Urbanism' and it sells at about 25 higher. People want a more walkable and neighborly place to live. I really liked how the documentary expressed the concept of 'New Urbanism'.".

	schema:headline " strong film that outlines the variety of issues that have threatened suburbia and a uniquely American way of life";
	schema:reviewBody "In The End of Suburbia experts including Barrie Zwicker James Howard Kunstler and Richard Heinberg discuss the explosion of suburbia how it relates to the global peak of oil extraction and what the future may hold for this way of life. With the turn of the 21st century critical reflection and questions have surfaced about the sustainability of this iconic American life style. We know for sure now that Earth has met its oil peak and the decline of fossil fuels is here. This means that global demand for fossil fuels is now exceeding supply and there is no other way of life that uses more oil than suburbia. This film illustrates the history and narrative of suburbia the marketing of the American Dream post WWII and the sprawling suburbs that followed. With the extreme dependence our society has built on oil the instability of suburban life is now obvious and the effects of inaction in the face of this catastrophe are huge not only for suburban residents but for American and the world as a whole. They present their arguments throughout the film alongside historical footage and through a series of interviews with experts raging in fields from authors and scientists to historians and urban planners. I found this method to be fairly effective although it would also have been interesting to hear perspectives from everyday people as well. The questions we're left with are how will the populations of suburbia react to the collapse of their dream? Are today's suburbs destined to become the slums of tomorrow?1 The voices and researchers articulately address these questions and more in The End of Suburbia. This film opens with one of its main arguments suburbia is a failed experiment that has put a huge strain on the world's resources especially fossil fuels. James Howard Kunstler author of The Geography of Nowhere The rise and Decline of America's Man Made Landscape states that the whole suburban project can be summarized very succinctly as The greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. America took all of its post war wealth and invested it in a living arrangement that has no future1. One can safely conclude that suburbia and all its promises plaid a heavy hand in constructing the American dream of independence family freedom peace and prosperity. Experts in this film concluded that this dream was in large part constructed as a reaction to city life specifically life in the industrial city. Early on in the 19th century these cities became a pretty horrible place as stated by Kunstler1. Horrible things came out of the cities like pollution high infant mortality over crowding hunger crime etc. This impacted cities because during this time city communities were almost often gutted through processes like urban renewal. Planners believed that in order to compete with the allure of suburban life they needed to build housing and buildings with more space in the city so they decided to tear them down and rebuild. Meanwhile there was a huge demand for suburban housing millions of house built across the US in the suburbs every year1. Houses were close together and had none of the real amenities of country living such as nature and farmland neither did they have the amenities of city living such as convenient businesses services and public transit. In fact it had the disadvantages of both  inconvenience and traffic congestion. This brings us to another large problem discussed in the film the dependence on cars and oil. And because of this oil abundance cars became the main way America could profit from oil. As we entered the 21st century and met peak oil production we see serious issues emerging that this film attempts to address. With the suburbs being a living arrangement reliant on oil critics and researchers are now speculating that suburbs could become the slums of the future1. Though that is only one of many compelling theories. Another central argument discussed in The End of Suburbia is how suburbia can meet the challenges of living with less oil. Several experts in the film examined a prevailing idea on how we could address these challenges through a movement called New Urbanism. One big thing I believe this film is overlooked is the potential behind renewable and alternative energy. This film was released in 2004 and they seemed to be very skeptical about the possibility of cars that ran on alternative energy  I wonder what they would say now with the popularity and success of hybrid and electric cars like Tesla and SmartCar. Although I believe the film is missing a large aspect within planning and sustainability  in regards to how renewable energy could transform suburbia and America society  they conveyed a great deal of information on possibilities for the future and I believe they were correct with their implication that a successful outcome for we humans in the imminent oilpoor era will emerge through thinking and planning on the scale of small communities. The End of Suburbia applies a wide variety of experts and data on the topics of oil and American development to shed a bright light on the facts while it's analysis on the issues create a convincing portrait of what the future could bring. It utilized historical footage in order to efficiently portray the history of suburbia accurately artistically and sometimes even humorously. It is a strong film that outlines the variety of issues that have threatened suburbia and a uniquely American way of life. Works Cited 1. THE END OF SUBURBIA. 2. Aleklett Kjell.

	schema:reviewBody "In Gregory Greene's The End of Suburbia Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream James Howard Kunstler Peter Calthorpe and many others enter into the conversation about the impending plateau of fossil fuel extraction. This documentary recognizes and validates the existence and imminence of oil depletion. Through the testimony of many experts Greene's movie defines oil depletion investigates its causes and develops arguments about its implications for the future. Mainly the documentary asserts that oil depletion will completely end the suburban lifestyle as we know it. Throughout it tries to disprove any solution to maintaining a suburban way of life. Consequently the points of the film become diluted with futility and are blind to more imaginative solutions. The film turns down all hopes of saving suburban life. The people in the film are rightfully concerned however. The IPCC today has provided the world with more than ample empirical evidence supporting and proving the imminence of oil depletion IPCC. If someone believes it is not an issue they can be immediately and wholly dismissed on multiple scientific levels. And so in this regard the documentary is sound. Then the film goes on to discuss the causes of the issue and it more narrowly defines the issue. The combination of cheap fossil fuels along with the cheap production of the Model T on the assembly line during the industrial revolution of the United States created an entire country based off of the assumption that car travel would always be easy cheap and convenient. Now that it is not  or becoming less so  problems emerge. Here is when the documentary begins to lose credibility in the conversation. Although it defines that causes of the problems it fails to actually define what the real problem is. From watching it I got the sense that they believe that problem is oil depletion. From the title I expected to see the problem as being unable to save the suburban way of life. However the speakers in the film want neither to have more oil nor keep suburbia alive and well. In fact what the many speakers in the film never do is define what they do want. No wonder the film is so incredibly depressing when it comes to looking at the future it has no cohesive vision of what a good future would look like. The brief parts where it does talk about a better future it never realizes ways to make it happen. And these problems in the film are just in the problem definition.When it comes to looking at the future this film is incredibly negative. It claims there is no possible way to sustain even a comparable level of consumerism to what we have today as oil depletion becomes reality. However this is not necessarily true. Many of the criticisms of this film say that it is too quick to dismiss alternative energy sources. The speakers in the film say we must cease to consume but I say consume on! Can the US ever be told to cease its levels of consumption? There are two factors that exist today that will forever characterize the future of American development alternative energy and new urbanism. In his interview James Howard Kunstler claims that there will never be powerful enough alternative energy sources to compete with fossil fuels. But that was in 2004 when the movie was made and today there are solar powered cars off the grid commercial buildings and exponentially more innovative alternative energy sources. To say the argument in the film is dated is an understatement not to mention the average age of the people interviewed in the film must be somewhere around 65. It lacks diversity of imagination. It lacks perspective. Most of all it lacks the level of idealism needed to effectively create change in the world. Until today development has been made for cars. Robert Moses tore apart cities for expressways. Today he is demonized as one of the worst planners to ever exact their efficiency plans on a city. So the world is changing but the stringent views of the people in the film are not. I would like to say that if the people in this video were educated about today's energy possibilities and the ideas behind new urbanism that they may expand their arguments. However if Kunstler is anything to go by this is not the case. Today he actively writes on economic and environmental issues like the ones touched on in this film on his website Kunstler.com however he still writes with an irrational alarmist voice utilizing several exclamation points and figurative language. For every fact he cites he draws a handful of loosely based conclusions that support an argument he obviously already had in mind before he retrieved the fact. And sadly the entire film speaks with a similar voice. The film pulls out a fact spouts off a few things about it and then goes on a path that is only tied enough to the fact to develop a faade of credibility. Essentially this documentary is the result of what happens too often to people who do not value the discipline of academic discourse. Instead of gathering facts investigating a subject and then drawing conclusions this film obviously had all of its conclusions on mind and felt only the need to establish them loosely on fact and propagate the rest of them with alarmism and absolutist claims.

	schema:reviewBody "In The End of Suburbia Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream Director Gregory Greene addresses the issues that the world more specifically suburbs is going to face when oil peaks. Greene is educating his audience on what to expect when the production of oil peaks. The meaning of oil peaking comes from M. King Hubbert's theory in which the production of oil reaches its maximum and starts to decline which causes the price of oil to increase. Greene presents the issues humanity will face when oil production starts to decline with many authors and experts explaining the situation. These experts explain we can no longer ignore this gigantic issue.The End of Suburbia opens up with the history on the development on the suburbs we have today. In the late 1800s society no longer wished to live in the city due to pollution factories and noise. The upper middle class moved into the suburbs seeking to live in peace away from the city. The suburbs started off as a single home on a large estate isolated from everyone. However after WWII soldiers were given homes in the suburbs as gifts for their services to our country and thus began the development of the suburbs we have today.The suburbs started to grow and grow due to the fact that people were now able to buy and own their own homes. As the suburbs grew the issue of transportation grew because people needed to get around. People could no longer walk to places so society turned to automobiles. The reason automobiles was such an easier solution over railroads and buses was due to the fact that suburbs were large and people were spread out making railroads and buses inefficient. People started to depend more and more on cars to get around and it wasn't an issue at the time because gas was very inexpensive. If oil wasn't cheap suburbs wouldn't have existed.As suburbs continued to grow so did the demand on oil and natural gasses. In the suburbs people rely on oil to get around and on natural gasses to provide heat and many other things. As the demand on oil grew because the growth of suburbs the amount of oil is now running out. Julian Darley an expert provided by Greene explains how oil is obtained. He explains that there are two layers of oil the first top layer is easily obtained while the second is very difficult and expensive to get. Once the first layer is gone no matter how much effort you put in you cannot get same rate of production as before in other words the production of oil is peaked.M. King Hubbert a very famous expert on this issue and a worker for shell he conducted a speech on this issue in the midlate 20th century. He calculated by 1970 we would peak and oil production would start to decline. At first although he was much respected nobody took his theory and calculations serious. Until in 1970 when they found out his theory proved to be true that oil production would peak and start to decline. M. King Hubbert's theory also calculated that the world's oil production would peak in the mid1990s. M. King Hubbert's theory would have been correct about that as well if not had been for the prices of oil shooting up in 1970 due to the scare of oil peaking. Today experts are calculating that the world's oil production will peak 1015 after M. King Hubbert's original production.As time passes we now expect to live this same lifestyle forever we are not ready to move backwards. We expect that oil and natural gas will always be there to fuel our cars and heat our homes but to believe that is unrealistic. Suburbs use tons oil and natural gas that it is suggested it was the reason behind the power outage in 2003. From 46pm that is when the most energy is being used commercially industrial and private homes are all using energy at this time. On August 13 2003 roughly a little past 4pm the blackout occurred leaving millions without power. Although it was officially said to have been caused by faulty transmission lines experts like Matthew Simmons think there is a deeper story. He believes the reason 57million people went through a blackout wasn't because faulty lines but because the natural gas everyone was using reached its limit.With the demand of oil being so high in order to maintain the lifestyle we live today what happens after the production of oil peaks? Experts and authors such as Michal Ruppert James Howard and Steve Andrew discuss what the outcome will be. When oil production peaks suburbs will soon come to end due to the fact it cannot function without affordable and reliable fuel. The prices of food will increase because the price of oil to fuel the machine will shoot up. Another gigantic issue we will face is war people will fight over control of the last oil refineries. People all throughout our nation do not know this issue is alive due to the media not covering these issues. The reason behind the media keeping quiet on this entire issue is because oil peaking is bad for business. We as a society must face these facts and prepare for the future. There is no alternative fuel or substance to keep up with the way we are living today. We must change we have to become aware of this issue and educate others on this matter. We must design smaller towns in order to walk to places instead of drive. We can no longer ignore the issue of oil production peaking and start preparing for the issues we are going to have to face.".

One thing I picked up when they being they talk about North America I assume this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For the Canadian bashing I will leave that to Bill O'Reilly.The consequence of the depletion of oil will affect everyone especially those who live in big countries of Australia Canada and the United States. I am sure that Green Peace are cheering no more gas means no more SUVs without realizing people who live in the sub zero temperatures could starve to death. As someone who has studied economics I know for a fact we are living in a world of finite resources. I will give the documentary props for trying to present a balanced point of view about the depletion of oil. However I am studying a degree in journalism this documentary is full of loaded messages  Republican as warmongers. What the Democrats didn't send troops to Vietnam? If you are going to present a documentary about economics and resources it is best to leave the political bashing to one side because it could cause a potential audience member to totally shut down. Concentrate on the issue of finite resources. At the end of the day it is best to open the minds of the mainstream as it is no good preaching to the minuscule choir. I really do enjoy watching documentaries such as Fahrenheit 911 and End of Suburbia not for their political bias because they do remind us the world isn't so safe. Sure I like to shop and consumer junk food like there is no tomorrow but if the world is going to end tomorrow I would rather die rich and consume the living beep out of it. For the potential documentary makers out there just give the people facts and let the viewers make up their own minds. If you are trying package your political views as a balanced documentary the people are going to smell a rat a mile away.".

A young girl comes across a crime scene where LAPD have discovered a dead woman dressed as a ballerina hanging over a hurricane fence topped with razor wire right by their station.

The SIU is where all the bad cases are transferred the ones the LAPD as a whole doesn't want to be blamed for not solving. SIU apparently also covers cold cases. She helps with a home invasionburglar case but is mainly concerned with reopening the ballerina murder case.

	schema:headline " Rubbish Film but one genius moment";
	schema:reviewBody "Where do I begin with the Killing Mind before I mention the good bit? This movie is about a young psychological profiling FBI woman or something that for some reason goes to work for the LAPD for a wee while. There are some recognisable faces like the I love you man bloke from Wayne's World playing a cop nice beardage too! and two guys who always seem to play cops playing..... you guessed it cops. One of them was one of the cops in Gross Point Blank following John Cusack about the place and the other is the FBI guy with specs in Final Destination who is also in the Fugitive as another cop. I know the FBI US Marshalls CIA etc aren't cops but they're all the same. They enforce the law to a certain degree that makes them cops in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down. Any I digress. The woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasn't been looked at for yonks. She saw the dead body as a kid so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it! I also like how the person profiling other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child. Surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head?! She starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open even though he appears to be the same age as the woman so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10 or he wrote a few school reports on it and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it.We then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava. Way to blend moron! Anyway she and the cops she's with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. This if you haven't already guessed is the best bit of the movie. I'm not sadistic and don't have a hatred for babies or anything but the scene just looks so stupid I promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie. It gets better when the cop from Final Destination  the Fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend It's a baby! How did he not know that before he jumped in is beyond me.Anyway she chases after the thief but loses him. Later on she remembers that a random dog didn't bark at the thief so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog. The dog had no markings or anything on it so how she knew where to find the dog and thus find the thief is another question I won't go into. it was shortly after this that I stopped watching. The story was moving really slowly and after I had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit I had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said.Saying that I'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty and she was spending a lot of time with him and anyone who watches Columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy. plus other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious so I'm sure it was him.So all in all a pants film but worth watching just for that one glorious scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK it's violent and bloody and vicious and cruel. It's also wildly creative beautifully filmed brilliantly acted with very few exceptions and has a great framing device. The stories are both filled with detail and minutiae and also have overarching moral tales and big picture flow. At the end of almost every episode you'll probably find yourself muttering This is SUCH a good show!Although it is ostensibly the story of a prison and its many prisoners 'Oz' can be viewed as primarily the story of one man Tobias Beecher. Beecher has committed vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk. Because Beecher is a lawyer the court decides to make an example of him and sends him to maximum security at Oswald Penitentiary. His journey through Oz is basically the rest of the series and it's certainly no yellow brick road he follows. Everything that you could imagine happening in a prison setting happens and probably a lot you wouldn't imagine. He gets assigned to Em City Emerald City an experimental unit in Oz the goal of Em City is to try a different living environment one that might give the prisoners a chance at changing their lives and possibly rehabilitate them. Managed by a true prison reform zealot Tim McManus Em City is for many prisoners the only hope in their lives. The inmates of Em City are some of the most brutal offenders in the entire penitentiary  McManus insists that these are the prisoners to try to reach. McManus also picks newer prisoners ones that don't have life sentences to add to the mix and to give them a shot at rehabilitation. Every episode has a storyteller  most of the time the storyteller is Augustus Hill shot while killing a cop and now confined to a wheelchair. Because he is unable to be physically brutal anymore because he is more imprisoned than even his fellow prisoners Augustus is very insightful and is used to heighten and clarify themes for the audience.The other inmates in Em City all have their own character development and story arcs  some are impressively vibrant but brief others last for the whole series  but ultimately the writers always return to Beecher and his story. His friends few his enemies many his family and his relationships with the prison staff.Amid the worst that prison can dish out the inmates struggle with the meaning of religion with definitions of family with the corruption of politics with friendship betrayal and ultimately survival. There are moments of sheer wanton destruction unspeakable violence shocking cruelty and pure evil. It's prison! There is nothing glorified here inmates do drugs to escape the horror of their realities gangs murder each other over trivialities inmates and guards commit rape just because they can. But how they manage to survive  and IF they manage to survive  keeps you watching.Some key performances The always perfect J.K. Simmons as Schillinger the leader of the Aryans Chris Meloni as Chris Keller quite a different part than his character on LO SVU! Lee Tergesen as Beecher Eamonn Walker as Said the leader of the Muslims Dean and Scott Winters reallife brothers as Ryan and Cyril O'Reilly and Kirk Acevedo as Miguel Alvarez a member of the Latinos. But honestly the whole cast is excellent. Even most of the guest starring roles  new inmates who practically have an expiration date stamped on them  are good and at least are pretty interesting.It's coming out on DVD in dribs and drabs  rent it borrow it steal it whatever. But watch it!".

	schema:headline " Brutal difficult uncompromising unpleasant unsettling and utterly brilliant";
	schema:reviewBody "In an innovation on the prison city a wing called Emerald City is created with Oswald State Penitentiary.  With this wing prisoners are given more responsibility and better conditions.  Sleeping two to a pod with clean facilities etc.  However the prisoners are no different and violence and crime runs the prison.  No one is above corruption and murder can come from the smallest events.  Drugs rape and torture are weapons and no one is above betrayal and deceit as powerful partnerships are formed and broken.Insomnia can be a wonderful thing.  I started watching Oz many years ago on Channel 4's Later' slot in the UK.  I used to watch Homicide Life on the Street and they relegated it to a 1am slot.  Because I couldn't sleep I used to stay up and watch it.  Oz was on after this and I got into that.  At first I couldn't believe how brutal it was then I got totally sucked in.I'm on the fourth series now and am glad I started watching it.  The series has one major strength  the writing.  The plot is one of constant tension and drama as plan follows plan follows murder follows betrayal etc.  The storylines are always good and always brutal.  However one of the main drivers for me are the characters.  They change with time  they develop with events they get killed  regardless of status within the series they get killed!The best example of what I mean can be seen in just a few examples  but on the whole it's true of most of the characters.  Beecher came into the prison as a normal guy jailed for drunk driving and killing a child.  The abuse he got from Schillinger has completed changed him  in fact 4 series on he continues to change.  Schillinger himself is compelling despite being relatively one dimensional he is a powerful character.  My favourite' character is Simon Adebisi.  In series two he became very passive very submissive but it was revealed as an act and he has become his cruel manipulative self again.  I could list them all  obviously there's going to be characters who come and go background extras who have only a few lines to say or who move the plot along by getting killed etc. but most characters develop or play major roles.In terms of actors the cast is mainly bit part players with no major lead roles under their belts but to a man they all do good jobs when called upon.  It's hard to pick out any one actor who stands out as it depends on their characters but it's worth acknowledging a few.  Tergesen Beecher has shone simply in the way he has convincingly changed his character over the years.  Likewise Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje has done great work as the monstrous Simon Adebisi.  These standout because they have shown how they can deal with extreme changes in their roles however every other member of cast is totally convincing.  J.K. Simmons will only ever be Schillinger to me after this and a bit part black actor from the UK's The Bill' shines in the role of Said Walker.  I could fill this site with praise for the cast.The programme is clever and intelligent although many can't get past the brutality violence and swearing.  The portrayal of the prison as not so much an integrated melting pot of races but a mixed room of races that all manage themselves first  much more like the real America.  The use of the brilliant Harold Perrineau Jnr as a character and as a sort of street theatre narrator is certainly different and allows each show to make a social point or a commentary without being preachy is really good  and often funny too.It does of course have weaknesses.  Sometimes the brutality can be wearing and be too much.  Where they constantly bring in new characters each week just to kill them in the same show to move the plot along it gets a bit tired too  however this doesn't happen every week.  The plots themselves can only go so far  basically they all come down to violence and betrayal in some form.  My hope is that they will only make this for another series at most.  It's better if they end on a high rather than risking showing signs of fatigue or running out of new ideas.Overall it's brutal cruel disturbing violent and upsetting.  Why watch then?  Because it's very well written and made it totally compelling it has great actors and the storylines are rarely less than gripping.  It has an energy unlike anything else  like a car crash you don't always want to see what's happening but you can't help but look.  After all isn't this how prison is?  Superb television but not to everyone's taste.".

Oz is amazing because almost every charachter in it's sea of people is in some way a terrible human being. But the magic of this show is that these terrible people become understandable. They do terrible things but they are not all bad. Ryan O'Rielly for example is a coldblooded killer. But when it comes to his brother and doctor Nathan and more recently the priest he befriended he is a warm and caring person who's pain you empathize with. Oz takes murderers rapists thieves and even a rich lawyer who ran down a young girl in a drunken stuper and makes them likeable and forgivable. That's incredible.  And this show is incredible.

But after the Ryan O'ReilyDr. Nathan storyline have watched every episode and the last couple of months I've done nothing else that expected the next episode. I just got so hooked on the show. So what's so excellent in the show? Everything. There is wonderful acting GREAT srorylines characters that are just perfect and of course the cold reality of the show. One thing I really like is this realism There are no stupid heros that shouldn't be in prison. Everyone there's a criminal and deserves to be there. This doesn't mean they are some emotionaless robots they also have feelings. Just watch the way ruthless killer Ryan O'Reily takes care of his retarted brother. Or the BeecherKeller affair. This show can offer you a peek to the prison lifeor at least as close as you can show on tv.Because it's done for cable you can say the fword and show violenceit would be kind of stupid if the prisoners said oh darn or tried to solve their fights in a nice game of poker..So the strong language and shocking deaths are justified but may not be suitable for younger audience.

They dont want to feel for murders drug addicts for rapists. People don't want to put a face on those people because then they'll feel for them. And no one wants to feel compassion for a coldblooded murderer now do we?Oz is HBOs first drama series. But it goes unrecognized and overshadowed by the highly viewed THE SOPRANOS. Lee Tergesen's role as Tobias Beecher is perhaps one of the most hurt characters in Oz. He plays pain so well I cant explain it you just have to see for yourself. All the characters in Oz are hurt in one way or another but they all handle their own pain differently. Miguel Alvarez Kirk Acevedo is depressed over losing a child and goes a little insane. But you feel for these people and you relate to them. Then it hits you like a bombshell they killed someone they broke the law! Gasp! Oh no! How can I relate to a murderer an abuser? A K. nazi?I am shocked to learn the six years Oz has been on HBO it had only 2 Emmy nominations. For casting and a guest performance! And they didn't even win! I am quite horrified to learn that a critically acclaimed show has never won a fing Excuse my French Emmy! Perhaps I will never know the reason why. Maybe they dont want the younger generation to watch this show and feel the urge to be a criminal. Maybe the show gives them too many ideas about killing.

Speaking of some of the great shows that came from that period like The XFilesHomicideLife On The StreetNYPD BlueThe PracticeLaw and Orderand so forth. For the six seasons that it ran on Home Box OfficeHBOproducing a total of 147 episodes that begin with the opening episode of the seriesthe first episode on July 121997 to the emotional and astounding finale of the series on February 232003. This was a brilliant series in astounding detail that was superbly acted and exceptionally well written with some of the most grippest episodes ever conceived and it shows coming from the creative minds of Barry Levinson and Tom Fontanathe forces behind this show and there over successful venture HomicideLife On The Streethave fashioned something that was out of the ordinary and for one something we haven't seen the likes of in a long time. And to show it OZ was just that...a gripping and intensely violent drama that takes place within the walls the nation's penal system and the inmates and prison officals that control it. OZ was so successful in fact that it was nominated for two Emmystwicefor Best Dramatic Series on Cable Television not to mention winning the ALMACable ACEEdgar Allen Poe Awards for Best WritingThe Writers Guild Of America for some of the best writing ever presented on television. For one OZ was something special that got people's attention It was a rare series that made up sit up and basically take noticeand actually care for the characters in such an ensemble cast as thisno matter how heinous their crimesor how streetandbattle hardened their exteriors were.Another reason why OZ was so brilliant was that it took the level of television drama to another level which was something that you would never see on any of the major television networksand it was only on HBO that you saw it the way it was meant to be seenand let me tell you this OZ was graphically violent and bloodyviciousand cruel not to mention full of nudity and explicit graphic language. In other wordsOZ tells it like it is and believe me it is not pretty. It's realisticfrank and very controversial. It was also wildly creativebeautifully filmedbrilliantly acted with the grand and beautifully innovation of great storytelling. This was a show that was clever and highly intelligentalthough many can't get past some of the brutuality and constant swearing not to mention the blood and goreand since this was basically an adult showmade for adults. Some of the plots within the show are one of constant tension and drama as plan follows plan follows murder follows betrayal and so forth with some of the story lines exceptionally good and sometimes brutal in the aftermath. As for the characters themselvesespecially with some of the inmatesand some of the guards toothey change with timethey develop within the eventsthey get killed and regardless of the status within the series' run they get killed offone by one! New inmates are added and the same formula follows the same suit. Regardlessto get through a entire day in OZ is through survivalwhere only the strong survive.OZ is set within the confine walls of Oswald State Penitentiary and within the wings there is a section called Emerald City which is basically a city within a prison. With this wing prisoners are given more responsibility and better conditions. Sleeping two to a podwith clean facilitiesetc. Howeverthe prisoners are no different as crime and violence runs the prison. No one is above corruption and murder can come from the smallest events. Drugsrapeand torture are the weapons and no one is above betrayal and deceit as powerful partnerships are formed and broken. Even the guards are in on the act right under the warden's nose. The head warden of Oswald State Penitentiary is Leo GlennErnie Hudsonwho runs his prison like a ironhand and is strictly by the book. His counterpartthe manager of prison operationsTim McManus Terry Kinneyoversee the majority of prisoners since he is dealing with some of the most dangerous inmates ever. The rest of the staff consisted of Sister MarieRita MorenoFather MukadaD.B. Wongand Nurse ReyesLauren Velez.The cast consists of the some of the best acting around...check it out the performances too including the youngest inmate ever inprisoned in OZteenager Kenny WanglerJ.D.Williamsnot to mention the first woman to be executed on death row in OZShirley BellingerKathryn Erbein a far cry from her role on Law and OrderSVUand Inmate Chris KellerChristopher Meloni in a role that was far away from what he does on Law and OrderSVU. Key performances what made this series stand out are here especially from firstrate actors Lee TergensenTobias BeecherJ.K.

After season one where characters' values actually mean something to them it seems that the writers got as uncreative as Grey's Anatomy by just having each character question the values that defined his or her character. There's way too much expositional dialog. So much of the show is recapped through inmates retelling what just happened in unnatural ways. If the plot needs to progress they don't even bother waiting within a few tin minute blocks. Prisoner A needs to be killed? Prisoner B has a knife under his bed. Prisoner C steals knife Prisoner A gets killed. That's about as complicated as the plot ever gets after the first season and they don't at least give the audience the benefit of anticipating the action by letting the plot encompass a few episodes.Throughout much of the show I continually ask myself So what? What's the significance? It becomes plot by the numbers with no metaphor.I watched through half of the third season and just couldn't take it anymore. There are a few actors that still do a good job with the bad writing they are given but it's not enough to continue.".

	schema:reviewBody "No...I don't mean bunkbeds. I mean bunk.I watched every season of Oz from start to finish and I have to say it never wasn't entertaining. Anyone who thinks this show could be viewed by just anyone better think again. Here is just a taste of what you're in for if you decide to embark on the same journey that I just did defecation anal rape on camera... suicide gouging of eyes shanking urine being consumed feces being played with torture more anal rape this time with a spoon...and plenty of good old fashioned bloody violence. Needless to say it's a graphic show but unfortunately for Tom Fontana writer of most episodes in the series it fails to remain plausible. What starts out in season one as a wellacted superblyfilmed prison drama degenerates into a wishywashy ridiculous unsatisfying shockfest that makes you scratch your head and say 'how the hell could that happen?'Examples of ridiculous plot lines1. Cyril O'Reilly a mentally handicapped man is thrown into a maximum security prison then sentenced to death for defending his brother and taking another man's life. Our right wing of course! Governor is coldhearted and cruel and cares not for any prisoner much less a retarded one...The political statements in this show are blatant and as per usual with left wing TV ludicrous. 2. Chinese refugees are thrown in maximum security prison. Please! Like this would EVER happen. Political refugees would be placed into a middle school before being thrown in with a bunch of murderers and rapists. Of course one of these refugees who we grow to love is brutally slain in graphic detail for us to enjoy. Barf. Pure shock value. 3. Prisoners on work detail roam the halls kitchen and gym unsupervised. A prisoners' father and brother are even shanked separately while they are visiting! In one scene a Moslem gets sliced open with a box cutter by two Aryan thugs in a storage room. No one hears his screams. In another scene a man gets his arms and legs broken on a wrestling mat while a guard watches and laughs. No one is held accountable.4. In Oz every correctional officer is not only corrupt but they are even gang members murderers and sadists. If I had to bet real correctional officers are deeply offended by this show. The CO's in Oz set up murders are bought by prisoners for a pittance and show no mercy. A female CO even 'rapes' several male prisoners! And of course no one sees any of this or investigates the crimes. It's portrayed as 'just part of prison life!' Give me a large break. 5. In Oz murders take place on a daily basis. Oz has more murders in a given year than the entire city of Detroit. No one thinks to put in camera surveillance? The murders are brushed off unless they are committed by one of our main stars who we like. Then they are sent to death row. 6. Our main character Tobias Beecher slices and dices a guard with fingernail clippers no less... and nothing ever comes of it. The guard is simply gone. It's never mentioned again in that episode or later episodes. 7. Prisoners are purposely left alone with those who they seek to kill. In one scene a vicious Aryan psycho is left alone with a dentist in a small office. The guard simply shuts the door. I guess the Aryan paid him 20... In another scene as I mentioned above a visiting lawyer who happens to be a prisoner's father is shut into a hallway so a pragg can shank him and gut him like a fish. When the visitor calls for the guard the guard slams the door in his face. Guess he got paid off too. They tried to intertwine too many stories and introduce too many characters in Oz most of whom were uninteresting and did nothing for the main story lines. It probably could have been done in half as many seasons. The audience has to be 'reminded' of plot lines from prior episodes by these little black and white flashbacks. It gets very tiring trying to keep up with it all.I could probably go on and on but it's not worth it. I did watch every single episode of this show and I did enjoy a lot of it. What I did like tallies up to be more than what I didn't so for that I'll say thanks to Tom Fontana Levinson and crew. Lots of good acting and great lines. Lots of memorable scenes and I especially enjoyed the character Kareem Said who was by far the coolest man in the show. If you can stomach wretched shocking scenes a lot of racial slurs along with derogatory terms and plenty of implausibility I'd recommend buying this series. Buy every season because it is highly addictive. But get it used if you can. And get ready to pass it on because it's not the kind of show that many people will enjoy watching repeatedly.6 out of 10 kids.".

	schema:headline " By the Numbers";
	schema:reviewBody "Barbet Schroeder's Murder by Numbers starring Sandra Bullock is solid work though not particularly compelling. I am a big Sandra Bullock fan and she is effective here as forensic detective Cassie Mayweather who is not very likable and a broken person too. However there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers Richard Ryan Gusling who is the cool one and Justin  Michael Pitt who is the sympathetic geek. Basically Richard and Justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing but it just doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder and it is truly by the numbers. We have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority and we just want them to take a fall. This is not a great exploration into the dark side like Schroeder's Reversal of Fortune about Claus von Bulow. There are interesting turns in Numbers. The movie is not so much a thriller but rather a character study of Cassie. Sandra Bullock balances the bravado of Cassie her fear of letting people get in with her and her secret past. Bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character. Her partner and sort of love interest Sam played by Ben Chaplin is more a plot unconcealing than a real character. Though Chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably. The other nice touch is having Richard and Justin involved a strange sexual attraction. The most interesting thing about Numbers are Pitt and Gusling. There are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie. Everything is done very competently. I saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect I like it a little more than I did when I saw it. However it is just not inspired work. Sandra Bullock and Barbet Schroeder deserve a lot better and so do we.".

The film's underlying premise is certainly relevant to contemporary American culture but the story is poorly plotted. The POV keeps shifting back and forth between the two boys and Cassie.I was not interested in Cassie's tortured past nor did I care about her relationship with her assistant Sam.

Michael Pitt as Justin gives an adequate performance and Ryan Gosling as Richard is more than convincing. I would have reduced the time spent on Cassie and Sam and added some back story about Justin and Richard to give viewers more insight into the boys' motivation.The film's visuals are adequate. There's some good camera work in the film's first and last twenty minutes. In keeping with the film's many cinematic clichs the climax is a melodramatic cliffhanger ... so to speak. Still the suspense was gripping. It kept me guessing as to who was going to do what to whom.Despite a convoluted and at times confusing plot Murder By Numbers is worth watching for its provocative premise its suspense and the acting of Ryan Gosling.".

The whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl' as well as Chris Penn who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better allaround film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is exactly what Hollywood does badly. Very Badly. Typically awful whodunnit featuring more bluffs and double bluffs than you could shake a stick at. This movie is up there with horrendous plotless rambles like Copycat Along Came A Spider and even Kiss the Girls. Horrendous in that it is possible to work out just about every plot detail in the first 25 minutes. The constant twists and surprises are tedious to say the least.Don't get me wrong I like Sandra Bullock but when is she going to get a role that truly makes her shine. She seems to manage to choose the wrong movies time after time. I think she should maybe look to more comedy roles as I feel some of her best parts have been in films like Demolision Man and even last years Miss Congeniality wasn't too bad ok it was was that bad but not as bad as Murder By Numbers. Michael Pitt on the other hand is awesome. I saw him in Bully not so long ago in which he was fantastic and also last years Hedwig and the Angry Inch. He does evil particularly well. I think he could be destined for very great things.   And what the hell is Chris Penn doing in this tripe?! Nice guy Eddie is far better than this!   It was worth going to see this movie just for the guys walking around in the Slipknot costumes whenever they were going to murder someone.On the whole this film was very poor it scores only a  out of  on the Meejoirmeter.

	onyx:emotionText "This is exactly what Hollywood does badly. Very Badly. Typically awful whodunnit featuring more bluffs and double bluffs than you could shake a stick at. This movie is up there with horrendous plotless rambles like Copycat Along Came A Spider and even Kiss the Girls. Horrendous in that it is possible to work out just about every plot detail in the first 25 minutes. The constant twists and surprises are tedious to say the least.Don't get me wrong I like Sandra Bullock but when is she going to get a role that truly makes her shine. She seems to manage to choose the wrong movies time after time. I think she should maybe look to more comedy roles as I feel some of her best parts have been in films like Demolision Man and even last years Miss Congeniality wasn't too bad ok it was was that bad but not as bad as Murder By Numbers. Michael Pitt on the other hand is awesome. I saw him in Bully not so long ago in which he was fantastic and also last years Hedwig and the Angry Inch. He does evil particularly well. I think he could be destined for very great things.   And what the hell is Chris Penn doing in this tripe?! Nice guy Eddie is far better than this!   It was worth going to see this movie just for the guys walking around in the Slipknot costumes whenever they were going to murder someone.On the whole this film was very poor it scores only a  out of  on the Meejoirmeter.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so I've read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site and the feeling I get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie.  That's why I'm writing nowI represent the minority because I did.  I admit I went to see the movie because I am very impressed with Ryan Gosling's compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible.  He is an amazing actor. That aside I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me... why?  Because it's a whodunit where you know whodunit' from the start and that's kind of unusual.As the plot goes two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly freethe uninhibited and let's remember guiltless acting out of one's will.  The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt.  Gosling was the manipulating controlling smoothtalker and Pitt was the extremely booksmart socially awkward outcast.  Enter Sandra Bullock's character who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate.  I think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a selfglorification thing.  I didn't see that as the case here.  Without Cassie's personal history about the exhusband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with Richard Hayward she never would have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard.  The case was seemingly airtight against Ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys.  Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither Bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other and the vomit Justin left at the sight.  Therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the guiltless acting out of will as true freedom' ended up working against Justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site.  Without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers.  And to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as I have I looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and exacting.  There's also a song by Sting called Murder By Numbers but that's beside the point. Many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between Cassie and her partner but I think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history.  Like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes it was a bit of the cliche women scorned woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life' plot but I think without the depth of Cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it.  There's no movie there.And to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can I remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed and totally traceable shoe prints.  The boys wanted to be involvedit was a game.  They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth.  What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side. A little unbelievable?  Maybe.  But many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts.  However this is a MOVIE!I saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and I liked it a little more.  The more I watched it the more I was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth Richard Haywardthere are people really like this.  My main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had Justin and Richard's interactions a little more central because let's face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterizationeach character was very distinct and interesting in hisher own way.  It was very well acted although I would have given Ben Chaplin's character a little more depth to work with he's a good actor and maybe pared down Bullock's character a smidgen.I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end.  I think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt.  I think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed.  Especially Richard Hayward.  Not that I'm biassed. ".

	schema:reviewBody "I can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent TV series. Otherwise there are just too many of these murder plot themes. I don't like the theme of the two overclever selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise I've no interest whatsoever in Hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way I don't intend to find out about. But don't misunderstand me the theme is in itself excellent the whole movie is so well done and of course Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. Sandra's character is as in Miss Congeniality not rated by the male team she works with in spite of her obvious skills and the boss mostly ignores her ideas eventually forcing her aside and giving the case to her male partner. Of course Sandra works out what's going on and nearly gets killed in a very dramatic denouement. It's intriguing how the boy who worked out the murder plot can't allow her to be killed by his colleague  he has a conscience of some sort and perhaps could be saved while the other is a true psychopath.Sandra's hard shell is caused by misery in her past that's tied in poignantly with the murder case. Her colleague realising that Sandra's solving this case in spite of being balked by the dense superior finally discovers what happened to Sandra herself in her teens that she must now face up to and exorcise and the last scene shows her starting  we hope anyway  to do just that. I can see from the few other reviews I've had time to read that this movie would attract a broadish group  those interested in the two spoilt boys whiling away their time with their grisly philosophical determination to trick the police and get away with the perfect murder the relationship between them that's so cleverly depicted the ghastly links to the heroine's past a police theme and some smokes and mirrors  as well as for Hitchcock fans.For those who've queried why Bullock's character has to have a problematic past really I think this would be a far less interesting movie if she had been just a detective trying to fathom what was going on with a willing sidekick helping out and a malechauvinist boss. The link between the murder victim and the detective is necessary to show the detective becoming too involved or otherwise how would she lose her arrogant boss's confidence and thereby nearly lose her life? That's hardly an original theme in fact it's usually an extremely irritating theme as this male chauvinist boss brutally tells his frustrated but obviously inspired operative to get off the case and leave it to someone who clearly doesn't have quite the skills to solve it nice though the sidekick is. I was getting very worried towards the end re what might happen to Sandra's character as her emotional involvement in the case and special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously drove her on with this case by herself.I wasn't disappointed re the relationship between Bullock's character and her sidekick. That goes along interestingly and at times very poignantly.The relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing if that's what you were interested in watching. I felt it was kept low key in some ways either because the moviemakers didn't want to get into boyboy friendships too much or because we weren't supposed to think emotion ruled their relationship. The movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages.There one thing I wish had been clarified and that's what happens after the movie ends when Sandra's character arrives at the Court.... you need to see to movie to know why she's there.Very well acted by all. I certainly can't agree with those who complained against Bullock's acting  she was superb. The part suited her very well indeed. The story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine.".

The movie cleverly makes you wonder which boy's in charge of the situation and there are some twists and turns and the boys show their underlying immaturity at various stages.There one thing I wish had been clarified and that's what happens after the movie ends when Sandra's character arrives at the Court.... you need to see to movie to know why she's there.Very well acted by all. I certainly can't agree with those who complained against Bullock's acting  she was superb. The part suited her very well indeed. The story is gripping even if murder mysteries aren't your thing and they aren't that often mine.";

I say filmgoers aren't critical enough.  I still love movies even some Hollywood output but I really hate it when I can watch a movie and without even thinking much about it recite the high concept pitch that the writers or producers or whoever made to the studio exec.  This is the tenth movie I've seen in 2002 that's been that easy and the message it sends is that no one in Hollywood is even bother to THINK anymore much less be creative.  And Barbet Schroeder God bless him was at one time a genuinely creative director turning Reversal of Fortune from a bland rehash of a story to which everyone knew the ending that had flooded the media a few years prior into a compelling character study by making it just that.  Murder by Numbers on the other hand is a bythenumbers character study with even its subtext having been coopted from countless films noirs and 60s and 70s psychological dramamysteries like Peeping Tom and Klute.Even Sandy as a cop was much more convincing as her typecast lovable klutz makes good character in Miss Congeniality.  She still shows promise as a dramatic actress but she hasn't realized it yet.  The teens are appropriately intense but despite all the claims the film makes they're really not that bright and experienced homicide cops would definitely be smarter than they are here.  In this way the film even manages to coopt from 80s and 90s teen farces.Basically there's nothing new here.  And if the celluloid flophouses want four times as much as they did 20 years ago for me to sit my ass in their chairs they better be prepared to offer more than a rehash of the same stuff I watched back then.".

It was only a matter of time  an hour and a half more in this case  to nab the two after a nail biting and cliffhanger kind of an end. Predictable stuff. Even though the performances are good it is unable to hold the story together at all because there isn't one. This is a thriller a murder mystery but I never felt being pushed to the edge of my seat anytime while watching it. On one hand Ryan and Michael go on with their murderous antics while the other track moves back and forth justifying Sandra's tough cookie image and her apparent vulnerable side. I didn't need this if all I wanted was to know about the 2 highly dysfunctional kids. If the movie would have delved into the psyche of these two guys the nature of their relationship with each other with others and why exactly such intellectually gifted kids can even think of committing murders out of sheer boredom and just for attracting attention it would actually have freaked me out. And I would have been glad because this is how I expect such movies to make me feel. Expectedly even though the movie can boast of good lead actors they are not able to hold the movie together because it is the plot that should be doing this and there isn't any here.

	schema:reviewBody "I almost didn't watch Murder By Numbers for two reasons. First I'm not the biggest Sandra Bullock fan but second and more importantly the trailer does not do the movie justice at all. In fact I would advise against watching the trailer because it will almost destroy all interest in watching the movie like it did to me. The problem is that the trailer gives the impression that Murder By Numbers is a murder mystery with no mystery because it is obvious from the start that there is no question as to who the murderers are. It leaves you with the feeling that if you watch the preview you've seen the movie. Kind of like what happened with Pleasantville.It is not long before it becomes clear that this is not a murder mystery it's a murder thriller. True there is never any question about who the killers are but the point of the movie is the chess game that they play with the investigators on their trail. It is difficult to accept Sandra Bullock as a CSI but at least in the second half of the film she pulls it off. In the first half she was going through the motions for some reason not really seeming to believe what she was saying or who she was supposed to be in the film. Of course this is all just my reaction I could be completely wrong.On the negative side the movie comes dangerously close to glorifying the Columbine shootings although it features one rich popular kid and one recluse as the killers while Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were both outcasts lashing out against the popular crowd. Richard the popular kid displays some odd behavior in his friendship with Justin the recluse. He seems to think that they're dating and acts like an overprotective jealous boyfriend generating much of his rage from times when Justin doesn't pay enough attention to him or even worse kisses a girl. Justin is the brains behind the operation having studied in great detail the investigative practices that would follow their master plan Richard is the motivation. He really wants to do this and the only reason that he ever gives in the movie is that he was bored. A true sociopath.On the other hand maybe it was Richard who felt like the outcast given his lack of success with the girls. Granted he didn't seem to have any trouble getting in bed with the girl Justin was interested in in order to turn him against her but consider the reaction that he always seemed to get from Lisa which was limited to obscene hand gestures. He was of course of the variety of high school kids who thought that the good way to get a girl's attention was to drive up next to her blasting Iron Maiden at full volume and flashing the devil's horns. Charming. Maybe if he had tried some more romantic Iron Maiden than The Number of the Beast like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Infinite Dreams. Chicks love Infinite Dreams.The movie has a lot to say about the bureaucracy of criminal investigations as Cassie Mayweather Bullock struggles to follow the strong leads that she has come across while her boss attempts to force her to stop investigating the crime already intent on closing the case with the tentative conclusion already reached. I'm not sure if this is meant to portray him as simply wanting the case over and done with or to show that he really doesn't care whether the real killers isare ever caught as long as someone goes down for the crime. Either way it's not a very glowing portrayal of authority figures.Then again Cassie being the only flaw in their plan is meant to come across as this sort of reckless independent investigator in one of the very few weak things about this movie. That's what every movie like this does. There is always someone who is forced to give up on a case because they're too close to it the victim was a relative lover etc. because they are a liability they know the killer the killer knows them etc. or because they are too dangerous they destroyed half a city block and lost a lot of evidence. In this case Cassie's forced to leave the case because she has found clues that might lead her to the real killers. Nice. Pretty weak way to generate suspense but overall with some good twists this is still a pretty entertaining thriller.".

Chicks love Infinite Dreams.The movie has a lot to say about the bureaucracy of criminal investigations as Cassie Mayweather Bullock struggles to follow the strong leads that she has come across while her boss attempts to force her to stop investigating the crime already intent on closing the case with the tentative conclusion already reached. I'm not sure if this is meant to portray him as simply wanting the case over and done with or to show that he really doesn't care whether the real killers isare ever caught as long as someone goes down for the crime. Either way it's not a very glowing portrayal of authority figures.Then again Cassie being the only flaw in their plan is meant to come across as this sort of reckless independent investigator in one of the very few weak things about this movie. That's what every movie like this does. There is always someone who is forced to give up on a case because they're too close to it the victim was a relative lover etc. because they are a liability they know the killer the killer knows them etc. or because they are too dangerous they destroyed half a city block and lost a lot of evidence. In this case Cassie's forced to leave the case because she has found clues that might lead her to the real killers. Nice. Pretty weak way to generate suspense but overall with some good twists this is still a pretty entertaining thriller.";

	schema:reviewBody "A random murder a secret friendship and a detective with an attitude problem are just three of the interesting ingredients of this absorbing psychological thriller. Murder By Numbers entertains and intrigues its audience not by posing the question who did it? but instead by following the progress of a detective's search for the evidence she needs to support her theory about who was responsible for committing a brutal murder. The fact that her task is made more difficult by her personal demons her clever adversaries and obstacles created by her superiors only makes things more difficult and adds to the story's already tense atmosphere.Richard Haywood Ryan Gosling and Justin Pendleton Michael Pitt are a couple of high school seniors who despite their very different personalities are secretly close friends. They meet regularly at a deserted house overlooking the ocean drink absinthe and are excited by the idea of carrying out the perfect murder as a means of proving their superiority over the police. They're both from rich families very bright but also bored and the closeness of their bond is symbolised by the presence of a photograph which is actually a composite of photos of both of them.By having no apparent relationship with each other selecting a random victim and planting misleading evidence at the site where the body's found Richard and Justin succeed in concealing their own connection with the murder of a young woman and also ensure that the school janitor Ray Feathers Chris Penn appears to be the culprit. Richard subsequently shoots the janitor in a manner that makes it appear that Feathers had in fact committed suicide.Experienced homicide detective Cassie Mayweather Sandra Bullock is assigned to the case together with her new partner Sam Kennedy Ben Chaplin. When her investigation brings her into contact with Richard her instincts immediately tell her that there's something suspicious about him but she's prevented from pursuing her interest in his connection with the crime by the intervention of Captain Rod Cody R.D. Call who takes her off the case.Cassie's a troubled character who still bears the physical and psychological scars of a traumatic incident in her past and tries to find solace in casual sex drinking alone and listening to Sheryl Crow songs on her houseboat. She has an unpleasant personality a reputation for being difficult to work with and a history of not following the rules and so her determination to follow her instincts and ignore the instructions of her superiors is regarded as reprehensible by everyone involved including her partner. Soon after however Cassie sees Richard and Justin together and becomes even more convinced that she's on the right track.The two detectives in Murder By Numbers are so different from each other that they make an uncomfortable partnership. From the dramatic standpoint however their juxtaposition is very effective in highlighting how mismatched they are. Sam Kennedy is a decent guy who's welltrained and methodical but also too inexperienced to have developed the instincts that Cassie possesses or to have acquired the kind of insight that enables an investigator to see beyond what the evidence superficially seems to show. Ben Chaplin and Sandra Bullock both make their characters believable and their interactions are important to the development of the story. Inevitably though it's the performances of Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt that stand out most as they make their characters both fascinating and disturbing and show convincingly how Richard and Julian's personalities complement each other.Justin is the movie's most interesting character because his brilliance enabled him to acquire the expert knowledge of forensics and police profiling which was vital for attempting to carry out the perfect murder and also his preoccupation with Nietzsche's doctrine of the superman was a key component of the motivation for the crime.Murder By Numbers is strong on atmosphere rich in complex characters and entertaining in the way in which the investigation of the murder develops.".

I remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people and a couple of cops I think who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving but being rocked side to side to look like it was... true cinemagic. I also remember it being the worst film I had ever seen up to that point and I promptly threw it in the garbage.Something tonight made me think of that movie I can't believe I actually remembered the name so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise... IT WAS! And a full other 5 people have seen it.... Amazing. Even though I remember hating the film at the time I sort of wish I had kept it hidden away somewhere because I'd love to check it out again for a laugh it would probably make a good drinking game movie. Anyway I'm glad I'm part of the elite few that's seen this little treasure. I would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks.... but beware this is not a recommendation... it is awful... it's just for nostalgia.".

It's not really a story much more random scenes loosely involving a brainsucker who drills people's brains out with a big cartoonish drill thing.People just do random things in this movie characters aren't really introduced nor developed. They just do random things and mention this bloodsucker who is hardly shown in the movie. The sheriff I think makes the townsfolks deputies and they run wild. There's cuts to some radio talk show host who can't seem to stop breathing into the mic. There's some attempts at humor but they're painfully unfunny. Some women says it's her son but she dies off pretty quickly and pretty randomly. We get these terrible police one with an absolutely terrible accent chasing after a dance instructor and her boyfriend when they reach an airport. One police officer finds out the brainsucker is his son but this isn't really a twist and I don't really give a . They take off in a plane and the brainsucker uses the drill to remove some white goop out of his head and releases it out of the plane.As I said it's hard to review this because it's not a coherent movie in any sense. There's a lot that's in it for no real reason and the story doesn't make sense anyways. The characters aren't fleshed out or given any life and there's little connection between them and what's happening. The effects are crude and barely amateurlevel. The brains look like strips of bacon or pork cutlets. I can't recommend this to anyone not even lovers of bad movies. Abysmal.".

The strongest feature of her otherwise bland personality is her strong sense of personal entitlement. She expects everything and wants to pay nothing. How can you not just love a person like that?

A Coy Decoy was one of these shorts and I was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned. When I was young I probably did not even understand the Black Beauty gag to begin with. Still this is probably why it was banned though until I watched this on a video site I did not even remember the gag. Upon viewing the video I did remember certain shots  in particular the shrinking of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes becoming clockworkish as the decoy circled him in The Lake. I was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned. Instead I was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short. Because of how much I liked this short as a child I rate it 7 out of 10.".

I can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet.Aside from this point A Coy Decoy is basically a fun interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here. The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time. Porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well bloodthirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry.

Every cartoon had to have a song in these days so we start off with a medley by The Westerner' Porky and Ugly Duckling' Daffy. Porky is really only there at the beginning because they needed somebody to set up the punchline at the end. The rest of the movie belongs to Daffy. The Duck cracks a rather racist gag involving 'Black Beauty' at the beginning but since he's black himself he can probably get away with it.Daffy moves to another book The Lake' while the Wolf of Wall Street' uses a toy duck the title character from yet another book to snare that screwy duck. When Escape' is blocked  Daffy makes use of Hurricane' The Mortal storm' and Lightning' to get rid of the wolf For whom the bell tolls'. We also find out that The Bridge of San Luis Rey' is about a pair of dentures. The main characters don't really have to act just be themselves Daffy has to be crazy the Wolf has to be hungry and Porky well he never had much reason to be anywhere anyway. In the end 'A Coy Decoy' does not amount to much more than a song a chase sequence lots of puns and of course a reference to the war.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Love animation it was a big part of my life as a child particularly Disney Looney Tunes Hanna and Barbera and Tom and Jerry and still love it whether it's film television or cartoons. Actually appreciate it even more now through young adult eyes thanks to broader knowledge and taste and more interest in animation styles and various studios and directors.Have a lot of appreciation and admiration for Bob Clampett with a visual and humour style so distinctive and easily recognisable. His early work was very variable but when on top form and in his prime the best of his work was great and even more. 'A Coy Decoy' is not one of Clampett's best. It is a decent cartoon though even if there are funnier wittier and fresher cartoons from him and did see some of Clampett's unique style all over it and being at ease with the material. Will agree with anyone who found the 'Black Beauty' gag in not particularly good taste the stereotypical nature is far from subtle and it was not very funny on top of that. For me despite liking Porky on the whole and usually his partnership with Porky is legendary he is a bit bland here and didn't really see the need for his inclusion considering the cartoon doesn't do much with him.However Daffy as ever is a sheer delight it is hardly surprising why he is one of animation's best most interesting and most popular characters. He is just so much fun to watch and his manic personality is so well suited to the material. Supporting characters are far from forgettable and provide a lot of fun. The wolf matches Daffy beautifully and the literary characters are fun to spot. Mel Blanc as always does a fantastic job with the voice work showing an unparalleled ability to bring individuality to multiple characters. The animation is as always atmospheric in crisp black and white with lots of smooth movement imaginative detail in the gags and rich and meticulous detail in the backgrounds. Carl Stalling's music score is as ever high in energy liveliness character lushness and whimsy and not only is dynamic and fits effortlessly with the action but enhances everything. Beethoven's Moonlight sonata is used inspiringly.What's more 'A Coy Decoy' is enormously entertaining elsewhere with some amusing wildness wit and bite starting to show at this point in the dialogue. Plus there are some beautifully timed and animated and imaginative sight gags that contain some surprises and a lively pace. Sure familiarity with what is being referenced is in order which wasn't an issue for me being one who was familiar.Overall decent if not great. 710 Bethany Cox".

In cases where a title could apply to both a book and a film such as 'The Bridge of San Luis Rey' here or Dante's Inferno in 'Book Revue' it's obvious that the audience were expected to think of the movie rather than the book. Either the Warners scriptwriters didn't know many book titles or else they wouldn't give their audience credit for being literate. In 'A Coy Decoy' I was pleasantly surprised to see references to 'The Yearling' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' bestselling books which as of 1941 hadn't yet been filmed.'A Coy Decoy' gets its title from a plot development here which wasn't used in the remake the wolf uses a clockwork female duck to entice Daffy. This is a running theme in many Clampett cartoons continuing right into his 'Beany and Cecil' era a male protagonist is lured by an artificial female either a male in disguise or else a mechanical surrogate a fembot?. Clampett seemed reluctant to put genuine female characters into his toons.There's a nice tinkling musicbox motif for the sheduck Warners cartoons almost always had excellent music tracks and there's a cheeky final gag one of Clampett's less obvious sexual entendres. That final gag is the only place where this cartoon surpasses its remake 'Book Revue' which is superior all down the line until it ends in a weak 'cissy' joke another of Clampett's predilections. I'll rate 'A Coy Decoy' five points out of 10. Take out that unnecessary racist joke and I might bump it up to six.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mon Oncle Antoine 1971Despite having a heavy film industry presence usually American productions looking for cheap locations Canada's own gems have often gone by the wayside. We're too close to America to really for it to care enough about a film not about its own country and too far from overseas to have the exotic flare found in European or Asian cinema. Perhaps that is why the film considered Canada's best goes so widely underseen and overlooked. Claude Jutra's classic Mon Oncle Antoine truly is one of the best Canadian films ever made. It's also one of my favourite films period. It is now out in a lovely 2 disc package from the folks at Criterion. Set in an early 1940s Quebec asbestos mining town it's a coming of age story over the course of a few days at Christmas time. Adolescent Benoit lives with his uncle Antoine his aunt and a teenage girl Carmen who the family houses and employs at their store. Antoine not only owns the local general store but is the local undertaker as well among other things. The film floats around with no real plotwise direction. Events happen in a relaxed and patient fashion not to highlight story but to highlight the emotional development of Benoit as he transforms from a free spirited adolescent into adulthood. He experiences the sexual passions the harsh indifferences and the cynicism of leaving childhood behind. Jutra balances light hearted humour and charm with dark pathos and sadness with a deft hand. There are playful moments between Antoine and Carmen and comedy with the sneaky Fernand played by Jutra himself who runs the store for Antoine when he's not chasing the uncle's wife. There is also a moment of great triumph when Benoit and another boy throw snowballs at the mine owner as he makes his way through town giving out small gift bags for Christmas rather than raises or bonuses to the men as the soundtrack blares a score fit for a spaghetti western. On the darker side there is a separate story where a family's father leaves the mines and heads to the logging camps. While he is away his eldest son takes ill and dies on Christmas Eve. Antoine is phoned to come pick up the boy's body and Benoit insists he go along. The long sleigh ride through a snow storm offers him opportunities for mischief but in the end leaves him with sad realizations about the nature of adulthood and those around him. Mon Oncle Antoine is certainly about the loss of innocence but it is also more than just a story about a boy in rural Quebec. It is a parable about the coming of age of the province itself. Most of the mines were owned by either Americans or English speaking Canadians as referenced by the film when the mine foreman speaks in English to his French workers who do not understand. The time period is the Maurice Duplessis era  he was the premier of Quebec with his Union Nationale. His party was deeply conservative probusiness rabidly antisocialist in any form and formed deep rooted connections with the traditional Catholic clergy. He was also deeply corrupt and reportedly a master of ballot stuffing. It's also just prior to the Asbestos Mine strikes and the Quiet Revolution. The miners voted to strike which was deemed illegal by Duplessis who continued to pledge unwavering support for the mine owners. He also authorized the use of strike breakers which lead to incidents of violence. However the miners had the widespread support of the public and the French media and even most priests and the province's archbishop. This marked a major turning point in Quebec culture as well as the shift to the social left in a large part of Canadian Catholicism. Separatist ideology increased dramatically.History lessons aside the physical construction of the film meant to evoke life in the harsh mining towns in the Asbestos region must be recognized. The small town shadowed by the mine hills literally exudes its cold surroundings yet still manages to fill its homes with undeniable warmth thanks to its characters. Jutra also uses practical naturalistic lighting rather than normal crisp studio lighting. The sounds and senses of Canadian winters are placed front and centre by Jutra. This is how these towns are supposed to look and feel during winter. The feel of the film is not limited to Quebec culture. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia not only have massive French populations and culture but the same woods the same houses the same towns. I know the feel of small harsh industrial towns  I grew up in one in Nova Scotia. They are not at all unlike the one in Mon Oncle Antoine. Most of them still look just like they did 50 years ago if not worse. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why I love this film so much. It's the sensation of familiarity found in Eastern Canadian life and culture which has its own very large FrenchAcadien population and culture.But alas I am rambling and fear that I could go on and on. Mon Oncle Antoine is one of the great hidden gems of the cinema. Its performances are earnest the photography is evocative and beautiful in that cold bleak sort of way its direction is assured and inspired. It is a masterful portrait of childhood's twilight and a sad but hopeful realization of the loss of innocence  a parable for the whole of Quebec.".

There are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building. MUA has a leisurely pace but have patience the reward is coming. I believe the film was subtitled and as with all nonEnglish speaking movies I've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version. Inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors with the additional necessity of lipsynching lines that don't quite fit.

Set in the snowcovered landscape of Quebec in the 1940s the film is notable for the tenderness and humor it brings to its story of the loss of innocence of a teenage boy and the awakening of Quebec to its dream of independence.Benoit Jacques Gagnon is a 15year old boy who has lost both of his parents and is being raised by his Uncle Antoine Jean Duceppe and his wife Aunt Cecile Olivette Thibault. Antoine is the owner of a small general store in an asbestosmining town who also serves as the village undertaker and the film poignantly depicts the townsfolk in the rural village on the eve of their annual Christmas celebration. We learn from the outset that the mine owners are Englishspeaking and the French minorities are treated as secondclass citizens the clouds of contaminated smoke emanating from the mine signaling the unfairness of the system.The film moves from comedy to drama and back again. Benoit discovers the village priest as he surreptitiously takes a nip of liquor sneaks a look at a haughty neighbor Alexandrine Monique Mercure as she tries on a corset and innocently discovers his attraction to a teenage girl Carmen Lyne Champagne who also works in the store. The turning point of the film however is the stunning sequence in which the young boy travels on horse and carriage with his Uncle into the winter countryside where they are to retrieve the body of a teenage boy who has succumbed to his illness.This scene underscores Benoit's initial encounter with death his awareness of his uncle's alcoholism and the betrayal he feels when he discovers his Aunt's infidelity upon their return. Mon Oncle Antoine is a memorable and timeless classic and the freezeframe when we recognize Benoit's transition from childhood innocence to a grudging maturity is as powerful as any including Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows.".

Set presumably in 1940s rural Quebec the story explores the developing consciousness of young Benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death.  The look of the film is astonishing especially seeing as a high proportion of criticism towards Canadian cinema by the general public surrounds aesthetics.  Beyond this the unassuming Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience looking at his corrupting community with fresh an innocent eyes.  I recommend reading Jim Leach's critical essay on the film in Canada's Best Features for anyone looking to place the film into a historical context while also dissecting the form of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "As a midteenager whose voice had probably broken a few months before Benoit peeps at an adult world he is only beginning to understand. It is not a pretty sight. We first see him looking at the body of a middle aged man in an open coffin. His uncle Antoine is the small town undertaker. A little while later during a session as an alter boy adolescent curiosity tempts him to take a swig of the communion wine. A few moments later he sees the priest also taking a surreptitious slurp Nothing to the disillusions he is about to experience but a foretaste. There are those artists who leave us but one work and a few fragments to remember them by. Such was the French Canadian film director Claude Jutra. He contracted Altzheimer's in his early fifties and drowned in the St.Lawrence River presumably suicide. His one full length feature Mon Oncle Antoine is nothing short of a masterpiece not just a little gem but a major work that is among the most perfect rite of passage films ever made. In addition it paints a superb picture of a small town community Black Lake Quebec dominated by the slag hill of an asbestos mine the time a winter in the '40's. Much of the film centres on the town's main store run by Antoine his wife Cecile and their assistant Fernand played by Jutra himself. Antoine and Cecile are childless but have adopted the orphaned Benoit and offer shelter to Carmen an unwanted girl who helps with the running of the shop. The store is the town's meeting place and much is made of the annual ritual of decorating the window with a nativity scene and opening the curtains that have been hiding it on the morning of Christmas Eve to the group of eagerly anticipating onlookers who have gathered outside. This is a highlight for a town in which nothing much happens in the way of entertainment. It contrasts with a later scene where the mine owner drives his horsedrawn vehicle down the main street throwing packages of tawdry trinkets for the town's children which no one seems to want such is the contempt in which he is held. It is a film in which small incidents such as these skilfully paint a comprehensive picture of what it felt to live in just such a small town one December a generation back. In addition to those associated with the store we are introduced to a family living in a farmhouse in the frozen wastes a few mile away. The father thoroughly disillusioned with his work at the asbestos mine leaves his wife and children to look after the farm while he tries to get better employment lumbering in another part of the country. While he is away their eldest son falls unexpectedly ill and dies prompting the distraught wife to telephone for the services of undertaker Antoine late Christmas Eve. The journey into the night with a body box that Antoine already the worse for drink has to make assisted by Benoit forms the great climax that is to be the awakening of the youth to the absolute inadequacy of his uncle to the task. His single accusation Drunkard when the mission goes completely awry says it all. The boy has left his playful youth around the store behind and has fully experienced the bitter reality of the adults around him. On his return he even catches something of his aunt's infidelity with the assistant. In a film rich in memorable images none is more unforgettable than the final shot of Benoit looking through the farmhouse window at the grief stricken family with the open box and corpse the father having just returned has retrieved from the snow. The boy has become a man overnight. His life will never be quite the same again.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is as much about a time and a place as it is about its characters. The time is the 1940s and the place is a small mining community in Quebec Canada at Christmas time. The movie has such an air of authenticity that I felt that I had gotten a glimpse into what life was like in that community at that time.The story centers on the experiences of fifteen year old Benoit an orphan living with his uncle and aunt who run a general store as well as a funeral parlor. Also living there is Carmen a young woman of Benoit's age. Most transitions from adolescence to adulthood take years but Benoit goes a long way to making that transition in a matter of a couple of days. The events that transpire in those days change Benoit from a rather carefree innocence to a sober appreciation of the complexities of life and death. We are witness to the joys frustrations and sorrows of the people we meet.Benoit's youthful experiences are universal in the large sexual awakening death duplicitous behavior dashed expectations but they are unique to him and that uniqueness is what makes coming of age stories ceaselessly interesting. There is a scene where Benoit is chasing Carmen around among the caskets such life amid the symbols of death and he finally catches her as she falls to the ground. He puts a hand on her breast exciting for him even though she is fully clothed. What happens then is one of those moments that make these experiences uniqueneither Benoit nor Carmen knows quite what to do at this juncture and they wind up just staring at each other. If you cannot appreciate such a tender scene then you will likely not appreciate this movie.Several themes lurk in the background. One is the friction that exists between the French and English speaking peoples of the province. After finishing a beer in a bar one of the French Canadians says That's one that the English will not get. The bitterness between the English speaking Quebecers and the francophone Canadians is brought home in the scene that has the English speaking mine owner tossing cheap Christmas gifts into the snow from his horsedrawn carriage. The harsh life of the mine workers is portrayed with just enough emphasis to make the point. The ugly and oppressive presence of the asbestos mine casts a somber shadow over the entire proceeding particularly given the health consequences of the mineral.Director Jutra chose Jacques Gagnon from the townspeople to play the role of Benoit instead of casting a professional young actor for the role. I think this turned out to be a fortuitous choice since Gagnon gives a surprisingly natural performance aided by some skillfull camera work. Many of the local townspeople appear in the movie adding to the feeling of authenticity the use of natural lighting adds to this as well.Several people have accused this movie of having no plot. I am always puzzled what such people mean by that. This movie presents a sequence of interrelated events leading to a dramatic final scene. To me that is a plot. I wish some of these plot deniers would spell out what they mean by their comment. Maybe I could see the charge sticking when applied to a movie like Warhol's Empire a continuous shot of New York's Empire State Building for eight hours and five minutes but not to this movie.I found this engaging and altogether worthwhile.".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't quite the best Canadian film ever IMO. I won't get off track and name 3 or 4 better. Just a couple of nights before I'd seen The Bicycle Thief the highly rated Italian classic and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their film in a specific time and specific place with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic setting and characters alone. The lingering shots over faces and landscape almost make this worth watching on its own. That being said this one isn't quite in the same league as the Italian classic. The movie is shot in a frigid barren Quebec asbestos mining town. That frigidity is contrasted with the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically what you get is a series of vignettes that are likely nostalgic recollections of Jutra  not ha ha funny  but poignant and probably sometimes difficult at the time but now warmed over with the patine of nostalgia. The movie meanders there is little tension. Somewhere around half to two thirds way through the story begins. Everyone you've met to this point is involved and you've gotten to know these characters rather well so have a little patience at the outset. The story is a good one it will leave you thinking and it involves sex love and death all the basic elements. If you like Bergman Godard Truffaut all that kind of stuff you won't be disappointed by this.".

	schema:headline " Stunning ComingOfAge Tale";
	schema:reviewBody "This Canadian comingofage tale is a magnificent example of how powerful a small character piece can be. Young Benoit Jacques Gagnon an amateur whose expressive face could put many a moreestablished actor to shame lives with his uncle and aunt Jean Duceppe and Olivette Thibault in a tiny village in which the primary employment opportunity is mining asbestos. Over the course of a deceptively low key Christmas Eve and Day in the early 1940s everything Benoit thinks he knows about his small world will be turned on its ear and he will become a man. There is possibly no way to do justice at least for me to the precision and delicacy with which the director Claude Jutra infuses the humdrum of daytoday life. So much happens and yet it could be argued that nothing really happens. In reality Life happens. While some events are more dramatic and lifechanging than others most everything is given its full due presented with perceptive grace. A small barrel of nails taking up precious walking space in the general store that Benoit's relatives ownhis uncle is also the town undertaker is just as prominent a storyline as some of the more devastating turns of eventsand when it is finally picked up to be put away the film gets its biggest laugh by having the young man carrying it still lift his leg high to step over it. Jutra isn't afraid to take his time and thoroughly investigate all aspects of life in this depressing little town the primary foci are on sex and deathabout which Benoit will learn much though he can't make sense of all of it. What's most amazing about Mon oncle Antoine isn't that it's unlike anything we've seen before but that it shows us the utterly familiar and universal moments of life and makes us see them with a depth we're unused to. But what I've never seen anything like in any movie is an astonishing scene between Benoit and Carmen Lyne Champagne another emotive amateur the young store clerk who his uncle and aunt have basically bought from her poor father. Upstairs in the storeroom of the store Benoit and Carmen flirt and chase each other among the caskets she in the bridal veil a customer waits for downstairs. They end up falling to the floor and he puts his hand matteroffactly on her breast. She turns away crying and flees Benoit shaken lies down on the floor and realizes they've been observed by the store's chief clerk Fernand played by Jutra himself. It is a simple but almost staggering scene of such allusive beauty with both characters caught up in a moment they can't quite make sense of. And the sex and death metaphor is unstressed allowing us to try and comprehend all the subtext without a lot of editorializing.

	onyx:emotionText "This Canadian comingofage tale is a magnificent example of how powerful a small character piece can be. Young Benoit Jacques Gagnon an amateur whose expressive face could put many a moreestablished actor to shame lives with his uncle and aunt Jean Duceppe and Olivette Thibault in a tiny village in which the primary employment opportunity is mining asbestos. Over the course of a deceptively low key Christmas Eve and Day in the early 1940s everything Benoit thinks he knows about his small world will be turned on its ear and he will become a man. There is possibly no way to do justice at least for me to the precision and delicacy with which the director Claude Jutra infuses the humdrum of daytoday life. So much happens and yet it could be argued that nothing really happens. In reality Life happens. While some events are more dramatic and lifechanging than others most everything is given its full due presented with perceptive grace. A small barrel of nails taking up precious walking space in the general store that Benoit's relatives ownhis uncle is also the town undertaker is just as prominent a storyline as some of the more devastating turns of eventsand when it is finally picked up to be put away the film gets its biggest laugh by having the young man carrying it still lift his leg high to step over it. Jutra isn't afraid to take his time and thoroughly investigate all aspects of life in this depressing little town the primary foci are on sex and deathabout which Benoit will learn much though he can't make sense of all of it. What's most amazing about Mon oncle Antoine isn't that it's unlike anything we've seen before but that it shows us the utterly familiar and universal moments of life and makes us see them with a depth we're unused to. But what I've never seen anything like in any movie is an astonishing scene between Benoit and Carmen Lyne Champagne another emotive amateur the young store clerk who his uncle and aunt have basically bought from her poor father. Upstairs in the storeroom of the store Benoit and Carmen flirt and chase each other among the caskets she in the bridal veil a customer waits for downstairs. They end up falling to the floor and he puts his hand matteroffactly on her breast. She turns away crying and flees Benoit shaken lies down on the floor and realizes they've been observed by the store's chief clerk Fernand played by Jutra himself. It is a simple but almost staggering scene of such allusive beauty with both characters caught up in a moment they can't quite make sense of. And the sex and death metaphor is unstressed allowing us to try and comprehend all the subtext without a lot of editorializing. It is in the last third of the movie though that Jutra brings all his themes together. A young boy has died suddenly and Antoine has to drive hours away through the snow on a horsedrawn carriage to retrieve the body. Benoit begs Aunt Cecile to let him go Uncle Antoine warns him Don't get all excited and the literal journey to manhood begins.

	schema:reviewBody "At the core of My Uncle Antoine is a comingofage story about a young Quebecan boy helping out his family with the store on Christmas Eve. But it is also rooted within the historical context of the Grande Noirceur or The Great Darkness a period of social unrest within the French Canadian province post World War 2 under the reign of the fiercely conservative Maurice Duplessis. For residents who have experienced this it rings true  the push of residents towards rural menial occupations the privilege and devotion afforded to the powerful Catholic church the utter futility of worker strikes and the opposition towards unions. Bathroom graffiti hastily scribbled seems to recognise the discontent with the political regime. Indeed the asbestos mine is photographed in such a way that it envelopes and suffocates the small town like a great grey shroud in a similar manner to how the lives of the low class Quebecans are subjugated and held in place by systems beyond their control. A miner's story which bookends the film tells of his singular attempt to quit his job and leave for a better existence as a logger. Suffice to say it is an unsuccessful one. As switch over to the main storyline it takes on the boyish excitement of Benoit who is helping his uncle and aunt set up the Christmas display for their general store. It is the mark of a small town that it is the showpiece that all the residents look forward to each year and there is a little mock unveiling that takes place. When a shy young girl announces her engagement the whole town cheers and ruffles the hair of the young groomtobe and drinks to the happy couple. And they are all intimately familiar with the singing voice of aunt Cecile and how she acts as the serenader for all the big events. This warm family is also accompanied by a lively score that seems whipped up from the young excited mind of Benoit himself a fastpaced melodic violin piece that is fit for a jig but which shows the whole town coming together for a snowball fight. Isn't Christmas the most lovely time of the year?The film is slow paced  it unveils these aspects of the community along with oddities that Benoit is accustomed to. His uncle Antoine is also the town undertaker and as such coffins line the walls and floors of the second floor but this is initially just a playground for the young boy a perfect moment of blossoming sexuality where he and Carmen have the urges but not the knowledge or maturity to proceed you'll notice how they almost immediately make up afterwards. There is that dreary sequence where the mineowner tosses his yearly 'bonuses' at each house even without showing their contents they look practically empty. The youth and kids excitedly fight and grab at the stockings while the parents and elderly watch glumly as they have been through this many times and are wise not to get their hopes up. And Benoit and his friend sit somewhere in the middle they aren't swayed by the stockings but pelt the owner's horse with snowballs perhaps not quite old enough to lose those wide grins on their faces. Even as his uncle is called out for a grim job on Christmas Eve to collect a corpse he still has that big grin on his face he begs to go as if he was running out the door with his friends and the lively score once again characterises his excitement and joy. But then he is silent as they approach the tragedystricken family. He sits while they quietly eat the lavish dinner the mother has prepared as if they were just visitors and is stoic as the children enjoy the gift of candy which is given a similar treatment as the stockings beforehand. Could he have suddenly realised the gravity of the situation in a way that the grinning teenager earlier could not? Brault's camera first and foremost shows its passion through its quick frantic zooms  and there is not one more important than the reveal of the dead boy scarcely older than Benoit himself a frozen lifeless mirrorimage of himself. It is in that moment we know that his grin will never be as wide his playfulness never as naive or mindless. What follows after is just a brutal reaffirmation of the fact. In a heartbreaking monologue Antoine spills out a confession that is not only intensely personal but reflects the social context of the period and the suffocation of the political regime. We see Benoit's new look his stonyfaced stare boring into the heart of Cecile who knows that she has been caught out but does not immediately recognise this Benoit. And in that final haunting POV shot a new consciousness behind the camera as if he is seeing for this first time not just looking. The mastery of My Uncle Antoine is that is is so tragic because it invests so much into the small Quebecan town and the intricate painful details. This elevates the emotional trauma to new levels. See the tenderness of a final sexual embrace between Jos and Madame Pouline and how they come together in the barn. See how the exact same treatment is applied to aunt Cecile's affair not with the usual aggressive lust but with an air of sweetness in how Fernand stares at her and tentatively compliments her dress. Spare a though for Carmen who think she is old enough to be wearing lipstick before hastily washing it off when Benoit teases her about it. In her father's eyes she is less a daughter and more a worker.".

That kid is the one put in a casket by Antoine and Benoit with the undertaker inert and almost unaffected by the loss for the family Antoine eating away at a supper prepared by the mourning wife is rather troublesome. When Antoine later can barely stand a pitiful mess Benoit seems to have lost all respect for him. Later when he sees Cecile for who she really is Benoit seems totally defeatedthese people he looked up to are truly flawed and disappointing. Fernand and Cecile trying to tiptoe around what Benoit saw by appealing to him delicately it failing miserably proves that the kid has grown up and not duped any longer. My favorite scene has the sophisticated beauty married to the mine accountant arriving at the store looking for a corset with the guys truly in awe of her.".

I found the story line to be disjointed and fleetingly related to the facts of life in that community. Yes it does depict the long slow winters of Quebec rural life but when you apply the long and slow to a movie it kills it for me. The last third of the movie is particularly painful.

Thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that he's it.The devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie and on that count Zarkorr!  The Invader fails miserably.  The monster Zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen totaling maybe 5 minutes tops with a generous estimate.  The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at and only because she's wearing a teeny bopper stereotype outfit complete with a teasingly short pleated skirt.  The climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say Whiskey Tango Foxtrot over.  In the next moment you are left to ponder whether you've just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained 3 pints of blood out of you.Admittedly though this movie did deliver one line that my friends and I to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture.  As the cast of protagonists is being interrogated by the fuzz one of them responds to the questions with the statement What are you some kind of a question asker?  It is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you're sitting with a group of friends who won't be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter.While this is no Manos or Eegah It's not even bad enough to be classically bad this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog unimaginative characters and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom 100.1.510".

The only part of it I liked was the beginning they opened the movie with the monster erupting from a mountain. That was cool and many monster movies have the problem of bothering us with the human characters and not introducing the monsters until a half hour in or so. The movie didn't go downhill from there it flat out dropped dead. Lemme put it this way this monster can shoot lasers from its eyes. Fun right? They kill it by reflecting its eyes back at it. A regular guy just reflects them back at the monster when it finds him. Doesn't try to eat him throw anything at him step on him just fires those lasers while they get reflected back at him BAM. Zarkorr is dead. The worst Godzilla movie would be better than this junk.".

The other shows may have better matches but i've always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement.I'm not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don't see it as fair to ruin the results on a review. I will comment on the quality of them though.We have the standard 4 matches and then the big rumble event. Two from Smackdown and two from Raw.Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. This proves to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match i'd recommend watching. It's hard to sum up without giving away the winner.Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is. Giant Gonzales Yokozuna Kamala... well this time it's Heidenreich. Its also a casket match. Typical Undertaker fare. Watch if you're a fan. I have to admit i am purely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.The next two matches are the title matches. For once Smackdown manages to upstage Raw. Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with a anticlimax and let down to end it. Raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved.Now to the main reason i love the event the rumble. It's a pretty good one this year. Coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove a big surprise but hey its very enjoyable. There are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. There is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. It has its usual highs and lows and i loved the ending in particular the Vince McMahon entrance.I'd recommend this show. Not the WWE on top form but its still good. Add it to your collection.".

	schema:headline " Batista seals the deal at the West Side Rumble";
	schema:reviewBody "The 2005 edition of the Royal Rumble came live from the Save Mart Centre in Fresno California. The two top Championships of the WWE were being defended The Undertaker was battling Heidenreich in a Casket match Shawn Michaels was taking on Edge in a grudge match that had been building up since last October and of course the every man for himself over the top rope Royal Rumble match itself. Who was going to take the price this year? Chris Benoit? Edge? Eddie Guerrero? Edge? John Cena? Batista? Edge? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of contenders.It was Batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy or should I say a botched finish. Batista and John Cena were the final two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to dump the young Smackdown! star over the top rope but it all went wrong and they both went toppling to the floor. The referees acted on their feet as we had an armraising contest similar to that of Bret hart and Lex Luger back in 1994. This brought out the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac walked down to the ring the way only he can but injured himself badly getting into the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting legs out telling the two men to restart the match. Batista then did was he was supposed to do first time round and dumped Cena to the floor sealing his own future with a Championship match at WrestleMania 21.The undercard for this years Royal Rumble had a very solid line up with many of WWE's biggest stars competing in matches. Each brand had two big matches each.Raw opened the night with the match between Shawn Michaels and Edge. This was a good technical contest. Back and fourth all the way until Edge got the pinfall. This was a smart booking decision and kept Edge as a contender to the World Heavyweight Championship.The second match of the night was the feud ending Casket match between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The match was not a classic but then again have their been any classic Casket matches? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane popped out the casket to a great pop. The Undertaker surprised no one when he got the win slamming the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud.The first of the two Championship matches of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields defence of the WWE Championship in a triple Threat match against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This match was very good. Again not a classic but entertaining none the less. JBL took the win after pinning Kurt Angle. His celebration was short lived however when backstage teddy Long informed him at No Way Out he would defend the WWE Championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage match against Big Show. Not a very nice way to spend a Sunday night.And of course there is no show without Punch. Punch of course being reigning World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. His rematch from Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was lot better than the original encounter. It's a pity because they just don't seem to click to well in the ring and this would be an excellent feud if they did. Orton played the concussion role very well and went down in defeat to The Game.So the first big one of 2005 was a good one. It achieved its goals. Feuds ended and new ones began. We were now officially on the road to WrestleMania 21.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last pay per view in the WWE was New Years Revolution 2005. All the matches in that event were pretty poor other than the main event. This PPV on the other hand was much better in my opinion. The matches had good build up and anticipation. It is always good to see the RAW and Smackdown Superstars on the same show every once in a while.Match 1 Shawn Michaels vs Edge  This match was good as i was expecting. It consisted of many near falls and was unpredictable. I am glad that HBK put Edge over. Edge is doing great as a heel and he should be the next HHH in terms of main eventing. A great match with a lot of build up.Match 2 Undertaker vs Heidenreich Casket Match  I find this feud to be going on for too long now. And the fact that this match was a casket match did not provide any further satisfaction. Both men have their turns at dominating the match. This was the worst match of the night i think. Highlights of the match include the undertaker legdropping heidenreich while he was halfway in the casket. Another good part was Snitsky and Kane interfering. All in all boring match though. Taker wins much to no surprise.Match 3 Triple Threat WWE Championship JBL vs Big Show vs Kurt Angle  Does JBl have to go over the entire smackdown roster including the main events? His title reign has beem good in the beginning but now is becoming tedious and way too long. The match is good but is short. Nice bumps taken by all three men including big show falling through the announce table and big show and JBL crashing through the guard railings. Disappointments include JBL cheating once gain by Interference. I think Angle should have won this he is a much more credible main eventer for Wrestlemania than Bradshaw.Match 4 Triple H vs Randy Orton World Heavyweight Championship Better than expected to say the least. Nice surprise to see Triple H win without cheating. Long match and Orton did do a good job of it. I got to love Orton's selling of the concussion. But it is time for this rivalry to end already. Royal Rumble match There have been batter Rumbles in the past but this one was not bad. Somewhat Average. Batista wins it. The question is will he face Triple H or JBL at WM. The rumble match was a tad predictable as many people i know were picking that batista would win and he did. The good Edge vs Michaels was a classic match.Batista wins. Triple H has a clean win for once in his life.The bad The casket match this feud needs to end ASAP. JBL winning over Angle.".

Undertaker vs Hedinreich. Not a good match. Undertaker had to carry Hedinreich through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves. It did get interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and a bit later Kane come into this match. Overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 210 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. This match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when Angle managed to speed up the match.Kurt Angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match. JBL and Big Show put on a slow match. The ending to this match was bad. Over all this match was a 510 mainlly because of Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Good matchsurprising heat for Randy Orton who was the face in this match. Randy proved he can go the limit with any top star. This match also marked the first match HHH has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss. Over all this match was about a 610.Royal Rumble match was OK. Some surprises. Some not so good surprises. I was kind of upset that Kurt Angle wasn't given enough time in this match. But over all this match had a guy who I never thought would be pushed so soon. I won't tell ya who wins. I give this match a 810".

HHH nails the Pedigree on Orton for the win to retain his World Title. 510FIFTH MATCH ROYAL RUMBLE This was a cool Royal Rumble Every Royal Rumble is good.

It was now up to Cena  Batista. First after reversing an FU Batista went for the Batista Bomb but suddenly both men crumbled on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision  Mr. McMahon making his way to the ring to settle the matter. The match was restarted again as Batista  Cena battled it out but Batista got the better out of Cena nailed a spinebuster  threw Cena out to win the 2005 Royal Rumble  go on to Wrestlemania 21 to face the Champion in the mainevent. 1010 This was a very good Royal Rumble but last year's would always top every Royal Rumble in history.Overall I'll give it 810  B".

	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly there are some scenes in this movie that seem a little unrealistic. The ravishing woman first panics and then only a few minutes later she starts kissing the young lad while the old guy is right next to her. But as the film goes along we learn that she is a little volatile girl or slut and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this movie is well done. We get to see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective and some of those images and scenes really raise the tension. Gtz George plays his character well a wannabe hotshot getting old and being overpowered by young men like the Jaennicke character. Wolfgang Kieling who I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN delivers a great performance that although he doesn't say much he is by far the best actor in this play. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real case of emergency nothing would really happen. But then again how realistic are films such as Mission impossible or Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie here and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that aren't very likely to occur in real life you can still enjoy this movie. It's a lot better than many things that I see on German TV these days and I think that the vintage 80's style added something to this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1983 there was a Dutch movie about a killer elevator called De Lift which was remade by the director in 2001. Here's a German movie from 1984 about a killer elevator. Funny how that happens. Anyway the one in De Lift was evil but this one is just poorly designed and maintained.Four people get stuck in an elevator a couple a younger guy and an older man with a suitcase. The night watchman doesn't notice the problem since the alarm had been turned off for the repairman who'd been there earlier. They try to get out hurting themselves and smashing up the elevator in the process. They bicker a lot. The handheld videogame playing walkmanwearing young man is annoying and the woman is surprisingly slutty. The actress is rather unusuallooking with eyebrows tweezed away to almost nothing and hair in a style that emphasizes how high her hairline is and how thin her hair is. Whoever did that to her should never have gotten the job!When repairmen come they give the security guard a hard time. He has a German accent the video I watched was dubbed in English which they mock and they complain about foreigners. I thought that was weird since the movie was German. Did he have an American accent in the Germanlanguage version? I was also surprised that they try to raise the elevator car rather than lower it I wonder if that is the procedure in real life?Still I enjoyed this. It's not great but is entertaining enough.I wonder if the elevator horror subgenre is played out. Someone ought to have one involving a paternoster lift look it up  those are pretty unusual a friend of mine had ridden one and told me about it.Incidentally the Worst Case Scenario Handbook writers have evidently advised the best way to survive a plummeting elevator is to lie down flat on the floor.".

	schema:headline " Some great moments some not so good";
	schema:reviewBody "Abwrts or Downwards or Out of Order is a West German 85minute film from 1984 so this one is already over 30 years old. The writer and director is Carl Schenkel and it is one of the filmmakers' most known works especially if you only count his Germanlanguage movies. He received some nice awards attention here and same can be said about the cast. Gtz George won a German Film Award for example for his performance here even if it was not a supporting performance at all. He was clearly lead if anybody was lead in here. The cast includes a whole lot of actors that are still really wellknown in Germany today such as George the really young Hannes Jaenicke in his very first performance and Wolfgang Kieling who was also nominated in the same category like George. If you look at these three you recognize that they stand for 3 different generations of actors. The only mentionable female performance comes from Dutch actress Rene Soutendijk but she was also the film's biggest weakness I think not because of her acting but because of the way the character was written.The kissing scene with Jaenicke or the scene when she randomly tells George's character that she is about to get his job felt really bad and were among the film's weakest moments. Obviously the filmmakers tried to use her to create controversy between the two alphamales in the elevator but it felt forced and wasn't working at all. Subtlety is sadly not the film's biggest strength and these were the thriller moments that weren't working at all. I personally thought the film was at its best when the action took place outside the elevator namely when there was danger somebody would be falling down or even dying. Yes there may have been a bit too many ropes in danger of being torn but it was still edgeofseat material and going by these sequences it was an 810 even.Another couple words on the actors. Jaenicke may not give a great performance in terms of range but he was at least as good as Kieling who added very little for me and Jaenicke's biggest strength was his physical acting here with which he shines and given it was a rookie effort it was pretty good. The supporting performances include familiar faces too such as the late great Klaus Wennemann Ralf Richter or Fassbinder protg Kurt Raab in a brief cameo early on. And while I enjoyed watching this film I still see it as a bit of a missed opportunity as the claustrophobic component has been used convincingly on really not too many occasions and this one could have added an entirely new dimension of thrill to the film. I guess you really have to be claustrophobic to feel the protagonists' fear here. I was wondering more why they would not just wait in there for help instead of risking their lives again and again. Is oxygen really a problem? I am not sure. Also there were sometimes too many coincidence for my liking but it adds to the plot and drama and that's why I can live with it. Even if it's not a perfect film by any means I still recommend seeing it. I like that they kept it essential with this short runtime and kept it from dragging. It had more positive than negative moments and George really shines once again. May he rest in peace and awesome he left us films and performances like this one here.".

The true comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. The misogyny cultural insensitivity and almost laughable machoism of the films of this genre are used for major comic effect. It also calls the illogic and formulaic elements to task with Agent OSS 117 constantly learning difficult things insanely quick such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument while missing some pathetically obvious clues. Some of the lines from the film left me laughing for hours after the movie was finished...and I have to say I have learned some...interesting...French vocabulary that would probably have my Professors quite exasperated with me were I to use. All in all I thought this film excellent. Intensely funny and the first film I've ever seen that truly parodies all aspects of the spy film.".

It's uncanny and you come to realise just how much of Bond in the Sixties was Connery's creation and not really Ian Fleming's character. The cinematography is a nod to those early films the movie takes off From Russia With Love and Thunderball mainly. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is not just in terms of sexism but nationalism and colonialism and how he puts noses out of joint when he is sent to Egypt. It's not perfect  about 20 mins in it seems a onejoke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day of which there were plenty. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspectlooking men in fez's following their heroes around too and that's going back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat Dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of realness or genuine pathos  he is too busy perfecting his Connery mannerisms. It doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song and there's no funny or serious villain like Mike Myers' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis for the hero to go up against.But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning had me laughing out loud in the threequarters empty cinema and the whole thing looks wonderful plus you'll never get a chance to see Operation Kid Brother on the screen and the women are ace crumpet really hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into the mad scientistKen Adam sets or funny gadgets routine. Throughly recommended.".

Even so what a funny funny movie. It's not quite as zany as a spoof like Airplane nor quite as funny which of course is hard to do but it takes the Sean Connery vintage James Bond film model and really does a parody worthy of 007. And of the franchise which of course is bigger than Bond bigger than Ian Fleming could have ever dreamed.But hold your horsesthis is a parody of the real OSS117. Yes a French author created a Bondlike spy in the 1950s and this movie and its 2009 sequel are really playing a doubleedged game. They bring the old French spy to life the original was a Frenchspeaking American bizarrely enough and they make fun of him of Bond and of 1960s super slick sexist movies all around.The star here the Sean Connery of this spoof he even looks a bit like the Scottish actor is Jean Dujardin. He's brilliant. He's funny campy silly serious and subtle about it all. He plays the role with a kind of oblivious selfridicule that Woody Allen and Peter Sellers were so good at. It's great stuff.And he's backed up by a strong if somewhat predictable assortment of international thugs beauties and oddballs. There are shades of Charade here as well as the original Pink Panther movies. The scoring is amazing composed with that Henry Mancini flair to a T and recorded with the familiar bright echoey sound studio fullness of the time. Equally authentic are the opening credits which were so convincing I had to double check when the movie came out. I was thinking wow a lost 1960s gem.But it's a brand new gem or almost gem. Time will tell if this will hold up over the years but it's a kind of mustsee now for anyone into Bond films the 60s French humor or just a well made movie with lots of gags. Like the gag where the noisy chickens go silent when the lights go off and so our hero delights in turning the lights on and off and on and off. Just wait and listen. It'll slay you.".

	schema:reviewBody "A spoof on James Bond about OSS operative stunningly performed by Jean Dujardin . Comedy spythriller with Jean Dujardin as inept secret agent versus nasty highranking Nazis and arms smugglers . Secret agent OSS 117 foils Nazis  beds local beauties  and brings peace as well as mayhem to Cairo . It's 1955 by time of dictator Nasser and the secret agent Hubert Bonisseur De la Bath a.k.a. OSS 117 is ordered a dangerous investigation in Cairo  there he has to take his place at the head of a poultry firm . Hubert Bonisseur is the French spy considered by his superiors to be the best in the business  this time his assistant is the charming Egiptyan agent Larmina performed by Berenice Bejo  director's wife . He's been sent on a mission to El Cairo  Port Said  to look for a former agent who has been eliminated . His eventful mission takes him all across Egypt accompanied by a beautiful girl and taking on a lot of adventures  risks and doublecrosses . The man is charming  and so is the young girl spy . Filmed on luxurious sets their tale is by turns an exciting intrigue and a love story . He acts as a playboy  this results to be his cover while he is busy investigating  foiling Nazi holdout and bedding local beauties . Hubert Bonisseur De la Bath a French spy is in Cairo to investigate the disappearance a French agent . He is he smart spy  or is he an imbecile ? He fights well but he's supremely smug and selfconfident even as he's deaf to cultural nuance and others' feelings  so the odds are even that he might survive .Funny moments along with embarrassing in this first entry about secret agent OSS 117 with a likable Jean Dujardin  role of the accidental spy who doesn't know fear or danger in this comedy spythriller . In this entertaining adventure  the most unlikely intelligence officer in French Secret Service must stop a group of international Nazi conspirators  quelling a fundamentalist rebellion and deal with an intrigue about weapon smuggling . Hubert Bonisseur a French secret agent who dreams of rising beyond his menial job within the OSS organization after all the other agents are bumped off is hired to discover a mysterious ring . With one shot at redemption he must employ all kind of means to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout an ambitious plot . Hubert must use every trick in his playbook to achieve his objectives . For Hugo Bonisseur disaster may be an option but failure never is. This original installment is an acceptable comedy though the formula is well known with 'The Pink Panther' series and recently with 'Johnnny English' by Rowan Atkinson . It stars clumsy Jean Dujardin as one man show accompanied by a gorgeous Berenice Bejo . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing  funny scenes  fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Jean Dujardin steals the show parodying the ordinary international secret agent  James Bondalike  including his ordinary faces  grimaces and gestures  he plays stunningly the highly unorthodox agent the inept and bungler secret agent from OSS .

	onyx:emotionText "A spoof on James Bond about OSS operative stunningly performed by Jean Dujardin . Comedy spythriller with Jean Dujardin as inept secret agent versus nasty highranking Nazis and arms smugglers . Secret agent OSS 117 foils Nazis  beds local beauties  and brings peace as well as mayhem to Cairo . It's 1955 by time of dictator Nasser and the secret agent Hubert Bonisseur De la Bath a.k.a. OSS 117 is ordered a dangerous investigation in Cairo  there he has to take his place at the head of a poultry firm . Hubert Bonisseur is the French spy considered by his superiors to be the best in the business  this time his assistant is the charming Egiptyan agent Larmina performed by Berenice Bejo  director's wife . He's been sent on a mission to El Cairo  Port Said  to look for a former agent who has been eliminated . His eventful mission takes him all across Egypt accompanied by a beautiful girl and taking on a lot of adventures  risks and doublecrosses . The man is charming  and so is the young girl spy . Filmed on luxurious sets their tale is by turns an exciting intrigue and a love story . He acts as a playboy  this results to be his cover while he is busy investigating  foiling Nazi holdout and bedding local beauties . Hubert Bonisseur De la Bath a French spy is in Cairo to investigate the disappearance a French agent . He is he smart spy  or is he an imbecile ? He fights well but he's supremely smug and selfconfident even as he's deaf to cultural nuance and others' feelings  so the odds are even that he might survive .Funny moments along with embarrassing in this first entry about secret agent OSS 117 with a likable Jean Dujardin  role of the accidental spy who doesn't know fear or danger in this comedy spythriller . In this entertaining adventure  the most unlikely intelligence officer in French Secret Service must stop a group of international Nazi conspirators  quelling a fundamentalist rebellion and deal with an intrigue about weapon smuggling . Hubert Bonisseur a French secret agent who dreams of rising beyond his menial job within the OSS organization after all the other agents are bumped off is hired to discover a mysterious ring . With one shot at redemption he must employ all kind of means to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout an ambitious plot . Hubert must use every trick in his playbook to achieve his objectives . For Hugo Bonisseur disaster may be an option but failure never is. This original installment is an acceptable comedy though the formula is well known with 'The Pink Panther' series and recently with 'Johnnny English' by Rowan Atkinson . It stars clumsy Jean Dujardin as one man show accompanied by a gorgeous Berenice Bejo . The movie gets entertaining and hilarious moments here and there. This slapstick picture contains amusing  funny scenes  fresh and diverting moments but also flaws and gaps . Jean Dujardin steals the show parodying the ordinary international secret agent  James Bondalike  including his ordinary faces  grimaces and gestures  he plays stunningly the highly unorthodox agent the inept and bungler secret agent from OSS . There appears two beauties as Berenice Bejo and Aure Atica . The actors seem to enjoy themselves immensely giving funny interpretations . Lively and atmospheric music by Ludovic Bource . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Schiffman . Other films about this famous spy are the followings  O.S.S. 117 Is Not Dead with Ivan Desny  Panic en Bangkok with Kerwin Mathews  OSS 117 Mission for a Killer with Frederick Stafford  OSS 117 Double Agent played by John Gavin and Vendetta of espies performed by Luc Merenda .

	schema:headline " A fun silly comedy. Look for sequels";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites. This is a spoof on the french cottage industry of OSS 117 films of the 50's and 60's. The first OSS 117 film based on the novel by Jean Bruce was brought to the screen in 1956 long before the first James Bond film staring Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with Luc Merenda Frederick Stafford Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all taking turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series. As the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles Desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like Sean Connery. Jean Franois Halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It borrows on the silliness of Naked Gun Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and I am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived OSS 117 reworked to comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius directs. I would give this a 7.5 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies is a brilliant satire of the 60's spy movies not just James Bond but the many European entries as well. Jean Dujardin is wonderful as Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath aka OSS 117. OSS 117 was a literary spy from a series of French novels which predate James Bond. In the novels he was an American from Louisiana who worked with the wartime OSS and postwar CIA. Here he is pure French with all of the connotations of the 1950's chauvinistic pompous patronizing clueless and suave. He begins his mission to Cairo to uncover the reasons behind the disappearance of another agent and friend. What he finds is a chicken warehouse Egyptian revolutionaries Nazis a missing Soviet ship femme fatales and a flair for singing in Arabic.The film has great sight gags including a running gag involving chickens and light a chicken fight that has to be seen to be believed rear screen projections that take one back to the 60's a bit of homoeroticism and an argument with a muezzin over a loudspeaker. Hubert is so clueless he actually believes everyone would treasure a picture of failed French President Rene Coty.This is great fun with far more subtle wit than Austin Powers. It has playful fun with the trappings of the Connery Bond films as well as the style of filmmaking in that era. Like Austin he is totally clueless but unlike Austin he is charming and sophisticated. It reminds you of what used to be great about the Bond films while gently or blatantly nudging them for their colonialism and undercurrent of racism.If you love cool spy films of the 60's you'll have fun with OSS 117. I can't wait for the DVD release of the sequel set in Rio.".

Never seen the original OSS117 movies either while being versed into James Bond since the 70s... As a big fan of the french movies of the 5060's and 70s I'm becoming tired and uninterested into the current wave of ultra bland vulgar and awful french movies so I wasn't expecting much...And glad I was cause this came as a wonderful treat and surprise for the old amateur of movies from my mother country. From the beautiful locations in Casablanca Morocco to the terrific costumes and perfect dialogues this was a blast from the past !Former french TV comical show writer JeanFranois Halin and Michel Hazanavicius got a lot of fun using absolutely ANY old school word from french vocabulary words that are considered has been to current french population and that seemed to be a relic from another world and life...And that's the full charm of those dialogues for me reminiscent of the masterpieces starring French Icons Jean Gabin Lino Ventura or Bernard Blier and such absolute greatness as Les Tontons Flingueurs and the greatest french screen writer and dialoguist of all time Michel Audiard !That's why only french talking people can truly enjoy every single nuance of Hubert Bonnisseur De La Bath aka Lucien Brammar Larmina Pelletier and any character from the movie.I've yet to watch it with English subtitles to witness if they've done justice to HalinHazanavicius master work on the words but in French it's a delight to my brain !The acting is on par with the locations costumes and dialogues with Dujardin being Dujardin his epic ultra white smile always cracks me up Mrs Bjo aka Michel Hazanavicius' wife is wonderful as Egyptian modern woman Larmina Aude Atika is also delicious as The Princess Al Tarouk the old time great and mentions to the actors who play Setine and Muller who do shine especially during the hammam for Setine and original party scene with terrific words of play between Dujardin Richard Sammel Muller and Costantin Alexandrov Setine that had me in absolute tears. Last but not least Claude Brosset as De La Bath boss aka Armand Lesignac is pure old school french brilliance.I give the movie only 7 because of a few moments that were plain boring and embarrassing aka the nazi part inside the pyramid and the one moment with Belgian Chicken owner and ultra nemesis of Lucien Brammar's SGEP the actor is awful and was a total letdown during the four men exchanges in the first party.Last but not least the climax was kinda boring and uneventful only the two females catfighting on the ground was fun and entertaining to me.But that's minor complains next to legendary FrenchEgyptian singer Dalida's Bambino cover by one surprisingly good singer Jean Dujardin with epic head banging for good measureor the multiplej'aime... hilarious one liners the excellent pursuit in the streets of Le Caire or should I say Casablanca again looks totally like Morocco and NOT Egypt. Last but not least nobody here mentioned the perfect and beautiful musical score. The OSS117 theme remixed with oriental instruments and vibes is so haunting and catchy It's currently stuck in my head. All in all a breathe of fresh air and an oddity in a very mediocre french movie scene that is just a poor old man version of the great era of french movies from the XXth century.The use of technicolor was truly the icing on the cake on this very delicious cake of cinema.".

One of these was OSS 117 Le Caire nid d'espions OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies in English. Dujardin plays a spy very similar to James Bond who investigates intrigue and arms trading in Egypt. Much of the movie makes fun of western attitudes toward the Arab world and in particular plays on the stereotypes of French men. It's the sort of movie whose purpose is mainly to be funny and it succeeds. Bejo looks mighty sexy as the spy's contact in Egypt as does Aure Atika as an Egyptian princess.

The main character is an annoying superficial and stupid racist sexist and anticultural snob that has to investigate on a boring random case along side with boring random characters. I know that the directors exactly wanted to create such a superficial and arrogant character but as I didn't get connected to him I didn't get connected to the whole movie. The jokes are so childish that it made me despair. You open the lights and some chickens make some noise. You hit a muezzin because he wakes you up in the morning. You hit a partner because he forgets a stupid password. There were so many countless and boring jokes that the story line becomes absolutely secondary and random stuff and the pseudotwist in the ending is also quite predictable.I really lost one and half hour of my precious life on this unfunny and annoying piece of garbage. I give one point for the beautiful landscapes and the fact that I was still hoping that there would be a turning point or a really funny scene in this movie which made me watch this until the very end. Well I was wrong but at least I made it through the whole movie. But I wouldn't recommend to any one to live the same fate as I did. Just ignore the influenced and not very objective reviews by some French fans of the main actor who did a decent job in the cult movie Brice de Nice. Give yourself a little gift and watch the Mad Mission series or if you want something French go for Welcome to the Sticks. Even my girlfriend who normally laughs about anything and adores comedy movies found this one annoying and boring.".

He also tells of his visit to the floating island of Laputa populated by scientists who are so obsessed with reason that they act with no common sense. Finally he tells of his journey to the land where his disturbing likeness to the bestial Yahoos and his inferiority to the intelligent horses there makes him question the very worth of his humanity.";

The amazing effects and direction make it a marvel to watch.  The allstar cast enjoy their roles to the hilt.The sequences within the asylum are disturbing as are Danson's twisted hatred on humans and what they have become.  And in some aspects the thoughtprovoking stories that Gulliver went through can still be adapted today.For example the we drink when we are not thirsty and eat when we are not hungry is a typically haunting line.  The social commentary which underlines the novel and indeed this film can still be used and adapted today.This is a thoughtprovoking well made TVfilm that is very enjoyable and I recommend you watch it.My Rating 810".

Lucky kiddies!The same applies to this movie. There have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean it's a TVmovie and it comes from muppetteer Jim Henson so how should we expect anything but cuteness?Look again  beauty turns up in the oddest places. Children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours of it but it also takes the time to get Swift's dark vision right. I hate special effects but here they are used to carry the story forward instead of just dazzling us. Please note that the producers took the trouble to recruit classical actors like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole who perform their eccentric roles with perfection.Dramatically the romance between Gulliver and Glumdalclitch is rendered touching and poignant as well as funny she's a little girl but twenty times his size. The framestory has a theme about absent fathers that many children will relate to. And the part about Gulliver in the asylum introduces an element of horror dealing with the abuse of authority apparently deriving from Val Lewton's Bedlam 1946 another forgotten masterpiece.The VHS is always turning up in the bargainbin for a few cents which is an insult to the many great artists who put this thing together. I encourage audiences to recognize a good thing by getting this movie and inspiring others to watch it. Although it has a lot to offer children grownups will find that it stands up nicely to such classics as Aguirre Brazil 1984 and other serious fantastic works.Much of it was filmed in Portugal I was looking up the various palaces involved Sintra MonserrateLaputa QueluzBrobdingnag Ribafria Palace Sorcerer's Palace I think Castle of the MoorsStruldbrugs Lisbon AjudaBurning Palace Lilliput Mafra Royal Palace and streetscapes Lilliput Sea Cliffs Brobdingnag and Lilliput The Doctor's Mansion is obviously in the Cotswold limestone district... anyone recognize it?

Although I have many favourite scenes I think my favourite is the court scene where Gulliver gets the upper hand. That scene is very exciting and tense and your rooting for him all the way.

She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does he is talking about tiny people giants a flying island and talking horses! Mary despite the strong fantasy element in the story is a very believable character.The special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall.The cameos are great as well Omar Sharif Richard Wilson Sir John Gielgud Kristin Scott Thomas Ned Beatty. All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson's superb acting ability.The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is. Gulliver and Mistress' study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos.The best version of Gulliver's Travels by far and one of the best miniseries ever.".

	schema:headline " The frame story which added to Swift's tale is useful and well done.";
	schema:reviewBody "This production was quite well done for a television original providing a very appropriate original slant on Swift's work. To make the frame story work well the film begins with Gulliver arriving home. Everyone who has read the book knows that will happen anyway. The frame story of the book has Gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. For example he is horrified that he will trample little people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. When Gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from England to the travel are very effective. I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first then they became natural. By the end moreover they have become a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. For example his hatred of filthy Yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity. The intercuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. For example ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. Swift only hints at this by having the longsuffering wife protest against further voyages. It becomes a natural part of this story. The casting and acting were competent throughout. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's mad magician is superb. O'Toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility. Many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference which after all is what we are about here. I read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. I may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. While the Danson version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book. However I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book enjoy this movie then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire in it find Swift's A Modest Proposal and his Drapier's Letters. Both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests cheap inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland. These were Wood's light weight coinage not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's torturous experiences a chance. I think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.".

The frame story of the book has Gulliver's crazed confusion in sections. For example he is horrified that he will trample little people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the film has all the book sections within one long voyage. When Gulliver narrates his travels the editing cuts from England to the travel are very effective. I confess I found them intrusive and irritating at first then they became natural. By the end moreover they have become a welcome addition to the story. As he tells his adventures to a larger and larger audience more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt its truth. For example his hatred of filthy Yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section comes across well when he is defending his own sanity. The intercuts between events in England and similar events or scenes in the tale is very effective. For example ripping the cloth from the table to suggest the motion of towing a group of ships is inspired filming. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. Swift only hints at this by having the longsuffering wife protest against further voyages. It becomes a natural part of this story. The casting and acting were competent throughout. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's mad magician is superb. O'Toole's little emperor is doddering delightfully toward senility. Many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference which after all is what we are about here. I read the abridged version several times a year from fourth grade on. I may have escaped the complete version until a college class but have read it a few times since. And I had to start it again as I began reading about this film. While the Danson version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book. However I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you have not read the book enjoy this movie then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire in it find Swift's A Modest Proposal and his Drapier's Letters. Both are satires attacking the wretched treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests cheap inflated copper coins being dumped on Ireland. These were Wood's light weight coinage not good for face value in paying taxes and official debts. The outcry from Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another mistreated British territory the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just poke fun they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's torturous experiences a chance. I think you will find them thought provoking and entertaining.";

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the rubbish Hallmark has come up with since it's easy to forget how good this was. As an adaptation of the book this is easily the best version and is the only version to include all four parts of the book. I do have one reservation which will be addressed. Obviously some satirical points are lost as the book contains many 'topical' references to persons and occurrences from the early 18th Century which would go completely unnoticed nowadays by anyone who has not made an academic study of the book. The book had Gulliver make four separate voyages to each land but here as in most versions that include more than one part Gulliver discovers all the lands in one long voyage. Whilst this removes a reasonably important aspect of the book's framing device The progressively worse treatment of Gulliver by the ships crews reflect Gulliver's own estrangement from the human race it does make the film flow better. The films own framing device allows much more information to be imparted although I do believe too much time is spent on the backstory accompanying it.The Lilliputian and Brobdingnagian segments are very well done all the major points covered in the book are dealt with very economically. It is with the next part that my reservation arises. Laputa the Academy and the Glubbdubdrib necromancy are very well adapted but the depiction of the immortal Struldbruggs show an incredible lack of courage. In the book the Struldbruggs are cursed with immortality but not eternal youth and depicts gibbering desiccated husks millennia old. Here the 'curse' of immortality is simply blindness and totally betrays the book. However this remains the first time to my knowledge that the Houyhnhnms section has been filmed a section that has given Swift a reputation probably undeserved of being a misanthrope. Here the odious Yahoos are kept as vile as they are in the book and although the impact of the ending has been softened the blow is still there.The film is very well done indeed with perfect art design costuming and atmospheric direction by Sturridge the Glubbdubdrib section is brilliantly eerie. Ted Danson is nothing short of fantastic in a studied yet emotional performance. Steenbergen is less memorable but still effective. The starstudded supporting cast impresses throughout especially to O'Toole's Lilliputian Emperor and Nicholas Lyndhurst's Clustril it is oddly satisfying to have a lead actor in 'Cheers' sharing scenes with a lead actor from 'Only Fools and Horses! The music is perfect with the rousing theme music the Indian influenced but otherworldly Laputan music and the primitive percussion of the Yahoo sections.In summary this is a great though qualified success. There will never be a film version that does full justice to the book but this is as close as we're probably going to get.".

Didn't expect much out of a TV miniseries but now I might have to check out some more. This is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made. Writer Simon Moore who wrote the teleplay for the original Traffic miniseries upon which the Soderberg film was based came up with a brilliant narrative conceit which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames Gulliver's adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as Gulliver first returns home everything having happened on one journey. Gulliver played by Cheers' Ted Danson is sort of crazyseeming when his wife Mary Steenburgen welcomes him back into his home. Unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor James Fox who has designs on Steenburgen. Gulliver seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people that's all the evidence Fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum. All four of Gulliver's travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film. I love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks. Gulliver's small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the Lilliputians. The doctors who observe him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of the Brogdingnagians and the doctors' scientific inquiries remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the Laputans and the professors at the Academy. Finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the Houyhnhnms and the Yahoos. The cast of this thing is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole Ned Beatty Alfre Woodard John Gielgud Kristin Scott Thomas Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest flaw of the miniseries is that the acting is really uneven. You have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of L.A. Law but don't do well in a costume drama. Ted Danson isn't especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels. It's probably better that he didn't attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an English accent. Steenburgen is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall. Another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly. It's not believable that Gulliver spent eight years away from home as is claimed. But in general it captures Swift's tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lemuel Gulliver Ted Danson is a doctor who goes missing at sea leaving pregnant wife Mary Mary Steenburgen behind. Eight years later he turns up disheveled and seemingly mad  babbling about his adventures in the lands of the tiny Lilliputians the giant Brobdingnags the floating island of the intellectual Laputa and the Houyhnhnms a race of intelligent talking horses who have to deal with the Yahoos  a race of bestial humans  among many other adventures. The notsogood Dr. Bates James Fox who has designs on Lemuel's wife has Gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution and Lemuel Mary and son Thomas Tom Sturridge must find a way to prove his sanity.A splendid adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels the story the satire the characters the visuals the brilliant cast. It's simply a treat to watch and it's almost amazing considering that it was a madeforTV film.The film does a brilliant job of capturing Swift's vicious satire which cuts like a hatchet through British society of the time but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes where Gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders they seem to pick the worst among them. . . who rules until they find someone even worse go to war We only go to war for a very good reason  such as they are weaker than us or we want all of their land etc. The scenes involving Laputa are also effectively done  the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else and really possess little common sense. And the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly  Dr. Bates is truly nasty character and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on Gulliver's alleged vices it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults.The film makes use of beautiful and fairly convincing CGI effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography particularly that concerning the asylum and the costumes are brilliantly done. The editing of the present with Lemuel's memories is a device which could be awkward but works very well.The cast is truly wonderful a veritable who'swho of British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent multilayered performance as Gulliver showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears to his rational intellectual personality at the end. Most wellknown for his work on sitcom Danson shows that he's more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful seriocomic performance. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos with Peter O'Toole Omar Sharif Warwick Davis Kristin Scott Thomas Geraldine Chaplin Alfre Woodward Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable  but even the smallest parts are very wellplayed.While not 100 faithful to the book Gulliver's Travels is a triumph of story and images. It's not to be missed.910".

The notsogood Dr. Bates James Fox who has designs on Lemuel's wife has Gulliver incarcerated in a mental institution and Lemuel Mary and son Thomas Tom Sturridge must find a way to prove his sanity.A splendid adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels the story the satire the characters the visuals the brilliant cast. It's simply a treat to watch and it's almost amazing considering that it was a madeforTV film.The film does a brilliant job of capturing Swift's vicious satire which cuts like a hatchet through British society of the time but still resonates today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with such pride of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes where Gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best with biting satire in describing how they pick their leaders they seem to pick the worst among them. . . who rules until they find someone even worse go to war We only go to war for a very good reason  such as they are weaker than us or we want all of their land etc. The scenes involving Laputa are also effectively done  the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else and really possess little common sense. And the addition of the asylum plot line enhances the story greatly  Dr. Bates is truly nasty character and when he gives a speech to the inquiry on Gulliver's alleged vices it's quite clear that he's describing his own faults.The film makes use of beautiful and fairly convincing CGI effects depicting the very diverse settings of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done in a very skillful way and all of the worlds depicted in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography particularly that concerning the asylum and the costumes are brilliantly done. The editing of the present with Lemuel's memories is a device which could be awkward but works very well.The cast is truly wonderful a veritable who'swho of British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent multilayered performance as Gulliver showing effectively his transformation from a person bewildered by his strange surroundings to the lunatic state he was in when he reappears to his rational intellectual personality at the end. Most wellknown for his work on sitcom Danson shows that he's more than just Sam Malone with this wonderful seriocomic performance. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast is made up mostly of cameos with Peter O'Toole Omar Sharif Warwick Davis Kristin Scott Thomas Geraldine Chaplin Alfre Woodward Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable  but even the smallest parts are very wellplayed.While not 100 faithful to the book Gulliver's Travels is a triumph of story and images. It's not to be missed.910";

The framing device  Gulliver comes back from sea tells a wild tale of his experiences is committed to an asylum tells further wild tales on further occasions and is finally vindicated  has no foundation in the book but neither does it alter the substance of the tales Swift wrote. Another major change is in the ending. Unlike so many adaptations the film tells of all four of Gulliver's voyages  it is not limited to Lilliput and Brobdingnag. The first and second are altered by having Gulliver's voyage from Lilliliput end not in rescue by an English ship but in landfall on the Brobdingnagian coast. It is implied that the two lands are a considerable distance apart but the book has Lilliput and its enemy Blefuscu lie in the Indian Ocean whereas Brobdingnag is a peninsula off the coast of Alaska. The deviation is an intelligent piece of adaptation and typical of the care taken by the adaptors to make a film of the book rather than of something rather distantly based on it. Special props to Warwick Davis who turned in a thoroughly convincing performance as Gulliver's dwarf tormentor at the Brobdingnagian court and to Tom Sturridge that Gulliver has a son is sort of implied since the book says he has children. Ted Danson made the part of Gulliver his own. He inhabited it as thoroughly as Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett have inhabited that of Sherlock Holmes.".

The guy who plays Gulliver and the women who plays his wife are actually married in real life so that kind of makes things cool. I also watched without understanding that it went beyond big guy in little world. It goes far beyond Lilleputt into other uncharted regions and undiscovered islands that are absolutely astoundingwatch out for the big underlining meanings their awesome. I would recommend the viewer to consider this like going to theater its not a big budget movie or anythingits a 90s mini seriesbuts a heck of 90s mini series!!!".

At the time I found it fantastic that I could watch a book without worrying about the doldrums of actually reading it. Looking back on it now I remember a feeling of fantasy and imagination. I could only wonder what was running through Swift's mind as he wrote this symbolic story. Watching it again older ... wiser ... and more inept to read instead of watch I thought it was still a wonderful story. There were flaws as there is with any madeforTV film but they seemed smaller then some of the big budget films that I have witnessed lately. I think that the fact that Henson's son had his hands in this allowed the creativity to leap from the screen.The biggest aspect of this film that I enjoyed was the satire on society. In every place that Gulliver travels he either imposes his society on others or they impose on him. There are times when they try to coexist but it ultimately fails in the end. Overall the film is very well done indeed with perfect art design costuming and atmospheric direction by Sturridge the Glubbdubdrib section is brilliantly eerie. Ted Danson is nothing short of fantastic in a studied yet emotional performance. He has trouble with the English accent at times but the effects and ensemble acting overshadow it. Steenbergen is less memorable but still effective. The starstudded supporting cast impresses throughout especially to O'Toole's Lilliputian Emperor and Nicholas Lyndhurst's Clustril. The music is near perfect as well.Overall a decent outing by everyone involved and worth viewing again for those that may be hesitant to read the books.Grade  out of ".
