But rabbits survived and stayed there. Unfortunately one day the wall fell down. Rabbits had to abandon comfortable system. They moved to West Berlin and have been living there in a few colonies since then. They are still learning how to live in the free world same as we  the citizens of Eastern Europe.";

	schema:reviewBody "Krlik po berlinsku or Mauerhase or Rabbit  la Berlin is a GermanPolish coproduction from 7 years ago that brought writer and director Bartosz Konopka an Oscar nomination and his careerdefining film so far. I have a bit of a problem though with the category placement. First of all at 50 minutes this is not a short film anymore by IMDb standards or by mine. And you could also argue if it is really a documentary as almost all of the people depicted in here were actors as well and their responses were scripted in order to fit the general approach of the film. This general approach is talk about the GDR and its citizens but refer to them as rabbits instead of humans. Rabbits are people too right? Anyway I must say this was an interesting idea. Lets be honest the topic of the German split into two countries has been elaborated on sufficiently in film by now so it's always difficult to being something new to the table and you could really only do so by the approach you give the subject and not really by the contents itself. That's why I think Konopka brought us a really creative metaphorical take on the whole topic here maybe one that is not working entirely for 40 minutes so I'd have preferred this one to be maybe only 30 minutes long. But I am fine with this one being Oscarnominated even if it lost to Music by Prudence. I recommend checking it out. Just don't go in it expecting an animal documentary because with rabbits being shot this is the last thing you'll get. Thumbs up for Mauerhase and I hope Konopka still has enough creativity in him to top his achievement here at some point or at least repeat it. After all he's still a prolific filmmaker.".

	schema:reviewBody "It could be said that The Grand Dual is merely a vehicle for its lead star and whoever said it wouldn't necessarily be wrong but while this film doesn't feature a lot of originality it's also true that Italian cinema was based on repeating itself and the film definitely succeeds in providing an enjoyable slice of western action. The script was penned by Giallo supremo Ernesto Gastaldi The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh The Case of the Bloody Iris and that's not surprising as there are shades of Giallo throughout and the film works both as both as a violent action flick and an intriguing mystery film. The plot focuses on Sheriff Clayton as he becomes involved in the murder of a man socalled 'The Patriarch' through his association with the sly Philipp Wermeer. The film follows the pair as they make their way through bandits and bounty hunters and eventually end up in Saxon town where the sons of the Patriarch live. They've fingered Wermeer as the murderer of their father and naturally want him hanged but there's a twist to the identity of the murderer.Lee Van Cleef made his name with Sergio Leone and the masterpiece westerns 'For a Few Dollars More' and of course 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. This film is nowhere near the quality of those two but Van Cleef does well in his 'man in black role' which is a variation on the common western 'loner' theme which was made famous by the likes of Clint Eastwood and Django. Van Cleef's presence is felt throughout and he continually makes every scene his own. As you might expect the rest of the cast don't live up to the central star but even so The Grand Dual features a good ensemble cast and Peter O'Brien does especially well in his central role. The film features a lot of shootouts and chases on horseback which are always good to see but at times The Grand Dual puts too much focus on entertainment value and this can mean that the plot suffers. Even so the story plays out well and the final twist is a real standout as even though it's pretty obvious throughout  Gastaldi manages to throw in a twist just before it which makes the final twist come as a surprise. Overall this film isn't one of the great Spaghetti westerns  but it's a good one and comes recommended.".

The script was penned by Giallo supremo Ernesto Gastaldi The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh The Case of the Bloody Iris and that's not surprising as there are shades of Giallo throughout and the film works both as both as a violent action flick and an intriguing mystery film. The plot focuses on Sheriff Clayton as he becomes involved in the murder of a man socalled 'The Patriarch' through his association with the sly Philipp Wermeer. The film follows the pair as they make their way through bandits and bounty hunters and eventually end up in Saxon town where the sons of the Patriarch live. They've fingered Wermeer as the murderer of their father and naturally want him hanged but there's a twist to the identity of the murderer.Lee Van Cleef made his name with Sergio Leone and the masterpiece westerns 'For a Few Dollars More' and of course 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. This film is nowhere near the quality of those two but Van Cleef does well in his 'man in black role' which is a variation on the common western 'loner' theme which was made famous by the likes of Clint Eastwood and Django. Van Cleef's presence is felt throughout and he continually makes every scene his own. As you might expect the rest of the cast don't live up to the central star but even so The Grand Dual features a good ensemble cast and Peter O'Brien does especially well in his central role. The film features a lot of shootouts and chases on horseback which are always good to see but at times The Grand Dual puts too much focus on entertainment value and this can mean that the plot suffers. Even so the story plays out well and the final twist is a real standout as even though it's pretty obvious throughout  Gastaldi manages to throw in a twist just before it which makes the final twist come as a surprise. Overall this film isn't one of the great Spaghetti westerns  but it's a good one and comes recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "I read the other comments previous to mine and won't add to what's already been said except to say that I really thought there were some remarkable features here.For example there's the device of panning a shot from point A to point B. I'm sure there's a technical term for this kind of shot but I'm no professional and don't know what it is. But what seemed to me unusual was the very smooth automatic autotiming of the transition. Say looking at Clayton for a few long seconds then as if someone flips a switch the camera looks from Clayton to Wermeer traveling at a fixed rate of speed and upon arriving at Wermeer the camera proceeds to look at Wermeer for several long seconds.There were some strange anachronisms. The hair styles seemed very much out of 1970s era. Some of the strangest western headgear I've ever seen were in evidence. These chapeaux looked more like something from the Mardi Gras of New Orleans or the Carnivale of Milano than any Western story. Likewise the almost Gucciesquire look of the attire of Adam Saxon.Some very spaghetti western style overthetop grittiness. So in the opening scene the tall tall tall rock. Then we have Lee Van Cleef playing Clayton in a black black Western outfit in stark contrast to the white outfits of the Saxons. Then we have this strange contraption involving a gun boobytrap set up to blow up their carriage on opening the door near Silver Bell. I loved the game of checkers played with full shot glasses that the players drank whenever they jumped someone. Then the room Clayton stays in full of bullet holes in the walls. When he asks the proprietress if he could have another room she says there are three kinds of rooms there rooms with women in them rooms for cardgames and this one is for shooting bullets in. Nuff said right? I loved the final scene ... sort of a Spaghetti Western version of the Shootout at the OK Corral. The love of the grotesque  such as Adam Saxon's pockmarked face  he is sardonically called Pocksy at one point. The typical spaghetti western tongueincheek humor is present in such bits and throughout the movie.All in all if you like spaghetti westerns please do yourself a favor get this one on DVD and enjoy!

	schema:headline " Above Average Italian Oater Enhanced by Lee Van Cleef and A Terrific Orchestral Score";
	schema:reviewBody "Prolific Spaghetti western scenarist Ernesto Gastaldi penned the script for this Lee Van Cleef continental oater The Grand Duel directed with considerable competence by Giancarlo Santi. Although he didn't helm any Spaghetti westerns aside from Grand Duel on his own Santi served as Sergio Leone's assistant director on The Good the Bad and the Ugly 1966 and his masterpiece Once Upon A Time in the West 1968 as well as Giulio Petroni's assistant director on Death Rides A Horse1967. In short not only did Santi know how to stage gunfights but he also knew about the conventions of the Spaghetti western bullet ballet. Originally Santi was hired to direct Duck You Sucker but Rod Steiger's complaints prompted Leone to replace Santi. The Grand Duel ranks high up in the lower 25 Spaghetti westerns out of the best 100. Three things make it memorable. First this aboveaverage shoot'em up benefits largely from Lee Van Cleef's iconic gimleteyed presence. Second the mystery gradually unraveled presented in surrealistic flashbacksgenerates suspense and tension. Third Sergio Bardotti  Luis Enriquez Bacalov's unforgettable orchestral score that signals the tonal changes in the narrative.Roughly speaking the motives of the characters in The Grand Duel reverse the relationship between the old gunslinger Henry Fonda and youthful gunfighter Terence Hill in Tonino Valerii's My Name Is Nobody. Meanwhile Van Cleef's entrance in The Grand Duel imitates his striking introduction in Leone's For A Few Dollars More. In these Italian horse operas Van Cleef is presented initially as a commercial passenger. In The Grand Duel he rides in a stagecoach while he rides in a train with his head bowed beneath a black hat in For A Few Dollars More. In the latter film Van Cleef concealed his face behind a huge Bible when he asked the conductor about the train making an unscheduled stop. The conductor warns him they aren't going to stop where Van Cleef's frockcoated black hat clad character wants. Nevertheless Van Cleef tugs the emergency cord halting the train and disembarks to fetch his horse from the freight car.As The Grand Duel opens lawmen fire warning shots at the stagecoach that Sheriff Clayton Lee Van Cleef is riding in and refuse to let Big Horse Jess Han of Escape from Death Row enter Gila Bend. They explain that escaped killer Philipp Wermeer onetimeonly actor Peter O'Brien aka Alberto Dentice has holed up with a girl in town after breaking out of jail in Jefferson. The authorities have posted a 3thousand bounty on Vermeer's head. Nevertheless Clayton disembarks and strolls without any apparent concern past two lawmen and several bounty hunters to quench his thirst in Gila Bend. This introductory scene unfolds at a leisurely pace as it covers points such as where the bounty hunters are hidden and Clayton's imperturbability in the face of death. Clayton indicates the positions of all the bounty hunters to Vermeer. Later after our wrongly convicted hero eludes the bounty hunters during a furious horse chase. The villains kill his horse but he flags down a stagecoach. The entire scene resembles the scene from John Ford's Stagecoach when Ringo John Wayne who was afoot clambered inside the vehicle.The omniscient Lee Van Cleef hero dominates the action. The hookednosed veteran Hollywood heavy delivers a stern but seasoned performance as the worldlywise elder. Van Cleef smokes his signature curved pipe. Actually when we meet Clayton he is no longer the sheriff of Jefferson. He protested Philip Vermeer's conviction and the authorities stripped him of his badge. Earlier he had taken the Patriarch to court three times. Eventually as the best man with a gun in the entire state Clayton ushers in justice above the law. Anyway one of the Patriarch's sons Eli Saxon bald headed Marc Mazza of Moonraker accused Philipp Vermeer of killing the Patriarch Horst Frank in a dual role wearing whiskers a wealthy unscrupulous powerbroker hated by half of the state. Vermeer suspects that the Patriarch had his father shot in the back because he learned about the silver on Vermeer's land. Meanwhile Eli demands to know the identity of the man who killed his father. Clayton reminds Eli that the Patriarch was gunned down from behind and that Vermeer stood in front of them at the railway depot. Clearly Vermeer couldn't have killed the Patriarch.The vicious and degenerate Grand Duel villains qualify as challenging adversaries. David Horst Frank of Johnny Hamlet rules the Saxon clan while Eli serves as Saxon City's marshal and Adam Saxon Klaus Grunberg of Fire Ice and Dynamite runs the saloon. Grunberg plays Adam as a depraved homosexual who wears a vanillawhite suit fedora and constantly caresses a long scarf looped around his neck. The first time that we see Adam he guns down an old man that his henchmen have thrown out of the saloon. Later Adam massacres a wagon train with a machine gun and Brother David orders him to leave no eyewitnesses. David's words In a violent country he who seizes today controls tomorrow epitomizes his treachery.The Grand Duel plays out in three settings first in Gila Bend second at the isolated Silver Bells stagecoach station and third in Saxon City where a showdown occurs in the stock pens in traditional western style. Santi never lets the action malinger. He does a good job with the first largescale gunfight at the stagecoach station. The bounty vermin not only blowup the stagecoach but also shoot each other to increase their shares after Vermeer surrenders. The Saxon City shootout when Vermin pole vaults to safety is neat. The black  white night sequence that he stages during the Patriarch's killing has surrealistic quality. Meantime hardcore Lee Van Cleef fans won't want to miss The Grand Duel for its several shootouts as well as the twists and turns in Gastaldi's screenplay. Get the widescreen Wild East DVD it surpasses the fullframe public domain DVD or the foreign semiletterboxed version.".

	schema:headline " Don't worry ma'am I only kill nice people.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a great DVD set put out by St. Clair Vision that offers nine films appropriately titled Spaghetti Westerns and fairly oozing garlic oil and marinara. If you're only familiar with the Clint Eastwood 'Man With No Name' films you'll be intrigued and entertained by the offerings here among them The Grand Duel. Lee Van Cleef stars doing what he does best as a calm lawman on the outside with a seething vengeance on the inside. His character is a former marshal but you're never really sure about that until he produces a star and even then it's questionable.The only other Western I can think of that offers a homosexual character is Little Big Man and in that picture it was an Indian. Here one of the Saxon Brothers is an overtly limp wristed white suited desperado with a silk scarf for added effect. The fact that he's a ruthless gunman is almost beside the fact his pock marked face is worthy of a seamy horror flick.The three Saxon Brothers are out to avenge the death of their father and numerous flashback sequences that offer the darkened outline of the killer point to only one person and yet when Sheriff Clayton Van Cleef reveals it was himself it almost comes as a surprise. The Saxon's had fingered rival Philip Wermeer Peter O'Brien for the murder of the Patriarch Wermeer's own father in turn had been murdered over his ownership of a silver claim. Early in the story it appears that Clayton's quarry is Wermeer until they team up following the apparent killing of Wermeer by bounty hunters  neat twist! If you're used to the Eastwood style of the genre you might find the circus type acrobatics of The Grand Duel to be somewhat off base but it seems to be standard fare in some of the other films on the collection I mentioned earlier. Here it's Philip who entertains with some improbable flying maneuvers but it does make for highly innovative action sequences.Also pretty clever was the game of checkers at the Saxon City saloon. Played with glasses of whiskey it seemed to me that the winner would be the guy who got drunk first after all you had to down your shot after jumping the opposition.I would swear I'd heard portions of the musical score in another film it's so provocative you find yourself actually anticipating some it. There's a definite Ennio Marricone influence though here it's provided by Sergio Bardotti and Luis Bacalov. Quite definitely another reason to tune in.The Grand Duel is definitely one to sample coming out near the end of the Eurowest cycle. Be prepared for marshals in business suits and the not so subtle portrayal of a gay bad guy but also keep an eye out for the new patriarch David Saxon sporting the same dimple in the middle of his chin as the portrait of his father hanging on a wall. If that weren't enough I'd say the bartender at the Saxon saloon was one gay caballero too!".

	onyx:emotionText "There's a great DVD set put out by St. Clair Vision that offers nine films appropriately titled Spaghetti Westerns and fairly oozing garlic oil and marinara. If you're only familiar with the Clint Eastwood 'Man With No Name' films you'll be intrigued and entertained by the offerings here among them The Grand Duel. Lee Van Cleef stars doing what he does best as a calm lawman on the outside with a seething vengeance on the inside. His character is a former marshal but you're never really sure about that until he produces a star and even then it's questionable.The only other Western I can think of that offers a homosexual character is Little Big Man and in that picture it was an Indian. Here one of the Saxon Brothers is an overtly limp wristed white suited desperado with a silk scarf for added effect. The fact that he's a ruthless gunman is almost beside the fact his pock marked face is worthy of a seamy horror flick.The three Saxon Brothers are out to avenge the death of their father and numerous flashback sequences that offer the darkened outline of the killer point to only one person and yet when Sheriff Clayton Van Cleef reveals it was himself it almost comes as a surprise. The Saxon's had fingered rival Philip Wermeer Peter O'Brien for the murder of the Patriarch Wermeer's own father in turn had been murdered over his ownership of a silver claim. Early in the story it appears that Clayton's quarry is Wermeer until they team up following the apparent killing of Wermeer by bounty hunters  neat twist! If you're used to the Eastwood style of the genre you might find the circus type acrobatics of The Grand Duel to be somewhat off base but it seems to be standard fare in some of the other films on the collection I mentioned earlier. Here it's Philip who entertains with some improbable flying maneuvers but it does make for highly innovative action sequences.Also pretty clever was the game of checkers at the Saxon City saloon. Played with glasses of whiskey it seemed to me that the winner would be the guy who got drunk first after all you had to down your shot after jumping the opposition.I would swear I'd heard portions of the musical score in another film it's so provocative you find yourself actually anticipating some it. There's a definite Ennio Marricone influence though here it's provided by Sergio Bardotti and Luis Bacalov. Quite definitely another reason to tune in.The Grand Duel is definitely one to sample coming out near the end of the Eurowest cycle. Be prepared for marshals in business suits and the not so subtle portrayal of a gay bad guy but also keep an eye out for the new patriarch David Saxon sporting the same dimple in the middle of his chin as the portrait of his father hanging on a wall. If that weren't enough I'd say the bartender at the Saxon saloon was one gay caballero too!";

	schema:headline " Not so grand. Still it was an alright film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Never consider a gun empty and never think that Spaghetti Westerns ran out of idea bullets. It's never empty of a good story even if it's presented in a lousy matter. Yes this movie is deprived of historical accuracies strange anachronisms and filled with clichs like one kill shots but it's still worth watching if you like the genre. This film doesn't feature a lot of originality in it so it's somewhat empty. Director Giancarlo Santi create this film after years of being assistantdirector to Sergio Leone and Giulio Petroni. The Grand Duel might not live up to Sergio Leone's films but at least it's not the worst. There is a bit of pretentious and silliest in this film. The film starts out with an exsheriff name Clayton Lee Van Cleef arrived by stage coach to find out that an escape convict Phillip Vermeer Alberto Dentice AKA Peter O'Brien is hiding out in his town. He is wanted for murdering a local patriarch and even so persecuted by a group of bounty hunters paid by the patriarch's sons the Saxons. Clayton believes that Vermeer is innocent and wants to prove it. The action is wellexecuted but way too cheesy. There is a scene where Vermeer shot a man off a building where the man's body fell on a wagon that slingshot Vermeer over a building while doing a somersault shot another man from the other side of the room. Yes totally outlandish acrobatic feats. There are odd scenes where Vermeer seem dead and somehow these bounty hunters had no idea to check if he was really dead. Come on movie! Do you think we're that dumb? At less the elaborated striptease scene that he had to do didn't make it to any known final cut of the movie. I don't want to see his hairy nude body around. The only good part about the film is that film turn into a murder mystery. Lee Van Cleef has more a reason to be there and more to do. Half of the time his character seem bored and lazy. The final twist although a bit obvious is told in a series of flashbacks shot in desaturated heavily filtered colors. It's get really annoying as the colors change throughout the flashbacks. I would rather those scenes in black and white. It does looks better. The Saxon Brothers are particularly wellcast and my favorite characters in this film. There is David Saxon Horst Frank who plays both the patriarch and his oldest son a cunning knowing man with political ambitions who bides his time then the middle child Sheriff Eli Saxon Marc Mazza who is a simple and impatient man of action and then the youngest brother Adam Saxon Klaus Grnberg who steals the movie with his portrayal of a homosexual maniac who kills an entire community of Dutch immigrants just for fun in a scene so over the top it will leave you cringing. I love how he plays with his scarf all the time and his face rippled with zits. I love how nearly all the brothers wear white suits. I love how Adam putt on white gloves before executing a defenseless old man so that it doesn't dirty his hands. Very sinister. The camera angles and shots are just too close or too far away. I can barely see what it is going on. There are scenes with both of them talking to each other but the other man is not in the shot. I think the main reason why people might remember this movie is because of the score. Director Quentin Tarantino used a part of it for 2003's Kill Bill. This score is attributed to both Luis Bacalov and Sergio Bardotti but Bacalov sustains he wrote all compositions. According to O'Brien the music played over the end credits was written by the De Angelis brothers. Edda Dell Orso voice is Italy's greatest treasure what a voice! She is just amazing in all the work she has done with the great Ennio Morricone and Luis Bacalov. This piece of music in the film is so strong and primitive you can see the big blue sky and feel the scorching sun as sand grates against your pupils. Your eyes squint sweat trickles down your trigger hand the whooshing wind taunts your ears and your mind with the gravity of your own mortality. You stare down the would be killer. The music fits in with the final duel in the film. The movie can be found in anything do to it being in the public domain. I found my copy on 5 dollar bin at WalMart. The quality copies are below any acceptable standards. The audio is awful. Lot of cackle crackle noises. The dubbing to English is pretty odd in a way as they left in Italian and Croatian languages without subtitles. The film footage is full of scratches and blemishes. The 'bloody hand print' shot present in the US trailer is missing from most versions of the US copies. You can find the film on the internet if you want to. The movie has different titles in some recopies and prints out there. In the United States the film is known as Grand Duel Storm Rider the Loner and the Big Showdown. In the U.K it's known as Hell's Fighters. Plus to let you know Grand Duel is not Big Gundown like some critics say. I watched the Big Gundown version and it's not the same movie. So heads up about that. So check out the film if not there is a pretty cool game of Checkers you can play with glasses of whiskey that I have learned from the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Awesome spaghetti western with a Lee Van Cleef who never ever looked coolers in his life and arguably the greatest theme song ever composed for a film and that's something Quentin Tarantino probably agrees with as he also selected the song for the soundtrack of Kill Bill. Van Cleef plays former Sheriff Clayton and obviously he's the type of gunslinger whose eyes are never really closed when he lies asleep with his hat over his face and who spots the hideout of every potential enemy without even lifting his head. Riding along with a traveling stagecoach Clayton is on the trail of a young fugitive outlaw named Philippe Vermeer. Not for the 1.000 reward on his head like all the other bounty hunters they encounter along the way but to keep an eye on him as he's heading towards Saxon City to settle a personal vendetta. Saxon City is kept under the thumbs of the three rich and utterly corrupted Saxon brothers David Eli and Adam too bad none of them is named John and they falsely accused Philippe of killing their father at Jefferson train station. Although Philippe is innocent of that crime and wisely better stays away from Saxon City he nevertheless insists on returning to find and get even with the murderer of his own father. Sheriff Clayton just happens to be the only person who can help him with that. The Grand Duel has everything you could possible seek in a western outrageous shootouts invincible heroes and psychopathic villains especially Adam the youngest Saxon is oddly menacing compelling sub plots jawdropping moments of intensity magnificent decors and breathtaking exterior locations and  as said already  an impeccable soundtrack. Director Giancarlo Santi might not be the most prominent name in the field of classic Italian westerns but he obviously paid close attention to the films of the masters like Sergio Leone Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima. Admittedly I'm being a bit too generous and biased here but it's a brilliantly entertaining example of a sadly extinct cinematic genre.".

Would be alot of fun gibberish if everyone spoke what they actually said As for the movie bit. Yeah there's a bit of a twist to this movie . Some needless action though. Didn't we already have a machine gun in a certain Eastwood western. Horrible acting in that one part. Hey stop faking getting shot. Johnny Cage be thinking this is the part you fall down zzzzz for a 3 blu ray with 2 movies on it  probably an easier watch than Battlefield Earth and many other westerns for one single reason.

	schema:reviewBody "THE GRAND DUEL is a typical entry in the spagwest genre. With a script by Ernesto Gastaldi Italy's hardestworking scriptwriter of the period and direction from Giancarlo Santi who worked as assistant director on THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY it has brilliant credentials behind it as well as a cast of some of the genre's heaviest hitters. It could have quite easily been a classic and parts of it are  the haunting music and theme that plays repeatedly throughout the movie manages to outdo Morricone and is possibly my favourite spaghetti western score Tarantino must have liked it too because he used it in KILL BILL. However THE GRAND DUEL loses something because of its focus on outrageous comedy and the kind of bumbling antics that Bud Spencer became associated with. If it had stayed deadly serious throughout I imagine that this would be a much revered film today.Instead it's merely a quite good western sometimes very good sometimes awful. The stunt team is certainly spot on although I could have done without the seesaw bit at the beginning where a guy is propelled into the air like something out of a cartoon. The action scenes are well handled and the final duel even manages to approach the ending of THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY in terms of quality with superb accompanying music and decent camerawork. Essentially though what makes this more than watchable is the leading presence of Lee Van Cleef appearing exactly the same as he did in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and giving another stern performance with his acting for the most part in his eyes  hands down Van Cleef is my favourite spagwest actor and he hasn't disappointed me yet.Van Cleef is given some good support especially from the likes of regular German bad guy Horst Frank and newcomer Peter O'Brien who only acted in this one film before disappearing off the face of the earth he looks uncannily like Ray Lovelock in THE LIVING DEAD AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE. The big and bloated Jess Hahn is also around for comic relief although he's so badly dubbed that I dreaded him popping up on screen while Klaus Grunberg has a ball as a homosexual villain and Marc Mazza's bald head steals much of the film. Also present is Dominique Darel a very attractive leading lady who died at the tender age of 28 six years after this film was released. Italian cinema lost a true beauty with her passing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Grand Duel directed by Giancarlo Santi is a movie that failed to properly use it's star power and great score. Partial blame for that can be equally divided between the bad editing and annoying female lead. But the biggest and most crucial reason goes to the highly unsatisfying final showdown that fails to keep to the movie's name.The film stars Lee Van Cleef as a lawman named Clayton who is on the trails of Philipp Wermeer played by Alberto Dentice. Framed for the murder of a high profile person Wermeer is constantly chased by bounty hunters and only Clayton's timely intervention saves him from death and further sets him on a course to prove his innocence. From then on the usual bloodbaths begin as both Clayton and Wermeer make their way through hordes of bounty hunters hired guns and finally the vengeance minded sons of the man Wermeer allegedly killed. To his credit Santi shows great competence when dealing with the shootouts. The opening scenes are especially memorable as Dentice's character shows moves that would later become standard part in action movies. It's a shame only he couldn't be more creative during the final duel which was borderline ridiculous lacking in atmosphere and a proper location. Problems don't end with that though as seen through several moments the film could have used an extra month in postproduction. Scene to scene transition is shabby a good example of that happens shortly after the shootout at the inn in the beginning with the scene directly cutting into the chase between Wermeer and the bounty hunters spontaneously changing the music. Ruining the mood. Luis Bacalov made a great score for this film and it wasn't edited well enough in again as an example take the opening scene when Van Cleef's character is walking to the inn.On the good side we have Lee Van Cleef who is his usual Man In Black self delivering a great performance as Sheriff Clayton. The same thing can't be said about the rest of the cast though. Alberto Dentice is average at best but still tolerable. What really got to me was the completely useless and downright annoying female lead. Not only was she testing my patience with horrid dialogue but she was also completely devoid of any sort of characterization. Spaghetti westerns often lack decent female leads and The Grand Duel is a typical example of that.I felt disappointed with The Grand Duel because it could have been a good movie had it only been given more time for postproduction and a few minor changes to the script. But most of all I was disappointed because Santi failed to make a grand duel in The Grand Duel.".

Alberto Dentice plays Philipp Wermeer a man desperate to know the identity of the man who shot his father. Philipp himself is accused of murdering the evil Patriarch of a desert town and escapes from prison. Assisting Philipp is leathery former sheriff Clayton Lee Van Cleef who believes Philipp to be innocent. On the other side are the Patriarchs' angry sons one of whom David Horst Frank is a power hungry madman.Director Giancarlo Santi was Sergio Leones' assistant director on The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West and it's obvious that he learned all the right lessons. He gives The Grand Duel a very operatic feel enhanced in no small part by the majestic soundtrack composed by Luis Bacalov and Sergio Bardotti. It's a score good enough to compare favourably to the best work of Morricone. The widescreen photography is simply gorgeous. The story is well paced and entertaining no matter if the viewer figures things out before the climactic revelation or not. One very nice touch is the way that Santi shoots the flashback sequences in which Frank also plays the Patriarch in atmospheric black  white. The stunts are impressively acrobatic and the action is first rate. The final showdown of the title is over fairly quickly but that doesn't make it any less effective.Van Cleef displays a quiet cool as he always does and the rugged Dentice is engaging as the murder suspect. The performances across the board are quite hearty especially from the likes of Jess Hahn as Bighorse the stage driver and Antonio Casale as nefarious bounty hunter Hole. Klaus Grunbergs' effeminate performance as Adam Saxon a young man clearly not that happy at the thought of marriage to a woman is amusing.A solid example of the genre overall recommended to its devotees.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sadomania is the infamous Women in Prison flick by the king of ultra low budget exploitation films Jesus Franco Spain. He has made many immortal films like Love Letter of the Portuguese Nun nunsploitation 1977 and Bloody Moon ultragore 1981 and even though some of his films are worse and notsoambitious he definitely has a talent and is noteworthy film maker. His greatest masterpiece of the films I've managed to see is Awful Dr. Orlof 1962 the black and white horror classic with Howard Vernon. Sadomania is among his dirtiest films and not without a reason.The ridiculous plot has a newly wed young couple who is kidnapped during their journey as they drive their wedding car somewhere in Spain. They are taken to the nearby women prison led by sadistic lesbian warden the late Ajita Wilson and some sleazy governor and his wife and despite the fact that the prison girlswomen work hard there their real reason to be there is to satisfy these leaders' bottomless sexual desires and perversions. Poor women are raped and abused in the guaranteed Franco style but it all ends happily for the protagonists and evil and horny sadists meet their fate again Franco style.This film is okay if one happens to like these kind of guilty pleasures with huge amount of nudity and love making. The sleazeometer is taken as high as possibly when considered the fact that the head warden Wilson was originally born man but changed his sex to female and the close ups of this attractive black lady show that her hands and some parts of the body are definitely male and thus her attractiveness tones down a bit for hetero sexual man but still she is very sensual here albeit her role character is more than repulsive. The other actors are more or less amateurs but also talented ones. Beautiful females get naked a lot and that's the thing Franco has always been able to do. Perhaps every frame of the film once it gets going involves at least one naked human being usually female.The message of this film seems to be that of what hides under our civilized surface and what kind of animals we are deep inside. Franco uses plenty of segments without a dialogue and some symbolic scenes like the knifefighttothedeath scene which show and depict the wild beast psyche what hides inside every human being but in many cases unactive. Another thing is that the sadists in the film are totally insatiable and hungry for sex which is perhaps the strongest instinct in human nature and psyche. Sadomania shows us the faces of human nature we wouldn't necessarily want to face but as we think about the state of the world and what kind of things take place Franco's thoughts are more than true and serious. The fact that this film is mostly exploitation oriented doesn't mean that the film couldn't have any artistic merits and Franco definitely wants most of his films to be more than mere exploitation.Sadomania is noteworthy piece of Franco cinema and shot with his usual zooms and beautiful images of nature stained only by the presence of the film's ugly and evil protagonists. Sadomania has also some interesting elements in its soundtrack which is supposedly composed by the director himself. I give Sadomania 710 rating but that's only possible if one can watch these films and appreciate them despite their many filthy scenes and characters.".

Despite its low budget the film is visually impressive with some atmospheric cinematography by Juan Soler.In terms of plot it comes as no surprise to learn that the script was adapted from an unused Ilsa screenplay. There are many similarities between the Ilsa films and Sadomania. Here transsexual Ajita Wilson plays Magda Urtado the wicked warden of a prison from hell. Well a prison that contains nubile young women who all look like escapees from Hefner's Playboy Mansion. This is a cue for all sorts of softcore goingson.The film's tiny budget is obvious  some of the guards' weapons look like they've been sourced from the bargain bin of Toys R Us and the crocodile special effects are somewhat rubbery. On top of this the prison governor's car is somewhat shabby for a man in his position. However the film overcomes these trivial obstacles and proves entertaining even if some of the humour is unintentional.Sadomania even has an appearance by Franco himself as a homosexual brothel owner. As Franco was not keen on contact with a fellow man Ajita Wilson was asked to play his lover without wig and disguised by a moustache.7 out of 10. Not half as seedy as you'd imagine it to be. It could do better in the exploitation department but the cinematography really is rather good.".

If it's nudity your after then Sadomania is a dream come true I don't think I've ever seen another film with so much nudity in it just about every sequence has nudity of some sort. The violence is far more restrained with a few whippings a few fights a needle piercing a nipple  a few gunshot wounds but none of these are what I would call particularly graphic. The acting is as good as one would expect transsexual Ajita has a real screen presence  is pretty intimidating as the obligatory sadistic warden. Technically Sadomania is cheap very cheap.

	schema:headline " One of the Most Outrageous WIP Movies Ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "Sadomania 1981  out of 4Jess Franco put his hands in many genres but there's no question that he was the king of the WIP genre. His womeninprison films are some of the most outrageous out there and this here might very well be the most offensive which means it's a mustsee for fans of the genre. The story is pretty simple as newlyweds Olga Uta Koepke and Michael are making out on some private property which belongs to a local prison. The evil warden Ajita Wilson orders Olga to be held behind bars where she realizes all the lesbianism torture and other evils going on. SADOMANIA is simply put a sick deprived and downright outrageous film and all of this makes it one of the best of its type. If you're looking for a soft and easy Rrated prison drama then this here certainly isn't that. This film is perverted on just about every letter and I honestly don't think fiveseconds goes by without some woman being nude. The film has pretty much walltowall nudity as all of the women in prison are forced to be naked and even the prison warden and her guards are always in the nude. Those wanting flesh are going to get plenty of it here. There's also some rather fun violence including a game where women must run through a swamp to try avoid getting shot. The only problem are some fake looking alligators who are very hungry. The film even goes as far as to have a prostitution ring white slavery and most notorious of all is a dog who likes to have sex with the girls. Yes SADOMANIA is pretty much the sleazy exploitation trash that makes the genre work so well when it gets everything right. Sure the performances aren't the greatest although Wilson has her certain charm in full force. The film actually looks a lot more professional than the previous ones done by Franco and this includes good cinematography great lighting and very good editing. Another major plus is that it seems the budget allowed for a lot more naked ladies because these films usually have a limited number of girls but this one here has dozens available. Again if you're going to be easily offended or are afraid of the genre then it's best to stay away. Those wanting to see one of the best WIP films out there should jump right in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a fan of Jess Franco's bizarre style and a lover even of his trashier films and my personal opinion is that he has besides several very entertaining movies also created a few masterpieces such as the brilliant Paroxismus aka Venus In Furs of 1969 for example. It is however an undeniable fact that the 180 movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career also include a bunch of big time stinkers. Sadomania of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity.Sure the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time. The only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is generously spoken slightly amusing.After couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns wardens of a local prison camp. While the husband is banished from the island the wife is taken to the prison camp a place of torture and sexual humiliation reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted governor. The prisoners are of course entirely hot chicks most of them blondes the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles.The plot if one can call it that is extremely stupid of course but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway. The only interesting thing about Sadomania is the high level of exploitation even for a 'Women In Prison' film. There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality and some of the torture scenes are really nasty.It is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze however can still be so boring. The sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning but after the first 45 minutes I actually had a hard time not to fall asleep. It also makes me wonder why out of all pornstars Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson who was according to most sources a transsexual who had been born a man well maybe for exactly that reason. If you really want to watch this make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor. Don't expect to be highly entertained however it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring. I am a Jess Franco fan and I always will be but Sadomania is just bad. 210".

Check.Thank goodness Franco didn't go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of coprology and indeed coprophagy another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de Sade's tediously long and disgusting saga.I rather hoped that this film would fall into the 'so bad it's good' category. But even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dismal dialogue dreadful acting elusive plot and  just to put the tin hat on it  dubbing AND English subtitles a belt and braces approach missing from the women's costumes. The Alsation gave a very professional performance though.Of course I could be wrong about the de Sade angle. After all I failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the 'prison' was a transsexual. I must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in future.According to another reviewer the film was banned in the UK. Well it clearly isn't any more though I fancy that the nippleneedling scene was cut to satisfy the censors. On the DVD I watched it was only clearly visible on the Spanish trailer which in case you're wondering I watched to compare it with the English one.The DVD also features an interview with Jess Franco though you'll need better Spanish than mine to understand it. Unless I'm much mistaken it's neither dubbed nor subtitled. And it points out that the person sodomising the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised using a moustache. Kind of ironic given that she had had the requisite appendage surgically removed.".

After that it's business as usual as the clothes budget was so miniscule that Franco couldn't afford to have his performers wear much so everyone appears naked while a few set pieces that involve a woman being 'hunted' and various other sleazy goings on populate the rest of the movie. I actually managed to get myself a copy of the 'uncut' version which runs at a massive 102 minutes.

The films vary in quality but almost all clock in at the 7080 minute range meaning even the worst of them I'm looking at YOU Voodoo Passion aren't long enough to get boring.And then there's Sadomania. Why Franco and producer Julio Parra decided to pad this one out to an engorged Tolstoyesque 102 minutes I can't imagine. Happily the length is not entirely reliant on repetitive bumping and grinding but it is still a bit of a chore to sit through. However it's worth it to see Franco and star Ajita Wilson partake of a little simulated gay sex. I guess.".

Why Franco and producer Julio Parra decided to pad this one out to an engorged Tolstoyesque 102 minutes I can't imagine. Happily the length is not entirely reliant on repetitive bumping and grinding but it is still a bit of a chore to sit through. However it's worth it to see Franco and star Ajita Wilson partake of a little simulated gay sex. I guess.";

	schema:reviewBody "Though I love sleazy exploit cinema I haven't watched too many of Jess Franco's films. Reason being the handful that I have watched have been pretty lame. SADOMANIA is much of the same. A pretty prototypical WIP film with tons of fullfrontal nudity and a few notably sleazy scenes  but Franco has a way of making even these elements boring.A man and his wife accidentally trespass on the property of a women's prison. The husband is let go but the wife is detained. The typical female abuse at the hands of the female warden and guards and even a German Shepherd in the highlight scene of the film. There's some side stuff about some of the women being sold into prostitution but who cares? This one's all about the nekkid women...There's really very little in SADOMANIA that you haven't seen in other WIP films. The plot is just like every other entry Girl gets imprisoned girl gets abused girl eventually escapes. There IS an absolute ton of fullfrontal nudity and most of the women are quite hot so that's a plus. The aforementioned dogscene is interesting too and is worth an extra point in my book. Problem is these films would have really benefited from some hardcore sex and some stronger violence  elements that are noticeably lacking from most WIP entries. Diehard exploitWIP fans will probably want to give SADOMANIA a look the average film viewer will either be bored or offended...610".

	schema:reviewBody "With 'Sadomania' director Jess Franco has deftly created yet another cinematic masterpiece while at the same time he completely blows the lid off of the shadowy underworld of topless female slave camps. Not surprisingly this gem was completely ignored by the snooty snobs on the Oscar committee! The film also exposes just how easy it is to assemble a bevy of attractive young 'actresses' in the middle of nowhere and convince them to degrade themselves for an entire film. A young newlywed couple is honeymooning along a desolate rocky section of the Spanish coastline why?! when they are suddenly hijacked and taken prisoner by the sadistic warden of a local slave camp and her topless female armed guards. The husband is quickly released and ordered to never return oh O.K.! while his hot wife remains captive. She is placed with the other slaves and forced to crack rocks along the coast beneath the blazing sun and under the watchful eyes of the guards. Their uniforms consist of 'Daisy Duke' short shorts and sneakers. In fact there is not a bra in sight for the entire film. These poor wretches aren't even provided with some basic sunscreen! Enter the 'Governor' a man who lacks any morals nor apparently any blood flow to his penis. He and his warden like to kill prisoners for sport. One blond hottie soon gets in a fight with one of the guards and the warden orders that they fight to the death to settle their differences. The fight scene which follows is of such complexity that it clearly took seconds to choreograph. Blondie finally dispatches her adversary but her skill and body have caught the attention of the Governor. He has her brought to his home where he devises a perverted plan which will finally allow him to successfully pork his smokin' hot wife. Enter 'Panzer' the Wonder Pooch I just made that name up. Panzer is a large German Shepard with a fondness for hot blond slave chicks. As the Governor and his wife watch Panzer is set loose upon the naked and shackled slave chick. He dives into humping slave girl with gusto. Surprisingly Panzer chooses the missionary position over doggy style! This sick display of bestiality is enough to finally give the Governor a stiffy and he is able to successfully pork his wife to completion. Panzer later won the award for 'Best Dog on Blond Chick Sex Scene' at the Cannes de Alpo awards. Next the Governor's wife decides to sell slave girl to another slaver and she drives her to a local wharf to make the deal. Following the sale the evil slaver locks slave girl in the cargo hold of his boat and sets sail for.....who knows? As expected his own horniness soon gets the better of him and he begins raping slave girl. She spots his gun in his belt and sees an opportunity for escape. She uses her feminine charm to convince the slaver to unshackle her and when he does she quickly snatches the pistol from his belt. Now with the upper hand she displays a moment of sheer stupidity. She holds the gun a mere few inches from his face and upraised hands and orders him not to move. Of course he immediately swats the gun from her grasp and then proceeds to continue dry humping her into submission. The viewer is treated to the sight of his hairy ass rising and falling between her thighs. At this point my curiosity has been more than satisfied and I decide to extricate myself from this sucking vortex of suckiness. Sorry if you want to know how it all ends you'll have to waste an hour and a half of your own life. 5 stars given only for the wealth of gratuitous topless and full frontal nudity. Show less".

	schema:reviewBody "Sadomania is one of the sleaziest films Franco ever did.SPOILERSEnjoying a day in the sun young couple Olga Uta Koepke and Michael Angel Caballero take a wrong turn on a road and are immediately captured and sent to a nearby prison lead by the evil warden Magda Urtado Ajita Wilson and her staff. Michael is set free while Olga is detained and charged with trespassing. Thrown in with the other inmates all women she is forced to work in the local fields while Magda occasionally comes in and takes one away including selling Conito Andrea Cuzon to Governor Mendoza Antonio Mayans and his wife Loba Mendoza Gina Janssen as a sex toy. After hearing that the other inmates at the prison where also sold into slavery or prostitution rings from the prison Michael leads a small force to take over the prison and release the inmates trapped inside.The News This is perhaps one of the sleaziest and greatest entries in the WomeninPrison genre. This film simply rests on its sleazy laurels. The intent is perfectly clear with the flesh count being ridiculously high hotpants being the sole contribution from the wardrobe department and lesbianism coming into play whenever a scene runs out of ideas. All you need do is notice how any camera move goes out of its way to ogle a quick behind or pair of breasts before coming to the realization that this is film with only one thing on its mind. In this respect then it's a film which does exactly what you'd expect of it and therefore could be described as a perfect example of this kind of film. It also gives the WomeninPrison audience all the naked flesh lesbianism and sadism it could ever want and then some. This is brought out with some off the best punishment ever shown in this type of situation. It ranges from being locked in a cage like a wild animal to being hunted down in the swamp to the death and being sold into slavery and prostitution rings. The swampland scenes are its best ones as there's quite an amusing feel to see armed guards traipsing through the swamp gunning down nude inmates finally being subjected to the Warden's grin of approval as a lone crocodile chomps down on the inmate's lifeless body. The slavery and prostitution subplots offer up even more sleaze and torture and offer some really bizarre scenes. Since the Governor has become impotent his wife who will stop at nothing to help her husband through it allows for some really sleazy help. This includes getting it on with the prisoners herself allowing him to get it on with the prisoners and ultimately allowing their German Shepard to get it on with one of the prisoners which is quite disturbing in thought but really quite funny in execution. There really isn't much to it that will keep from bursting out in laughter but it's still a cruel thought. The film also has moments of genuine artistry such as the impressionistic imagery as Mendoza silently enters the room to take over from his wife in servicing Olga. There is an incredibly strong sense of feminism in the film for the way in which the male characters are weak and ineffectual their female superiors strong and capable. This is quite evident in the fact that all the male attempts to rescue the women fail and must resort to the women to get them out of trouble. Franco's direction continues to be plagued with relentless zooming and panning shots but overall is more coherent than a lot of his work. The message of this film seems to be that of what hides under our civilized surface and what kind of animals we are deep inside. Plenty of segments without dialog and some symbolic scenes like the knifefighttothedeath scene which show and depict the wild beast psyche that hides inside every human being but in many cases unactive are brought loud and clear to the forefront. Another example is the sadists in the film are totally insatiable and hungry for sex which is perhaps the strongest instinct in human nature and psyche. It shows us the faces of human nature we wouldn't necessarily want to face but as we think about the state of the world and what kind of things take place the thoughts are more than true and serious. There is also a couple of problems in the film. With tons of gorgeous naked blonde women on display throughout all of the girls look alike and there are so many of them it's hard to keep track of who's who and where they are. Worse still the camera work in here is a distracting mess Franco shoots one love scene mostly out of focus and another with an emphasis or an obliviousness to a giant zit on the woman's torso that is frighteningly unerotic. Perhaps most representative of the style is a long shot of a car driving off as seen from behind some trees. Instead of shooting through the branches the shot is directly into the branches thus obscuring the view of the car altogether. There is also a really distracting sequence where a toy pistol is standing in for the real thing in one key scene. Rather than attempt to hide this it is shot in tight closeup where it even can be seen expelling a few drops of water when fired. All these elements though don't distract from a severely twisted and exceptional sleaze epic.The Final Verdict A sleaze classic from Franco this is required viewing for those interested in seeing a master work his trade or those who are into the scene. It's got it all for everyone and indulges in everything possible.Rated UNNC17 Nudity several long graphic sex scenes bestiality Rape Graphic Violence and Language".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Snderin is a fascinating film encompassing a wide variety of modern techniques that were very modern for 1951. The flashbacks and voiceover narration were some of the most complex to date and coupled with other techniques such as the superimposition of a portrait over an actor's face this films reeks of the new bold postWar era.However the film was not just breaking ground in terms of its technical achievements and sophisticated use of cinematic devices it was also prepared to challenge taboos. Whilst the brief nude scene from the wonderful Hildegard Knef is unlikely to raise the eyebrow of anyone outside the United States in this day and age the film's ending featuring a euthanasia and suicide doubleact is still mildly shocking and it was this that resulted in censorship on the film's first release.Although a moral taboo the euthanasiasuicide is perfectly in keeping with the characters and their motives and is a fascinating scene to see in a German film so short a time after the enforcedeuthanasia practices of Hitler's insane regime.Beyond this Knef is as brilliant as usual providing the film with an impassioned narration. She is also as charming and beautiful as ever and tackled the challenging groundbreaking role with bravery and dignity. Her costars are equally proficient and the cinematography is crisp and captures many beautiful scenes a notable example being Mariana's long walk up the stairs carrying her limping beloved.As the previous reviewer notes there are some elements of the sturm und drang element present in this work but it doesn't fully conform to that genre. It really remoulds it to suit the newlyemerging world of postwar West Germany.The soundtrack though sombre does not sink into melodramatic. It heightens the mood especially of Marina's moments of despair throughout her short but tumultuous life.Ultimately this is a very strong film that deserves to be more widely known. Devotees of European cinema and Knef aficionados will be richly rewarded in particular. An overlooked gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Snderin or The Sinner or The Story of a Sinner is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1951 so this one has its 65th anniversary this year. Despite color films existing in Germany already a decade earlier this one here is a blackandwhite film. The runtime according to IMDb is 100 minutes but the one I saw was considerably shorter barely made it ast the 80minite mark but it also was without credits. Still there probably exist several versions of this film maybe also due to the then scandalous scenes. The director is Willi Forst and it is one of his most known works. His cowriters Marischka and Menzel worked on other pretty prestigious projects themselves during their long careers. Marischka was also a successful actor. But back to this one here. It caused lots of controversy back in the day because of the nudity depicted in here and it shows that it is so incomparable compared to today's standards in what we see as offensive or inappropriate. With all this controversy people almost forgot about the story. The main character is a prostitute so the nudity actually makes sense. She is played by Hildegard Knef in one of her careerdefining performances. Herman is played by Gustav Frhlich and he managed a successful transition from silent films to sound films. Both give decent performances overall I guess but I personally did not find either of the two really likable enough to deeply care for what happens to them. Besides Knef's constant voiceover narration 8sometimes pretty overthetop gets somewhat annoying at some point maybe halfway into the film that one loses even more interest in it. This is quite a pity as the first 3040 minutes were quite interesting and enjoyable when we learn who the characters are and what they are all about. It's also nice that the focus was really on 2 characters only and did not include any pointless additional material or references that would have been forgettable eventually anyway. But still because of the decline in quality and the weak ending I mean the final relatively unrealistic plot twist about who dies it's not love in my opinion it's giving up yourself for the other and I don't like it I just cannot give this movie a thumbsup or recommend checking it out. Quite a shame. If it had stayed the way it was early on my decision certainly would have looked different. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:headline " Madame DuBarry is star vehicle for Pola Negri";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Madame DuBarry 1919 it's easy to figure out why Pola Negri was such a huge star in the early days of film. This movie directed by Ernst Lubitsch demonstrated Ms. Negri's obvious talents to audiences of the day and was one of her greatest triumphs. Pola had starpower to the nth degree and she wasn't above flaunting it on screen or off. Her Madame DuBarry is both comical and in the second half sympathetic. Her heavy Polish accent may have doomed her to a middling career after the advent of talkies but she shined brightly during her heyday and Madame DuBarry is certainly a highpoint. Emil Jannings is also in the cast as a lecherous King Louis XV. The film itself strays far from historical accuracy but the narrative is at least coherent. In reality King Louis XV died 15 years before the beginning of the French Revolution and Madame DuBarry was long gone from Versailles by the time of the storming of the Bastille. She was an old woman of 50 when she was executed during the Reign of Terror. In this movie all these events happen nearly simultaneously with little concern for the truth. Despite those obvious flaws the gigantic mob scenes and the final shots of poor Pola being carted off to the guillotine are wellstaged and resonate even with modern viewers.Since this film was made in 1919 there are some frames that are quite shaky and some missing entirely especially near the end. For the most part however it's well preserved unlike nearly all the other silent films still in existence. Lubitsch who had a lengthy career in light comedies is able to apply his directorial magic to many of the early scenes and keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The seriousness of the material lends itself to a much more heavyhanded approach during the second half but it's still a worthy effort on the director's part. For a film done in 1919 it's quite an accomplishment for all involved.".

Negri and Jannings do well as Du Barry and Louis XV but this is no intimate drama so it lacks character development and depth.

So like a man!Negri is early in her career and far from the subtle actress she would later become.  She is so heavily made up that she is often rather grotesque.

There is a lot of posturing and it tries quite well to give us a history lesson  although it succeeds it is dullsville along the way.The lavish and elaborate art direction is worthy of award consideration. Don't seek this out unless you are a fan of the two leads the director or the subject matter.Note that same year Lubitsch would go mad and find his niche with the delightfully funnny OYSTER PRINCESS.

	schema:reviewBody "The Ernst Lubitsch touch as it would later be known was altogether littleknown back in 1919 and for the curious looking back into the director's repertoire Madame DuBarry is often seen a historical curiosity rather than a signpost to later greatness. It is my opinion however that this widelyregarded stance on Lubitsch's first major motion picture has just as much to do with the quality of prints available as it does with the feature's tendency to lean on drama more than comedy. Having recently viewed Eureka's newly released bluray featuring a crisp new print backed up by a dynamic score by William Axt it's clear that although the touch is notably lighter or darker than Lubitsch would employ in his films later on in his long career there remain many scenes during the film's first hour where the director plays with his characters and plot in a manner which explicitly seek to extract laughs rather than varying degrees of pathos. Writers Norbert Falk and Hanns Kraly tell the infamous story of Jeanne Becu her rise to power's easilyswayed side and in the end her ultimate fate at the hands of the Reign of Terror. Although they play loose and casually with the real events that the film is based upon the writers do well in keeping key points together whilst telling a compelling character drama. Historians may well cry humbug but the story is gripping amusing and enlightening in spite of its inaccuracies. Lubitsch himself directs the script's calling for epic moments of drama well though instils just enough humour and lightheartedness to break it up so as to not become overbearing. Lead star Pola Negri establishes herself in a seminal role here and often makes a lot out of very little. Also of note is Emil Jannings as King Louis XV Harry Liedtke as Armand De Foix and Reinhold Schnzel as Minister Choiseul who make scenes devoid of Negri as compelling as possible even though the ham can get a little chewy at times. This was my first time viewing Madame DuBarry so have no real reference point to other prints of the film other than having history with other silentera movies with some terrible public domain versions which never really do the films any justice and at times render them incomprehensible. It's for this reason that I thoroughly recommend viewing the film on Eureka's bluray if you have a means to do so. Not just because the image quality is outstanding but also largely in part for Axt's score which complements the onscreen action superbly. It might not be as light and airy as Lubitsch fans would hope for going this far back but there's still plenty here to enjoy and strikes a nice balance between lush historicalcostume drama and darkly amusing character piece.".

Well I gave away the real ending so I might as well talk about the movie now. It's about a French girl who becomes a mistress to royalty. In the days of the French Revolution that was not exactly a healthy way to make a living... I do want to say before I go on that I don't like looking at dead bodies and if that had been her actual head I wouldn't have gotten a copy. The acting is splendid all the way around.

Grapevine Video did a nice job transferring this to DVD...but warning on the box it states that the background music is Orchestra music...it is not...it is Organ music and not too bad either! Do I recommend this movie? YES!During the last years of the Romanov Dynasty the Semicircular Hall was also regularly used to show silent movies and slide shows. A square hole was punched through the wall on the right hand side of the doorway and a Pathe film projector installed. A portable screen was constructed. Movies were usually shown on Saturdays when the Imperial family would sit in front while the servants stood behind them to watch the show. While most films were educational  on nature subjects travel or WWI  comedies and thrillers were also shown. One of the most interesting programs was one which included a film on the life of Madame DuBarry during the French Revolution. The climax of the film was a chilling scene of Madame DuBarry's execution on the guillotine which the entire Imperial family watched without visible reaction. This scene took place just a few months before the Russian Revolution and was long remembered by people who saw it. After the exile of the family to Siberia the projector and a number of films were sent to entertain them in Tolbolsk.  quote from website httpwww.alexanderpalace.orgpalacesemicircular.html".

	schema:reviewBody "Madame DuBarry is a German film from 1919 and the fact that it will have its 100th anniversary 3 years from now tells you of course that it is a silent blackandwhite movie. At 80 minutes it is nowhere near the longest or shortest films from that era somewhere inbetween. The director is Ernst Lubitsch and the two lead actors are Pola Negri and Academy Award winner Emil Jannings a trio of big stars from back in the day and the supporting cast also includes many very successful and prolific actors. So there was certainly a nice possibility that this film could turn out well but for me it did not. The reason may be that I did not find this era in French history interesting at all and also that I am not the biggest fan of blackandwhite silent films. If you think differently about the days of Louis XV or the days of Lang Pabst and Murnau then you may have a great time watching this one. pay attention to how the original language of this film is German but of course this only refers to the intertitles as there is no spoken language in here as I already stated. Overall I felt the story was not compelling enough at all not even for a movie that stays easily under the 90minute mark so unless you belong to some of the groups I mentioned earlier I recommend you to watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vorstadtkrokodile 2 is the second of three movies based on Max von der Grn's novel and the 1977 original film. The director is just like for the first film Christian Ditter. He did not return for the third and final movie though. Ditter also wrote the film with Neil Ennever. he worked with him on previous projects as well. Ditter did the Wickie sequel in the past and a couple Trkisch fr Anfnger episodes and most recently he made a UK movie with Lily Collins and has another one with her and Dakota Johnson coming up. The producer duo are Lena Olbrich and Christian Becker who have already worked on several very wellknown German movies. I guess the first film was commercially successful enough so they decided to make another. Just like the first it runs for roughly 90 minutes. I personally would not say it is much worse than the first but this is mostly because the first one already wasn't particularly well done. Neither is this one here.You could probably say it is a bit more grown up than the last. Topics like first love kissing unemployment and economy fraud are included and also the action is a bit more severe like the explosion at the end. Sadly there is embarrassing fart humor again as well and none of the dialogbased jokes are witty. The younger cast is pretty much the same as in the first. And they start right away with some drama and action as they are on an adventure that includes an unstable wooden bridge. Also most of the adult cast return rapper Smudo Nora Tschirner and Maria Schrader are back on board and Esther Schweins and Tatort police detective Dietmar Br join the team. In the first part the main antagonists were a bunch of criminal young guns here it is a similar scenario only that the real crime boss is a grown up and surprisingly ? a possible love interest to the main character's mother. Also there is a bitchy superficial young woman who finally ends up as a friend to the gang. The main character is played by Nick Romeo Reimann. He switched from the Wilde Kerle movies to here and I don't see much acting talent in him. Most of the other kids played their parts better.Neither the drama nor the comedy or the adventure wowed me here. They tried so hard to make it relevant again. The first film was about tolerance and acceptance of disabilities. So they thought why not reuse some of the old aspects Krppel insults and include a stuttering kid to draw a parallel. Did not work out though. The music is not very good either. The main theme is fine the rest of the songs is forgettable to downright bad the Virginia Jetzt! one. Not recommended. Utter racket with no soul.".

	schema:headline " Not German Twiligt";
	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin I will have address the fact that this film has been compared to Twilight a lot in reviews. This is film has very little to do with Twilight. Just because a vampire film has teenagers and vampires in it does not make it a Twilight rip. There where romantic teen vampire flicks before Twilight The Lost Boys Near Dark. It's not an invention of Twilight.The plot revolves around three decadent and wealthy vampire girls. They move around in Berlin at night in search for blood and pleasure. Their leader LouiseNina Hoss is also looking for that special lady the one you want to spend your entire life together with. This special lady turns about to be dysfunctional youth criminal LenaKaroline Herfurth. Louise turns Lena into a vampire and introduces her to the life as a vampire a life Lena enjoys at first until she has to deal with the disturbing side effects.First I want to bring up the good things about this movie. The atmosphere is great and the cinematography in simple gorgeous. It's a real treat for the eye and we get lots of very slick and beautiful visuals. The most beautiful scene is Lena's transformation into a vampire when her inner beauty is set free. Another thing this movie does well is the portrait of vampire life. It often happens in modern vampire films that you get to much of the good side of vice versa but in best Interview with the Vampire style we get a balanced portrayal. Sure immortality is great you can party all night and never grow old and die but all the people you love will grow old and die while you stay the same. If you find a mortal that you really love you can't be with him because of risk you might kill him in the heat of the moment. This is portrayed very well through vampires Charlotte the very talented Jenny Ulrich and Nora the lovely Anna Fischer who are most well written and well acted characters in the film. Both of them have very heartbreaking scenes in the second half of the movie but I won't tell you more than that.Other than that the special effects are done well and the music is great. The soundtrack is filled with great songs that not only add to the atmosphere but works as a Greek chorus commenting on the plot and the feelings of the characters.Gansel's directing is outstanding. Following the show don't tell principle he allows his actors to often do the most emotional scenes without dialog. Instead the looks on the actors faces tells the emotional turmoil behind them. The effect is wonderful. One strange result however is that the word vampire is never mentioned. The movie is so good at making us understand that is does not have to.The negative parts on the other hand is the romance between Lena and Officer TomMax Riemelt I could buy that these people care for one another cause the film builds it up to that in a fine way but that they fall in love? No I don't buy that. It douse not feel like there is any hint at romance. As I said it's oblivious they could and should care for each other but a romance seemed to be forced in by the producers. The relationship between Lena and Tom is to undeveloped for that. Also without spoiling anything the ending was a bit rushed and could have lasted a little longer. It comes off as much weaker than the rest of the film. But it does not destroy the rest of the film. There is not much violence. Most of it is offscreen deaths and dead bloody bodies. There is a not graphic bite but there is also one very graphic scene where Charlotte takes paper cut to a new level. That will sure to satisfy the gore hounds and is the best death in a vampiremovie since the lawn gnomescene in Frostbitten. Wir sind die Nacht does not really add anything to the vampire mythology but has it's fair place within it. The vampires are beautiful but deadly as it should be. Don't ask for originality the only one you get is the fact that the girl vampires of the world have killed off all the vampire men but expect a nice and great looking thrill ride. Wir sind die Nacht also has a great rewatch value which is always a huge plus. The cinematography reflects the damaged characters. Just as they may appear glamorous they are really hurt inside.Torsten Breuer films the night scenes in vivid and spectacular color while the day scenes are shoot in a way that makes the light of the sun seem cold and the city of Berlin look dirty and not glamorous at all. When brought into light we see what how tragic these characters are. There are no villains just damaged people who needs love but that is denied from them. In 1979 Werner Herzog showed that Germany knew their vampires and in 2010 Dennis Gansel shows they still does.".

Wir Sind die Nacht is a pleasant vampire movie with action humor drama and romance. The beginning is a sort of tribute to Nosferatu and Dracula of Bram Stoker with the female vampires killing the passengers and crew of an airplane the same way Nosferatu and Dracula do with the crew of the ship that arrives at Wismar without any living soul.The plot is very well constructed and actually dramatic and mature on the contrary of most of the American films of the genre. The actresses are very beautiful and talented the cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and in the end I loved this film.

They race exotic cars in the city at night go shopping in a mall all for themselves dance in their club. Despite this life of opulence Lena isn't all that thrilled about consuming blood and killing people. She does enjoy the powers of a vampire super strength and the ability to defy gravity. But the cop doesn't give up and tries somewhat successfully to seduce her.This will lead to the cops getting on the trail of the vampire clan which was responsible for massacring some mobsters.We Are The Night is a great title for a vampire movie and the movie is also great. Unlike 95 of vampire movies in the last 15 years it's not offensive to fans of the genre. It's a real cool very stylish and erotic vampire movie full of fantastic actions scenes. This day and age it's harder and harder to impress with action scenes but this movie does it. And the vampires crawling walking and fighting on walls and ceilings looks excellent. The cast is outstanding. Nina Hoss' Louise in particular is very interesting she's mature but attractive and has something animalistic about her. Anna Fischer's Nora is innocent fun playful yet vicious. Jennifer Ulrich's Charlotte is distinguished and classy she likes to smoke using cigarette holders and read books but is very deadly when necessary. This movie features the nastiest paper cut ever. Direction is first rate and the locations in and around new and old Berlin are quite unique.But unfortunately We Are The Night has to take the moralistic turn 34 of the way into it. That's when the good guys catch up with the bad guys and you know the outcome. The editing cold have been better. The ending still is surprising and interesting but vampires have always been the more interesting and sympathetic characters than the regular and boring humans. This movie should turn into a franchise not sure how but fans of vampire movies deserve a We Are The Night II.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a film it's a nice one. As a genre  a modern vampire  flick it might easily deserve a full tenner. It's one of the most intelligent mature no pun intended on the ladies who have had about 300 years to ripe technically apt movies about the life of a vampire in the modern world. The story might be only soso but the solid actors the production values the direction and the overall classy look of the outcome more than compensates for the very slight shortcomings of the structure. Basically a lesbian love or lust story it never gets sappy or lame whether dealing with girlongirl or straight passion. It's quite different from American vamp flicks True Blood bares similarities in the overall mood especially those vamp flicks which pretend to be European. Wie sind die Nacht is a solid piece of good entertainment without most of the clichs of a traditional 'I suck your blood' romp. It's a vampire film which never once mentions the word 'vampire'. My only negative complaint would be the appearance of Charlotte the utterly gorgeous Jennifer Ulrich why do we always assume that a vampire sort of gets stuck to the fashion of the era heshe was actually young in? Look at Tom Cruise in The Vampire Chronicles the guy has been around for  what? 250 years? And he NEVER gets tired of ruffs laces and buckled shoes? Never once ventures to try out jeans fishnet shirts disco boots zoot suits  no?! I mean come on!  a vampire if anyone should be willing to always change its appearance for the sake of sheer boredom! Yet Charlotte who was made a vampire in 1923 never outgrows the Charleston dress even though she is a remarkably pretty dish. Hard to believe. But hey the ladies have killed off all the male vampires in the world so they may very well wear what ever they desire. Enjoyable!".

Wir sind die Nacht took its inspiration from Carmilla rather than Dacula which was a wise decision and it made the movie really interesting and enjoyable. Wir sind die Nacht has a top notch production value and performance by all the leading actresses. Initially it looked like Karoline Herfurth playing Lena took her inspiration from Lisbeth Slander but once she is bitten and becomes Vampire she transforms into this gorgeous young girl. The transition is so drastic that a person like me who have not seen her previously in any movie was completely stunned. Nino Hoss is powerful as the vampire leader and I saw her recently in The Woman in Berlin so it was shocking to see her in such urban movie. Jennifer Ulrich is gorgeous she literally looked like someone stole her from 1920s. Anna Fischer as vamp party girl brought her spunk to her spunky character. Max Riemelt is the hottest German actor alive darn he sizzles on screen. His chemistry with Karoline Herfurth made the small love story really interesting. We are the Night is one of the best Vampire movie I have seen in recent years its urban chic and filled with strong performances. I would love to see a sequel for sure as the ending was ambiguous.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I expected to watch another archetypal vampire movie perhaps not a vampireoriented romance Twilight franchise. And the result was quite charming spectacular scenes a decent cast of main characters a dark and seducing Berlin. The clich ending of the movie was saved by a smart scene with the cop saying farewell to his comrade. The soundtrack kept track of the plot and its a nice collection of classical tunes and electropop and techno tracks of the contemporary European scene. Taking into account these elements I can say that yes it was a satisfying one hour and a half that I regretted not watching in a cinema I preferred the Bluray home edition. But then I became concerned about why a promising and talented director like Dennis Gansel Die Welle would write and direct a typical Hollywoodstyle actionhorror movie. Then it came to me. Most probably Dennis Gansel wanted to make a social allegory disguised with the charming cape of vampires. The outcast girl Lena Karoline Herfurth is forced into a previous unknown world of luxury recklessness and excess by a covenant of three female vampires. Louise Nina Hoss sees in her the unfulfilled love of ages. But in the end they just try to escape boredom with their new toy Lena. Lena is seduced by the new horizon opened before her own eyes till she realizes that its all in vain after refusing the beautiful young cop Tom to see the beast that she became. The Allpowerful and Immortal Vampires are an image of the highsociety people living in a luxurious fenced environment recruiting unsuspected outsiders into their world just as they were in the past. I refuse to believe that such a talented director wouldn't have this in his mind while writing and directing this movie. But here is the major flaw of this movie for me if this was the scope of the movie he fails to convey this message to the viewers. If not well then he just made another Bladelike movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vampire films are ten a penny these days. But it's not all the same old crap over and over again. With vampire films I think you just need to find the right balance between emotional moments that humanise these monsters and those awesome cool moments. We Are The Night does pretty well in both departments even if it is in favour of action. The first scene had me absolutely hooked. The camera pans around an airplane where all the passengers and crew have been killed. Still alive are three attractive women that soon reveal themselves to be vampires. After a bit of fun they open the airplane door and dive out midair. From there we are introduced to Lena a young criminal that soon finds herself involved with the vampires. Unfortunately for them just before Lena is turned she catches the eye of a young policeman that's interested in her. Like all vampire films it starts by showing the luxurious excess. Clubbing drinking sex etc. But at the same time the film uses the character of Charlotte as an antidote to all this. She obviously suffers from depression. As the gang go out shopping she stares longingly at some baby shoes. She also stands in the sunlight causing herself great pain. This character encompasses the strongest emotions and counteracts the action nicely. We also have Louise. A lesbian vampire that is in love with Lena and feels jealous about Lena's crush on the young cop Tom. It shows that no longer how long you live for certain human emotions are unavoidable. Towards the end it goes for all out action. With SWAT teams prison breaks and a beautifully shot fight that has the vampires moving all over the walls. The music was also enjoyable but the amount of nightclub scenes did get tiring. Just one less could have made an improvement. We Are The Night is a string Vampire film with stunning locals and excellent pacing. It was great seeing these girls have fun in a woman only vampire world. Another great example of Gansel's talent.".

The film introduces some concepts that I've never seen in a vampire film such as when one of the young looking vampires visits her elderly dying daughter or when another gets shot and then pops the bullet out of her chest.

Because I prefer a group of beautiful women vampires than a vampire girl who befriends a young boy who is bullying victim. We Are The Night is about a trio of beautiful female vampires lead by Louise who is over 280 years old. Her two companions are the quiet Charlotte and the cheerful Nora. These female vampires are just as beautiful as they are deadly. Louise runs a nightclub and one night Louise sees at the nightclub a troubled young woman named Lena who does pickpocketing for a living. Louise believes Lena to be the love of her life that she is looking for. So Louise turns Lena into a vampire. Lena is initially shocked by this transformation but starts to enjoy her immortal life with the other three women. This life includes fast cars shopping and all night parties. But this immortal life comes at a price. Lena maintains her conscience and when the murderous lust for blood becomes too much for Lena all hell breaks lose. This film explores the consequences of immortality and also explores the idea of an all female society. In one scene in this movie Louise explains to Lena that only female vampires exist because the female vampires have killed all the male vampires because they were too arrogant and too stupid. So the female vampires have vowed not to turn any men into vampires so no man mortal or immortal tells us what to do. So if you like a film with beautiful female vampires than We Are The Night is the film for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Germans tried to create their own Vampire franchise with We are the Night with mixed results. Compared with any of the TWILIGHT movies this looks like a masterpiece but with really great movies like NOSFERATU in any of its version this is just a clichd movie with a few original ideas.The most interesting things are dialogs which based on my very limited German and subtitles seemed really smart. Another is that even when vampires are only women and there is a lot of lesbian innuendo the movie is far from exploitative. There is no feminine nudity no sexual scenes and a very PC moral message here nobody is happy to be a vampire. Even violence in the movie is more suggested than shown there are a few brief strong scenes  but mostly for the surprise effect  . Lena a minor delinquent is converted by Lena an old bored vampire looking for her great love. Louise has two other vampires girlfriends all living like Sex and the City in Berlin. An excess of glamour and luxury just to cover their empty lives. Lena is not very happy with her unwanted changes particularly because she has a certain interest in a policeman something forbidden by Louise for two reasons he does not want men and even less policemen. There is not much more happening. The first act is strong but after Lena conversion the second act looks extracted from SEX AND THE CITY. The drama could have been really interesting if we knew something about each woman but aside from a few dialogs and little back story about one of them the others are pretty much a mysteries nobody cares to solve. The third act is more action driven and it is very effective with just the necessary amount of special effects in order to get things realistic. In brief it is not a bad movie but considering it comes for the country that reinvented cinema and the vampire genre it is below expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of vampire films despite how the Twilight movies and numerous clones all but ruined the genre for me. So I had high hopes for this German movie about 3 female vampires who adopt a new girl into their all girls club. The opening sequence is quite spectacular the soundtrack an alluring mix of classical and techno all scenes are beautifully shot. Lena is a scruffy looking delinquent who we first see pickpocketing a Russian pimp then gets chased by a young cop who of course becomes unbelievably smitten by her and just manages to escape.Lena then wanders into a rave and catches the eye of Louise who's been searching for the special one for a very long time. After Louise bites her and she's given blood to drink she undergoes an incredible transformation from tomboyish rogue into a beautiful woman. She gets spoiled by everything money can buy fancy clothes expensive restaurants and a Lamborghini. Then after the allure of the wealthy night life full of partying and speeding around in expensive cars Lena quickly becomes unglued when the women kill some night guards where did she think their blood came from before they drank from the pretty glasses?. Eventually the police squad descends upon them and things aren't so fun anymore. The first half of the film is quite engaging seeing Lena's transformation and seduction into a lascivious lifestyle. I particularly liked Jennifer Ulrich who plays Charlotte by far the most beautiful and interesting actress in the film. I think the story would have been more interesting had they explored the vampires long history together more in depth and worked on more character development. Unfortunately the last half descends into sappy Twilight territory. The policeman who looks more like a prettyboyactor playing a cop than a real cop keeps popping up in the story and the ending is disappointingly weak. What's most disturbing is how the movie reminds me of one of those 1970's vampire movies where the lesbian element is merely a plot device intended only to tantalize but never seriously takes form. The female protagonist is lead astray by the beautiful lesbian vampire but of course gets rescued in the end by the dashing male hero and the big bad lesbian vamp gets vanquished and you pretty much see this predictable outcome way before the movie ends. The film makers had the chance to produce something unique but it ends without much bite.Jennifer Ulrich the great soundtrack and some stylish cinematography are the only reasons I'd rate it has high as a 510.".

You also have Louise the head of 3 attractive female vampires Charlotte a former silent movie star and Nora a young lively and hip raver girl. They led a luxury live with sports cars shopping trips to Paris sex and last but not least killing people and drinking there blood. Louise falls in love with Lena she wants here and makes a vampire out of here. The next morning Lena wakes up as vampire but the painful metamorphose is not over yet. However direct sunlight would burn here and she has no mirror image. The next night she goes out to find the thing who did this to here. She meets the 3 ladies. She realises that she has to stay with them and she is also now a being of the night. Lena falls into this luxury lifestyle but can not kill people and drink there blood. This occurs to conflicts with Louise. Also Lena falls in love with a young police man. Another conflict with Louise who is in love with here. Charlotte misses here former live and here husband and child and Nora just wants to have fun.All in all it is an O.K. movie I give a 610. Lets start with the good things. This no boring movie and you wonder how fast 100 minutes are gone. It is fast action lasting one with a great camera image and soundtrack. It deals with is it possible to find a love for eternity is an eternal live worthwhile or boring and is morally good kill people and drink there blood or better to consume there blood. What I like was that these vampires are evil they do drink human blood and live fast life. Not like Edward Cullen. The weakest point is it has thin plot but it is O.K however. I deals with a lot of things but only on the surface. The character development of its figures does not go fare enough. So do the conflicts which occur. Maybe I just want to much a fast action lasting movie with a great story deep characters and good intrainter personal conflicts. Like Avatar!!? but this is no vampire filmAnyway now I am into vampire movies. So I will watch Dracula Blade Nosferatu and more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers do not reveal major plot points or affect the integrity of the film. We Are the Night German Wir sind die Nacht is a 2010 German vampire horror film directed by Dennis Gansel. German language with English subtitles. Also available in English without subtitles. I'm a lover of all things horror and have recently warmed to German films which made this combo a must see for me. The film packs some powerful punches as it explores concepts like youth beauty depression selfharm suicide aging and the consequences of immortality along with Valerie Solanas' idea of an allfemale society. These themes are wrapped so snugly into the film that it's revelations are practically seamless. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to lovely but lonely Lena artfully played by Karoline Herfurth. She's a tough teen whose life is overshadowed by the cold despair hopelessness and pointlessness which often accompanies abject poverty. Her life is dominated by negative interactions with male authority figures in the police her parole officer and those she pickpockets on the streets. Her only reprieve from this desolation seems to come from escapism into the German underground. It is in one of these undergrounds where she meets Louise the head of a 3 person pack of attractive female vampires. One is Charlotte a breathtakingly beautiful former silent movie star who seems distant and removed from the world around her. The other is Nora a cute and perky. young hip raver girl with enough energy your head will spin just watching her as she parties her way from one scene to the next. Louise herself is a rather attractive and regal looking woman whose maker was killed by sunlight. Louise becomes consumed with the idea that somewhere out there her lost love and sole mate will be reincarnated and she will recognize her by looking deeply into her eyes. Incidentally this plays nicely off the concept that eyes are the windows of the sole. But how can one know for certain it's their lost love with only a glance? You can't and thus Louise turns each girl who might be her lost love but inevitably finds they are not the one and so continues her search. Even though there's an inevitability to each new partner not quite meeting Louse's expectations she does not discard them upon this revelation. Choosing instead to collect and keep them like living photos of whichever century she steals them from. They remain at her side as immortal cohorts in crime.Early on in the movie Louise shares the premise to their way of life with her freshly initiated young whelp Lena. All of the male vampires were murdered by the females for being too noisy too greedy and too stupid.Upon first glance that might make the viewer draw the conclusion that this film is about misandry and those evil feminists plotting to take over the world. On closer observation though it proceeds to carry a completely different message via multiple scenes in which the female vampires make any number of vacuous decisions equal to if not greater than their socalled inferior male counterparts. The takeaway of this film is a twofold message Men and women are equal in their more redemptive traits like selflessness kindness and compassion. Scattered throughout the movie are small breadcrumbs alluding to this such as a rather poignant moment in which Nora is intentionally cruel when a sweet young bellhop who likes her offers her a flower at the steps of their hotel. She tells him she'll have him fired if he dares ever speak to her again because she knows if she returns his affections it will lead to his death by her hands. Women are also equally capable of committing monumental acts of evil and cruelty such as when Louise taking on role of mother and lover dumps the vulnerable and ailing Lena at the feet of a human trafficker who intends to beat and rape her into submission.It's the sum of these small scenes which add up to the breathtakingly big revelation that the female vampires inevitable outcomes are due to their own shortcomings of greed carelessness and stupidity..the very all too human traits Louise earlier subscribed to as the reason for the downfall of their male counterparts. The ending in particular actually refutes any claims to be made for misandry both in the choices Lena makes for herself and the fate of the other vampires who have been subscribing to such misandry.Other interesting pointsThe original script for this film was written before Twilight but shelved for other projects until after Twilight came out. Due to the similarities between the original script and Twilight Gansel had Jan Berger rewrite the script now under the title Wir sind die Nacht. It's loosely based around Carmilla and sanitizes out most scenes involving a romance between Lena and a police officer in favor of a love story between women.Heiko Maile was inspired by the score of the film The Dark Knight and how it combined electronic music with orchestra and electric guitar. Maile used Au Clair De La Lune as Charlotte's theme. Peppered throughout the film are other outstanding musical scores. Among them IAMX's Nightlife and Wir sind die Nacht by Covenant. Well worth a purchase of the album for these two songs alone. Torsten Breuer's cinematography Shot for shot make this is a gorgeous film and a feast for the eyes. In a brilliant maneuver Breuer and Gansel manage to make the vampires nocturnal world of night wildly colorful and lush while simultaneously making daytime life seem cold bleak and colorless.I highly recommend joining these fun loving and endearing homicidal psychopaths for a bit as they send you on a dizzying romp of action gore and genuine drama.".

One is Charlotte a breathtakingly beautiful former silent movie star who seems distant and removed from the world around her. The other is Nora a cute and perky. young hip raver girl with enough energy your head will spin just watching her as she parties her way from one scene to the next. Louise herself is a rather attractive and regal looking woman whose maker was killed by sunlight. Louise becomes consumed with the idea that somewhere out there her lost love and sole mate will be reincarnated and she will recognize her by looking deeply into her eyes. Incidentally this plays nicely off the concept that eyes are the windows of the sole. But how can one know for certain it's their lost love with only a glance? You can't and thus Louise turns each girl who might be her lost love but inevitably finds they are not the one and so continues her search. Even though there's an inevitability to each new partner not quite meeting Louse's expectations she does not discard them upon this revelation. Choosing instead to collect and keep them like living photos of whichever century she steals them from. They remain at her side as immortal cohorts in crime.Early on in the movie Louise shares the premise to their way of life with her freshly initiated young whelp Lena. All of the male vampires were murdered by the females for being too noisy too greedy and too stupid.Upon first glance that might make the viewer draw the conclusion that this film is about misandry and those evil feminists plotting to take over the world. On closer observation though it proceeds to carry a completely different message via multiple scenes in which the female vampires make any number of vacuous decisions equal to if not greater than their socalled inferior male counterparts. The takeaway of this film is a twofold message Men and women are equal in their more redemptive traits like selflessness kindness and compassion. Scattered throughout the movie are small breadcrumbs alluding to this such as a rather poignant moment in which Nora is intentionally cruel when a sweet young bellhop who likes her offers her a flower at the steps of their hotel. She tells him she'll have him fired if he dares ever speak to her again because she knows if she returns his affections it will lead to his death by her hands. Women are also equally capable of committing monumental acts of evil and cruelty such as when Louise taking on role of mother and lover dumps the vulnerable and ailing Lena at the feet of a human trafficker who intends to beat and rape her into submission.It's the sum of these small scenes which add up to the breathtakingly big revelation that the female vampires inevitable outcomes are due to their own shortcomings of greed carelessness and stupidity..the very all too human traits Louise earlier subscribed to as the reason for the downfall of their male counterparts. The ending in particular actually refutes any claims to be made for misandry both in the choices Lena makes for herself and the fate of the other vampires who have been subscribing to such misandry.Other interesting pointsThe original script for this film was written before Twilight but shelved for other projects until after Twilight came out. Due to the similarities between the original script and Twilight Gansel had Jan Berger rewrite the script now under the title Wir sind die Nacht. It's loosely based around Carmilla and sanitizes out most scenes involving a romance between Lena and a police officer in favor of a love story between women.Heiko Maile was inspired by the score of the film The Dark Knight and how it combined electronic music with orchestra and electric guitar. Maile used Au Clair De La Lune as Charlotte's theme. Peppered throughout the film are other outstanding musical scores. Among them IAMX's Nightlife and Wir sind die Nacht by Covenant. Well worth a purchase of the album for these two songs alone. Torsten Breuer's cinematography Shot for shot make this is a gorgeous film and a feast for the eyes. In a brilliant maneuver Breuer and Gansel manage to make the vampires nocturnal world of night wildly colorful and lush while simultaneously making daytime life seem cold bleak and colorless.I highly recommend joining these fun loving and endearing homicidal psychopaths for a bit as they send you on a dizzying romp of action gore and genuine drama.";

The cover art for it suggested to me that this will be just another foreign vampire film with breasts and pretty faces all over it and not a near interesting story. I was wrong. This was actually a pretty decent film. It's about a beautiful vampire named Louise who's been spending eternity with her two beautiful cohorts looking for her soul mate. Nina Hoss as Louise very much reminded me of Lauren Hutton in Once Bitten as the Countess with her luscious long blonde locks and beautiful face. Louise is obsessed with finding her partner and it is implied that there was a time where she might have thought her cohorts Nora and Charlotte were her soul mates. Louise meets a troubled young girl named Lena and forces Lena against her will to become a vampire. Louise is convinced Lena is the partner she's been looking for.This vampire story might be more for a female audience. The story is mostly about being lovesick for someone who doesn't want you and all the chaos and jealousy it may ensue. Other than that it has most of what you would want or expect from a vampire story. There's violence there's action there's still that conflict between being powerful and immortal and being sad and alone. There's a lot of elements of fun in this film as you will see these women doing absolutely anything they want from speeding doing drugs having sex and shopping. Nora is a fun character because for an undead she is quite lively and energetic. Charlotte and her story is quite tragic and justifies her behavior once you get more involved in the film.I thought the story could have been better but there's plenty to like about this film from it's casting to it's imagery to it's playfulness.".

However  for not being transgendered himself the actor really gets the pain the frustration everything that is behind the feeling of not fitting in such a basic category system.I was also pleased with the development of other characters. In a love story a viewpoint and actually the whole life of someone's best friend can get easily overlooked and I like how they dealt with it.

Moved to tears not only because of the performances although they were extremely good but because...finally someone has come along and made a movie so brutally honest without apologies on a topic that so many people are ignorant about. And we all know what happens when people are ignorant. Ignorance leads to fear and fear leads to blind hatred. That ignorance fear and hatred is what kills our youth whether its from suicide or bashing.First part of the film reveals his daily routine as a trans gendered person hormone injections lifting weights measuring different areas of his body etc. He also keeps a live journal online where he connects with other trans gendered people in all stages of their transition. When Ine invites him out with her to a party you really get to see how awkward it is for Lukas. Even though the hormone treatments have done wonders with his outward appearance facial hair muscles deep voice etc. the one thing they haven't helped him get rid of are his breasts. Lukas wears some sort of chest binding vest but it still does not keep his bosom completely flat. This is why he layers his clothes crosses his arms over his chest never getting too close to anyoneanother words Lukas is always in a state of anxiety or paranoia afraid that someone will notice.The hunky charismatic Fabio is the one person Lukas wants to notice him but not for his upper appendages. Fabio is the epitome of a gay alpha male appearing to be confident in mind and body. He attracts the attention of both males and females and in some scenes in the movie you wonder if he is bi or if he dates women to make Lukas jealous you will see what I mean if you watch the film. Lukas is fascinated by Fabio a part of it could be first love a crush but I got the sense that Lukas views Fabio as the perfect male specimen. He is everything that Lukas wants to be perfect body and the confidence to go with it.But all is not as it seems.But one of the hardest lessons Lukas must learn is how can he expect someone to love and see the real him if he can't even tolerate his own self? There are so many interesting topics that are addressed in this movie but there were 2 that really fascinated me. One is during a scene where Lukas reluctantly goes with Ine to the beach because he finds out that Fabio is going. While everyone is stripped down to their swimming shorts or bikinis you feel Lukas's awkwardness as he sits fully clothed with his layered shirts. As he watches Fabio and some of the guys swimming Ine his best friend takes her bikini top off remember nude beaches are common in some other countries. Lukas points to Ine's breasts and starts explaining the breast removal process that he will eventually go through and Ine pushes his hand away and tells him to stop. She asks If you like boys why don't you just stay a woman? Lukas responds One has nothing to do with the other. Lukas is completely right. But Ine's question is one that confuses so many people in the world. There is a BIG difference between someone's gender and someone's sexuality but oftentimes they are thought to be one and the same. Gender is whether you are a male female or trans gender born with parts you don't identify with and wish to change such as in Lukas's case. Sexuality is your sexual preference what you are attracted to such as being straight gay bisexual etc. So even though Lukas was born female he identifies himself as male. He is in the process of physically becoming a male. Since he is attracted to men that would make him gay. His best friend is being hypocritical. Ine openly admits she is a lesbian. So for her to tell Lukas that he might as well stay female if he likes guys sort of makes no sense. I could see that being more of a comment that someone homophobic would say. Lukas could have turned her words back on her and say since you like women why don't you grow a penis?This leads me to the last point I want to make that the movie addresses. Once Lukas's secret is revealed I won't say how and why prejudice starts to rear its ugly head. Fabio turns into one of his greatest tormentors calling him a tranny flaunting other men and women around him as if to say he would date anyone other then him. Straight people are not the only ones that can be ignorant and prejudice towards trans gendered people. The homosexual community can be a trans gendered person's greatest nightmare. Why? Because ignorance breeds fear and fear breeds hate. Fabio really does care for Lukas. What holds him back is his lack of knowledge about trans gendered issues and the pressure of what others would think of him liking someone like Lukas. There is no denying Fabio's curiosity and once he lets go of worrying about what others may or may not think about him and Lukas he is then more willing to let go of his prejudices and learn more. And let me be clear Fabio is not as confident as Lukas thought he was. There are many reasons why but that is for you to find out!".

Lukas could have turned her words back on her and say since you like women why don't you grow a penis?This leads me to the last point I want to make that the movie addresses. Once Lukas's secret is revealed I won't say how and why prejudice starts to rear its ugly head. Fabio turns into one of his greatest tormentors calling him a tranny flaunting other men and women around him as if to say he would date anyone other then him. Straight people are not the only ones that can be ignorant and prejudice towards trans gendered people. The homosexual community can be a trans gendered person's greatest nightmare. Why? Because ignorance breeds fear and fear breeds hate. Fabio really does care for Lukas. What holds him back is his lack of knowledge about trans gendered issues and the pressure of what others would think of him liking someone like Lukas. There is no denying Fabio's curiosity and once he lets go of worrying about what others may or may not think about him and Lukas he is then more willing to let go of his prejudices and learn more. And let me be clear Fabio is not as confident as Lukas thought he was. There are many reasons why but that is for you to find out!";

	schema:reviewBody "Romeos....is a Carefree title....a Fun title. BUT buckle up your seatbelts and hold on tight....for the ride you're about to be taken on is often neither carefree nor fun. And why is that? Because over and over you'll be asking yourself HOW is this young guy...this Rick Okon from a little town in the Northeast fringes of Germany able to drag us inch by inch by inch into all his emotional turmoil Into his shyness...his physical discomfort...his fear of discovery...his beginnings of love? ....And while doing so with little more than his frequent armshugginghimself poses...his facial expressions...and those dark EYES. Well the answer is just something you'll have to figure out after the trip. For each of us it will have been different.But...forget the HOW we've just discussed. More important is the WHAT....for what we are being given here is a NearEqual to the Oscar winning Best Actor performance in 1999's Boys Don't Cry. That time Hilary Swank......this time a rising young German star. As the transgendering Lukas Okon takes us along on an important part of his journey through the swirling emotions of Hormone Replacement Therapy. And on to complete physical transformation from femaletomale. BUT....in this film unlike in others the end goal is to find a samesex Male  Male relationship. About which please note the following I can talk about this movie's particular sexchange circumstances in no better way than to paraphrase a quote by Reviewer nnenok from Slovenia here at IMDb.com The MOST IMPORTANT lesson this film gives to us and to any already TransgenderedtoMale person who is attracted to another Male IS ...Being attracted to a woman doesn't make you a manbut FEELING like a man does.  So...maybe Boys Don't Cry. Yet perhaps at times this film will bring you to the verge of doing so. For what we are seeing is a near breathtaking and heart wrenching performance I often recall James Dean about a young transgendering German who has fallen for a macho LoverBoy type. Yes yes Maximilian Befort as Fabio has a face and body which will keep your dreams HOT for days. A LoverBoy?...sure. A Sex Bomb?...you bet. In fact he's Sex on a Stick! YET despite acting selfcentered and forever off to the next conquest his scenes with Lukas are always exciting ones...giving us a gut feel for the Fever which is building up between these 2 a Fever always tempered by fear of Fabio discovering the hidden transgendered condition.As to Fabio's side of this relationship he is kept almost always offbalance and in a perplexed state Lukas being turnedon by Fabio...quickly followed by instances of Lukas shutting Fabio down. But still hard as it is to live with the emotional changes being thrown at him...Fabio does keep trying he keeps coming back for more. Leading to this Reviewer's opinion that Lukas has him hooked....letting the line out then pulling it backeven if not always aware he's doing so.And so I TRULY BELIEVE the ending lovemaking scene is giving us The Key to this relationship oh yes indeed it is. BUT that is not half as much as we are being told by the last few seconds shot wherein we are watching through the lens of a digital camera...and seeing A deliriously happy and completely transgendered Lukas taking off running into seaside sand dunes toward water's edge. Come on now....STOP AND THINK about it! That CAN'T be all we're seeing. Because you know what? SOMEONE is holding that camera....You wanna take any bets as to WHO?Enjoy this Special Movie....And thank you Sabine.PSAnd amidst all the turmoil...Thank Heavens for the occasional fun lightness and warm support given by terrific young actress Liv Lisa Fries as Ine...the BGirlFF of our Lukas during their growingup years.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly well done entertaining and accurate";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to be honest I put of watching this movie for several months for multiple reasons the most important one being the fact that I was unsure if I would even enjoy Romeos. I'm a gay transman myself and let's be honest there aren't a lot of movies who even deal with transgender issues yet alone the issues gay transmen face. At this point I'd like to point out that the right word to use in this context is either trans or transgender most of the reviews on here use the word trangendered which is incorrect in the same way a blind person is not blinded. Anyway moving on... I won't summarize the plot considering it is probably the weakest aspect of the movie. To put it simple It's a love story with lots of teenage drama. Instead I would like to emphasize that I was honestly impressed by Rick Okon's work as an actor. Sure I would have preferred an actor who's actually trans but I still thought Okon's performance was great. It was obvious that this was a role he really prepared for the awkward posture is something I always catch myself doing it was almost a perfect reenactment. Most other issues for transmen were also portrayed accurately constant fear of being found out people accusing you of being egoistic stupid questions having to fight for your rights etc. Yes some of it was different from my own experience but that's the thing there is not one universal experience. However two things were simply wrongoutdated. First transmen usually don't do their own shots in Germany but have it mostly done by a nurse but I suppose doing your own shots seems cooler. Second you can now change your gender marker without any surgeries but this might have not been the case when the movie was released. The only thing I truly disliked was the constant focus on sex. Yes the gay scene can be quite sexual but there are obviously lots of gay men who think differently. Oh and another things There are definitely better ways to flatten your chest. I was constantly frustrated because the binder Lukas used was just horrible. I suppose it would have erased some of the plot points but it was just frustrating to watch knowing that there are way better and more functioning alternatives. Overall I would definitely recommend this movie especially to someone who has little knowledge of transgender issues.".

Otherwise trivial shallow or fake.BadsExtremely clich rich concerning the following clichs overly macholike violent and homophobic Southern Europeans homophobic Southern Germans Bavarians overly mobbingful young people sexist clichs in young people i.e. all girls are nice and sweet all boys are nasty and mean gay man have sex with each other always and everywhere. All that is not reality and is tiresome to watch.All people in the movie look like super models or at least pretty attractive in a porno this would be good a normal movie is only rendered incredible. And yes The average German and also the average Southern European does not look like a model.Rich in cryptopornography i.e. something pretends to be nonpornographic though it's actually not e.g. if in a movie all people are superhot with no contentwise reason normally to be seen in most mainstream USAmerican movies.The movie shows the life of the roles as consisting only of party sex leisure time and a little bit of sleep fun porn although the protagonist lives in a dorm for civilian servicersnurses and I was curious what problems or difficulties may occur in his everyday work because of his transgernderness. That again are elements of cryptopornography and unrealism.Too much deus ex machina i.e. incredible coincidences that are used to support and promote the action also the clich elements are particularly used in this way what the authenticity of the whole movie suffers from.The precarious situations the protagonist runs into because of his transgenderness are also mostly incredible. Real transgenders are just much better in hiding their secrets.The end is no end the movie just breaks off and additionally in the best moment to make the missing of the end dramaturgically particularly meaningful a true contentwise meaning though for me is not recognizable.Gives a simplified misleading idea of transgenderness.GoodsThe residual of the accustomed girllike dealing with his female best friend from former times is well depicted by the protagonist.His reactions to the first positive responses from other boys to his new male appearance are well depicted by the protagonist.The female breasts of the boy look superextremely real.In general the actors do a good job.The basic ideas of the movie are super would be great if they would be realized more well in the future.The depictions of the actors are per se good and entertaining to see.Gives a simplified easy to understand idea of transgenderness.".

Real transgenders are just much better in hiding their secrets.The end is no end the movie just breaks off and additionally in the best moment to make the missing of the end dramaturgically particularly meaningful a true contentwise meaning though for me is not recognizable.Gives a simplified misleading idea of transgenderness.GoodsThe residual of the accustomed girllike dealing with his female best friend from former times is well depicted by the protagonist.His reactions to the first positive responses from other boys to his new male appearance are well depicted by the protagonist.The female breasts of the boy look superextremely real.In general the actors do a good job.The basic ideas of the movie are super would be great if they would be realized more well in the future.The depictions of the actors are per se good and entertaining to see.Gives a simplified easy to understand idea of transgenderness.";

The movie would have been better with someone else cast as Lukas or if Lukas had just been a gay man which is how he comes across anyway.In order to make sense of the character Okon was portraying I had to ignore all the transgender issues which simply were absurd for that entirely male character and I'm sure that's not what the director intended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much more. Romeos is a German movie from 5 years ago written and directed by Sabine Bernardi. No surprise to see she is back to directing mediocre television projects as her effort here for this film is fairly mediocre as well sometimes even bad. It runs for slightly over 90 minutes and takes us into the world of a young woman who intends to become a man via surgery. The first and possibly biggest problem is that the protagonist is played by a male and not at one single point in the film looks physically in a way like she has ever been a woman from the biological perspective. So yeah bad casting decision bad makeup etc. Your pick to make. Speaking about the story it is not more convincing either. They try so hard to make this a touching film but it never really gets past the attempt. The acting is not good on many occasions and the script isn't any better.The most known cast mate is certainly Liv Lisa Fries who has become a breakthrough artist in recent years and been the lead in her own comingofage films recently. But she cannot elevate the material here either. In my opinion this film has the same problem as so many other LBGTthemed movies. It is about a certain subject and as a consequence gets appreciated by audiences and awards bodies a lot more than it should. Audiences to whom this concerns should not just suck it up because it is about a certain subject but they also need to want a certain level of quality a level that is not reached here at any point. You cannot even blame the filmmakers for putting in so little effort if including a certain subject is already enough for a film to be liked. This is not a good film here and deserves none of the appreciation and popularity it received. I do not recommend checking it out. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen quite a few movies dealing with MTF trans but rarely one dealing with FTM. So needless to say I was very excited to see this. And sadly I couldn't be anymore disappointed. This film feels like a straight up gay male film thanks to a miscasting of epic proportions. While I'm sure Rick Okon is a fine actor he has no business playing the role he was cast in. There are so many real transgendered actors and actresses out there struggling to get work like the rest. And yet they are denied roles that were basically made for them! It seems very hypocritical for a film that wants to express the struggle of being transgendered. They literally slapped prosthetic breasts on a biological male and called it a day. There are no nuances in Rick Okon's performance to give us any clue that we are watching a preop transgendered male struggling with his identity. Not even seeing his breasts can fool me into thinking for the briefest second that he is trans.On top of that the story was sub par and resembles that of a cheap clich gay romance flick more than anything. And even that's a stretch as the romance here is so illogical and poorly done that I was actually irritated when they ended up together. His supposed love interest spends half the film taunting and teasing him and otherwise humiliating him in public. And then suddenly a light bulb goes off in his head and we're suddenly supposed to believe that he is instantly redeemed for his transgressions? I don't think so. It is incredibly fake lacking any semblance of heart.I also have many objections to the portrayal of trans life and emotions. As a trans person myself it saddened me to see how pertinent questions and issues were just glossed over to make the film a bit more easily digestible to hetero cis gendered viewers. In a perfect world this film would clue in cis gendered people as to what many trans people experience and struggle with and feel while making any fellow trans viewers feel a sense of solace and understanding. I don't expect every LGBT movie to be a Boy's Don't Cry style tragedy but I do expect portrayals of LGBT issues to be respected. This film has no respect and no interest in portraying any issues or struggles a real transman faces in the world. Lukas is clearly struggling with his transition and struggling to find his place in the world as a man who still has his female parts. Yet none of the film's events explore that. In fact the film contradicts itself by not exploring those feelings trading it in for cheap pseudoconflict in the form of the mild teasing and taunting he faces. He is striving to be as masculine as possible and yet the possible conflict he faces while being attracted to a man which is by the general consensus of society considered unmasculine is never really even brought up. It is a simple watered down portrayal of trans life that I would only recommend to cis heterosexuals that want to watch a film about a minority without having to ponder their own beliefs and the harsh realities many trans people face everyday.It's more or less a gay film with a lead who happens to be trans. It'd be a tad more excusable if there was at least some good drama or romance to be found. And there is not. This could have been an amazing film and instead it is cheap and even mildly offensive.".

One assumes that Mussolini's film critics were not completely objective. And yet this movie has excellent production values and a gripping story which despite its toolong running time still make it an appealing film for those of us who aren't Nazis.This film recounts the travails of Prussian king Friedrich the Second during the battle of Kunersdorf when his army were decimated by the Austrian forces. Just when defeat seemed certain Russia's czar Peter the Great sent reinforcements.When this movie was made the early victories of Hitler's army were long past ... and it was now starting to look as if Germany might lose the war after all. 'The Great King' was clearly made to inspire German audiences to continue the struggle against overwhelming odds. Despite its odious Nazi agenda this film is still eminently watchable. The battle scenes are impressive and Otto Gebhr gives a fine performance in the lead role as Friedrich. There's also a splendid turn by Paul Wegener as the leader of the Russian forces. Wegener was a stiff and very mannered actor but he manages to turn those traits to his advantage here.Gustav Frhlich best known for playing the idealistic youth in 'Metropolis' gives a splendidly earnest performance here as Sergeant Treskow who violates orders to give a crucial command to his men ... with disastrous results. The propaganda message here is that good Germans shouldn't take the initiative and think for themselves instead they should follow the orders of their wise leaders who know what's best for them.Even though this movie is Nazi agitprop the Third Reich imagery isn't crammed down our throats here the way it is in 'Triumph of the Will'. You can enjoy this movie without feeling any urge to goosestep. But the story could have been told more effectively in a shorter running time. I'll rate 'Der Grosse Konig' 6 points out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another Veit Harlan film seen on the big screen from a fine 35mm print and I am more and more in awe of Harlan's cinematic sensibilities. His films seem made for the cinema and he is an incredibly visceral visual artist. Of course it helps having one of the best cameramen of your time at your disposal. Bruno Mondi's cinematography produces many special moments that had me in their grip from the beginning. If he shows closeups of faces think Hollywood of the 30s combined with Eisenstein or makes one of his tremendous tracking shots equally effective in enhancing the dynamics on the battle field or zooming in on people. His superimpositions montagesequences or the combination of both like in the incredible closing images of Friedrich's eyes over a rotating windmill. Mondi can't go wrong and enhances every acting performance  he must have been loved by his actors. Harlan shows his prowess in the combination of different modes of realism and abstraction for example the Sovietstyle montagesequences and his vision is never less than monumental while never forgetting that it's the monumentality of moments of human emotions that are at the center of his art. Lots of the scenes are goosebump inducing similar to the finale of Jud S 1940 when Ferdinand Marian's character gets punished by the evil townsfolk.As for propaganda it clearly shows that the film had been made under the Nazi dictatorship in particular during some brief moments in speeches or dialog by Friedrich the Great. BUT  and this is a huge but  I would argue that the film includes much less warmongering than could be expected and one could hardly find a film as ambivalent or dialectical made with propaganda ideas in the political background coming from the Soviet Union England or the United States in 1942. The film as a whole is in my opinion not a piece of Nazi or militarist propaganda but could actually also be said to have an antiwar message. At least I think it lets the audience decide what to make of the events and the people depicted.What I took from it were horrible and cruel depictions of the evil that is war focusing on an embittered isolated and deeply flawed monarch who remains a controversial figure until the end. Otto Gebhr who played King Friedrich II. in over a dozen films from the early 20s onwards culminating in this film gives a masterful performance as the titular antihero who can only let his true emotions come into play when he is alone. Positioned between what he sees as the duty to his people and the duty to his ideals he loses everything he loves in the sacrifice for the Prussian nation. A tragic fate. In the end the film is an honest and depressing tale in the vein of old Shakespearean drama where good and evil right and wrong are often difficult to unravel.Surely one of the best films of the decade from one of the best directors. Pompous selfindulgent melodramatic operatic and therefore full of many condensed truths of life Harlan depicts male characters that are ambivalent to the core. Maybe a forerunner of sorts of masculine angstfueled films like Gibson's Braveheart The Great King is an existentialist depiction of historical events that directly relates to the times when it was made. In the middle of all the shenanigans Kristina Sderbaum Harlan's wife placed as a seemingly unnecessary addendum but clearly showing the torment women had to go through in a society that left little space for them. Much could and should be written about such a film and similar works but this is only a short commentary born out of the moment.For a glimpse into Harlan's aesthetics I recommend the first minutes of the film uploaded on YouTube where it isn't essential to understand the dialog.".

His films seem made for the cinema and he is an incredibly visceral visual artist. Of course it helps having one of the best cameramen of your time at your disposal. Bruno Mondi's cinematography produces many special moments that had me in their grip from the beginning. If he shows closeups of faces think Hollywood of the 30s combined with Eisenstein or makes one of his tremendous tracking shots equally effective in enhancing the dynamics on the battle field or zooming in on people. His superimpositions montagesequences or the combination of both like in the incredible closing images of Friedrich's eyes over a rotating windmill. Mondi can't go wrong and enhances every acting performance  he must have been loved by his actors. Harlan shows his prowess in the combination of different modes of realism and abstraction for example the Sovietstyle montagesequences and his vision is never less than monumental while never forgetting that it's the monumentality of moments of human emotions that are at the center of his art. Lots of the scenes are goosebump inducing similar to the finale of Jud S 1940 when Ferdinand Marian's character gets punished by the evil townsfolk.As for propaganda it clearly shows that the film had been made under the Nazi dictatorship in particular during some brief moments in speeches or dialog by Friedrich the Great. BUT  and this is a huge but  I would argue that the film includes much less warmongering than could be expected and one could hardly find a film as ambivalent or dialectical made with propaganda ideas in the political background coming from the Soviet Union England or the United States in 1942. The film as a whole is in my opinion not a piece of Nazi or militarist propaganda but could actually also be said to have an antiwar message. At least I think it lets the audience decide what to make of the events and the people depicted.What I took from it were horrible and cruel depictions of the evil that is war focusing on an embittered isolated and deeply flawed monarch who remains a controversial figure until the end. Otto Gebhr who played King Friedrich II. in over a dozen films from the early 20s onwards culminating in this film gives a masterful performance as the titular antihero who can only let his true emotions come into play when he is alone. Positioned between what he sees as the duty to his people and the duty to his ideals he loses everything he loves in the sacrifice for the Prussian nation. A tragic fate. In the end the film is an honest and depressing tale in the vein of old Shakespearean drama where good and evil right and wrong are often difficult to unravel.Surely one of the best films of the decade from one of the best directors. Pompous selfindulgent melodramatic operatic and therefore full of many condensed truths of life Harlan depicts male characters that are ambivalent to the core. Maybe a forerunner of sorts of masculine angstfueled films like Gibson's Braveheart The Great King is an existentialist depiction of historical events that directly relates to the times when it was made. In the middle of all the shenanigans Kristina Sderbaum Harlan's wife placed as a seemingly unnecessary addendum but clearly showing the torment women had to go through in a society that left little space for them. Much could and should be written about such a film and similar works but this is only a short commentary born out of the moment.For a glimpse into Harlan's aesthetics I recommend the first minutes of the film uploaded on YouTube where it isn't essential to understand the dialog.";

All those extras you see in one of those cast of thousands worthy of a DeMille film from Hollywood are soldiers taken from the front and probably grateful for the chance to play 18th century soldiers instead of being 20th century ones. The Great King is about Frederick the Great whose reign was probably the height of the Hohenzollern rule in Prussia. We should be exceedingly glad that Old Fritz as his subjects called him didn't have the resources of the modern German state that was united in 1871. As it was the man was a military genius who as we see in this film managed to snatch triumph out of defeat. For a while there it looked like the upstart state of Prussia was going to be overrun by all of Europe in the Seven Years War. Prussia's nominal ally was Great Britain but the British had a lot of far flung adventures in places like India and North America where we were fighting The French And Indian War.Otto Gebuhr who looked a whole lot like Frederick the Great made several film appearances as him. Kind of like character actor Frank McGlyn who was always being cast as Abraham Lincoln. The film was directed by Hitler's favorite director Veit Harlan who found a role for his wife Krista Soderburg as the wife of a Prussian soldier who learns too late the value of discipline. That was a message that Hitler wanted to send loud and clear to his audience have faith in me because I'm the 20th Century version of Old Fritz.Even the Nazis tell in the film that part of the reason for Prussia's triumph was some court intrigue in Russia after Empress Elizabeth died. That whole story is told in both the Elizabeth Bergner and Marlene Dietrich films on Catherine the Great. Suffice it to say in the film and in real life Frederick was shrewd enough to exploit matters.The Great King is a great film certainly the equal of any Hollywood production even if it is propaganda for the Third Reich.".

I did not really care for the political message this film was trying to send to the world and the German population.

	schema:reviewBody "The title of this German film translates as 'The Emperor of California' so  when I first heard of this movie  I thought it would be a dramatisation of the bizarre true story of Joshua Norton an eccentric beggar in 19thcentury San Francisco who declared himself Emperor of the United States. This movie turns out to be inspired by the life of a 19thcentury historic figure right enough but it isn't Joshua Norton it's John Sutter or Johann Suter the immigrant on whose land was discovered in 1848 the gold ore that led to the California Gold Rush.I'm extremely impressed with this film. It was clearly made on a large budget and several exterior sequences were actually filmed in California. Most of the cast give excellent welldirected performances.I'm slightly familiar with the life story of the real John Sutter. This German movie varies somewhat from the facts as does Hollywood constantly but much of the rewriting here actually serves to make Sutter's life story more plausible rather than less. It's not widely known that the real John Sutter's emigration to California was by an extremely circuitous path that took him through Hawaii and Alaska! But that trivium is ultimately irrelevant to the part of his story that really matters the gold strike and its aftermath so Sutter's peregrinations are wisely left out here.'The Kaiser of California' won Italy's Mussolini Cup as best foreign nonItalian film of the year. This means both good news and bad news. In order to win the Mussolini Cup a film had to be genuinely wellmade featuring excellent photography intelligent scripting superlative performances. This movie has those assets in abundance. The bad news is that  as you might guess from its patron's name  the Mussolini Cup was ideologically motivated. To be worthy of that award a film had to advance Fascist agenda. Which this movie indeed does. At every point where I spotted a deviation from historical truth in this movie the deviation was always to the benefit of totalitarian and antiAmerican politics.To begin with the real John Sutter or Johann Suter was Swiss. When he founded a homestead in Spanish California he cried it Nueva Helvetia New Switzerland. In this movie Johann Suter not John Sutter retains his German birthname throughout his life and he identifies himself as German not Swiss to his dying day. In the time of the Anschluss I can understand why Nazi filmmakers would want to blur the distinctions between Germans Austrians and Swiss.The basic nugget of historic truth is retained when gold is discovered on Suter's land his homestead is ruined by prospectors. Others make fortunes in the goldfields while Suter ends his days in poverty. The last reel of this film shows Suter shrieking on the steps of a U.S. courthouse cursing the American politicians who have cheated him. The truth is more complicated. In real life the U.S. Congress voted to compensate John Sutter very generously for the loss of his land ... but he died before the compensation could commence. Also John Sutter's reallife son August amassed a fortune in the boom economy triggered by the Gold Rush. The son selfishly refused to share the wealth with his father. In this film Johann Suter has a fictional son Rudolph who bears almost no resemblance to the real August Sutter. For that matter the name of Suter's wife has been arbitrarily changed from Nanette a Swiss name to the more Germansounding Anna.The injustices heaped upon Suter throughout this movie are presented as semiofficial actions of the United States government rather than what they actually were depredations caused by greedy individuals. This movie stands as solid evidence that as far back as 1936 the German film ministry were trying to stir up Germanlanguage audiences against the United States. 'The Kaiser of California' is antiU.S. proNazi propaganda but it manages to be fairly subtle in its intentions there is of course no explicit mention of Nazism nor Hitler. Since this movie achieves its intentions very proficiently I'll rate it 7 out of 10 with a footnote warning viewers to proceed with caution.P.S. In real life but not in this movie some of the prospectors in the California Gold Rush were from Australia. One of them noticed that the land near Sutter's Mill bore a strong resemblance to the land near his own homestead in Kalgoorlie Australia after panning out his claim in California this man went back home to Kalgoorlie and struck gold. Few Americans know that there was a gold rush in Australia immediately after the one in California. I hope that somebody will eventually make a film about the Kalgoorlie Gold Rush it's a fascinating story.".

This means both good news and bad news. In order to win the Mussolini Cup a film had to be genuinely wellmade featuring excellent photography intelligent scripting superlative performances. This movie has those assets in abundance. The bad news is that  as you might guess from its patron's name  the Mussolini Cup was ideologically motivated. To be worthy of that award a film had to advance Fascist agenda. Which this movie indeed does. At every point where I spotted a deviation from historical truth in this movie the deviation was always to the benefit of totalitarian and antiAmerican politics.To begin with the real John Sutter or Johann Suter was Swiss. When he founded a homestead in Spanish California he cried it Nueva Helvetia New Switzerland. In this movie Johann Suter not John Sutter retains his German birthname throughout his life and he identifies himself as German not Swiss to his dying day. In the time of the Anschluss I can understand why Nazi filmmakers would want to blur the distinctions between Germans Austrians and Swiss.The basic nugget of historic truth is retained when gold is discovered on Suter's land his homestead is ruined by prospectors. Others make fortunes in the goldfields while Suter ends his days in poverty. The last reel of this film shows Suter shrieking on the steps of a U.S. courthouse cursing the American politicians who have cheated him. The truth is more complicated. In real life the U.S. Congress voted to compensate John Sutter very generously for the loss of his land ... but he died before the compensation could commence. Also John Sutter's reallife son August amassed a fortune in the boom economy triggered by the Gold Rush. The son selfishly refused to share the wealth with his father. In this film Johann Suter has a fictional son Rudolph who bears almost no resemblance to the real August Sutter. For that matter the name of Suter's wife has been arbitrarily changed from Nanette a Swiss name to the more Germansounding Anna.The injustices heaped upon Suter throughout this movie are presented as semiofficial actions of the United States government rather than what they actually were depredations caused by greedy individuals. This movie stands as solid evidence that as far back as 1936 the German film ministry were trying to stir up Germanlanguage audiences against the United States. 'The Kaiser of California' is antiU.S. proNazi propaganda but it manages to be fairly subtle in its intentions there is of course no explicit mention of Nazism nor Hitler. Since this movie achieves its intentions very proficiently I'll rate it 7 out of 10 with a footnote warning viewers to proceed with caution.P.S. In real life but not in this movie some of the prospectors in the California Gold Rush were from Australia. One of them noticed that the land near Sutter's Mill bore a strong resemblance to the land near his own homestead in Kalgoorlie Australia after panning out his claim in California this man went back home to Kalgoorlie and struck gold. Few Americans know that there was a gold rush in Australia immediately after the one in California. I hope that somebody will eventually make a film about the Kalgoorlie Gold Rush it's a fascinating story.";

And the fact that it is in blackandwhite is also not too common compared to some fictitious propaganda films. But unfortunately these slightly under 90 minutes were not a fascinating watch for any reason neither acting nor writing or directing.

But I had a unique pang of excitement when Joe Louis was on screen. Max Schmeling is played by Henry Mask and the boxing matches were very similar to the real thing.

This occasionally transcends into flat acting that on a whole was plainly mediocre.

He has a blooming romance that comes across as a bit clich but in all this movie was interesting and very truthful to Schmelings actual life.

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie because it related the struggles of a man who was first a good sport and a gentleman. He was a boxer but not a violent person. While that might sound like a contradiction in his case he was a gentleman who had no hostility toward anyone unless they were in the boxing ring. Out of the ring he truly cared for people. He may actually have been a bit naive where it came to understanding the Nazi mindset. It almost cost him his life. He managed to be himself through the whole Nazi reign of terror and eventually became an asset to his homeland which was in great need of healing after the war.The proof that he cared for others is in the fact he rescued a father and sons during the kristallnacht event. And after his death he left his entire estate to charity. It was a sizable sum as he was a notable business man with CocaCola in Germany. His mansion is now the embassy for the Libyan ambassador.The acting was not on Oscar level but that didn't ruin the movie for me. I rented the DVD for the story and it did a good job of delivering that. As someone with ancestry from Germany I take heart in the fact there were many Germans who did not support the Nazis. They are given very little notice which is to me most unfair. My ancestors came to America in 1732 the sons married all German descent wives until my father married my Irish mother in 1945. So I have a great deal of German background.I will confess it was the title that caught my eye at the rental place. I wanted to learn what this movie had to say about a man who became a hero to his homeland.There was so much turmoil during Max's life. It pleases me to learn he became successful after the war. He was a thoughtful and generous man known to help others. He stayed friendly toward Joe Louis and even arranged meetings and later helped Joe get a respectful burial.Max's clean life style and generosity toward others paid well. He lived to be a ripe old 99.I rated this movie a 7 not due to the acting it wasn't as bad as some suggest but rather because it did a good job of telling the story of a man who remained true to self and did not bend to those who he knew were wrong.".

I rented the DVD for the story and it did a good job of delivering that. As someone with ancestry from Germany I take heart in the fact there were many Germans who did not support the Nazis. They are given very little notice which is to me most unfair. My ancestors came to America in 1732 the sons married all German descent wives until my father married my Irish mother in 1945. So I have a great deal of German background.I will confess it was the title that caught my eye at the rental place. I wanted to learn what this movie had to say about a man who became a hero to his homeland.There was so much turmoil during Max's life. It pleases me to learn he became successful after the war. He was a thoughtful and generous man known to help others. He stayed friendly toward Joe Louis and even arranged meetings and later helped Joe get a respectful burial.Max's clean life style and generosity toward others paid well. He lived to be a ripe old 99.I rated this movie a 7 not due to the acting it wasn't as bad as some suggest but rather because it did a good job of telling the story of a man who remained true to self and did not bend to those who he knew were wrong.";

	schema:reviewBody "Would this be the first real film that Uwe Boll has made? His first work that critics will take serious and that will bestow upon him the glory and acclaim that he as Boll keeps saying deserves? Perhaps even his first good movie? Well no miracles don't come so quick or cheap. Making film is like any other sport you can only learn to the limit of your potential. Eventually you have to acknowledge that you'll never make it into the big league that you don't have it in you and will spend your boxing days in the amateur league. Pardon my French but there's just no way to turn manure into gold. But let's not loose too many words on the German Ed Wood enough bile and vitriol has run down that creek already.Max Schmeling is the Mohammed Ali of German boxing a sporting legend and often fingered as one of the few German celebrities that stayed decent in the times of Adolf Hitler and the NSRegime he refused to rat out neither against his Jewish manager nor his nonAryan wife and retained a friendship with the colored boxer Joe Louis. He was a heavy weight world champion used as an icon was eventually discarded by the propaganda machine sent to the front as gun fodder when he outgrew his use and remained a popular figure in the German media until his death in 2005 at the respectable age of 99.We may never find out why Uwe Boll saw himself the man to make a movie about this iconic figure  we can only speculate that it was because he once was a semiprofessional boxer himself and used to beat his critics to a pulp in boxing matches. Nor will we ever find out why nobody prevented him from doing so then again that's Germany for you. The American reader may imagine that the makers of Epic Movie undeniably the unfunniest spooffilm in history having a go at a Cassius Clay  Mohammed Ali biopic and than imagine the public outrage among moviefans and boxingaficionados. Unfortunately there was no such outrage among the complaisant German citizens and nobody stopped Boll from producing this film.It's really not so different from any other Uwe Boll movie it's shoddily produced sweats incompetence from every pore  yes it's like gleefully watching a duo of drunks performing the Wilhelm Tell routine. Where other directors may try out new angles or approaches Boll shoots straight as an arrow telling the story from A to Z like a 3rd Grader writing an essay on how I spent my summer.Let's talk about the acting. Well there is preciously little. Protagonist Henry Maske himself a former champion turned socialite is neither a trained actor nor does he have much natural talent. Seeing a wounded Schmeling  Maske lying in a sickbay asking for a glass of water in his broad Saxony accent his first line is enough to animate the audience to some mischievous giggle. A block of wood has more charisma and skill and so we have to watch Maske stumble from scene to scene always on the lookout for the camera as if asking for aid from the director which never came. To his credit Boll was clever enough never to let his star recite more than three or four sentences in one go. Just imagine a young Arnold Schwarzenegger  no not the Shakespearean presentation of Conan the Barbarian or Terminator but rather Hercules in New York and the Streets of San Francisco episode Dead Lift.To give credit where credit is due Heino Ferch best known for playing Albert Speer in 2002s Downfall  Der Untergang gives a solid performance playing Schmelings trainer Max Machon. The rest of the cast the people playing the fighters Joe Louis and Richard Vogt are all reallife boxers who have as much skill and talent as Maske  I'm talking acting not boxing. The other actors have been assembled from German television and generally if they were working in Hollywood would qualify for nonspeaking roles only or perhaps a Quentin Tarantino film.As an exboxer and working with exboxing champions one could have hoped that at least the fightscenes would catch a glimpse of magic. They are invariably ruined by the director's general inability. Take a look at the boxing matches in films like Rocky or Raging Bull  they are everything that the fights in Schmeling aren't. To give due credit the fights are choreographed decently but the energy and drama isn't half of what Boll must have 'envisioned'.Boll has one trait that is considered very typical German no matter what he does he does it with the utter seriousness. Every scene every edit every nuance is a desperate cry for being taken serious as a filmmaker. The cries generally remain unanswered.For anybody interested in the story of Max Schmeling and Joe Louis I recommend the 2002 film Joe and Max which is  despite featuring Till Schweiger the acting equivalent to director Boll  the infinitely better film.I'll give it three stars out of ten one for Heino Ferch one for the memory of Max Schmeling and one out of pity.".

I am not a fan of English dubbed but i tough it was rather OK in this the voices didn't bother me too much. I come from a french province so i am used to french dubbing but not English ones. Anyway yes the acting was soso but not that bad. I could get into the movie. I think his boxing years where pretty well done the fights whee numerous and entertaining i was actually surprised. I think the war segments and how the Nazis saw him could had been way better done but then again it was not the point of the movie per say.Overall i am surprised... its a decent movie even tough its made to by Boll. Got to give credit where its due I'm sure if the movie would had been dubbed in french i would had even more fun watching it. There is nothing spectacular but the movie don't feel too cheap or whatever and i didn't knew Max Schmelling at all so now i want to look him up on wikipedia.So yeah i liked the movie. Will i keep it or pawnshop it? I dunno yet it was way better than expected.".

He was world heavyweight champion between 1930 and 1932 and will be making himself the first European heavyweight champion of the world. On June 12 1930 after beating the American Jack Sharkey.

During the rematch organized on 22 June 1938 Louis wins by technical knockout in the 1st round. Max Schmeling later said After this defeat I no longer existed for Hitler my name had disappeared from the newspapers. Schmeling had then become the shame of Nazi Germany and Hitler felt humiliated by this defeat in the face of a black man repudiating him and sending him to battle on the front where he would do everything possible to survive.

So many will probably not be too amused to hear that Uwe Boll is the director who made this film. However I have to say I was very positively surprised by the outcome. The fact that Henry Maske one of Germany's greatest boxers of all time himself played Schmeling did not hurt the film at all even if Maske had no real acting experience. A brave choice and a successful one. Maske was up to 15 years older than Schmeling when he played him in the film but also this is not a problem at all. Also all the other boxers in the film with ring action are played by professional boxers such as Artur Abraham.As it is been so long since Schmeling's peak people today know hardly nothing about him. A shame. And this film educates us on an athlete who does not deserve to be forgotten. For example that his name as a fighter was Black Uhlan of the Rhine. The film plays at wartime but it's really much more about Schmeling's career than about politics although we of course find out about Schmeling's attitude towards the Nazis who glorified him after he bet the Negro Louis and forgot him after he lost to Louis. It's interesting to watch Schmeling's struggles as he still was not fully accepted as a champion due to the way he won his first big fight an illegal punch by his opponent. Only knockouts or really long fights counted as worthy back in the day. Another big part of the film is about Schmeling's longlasting relationship with actress Anny Ondra.The most interesting way to watch this film is obviously if you don't know anything about the way Schmeling's big fights ended especially those against Louis but it's equally a great watch for those with an interest in the world of boxing. Certainly recommended. I have not seen too much from Boll but this is certainly a pretty good movie possibly his best.".

While searching for a parking space in the jampacked lot Della notices an old car taking up two spaces. Frustrated and annoyed she decides to leave a paper message on the windshield of the old car writing Hey Jerk. Two parking spaces. How selfish can you be? After the mall closes Della's car is held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  Chuckie Huey Vingh and Toms. When the security guard of the mall attempts to protect Della he is shot and killed by Chuckie. Della tries to escape from the criminals in her truck but the gang chases her.

She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.After she leaves the mall she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded and insult them verbally? I don't mean after an attack had already started because then of course it's completely normal for someone to fight back. But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level. No woman would do that unless she 1 had a weapon 2 has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close and so is relatively safe from harm or 3 the attackers are so young and weak looking that she's pretty sure she can take them. None of that applied in this situation so she was just acting like someone that's asking to get raped or mugged. And by the way when the security guard approached as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger why wouldn't she immediately either run towards him for help or scream?? When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head she drives into a deserted part of town and crashes. She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car but she should've ran.I didn't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie because I loathe people who do that in their reviews but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it.Why would she carry a loud Red Toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? When she does get caught one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox. First she resists then eventually opens it. And takes out a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie. When asked to open the box she's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she didn't open it in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touchpushopenmanipulate and once that hero refuses to open it the enemy grabs that device only to have that device automatically dispense a chemicalshoot him in the facerender him unconscious which was the hero's plan all along. It feels like that's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.Throughout the rest of the movie basically what you see is this suburban house wife sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.When she was running away how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude. She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.Finally this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs' perspective she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier and so they felt they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said they could've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from no one but her had seen them anyway and she probably didn't get the license plate. Even if these possibilities wouldn't work in their favor how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?".

This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted.The story details DellaKim Basingeris just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger the acting is madeforTV bad. Hell this pseudo thriller is madeforTV bad. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs1 Caucasian 1 Hispanic 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman. Don't you just love America?is laughable to a fault. The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. I only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else. Anybody else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this flick. You don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you? Of course not. You were warned.".

Not the worse despite being engulfed by negatives but there's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm but compact and unbalanced latenight survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material taken from a short story along with the very variable performances. The flimsy script was poorly thoughtout which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events. As for the bunch of stereotypical goons led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon terrorizing Basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless. Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand don't ask me why? knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up. Basinger's performance is stoutlike but doesn't craft much empathy. Craig Sheffer shows up as her hotheaded husband. Strangely I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing. Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.Susan Montford's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy as it pretty much chugs along. I liked the opening credits though with its hauntingly sullen score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photography.No great shakes. Doesn't ask much of your time but I wouldn't care to see it again. However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen.".

All she has is a toolbox. was said on the DVD's back you would think that it was carefully planned this movie and cleverly made but it is not The ending was just awful very straight forward and pointless too. The acting is either average or below average maybe even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. The Special Effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever. There is not much gore or bloody violence not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing yet really its not even worth looking for I do not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by a few fights and a boring story.".

It's a fairly standard chase movie as a woman is chased through the night by a gang of thugs out to kill her in revenge for her having left a nasty note on their car when they double parked in a busy parking lot on Christmas Eve. So yeah it's a variation on a pretty standard theme. There are no real surprises. You know the woman is going to survive somehow and in all honesty I thought there was a fair bit of tension and suspense through the whole thing. It's a bit unbelievable sure  but that's the nature of this kind of movie. Unoriginal yeah  but anyone who reads the description of the movie going in has to know it's going to be unoriginal so don't watch it if you want something brand spanking new. I liked the basic story from the point at which Della began to be pursued to the point at which she escaped. I thought it was well done.The movie was helped by having a better than usual lead. Kim Basinger played Della and did well with the part. So many of these movies feature a complete cast that you've never seen before and that you'll never see again that it's kind of nice to see a familiar face. Ironically perhaps the weakest part of the movie was also Della though  not Basinger's performance but the character's background. From the opening scenes of the movie Della is portrayed as a victim of an abusive husband apparently trapped in this unhappy marriage. That really served little purpose and had few connecting points to the remainder of the movie except to allow for a shocker in the very last scene which again wasn't necessary to the story. Go into this with your eyes wide open. If you like this type of movie then this is certainly on par with and maybe even a bit better than most chase movies you'll come across. But if you're looking for originality forget it. It all depends what you're expecting from it. Personally I rather liked it. 710".

Soon I was at two Darwin awards if that's even possible for her immense stupidity.And hey Produced by Kim Basinger? So she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us the people? I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent which are idiots a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are.".

I guess While she was out was worse.It has all been said before in other comments Unrealistic illogical etc.  the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin award if she actually died only watched first half so I don't know. Soon I was at two Darwin awards if that's even possible for her immense stupidity.And hey Produced by Kim Basinger? So she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us the people? I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent which are idiots a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are.";

This is a shame as the standard of the writing directing and acting is very good indeed and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to DVD flick.Kim Basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband Craig Sheffer. While Sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence it is in their brief scenes together that Basinger connects  showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths. It's a truly great understated performance her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played.Lukas Haas I initially thought was miscast as he along with the other three youths just did not seem much of a threat. However had all four youths been more physically imposing the later scenes in which Basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all. The fact that these are four average men albeit slightly unhinged is the key to why the film works as well as it does.Apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over. Some may be put off by the slow  burn nature of the opening scenes or the abrupt ending. Others by the at times brutal violence. I say give it a chance it's certainly more deserving of your time than Saw V.".

Particularly interesting is when Haas' Chuckie sizes Della up and she in turn seduces him using her seemingly ageless beauty as a means to buy herself some time. And to see Della so completely liberated by this night to put an end to the routine she is able to face her husband and finish the movie with a bang. Craig Sheffer makes a brief but impressionable appearance as Basinger's loathsome husband. The plot isn't overly complicated and the pace is fast..it is rather funny that all this starts because of a parking space.".

I can't help but remember what Kim went through with her marriage problems and all and somehow connect this movie as a catharsis of sorts for her.While She Was Out might not be very wellknown but it should in my opinion.

OK so this movie is super X 10 times stupid!! I don't want to write much of a review but couldn't resist myself from pointing out some of the demented scenes created by the director.1. A mall which is so busy at night that a parking space is impossible to find all of a sudden turns so empty as if it was a graveyard.2.When Kim was escaping from the mall instead of going back to whatever place she came she ends up going to the most remote place on planet earth. There were cops too on the way to the mall but she decides to go to the MARS. 3. What is that red tool box?? lol.......lol.....give me a break!! Why on earth that box?? Many other reviewers have already told a lot about that box. Actually the name of the movie should be The Red Box lol 4. When 4 thugs are chasing you and you have woods in front of your eyes then what would you do? Right! you would run to your last breath and probably would reach to the farthest end of the woods but Kim ends up running around the thugs again and again and.........again. 5. Why on earth that Kim's 'pee' scene???!!! The director was so artistic that she covered even the minute details. 6.The young moron thug starts acting like a 150 IQ genius.......He knows how to mark trees he is even so sure that Kim is around him in that 100 acre woods that he talks loud to himself and says I know you are here.....lol 7. The musical tribute to the dead acquaintance was super hilarious. 8. The abrupt sex scene in the end was out of this planet. I guess Martians feel a burst of sexual desire when they kill 4 people and when their own a is on fire. This is completely logical for Martians. I am not sure about the folks living on planet earth. 9.Instead of hiding into the woods she sometimes takes a stupid tool from her Red Box and jumps to kill a thug like Rambo. 10. Finally when she kills all the thugs she starts for her home she doesn't care to tell the cops on the way that she just saw 5 dead bodies 4 were her own contributions!This movie is funnier than any of the Scary Movies. Please watch it if you wish to laugh for hours.Beware despite it's hilarious nature this movie could be injurious for some people. and potentially fatal as well.".

The genre is a revenge kind of thing i suppose not unlike dirty weekend. The end is very similar to parts in this film and there is a lot of bad language and references to sex etc. However i didn't find it used violence gratuitously due to its genre. Kim Basinger looks really good in the film and considering she is 56? now I was surprised how fit she looked better than her younger days if you ask me and this is from a hetro female who grew up with her films in the 80's.. The film itself as i said is a revenge type film it starts off with Christmas at Della's family home. She has a twin boy and girl and a bully husband who complains she doesn't clean up enough  clearly doesn't realise marriage is supposed to be a partnership and it's no longer the 19th century!! and said she has let her self go to pot physically! has he SEEN what most housewives look like? he has been watching too much American Pie and Stiffler's mum i think! Anyway as the film goes on basically she goes to the mall to get last minute Xmas stuff and manages to antagonise a group of hooligans. It centres around that and although it's hard to believe it goes from then on and it gets quite tense til the end as you're worried about whether she will get home and the kids being at home and so on... wont totally give the game away but LOVED the ending retribution served. Just easy going revenge film id say. Nothing pretentious. quite tense and lots of fun...".

	schema:headline " A tidy and entertaining independent thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I did really enjoy this movie.It's not gonna be an Oscar winner but it's a great independent thriller with some superb performances  Kim Basinger's performance was of course central but kudos has to go also for Craig Sheffer's believable performance as her abusive husband.I figure everyone knows the basic plot but there were still enough surprises to keep me entertained. I didn't jump out of my seat but sometimes the action veered in a direction I didn't expect and I was intrigued by where the move ended up. It wasn't full of shocking twists but it still kept you gripped where the story was going to end up.All credit has to go to Kim Basinger who's matured into a really good actress and whose vulnerability ensured you never lost sympathy for the character and to Susan Montford for delivering a lively and entertaining script.It's not flawless  I admit the 82 minute running time felt a little short for me and after a length build up the sequences with Basinger fighting for her life felt a little briefer than I might have hoped for.Luke Hass was great as the central protagonist but he seemed too clean cut on occasion and sometimes lacked the air of danger I'd have expected. He didn't quite hit the right level of seductive villainy that I might have expected from say Christian Slater in Heathers but he had a great turn nonetheless and some memorable dialogue.Sometimes the plotting seems a little contrived  placing Kim's character in the middle of nowhere with no means of contacting help  but completely forgivable given that it's a standard of the genre.The simple plot mostly works for the film though rather than against it and means the actors have to work towards making you care about their characters And they do. Simple but effective character arcs exist for all the characters and it's quite interesting to note that I felt almost as much sympathy towards the villains of the piece as I did towards Kim's character.In short it's a tidy thriller with some stand out performances to put it above others in the genre. It's a solid debut from Susan Montford and I have to say I was impressed.Great ultimately satisfying ending too and I can see why the audiences at the premier reacted the way they did.Kudos to all involved.".

The flick is rife with symbolism but I think that the most emphasized one is the parallel drawn between the meaningless violence Della the central character is subjected to by some mindless psychopathic freakish strangers on the streets while she was out and the meaningless abuse that Della's own husband subjects her to while she is at home. The few hours that she is out fighting against the freaks to save her life to get back to her home help build up the attitude in her to not submit to a similar situation at home. And we see that in the end Della brings her life back into her control by putting an end to the criminals...both outside her home and inside. So I liked the script for this symbolism. Kim Basinger's performance is awesome as usual.".

As far as Eurotrash goes Bluebeard is double platinum. This was a really big budget production and a lot of money went into the art direction. That said expect great looking costumes and sets which often rival the women as overall cinematic eye candy. I have to mention the ladies again because they are stunning. Listen to this cast Raquel Welch Sybil Danning Joey Heatherton Virna Lisi Nathalie Delon Karin Schubert....Bluebeard plays out like a virtual Whos Who of Alist 1970's bombshells. Anyway the script is ludicrous and silly as is Joey Heatherton's performance as the female lead but Richard Burton does a terrific job holding everything together. Raquel Welch plays one of the murdered wives and a nun to boot and she's in the film for about 10min. Sybil Danning plays a prostitute and she has a pretty dank lesbian scene but her screen time is similarly brief. The film's mystery elements are pretty predictable but the whole affair is campy and attractive enough for it not to matter much. It is a bit long and there is a tasteless hunting scene where a range of animals are shot but I can't discount how fun most of this was. A Eurosleaze classic.  Reviews by Flak Magnet".

It is a bit long and there is a tasteless hunting scene where a range of animals are shot but I can't discount how fun most of this was. A Eurosleaze classic.  Reviews by Flak Magnet";

The material frankly begs for someone like a Roger Vadim or even Roger Corman. BLUEBEARD should have been more fun more intelligent than the Vincent Price movies of the time such as THEATRE OF BLOOD or even those of Roger Vadim such as PRETTY MAIDS ALL IN A ROW and yet it isn't. The script demands macabre humor and erotica and Dmytryk couldn't deliver either even in his heyday and this film was made at the end of his slow sad artistic decline. However I personally enjoy this movie more for what it could have been than what it is. Unlike Chaplin's MONSUIER VERDOUX and other Bluebeard movies directed by various people from Edgar G. Ulmer to Claude Chabral this is one film not inspired by the true story of Landru. It much more hearkens back to the original Perrault fairytale only done in the modern times with Burton's Bluebeard as a protoNazi. It's not a bad idea for a film but someone more hip with more energy was needed to pull it off.".

The feeling is increased more by the fabulous castle imaginative deaths and so forth. But placing the time of the story in the era of Nazi regime though the marks and symbols used in the film are not genuine gives it also another dimension. By taking on new wives to only to destroy them because of his own incompetence and false pride Bluebeard can be seen as a symbol of certain powers and what they have done or are doing to other countries and people. I'm not sure if the filmmakers really meant it that way but that's how I see some of it.If this film is mostly forgotten now I think it's unjustly so and deserves new viewings.

	schema:reviewBody "It's funny but I always thought the Bluebeard character was based on a reallife historical figure much as Vlad the Impaler had been the inspiration for Dracula and Gilles de Rais inspired Paul Naschy's Alaric de Marnac and the Countess Elizabeth Bathory was the obvious basis for Delphine Seyrig's vampiric Countess Bathory in Daughters of Darkness. But a little research reveals that Bluebeard was rather the creation of French author Charles Perrault and first appeared in a collection of the author's fairy tales in 1697. The basis for no less than six cinematic treatments the character appeared in 1972's Bluebeard in a topnotch production with a terrific cast a film that was strangely enough almost universally scorned by the critics of the time. It has taken me a full 40 years to finally catch up with this one and now I cannot help wondering what all the negative comments were about. The film strikes me as a woefully underrated black comedyhorror gem and a tremendously entertaining one to boot. In the film Richard Burton plays the title character also known as the Baron Kurt von Sepper. The survivor of a WW1 dogfight crash landing von Sepper's face is now somewhat scarred and covered with a neatly trimmed beard that due to some chemical admixture in that crash is now decidedly bluish in tint. A wealthy landowner the Baron lives in a sprawling castle in what the viewer must infer is Nazi Germany a lover of beauty he has already gone through six wives by the time the film begins in earnest. Unfortunately all six of his previous wives were for one reason or another monsters in the Baron's eyes and he was compelled to slay the entire bunch keep them preserved in his hidden refrigerator room and then paint abstract portraits of them a la Humphrey Bogart in 1947's The Two Mrs. Carrolls for his gallery. And now wife 7 an American entertainer named Anne surprisingly well played by '60s sexpot Joey Heatherton has just moved in....Unlike Henry VIII who only killed two out of his six wives Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard von Sepper here is a much more consistent chap! Burton is quite excellent in his portrayal and I really cannot explain all the harsh criticism regarding his performance. The film boasts some incredibly handsome sets solid direction from Hollywood vet Edward Dmytryk this was his extrapenultimate film and yet another wonderful score from the maestro Ennio Morricone a creepylovely score that will likely stay with you for days. As I've said elsewhere I'm just in awe at how many superb film scores this genius has come up with! Joey very much the female lead here not only looks smashing but also does quite well in the acting department too although she does not FULLY convince us that she's a 1920s flapper with her decidedly limited acting range she also gets to do some highkicking dance numbers here of the sort that wowed viewers of The Dean Martin Show in the mid'60s. Bluebeard's structure is a fairly interesting one jumping about in time as it does. During the film's numerous flashbacks we get to see von Sepper's six previous wives and learn just how and why he did away with them. And what a bevy of international pulchritude is on display for the viewer here! We meet wife 1 a singer who just wouldn't stop singing and played by the gorgeous Italian actress Virna Lisi wife 2 Erika a babytalking nitwit played by the luscious French actress Nathalie Delon who goes to a prostitute played by Austrian cult actress Sybil Danning for lovemaking advice wife 3 a lapsed nun with a rather licentious past played by THE American sex goddess of the era Raquel Welch though second billed Racky only gets seven minutes of screen time in the film wife 4 Brigitt a feminist turned masochist and played by steamy Italian beauty Marilu Tolo wife 5 Caroline a very young and indolent layabout portrayed by supersexy Italian actress Agostina Belli and wife 6 the increasingly randy Greta played by German future porno actress Karin Schubert. All these fabulous babes give wonderful comedic performances helping to make Bluebeard a black comedy to relish. But the horror elements are present in abundance too besides the six grisly murders the film dishes out a mute female servant underground crypts a mother's preserved corpse one that is just as hideous as Psycho's Mrs. Bates a cobwebbed castle an electric chair and on and on. Perhaps most horrifying for this viewer however was the spectacle of all manner of wildliferabbits deer fowl a fox a boarbeing shot and killed during one of the Baron's hunting parties. No animal should be needlessly slaughtered to make a motion picture I feel so I am deducting some points for this gratuitous nastiness. But other than this scene the film works splendidly and is really gradeA entertainment. This is a story that can be recast and remade every generation it seems to me using the top female sex symbols of the day. I can almost envision a 2013 version starring Salma Hayek Michelle Pfeiffer Megan Fox Scarlett Johansson....".

What follows is a primer in how not to pick a girl.The dialogue is phony the accents are terrible but the women are all beautiful and at least partially disrobed.

This movie should definitely appeal to people who love campy ensembletype films and Richard Burton at his hammiest probably mostly gays and women. But the most straightarrow unironic frat boy types will no doubt enjoy it too because every woman here except for Raquel Welch gets naked! I did have one minor quibble though. If I was a homicidal misogynist the first female castmember to go here would have been Joey Heatherton with her screeching voice and singular inability to deliver a convincing line of dialogue but she gets to be the final girl. Someone like the very lovely Agostina Belli on the other hand would have gotten to live a very long time. No one else needs to act with Burton around though. He seems as happy as a pig in slop as he gets to deliberately ham it up for a change and according to an interview I once read with one of his costars Sybil Danning he had even more fun OFFSCREENmuch to the chagrin of Elizabeth Taylor.

The rest are downright hateful. 1960s Sex Goddess Raquel Welch plays a nymphomaniac nun called Magdalena. One of the 1960s premiere Sex Kittens Joey Heatherton does a fine job with her role and gives us a Big Bonus by baring her delectable Ccup natural breasts. And we get to watch her puppies play in a seethru black top. She's the only sympathetic character in the movie and the one we cheer for. Joey exudes both sex appeal and talent in this movie. Her performance and her body are both a pleasure to watch. I give this movie four stars for having almost everything needed to make a movie great 1beautiful scantily clad and naked women 2 good plot 3 good character development and acting 4 high suspense. It's only lacking a high action sequences See my QT comment above.".

On his honeymoon night with latest wife Anne played by Joey Heatherton Burton's Baron von Sepper fails to rise to the occassion. In flashbacks his tales of murderous endeavor with previous wives unfold. Most of the beautiful European actresses in this movie merely pose looking beautiful. One exception is Virna Lisi who can't stop singing so the Baron must off her to keep his sanity. Raquel Welch is another wife a former convent nun named Sister Magadalena who constantly modifies both her nun's habit and appearance during the weeks that the Baron is courting her. By the time that the Baron is ready to pop the question to her her habit is low cut and thigh high! Magadalena begins to confess her past indiscretions 1 by 1. By the time she is on her 76th peccadillo the Baron can take no more and entombs her alive ! Otherwise the film is both dull and has terrible dialogue. Heatherton mutters things like  I spit on you my darling . The continuity runs like a badly dubbed Mexican horror flick. It's no wonder that the careers of those involved stalled..........".

Other than her beauty she adds nothing to her part not that there is much depth in hers or any role to explore.Of the other ladies Virna Lisi is probably the best known and therefore gets to retain her clothes for her brief role. She was an extremely beautiful woman when she was young but you would never know it from her appearance here. She's tarted up with an atrocious wig and some of the most retina burning dayglo lingerie ever created. She eventually became a well respected character actress in Europe but this was made during her sex bomb period and her role is as vapid as all the rest.As for the other actresses none really make an impression but all manage to lose at least their tops in order to pander to the audience. Which brings us to Miss Heatherton she offers a non performance of such staggering ineptitude that in its way it becomes enjoyable. Blank faced no matter what horror presents itself and with a flat expressionless voice she comes across as a third rate showgirl who wandered onto the set in error. In a way she is she gets no assist from Burton nor does anyone else. Of all the great actors who squandered their talent his did so the most willingly. His bored strictly for the paycheck performance is an affront to the paying audience.That leaves only two points of the film to discuss. One is the unseemly and unnecessary violence to both the women and animals. The rough treatment of the women is part of the story since Bluebeard is a serial killer but the shooting of various animals is unimportant to the story and could have been deleted.The other facet is the incredibly bad and cheap production design. While the castle which is the setting of the film is beautiful outside what the rooms look like inside is enough to upset your stomach for days. Red flocked wallpaper electric blue velvet wall coverings and other nauseating geometric patterns abound causing the viewer eye strain perhaps it was to distract them from the idiotic plot! Even worse are the cheapjack effects spiderwebs that looks like cotton candy ice in a walk in freezer which looks like nothing more than white shag carpeting the list could go on and on. It's dreadful and funny at the same time. The film is valueless by any measure of good film making but if you are a fan of bad movies there are things that will amuse you. Anyone else watch out!".

	schema:headline " BLUEBEARD looks beautiful but fails to perform.";
	schema:reviewBody "BLUEBEARD is an oddly beautiful film with beautiful sets beautiful costumes beautiful European women and Richard Burton's beautifully blue beard. The film is a retelling of the Bluebeard story that takes place in an almost Nazi Germany. The Nazi uniforms are not really Nazi uniforms and the swastika is not really a swastika but this helps add to the fantasy aspect of the film. The idea of watching a pseudoerotic black comedy about real Nazis would be a little tacky even for BLUEBEARD which is abundant in tackiness.The movie is about sex and sadism but never goes far enough with either the sex or the sadism even by 1972 standards. Baron Von Sepper Richard Burton attracts and is attracted to a series of beautiful women whom he courts and then marries. Once married to the various objects of his obsession the sticky part of consummating the marriage rears its ugly head or fails to more precisely. An Oedipus complex a plane crash and some kind of chemical reaction that has turned Von Sepper's beard blue have all combined to render the poor Baron impotent. To save himself from embarrassment Von Sepper must kill off his wives once they discover his inability to perform. This is where the film is remarkably realistic with its examination of the lengths a man will go to hide that he is not a functional man.I bought Richard Burton as the reserved Nazi baron who is incapable of accepting his shortcomings. He is funny in the scenes where he is trying not to have sex. The many failings of the movie are the fault of the director Edward Dmytryk. From the incredibly slow pace to the undramatic use of flashback right after flashback the film alternates between the boring and the beautiful. The director also annoys the viewer with an obvious correlation between the sadism of Nazi Germany and the sadism of Bluebeard. Anyone familiar with history knows that the Nazis were sadistic. No one needs this movie to try to drive that point home.".

FrenchItalianWest German coproduction has a striking art direction and design but suffers from continual poor taste. Veteran director Edward Dmytryk is as tough on the animals as he is on the female victims and an early hunting montage of creatures being shot and writhing in pain on the ground is unbelievably insensitive. Joey Heatherton tries hard in the largest femme role as the Baron's seventh wife but Dmytryk undercuts her performance with a cheesy succession of nude shots. It appears the producers wanted titillation satire and black comedy but Dmytryk doesn't have the nimble touch to pull this trifecta off. For starwatchers Raquel Welch and Virna Lisi are around for about six minutes apiece while Burton remains in a deadly lowkey throughout although creepy at times Burton is just faking his way through. Filmed in Budapest the picture has an interesting look and some definite signs of style but the narrative is a mess. A young handmaiden is involved in an accident while crossing a bridge which we are to assume was orchestrated by the Baron but we never learn why he chose to do this how he managed to pull this stunt off or whether or not the girl was killed. The screenwritersDmytryk among themhave even thrown in a Nazistyled subplot which only serves as a shortcut to the finale as if this Bluebeard weren't nasty enough he's also made a war criminal!.

I haven't been able to track down the 1944 version starring John Carradine! yet but I was very happy when I got hold of this one. I figured it couldn't go wrong with this cast Richard Burton and Raquel 'One Million Years B.C.' Welsh the period of release the rancid 70's and because it partly is an Italian production they dare to exceed limits of good taste more easily. To my regret it turned out a disappointment Not that it's an entirely bad film though. The classic tale is respected and the film implies an interesting structure but it's so darn tame! To any creative director or scriptwriter this plot would offer such a great opportunity to deliver a compelling adrenalinfilled film but here it's not the case. It doesn't even feature the slightest bit of sleaze which I actually hoped for. There's too few excitement and action while the chilling setpieces are underused. To choice to have Richard Burton play Baron Kurt 'Bluebeard' Von Sepper sounded like an ingenious casting idea but his performance only is so so. For those unfamiliar with the plot it handles about a German WWI veteran who returns from the war a ladykiller.literally. His eighth wife Anne discovers a secret room in the castle and a horrible secret. The only good comments actually go out to the female cast! One thing you got to admit Baron Bluebeard has a fine taste and eye for female beauty. Goddess Raquel Welsh is great as a nymphomaniac nun and also Sybil Danning Nathalie Delon and Virni Lisi impress in their roles of exwives. Bluebeard is worth a peek if a TVstation would ever program it definitely not worth buying.".

Burton would sink to even greater depths and also come back for a few good moments. The big story here is tragic sexpot Joey Heatherton who gives it her all in what would be really her only shot at breaking into features. I'm almost sure She also did an early low budget feature IMDb somehow missed. A stunning beauty hampered perhaps by a chipmunkish voice She looks stunning and hangs in there in shot after shot. Her amazing nude scene probably destroyed her chances of being taken seriously but it does not rob her of her dignity. Showbiz is not for sissies and She deserved a better break.

The plot takes a split approach with the Stardust being taken over by a mysterious force causing it to land on the Dark side of the Moon and out of contact with Earth. Meanwhile on earth an organized crime boss has planted an agent amongst the crew of the Stardust to attempt to take the energy source somehow if it is found. Soon Perry Rhodan and his crew discover an alien starship which has had to make an emergency landing on the Moon due to technical problems. The ship is commanded by the Alien Crest and the beautiful captain Thora.

My issue with the film was that the first bit is much more interesting but only constitutes about a third of the movie. Once the action relocates to Earth it loses a lot of its interest and becomes a slightly tiresome action caper. I guess that overall this awkward combination of scifi with a crimeaction story is one of the things that makes Mission Stardust quite distinctive. But for me its good parts were loaded at the start meaning that by the end it felt a little disappointing to me.It's a 60's scifi film so some slack has to be given regarding effects work. Quite a lot of them are really bad here but there is some decent model work for the spacecraft while the robots were pretty original in design. The moon scenes in general were pretty well done and had a sort of Star Trek original series type of charm. The lead male characters were quite forgettable but the lead female alien Thora was quite striking and a good character. It is also worth pointing out that like a lot of Italian genre movies of the time it has a very good soundtrack as well.

As such I'm not going to get into that argument. Mission Stardust is another of those movies that I really really and I mean really wanted to love. It's got a bizarrely appealing premise a groovy opening some really cool gadgets and wonderfully cheesy 1960s era special effects. Mission Stardust also has Essy Persson. Wow is about the best word I can use to describe her. Unfortunately it takes more than one woman to make an entertaining movie. I think Mission Stardust suffers because it doesn't have a well thought out plot. The movie gets off to a fantastic start tut it all grinds to a screeching halt in the second act. Dull isn't near a strong enough word. I'm not sure if there's a better cure for insomnia than the middle onethird of this movie. It's painful. If you can rouse yourself from the coma you're no doubt in the films finale does fortunately pick up a bit. But by then the damage is already done. Looking up Essy Person's filmography on IMDb I'm shocked to see only 17 acting credits  and unfortunately for me most of her work does not appear to be in English. Too bad.

Once they prepare to land however their electronics and communications suffer interference which prevents them from contact with earth. Additionally as they begin to patrol outside of their spaceship they notice a large alien spacecraft in the distance. Upon further investigation they encounter a robot which takes them inside the spacecraft commanded by a beautiful but condescending woman named Thora Essy Persson. Along with her is a very ill older gentleman by the name of Crest John Karlsen who desperately needs medical attention. Since the disease he has contracted leukemia is unknown on their home planet of Akron the decision is made to transport him back to earth for medical care as quietly as possible in order to prevent any governments from getting their hands on advanced technology. Now having given a quick synopsis of the plot I think it's only fair to state that I was unaware that this film was based on a European sciencefiction novel. Because of that I cannot compare how accurate this movie was with regard to the book. I would also like to add that the version I saw was titled Mission Stardust and from what I understand there are other titles it goes by as well. Likewise it was initially filmed in Italian and dubbed in English which might lessen the effect to some degree. Further this movie was filmed 36 years ago and as a result the special effects appear quite primitive compared to today's standards. Add in the fact that the character development needed a bit more work along with some rather poor acting on everybody's part and this film should probably merit a very low score. But in spite of all the flaws this movie was actually somewhat entertaining. But only to a certain extent. Of course in order to get any enjoyment from it a person will need to make some allowances. But that doesn't excuse the poor character development the substandard acting or the rather vague outline. All things considered then I rate it as slightly below average.".

	schema:reviewBody "MISSION STARDUST is a 1967 Italian film based on a popular German science fiction novella series of which I've never heard. It starts with the impression that we're settling in for a heady if horribly inaccurate science fiction film and makes a drastic turn into action territory in the second act. The title refers to the space mission launching at the start of the film where a team of astronauts led by Major Perry Rhodan Lang Jeffries is being sent to the moon to harvest rare metals that have been discovered under the surface of the Newcomb crater. What Rhoden and HQ don't know is that a powerful ? crime boss named Arkin Pinkas Braun has an inside man amongst the Stardust crew to report back to him in hopes of hijacking these valuable metals. None of this matters though as the Stardust is intercepted in lunar orbit and loses contact with Earth as it's forced to land. After touching down Rhoden and his crew discover the cause behind the interference an alien craft. They're introduced to Crest John Karlsen and Thora Essy Persson aliens from the planet Arkon whose ship broke down and they were forced to land on Earth's moon. Crest is unable to repair the ship because he's fallen ill with leukemia but that's all right because Rhoden informs him of a doctor on Earth who has conveniently enough developed a leukemia serum that can cure him. Can Rhoden and his crew overcome their differences with this alien race long enough to cooperate and save them? Will Arkin eliminate them all and steal the advanced Arkon technology?MISSION STARDUST fails on two very important levels as science fiction and as an actionadventure film. It's far too stupid to be decent science fiction. It started fun enough with psychedelic colors flying behind the opening titles while we're treated to an upbeat pop tune screeching Seli that sets the stage for a zany headtrip of an adventure that never comes. But as Seli fades out and the trippy colors are traded for reality it becomes a very serious science fiction. Tense faces countdowns inherent danger. What will become of the Stardust crew? Then stupid peeks its head around the corner. What're they going to the moon for? A metal has been discovered that's denser than cobalt or lithium! For anyone curious there are loads of elements denser than cobalt and lithium right here on Earth including such obscure metals as nickel copper and lead. OK so no real thought put into the film. Sort of cheapens the science part of science fiction but I can appreciate some stupid fun. I loved the miniature work and there was plenty of it in this film and the Arkonite craft is staffed with a crew of lumbering lurchbots who look like your average spaceman until you remove their helmet and discover the skinned Furby underneath. Details like this make cheap science fiction fun regardless of the dwindling thought behind the script. I mean these astronauts are supposed to be pretty savvy dudes right? So it's nonsensical that they're completely unfazed when their lunar rover disintegrates but then baffled at the site of an enormous UFO moments later. I mean what did they think happened to the rover? Who did they think was responsible for their emergency landing? The giant alien spaceship should be the least surprising thing going on. One astronaut's response to their invitation to this mysterious spacecraft by way of tube elevatorQuite an elevator eh Perry? And up we go to paradise or possibly hell!These astronauts and everyone else in this movie are dumb. Except maybe Thora. She's cool. She can't be bothered to waste any more time than necessary with these primitive earthlings. She's so advanced that she barely reacts when Major Rhodan the movie's hero remember forces himself on her. You see she's so advanced that sexuality doesn't register with her Rhodan sees this as a challenge and starts trying to make out with her because the first impression of our species Rhodan believes best to give this race of aliens is that of a dog humping your leg. Regardless he's not the only idiot here. But he's probably the biggest. When it's discovered that Crest is ill with leukemia his 10000yearold race discovered the cure to all diseases except this one the plan becomes to bring the aliens to a Dr. Haggard in Mombasa for the cure. The astronauts then land the alien ship 400 miles away from Haggard's location and plan to I guess walk there. Or they would if their careful plan to not be spotted hadn't failed immediately and they weren't beset by a patrol from the African Federation Army from the moment they set down in the African desert. So now the entire second half of the film has the astronauts battling a vague African military and eventually Arkin and his team and the film becomes a shoddy actionadventure. One final example of Rhoden's lessthanstellar leadership ability the astronauts realize they need a vehicle so rather than find a reputable salesman he bargains with a shady dude on the street who initially tries to sell them child sex slaves. It fails miserably and it only gets dumber from there.There's so much to say about this film I couldn't possibly do it all here. I could go on about how the astronauts are pretty much interchangeable. They're all bland white dudes without personality or distinguishing features of any sort. I haven't mentioned the lame oneliners that come once the astronauts become action heroes e.g. His retros failed on him! when an African thug is tossed by a gravity ray. There's a bunch. MISSION STARDUST is great conversation fodder if you've got friends similarly interested in bad movies. It's not as exciting as it wants to be but it's a fun failure.".

She's so advanced that she barely reacts when Major Rhodan the movie's hero remember forces himself on her. You see she's so advanced that sexuality doesn't register with her Rhodan sees this as a challenge and starts trying to make out with her because the first impression of our species Rhodan believes best to give this race of aliens is that of a dog humping your leg. Regardless he's not the only idiot here. But he's probably the biggest. When it's discovered that Crest is ill with leukemia his 10000yearold race discovered the cure to all diseases except this one the plan becomes to bring the aliens to a Dr. Haggard in Mombasa for the cure. The astronauts then land the alien ship 400 miles away from Haggard's location and plan to I guess walk there. Or they would if their careful plan to not be spotted hadn't failed immediately and they weren't beset by a patrol from the African Federation Army from the moment they set down in the African desert. So now the entire second half of the film has the astronauts battling a vague African military and eventually Arkin and his team and the film becomes a shoddy actionadventure. One final example of Rhoden's lessthanstellar leadership ability the astronauts realize they need a vehicle so rather than find a reputable salesman he bargains with a shady dude on the street who initially tries to sell them child sex slaves. It fails miserably and it only gets dumber from there.There's so much to say about this film I couldn't possibly do it all here. I could go on about how the astronauts are pretty much interchangeable. They're all bland white dudes without personality or distinguishing features of any sort. I haven't mentioned the lame oneliners that come once the astronauts become action heroes e.g. His retros failed on him! when an African thug is tossed by a gravity ray. There's a bunch. MISSION STARDUST is great conversation fodder if you've got friends similarly interested in bad movies. It's not as exciting as it wants to be but it's a fun failure.";

A couple aliens are aboard and they welcome the humans...well one welcomes them. The other is an inexplicably angry and disdainful hot ladywhich ultimately means it'll take the love of one of our sexy heman heroes to tame her! So why other than for the woman to score did these two come to the moon and approach our astronauts? It seems that one of them is dying and needs medical help. So far this is a really cool movie with kitschy sets and music and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately when they all went to Earth things slowed down...a lot. In fact it all became tedious as wave after wave of ultrastupid and greedy men kept attacking the alien ship! With the loss of momentum the film stopped being fun after a while. As a result I only mildly recommend it.".

Those fake sexual encounters during which the participants never shed any of their clothing do not exactly contribute to the credibility of the story either.

	schema:headline " Ensslin preBaader and a forgotten historic figure";
	schema:reviewBody "Wer wenn nicht wir or If Not Us Who? is a German movie from 2011 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. The director and one of the two writers is Andres Veiel and these two hours we have here are certainly his most known effort as a filmmaker. However the fact that he has not made a new film afterward yet shows that he has other fields of profession too in which he is active. His work here received a pretty great deal of awards attention including German Film award nominations for lead actors Diehl and Lauzemis and the movie itself was chosen as the thirdbest movie of the year back then. And there was awards attention outside the German Film Awards too but I will not go into detail here as you can check these out on another place too. The perspective to take when watching this film is to find out why it is so interesting. And one of the main reasons is probably the historical context. There are so so many German films that take place during the days of Nazi Germany and also quite a few that take place during the days of RAF terror but this one is inbetween in terms of time. Also it takes place after the days of the Trmmerfrauen and the time depicted in this film is actually one that does not get really that much attention so this alone is already why the approach can be appreciated here. Basically if you plan on watching The Baader Meinhof Complex at some point then it's a good choice to watch this one here maybe a day earlier especially because it takes place in the years before that. And this is mostly seen through the depiction of Gudrun Ensslin here a German terrorist who is still very wellknown here today and Lauzemis gives possibly the biggest performance of her career here especially in terms of awards attention. The male main character is played by August Diehl and Bernward Vesper is really a name that not too many know today anymore maybe also because he vanished before the most radical days of Ensslin and the RAF. But Diehl once again does a tremendous job and while I was not too impressed by Lauzemis Diehl steals really every scene he is in. The film is also written pretty interestingly and making a 120minute movie that has really no lengths at all is quite a success. Rising young actor Alexander Fehling plays Baader who also plays a major role already in the two protagonists' lives especially Ensslin's mostly in the second half of the film. And the cast includes several other really gifted German actors in supporting roles such as Thieme personal favorite of mine Lothar Wittenborn or Blomberg. And more. This is why the acting and script of this movie were certainly good enough to let me recommend the overall outcome. The only problem I see with the film is that it is extremely bleak from start to finish and deals with a time in German history that may not interest that many and even those who do may end up not really caring for it as it just is not as showy or in your face as The Baader Meinhof Complex for example. These two hours here are much much more subtle. But like I already said I enjoyed the watch especially Diehl who once again makes it easy to understand that he is among the very best Germany has to offer in terms of acting these days. His performance is enough already to let me give a thumbsup here.".

	schema:reviewBody "To start my review Hell means Bright in English.It is a rare thing even nowadays a German film studio realizes a serious dark film which has nothing to do with World War 2 or family drama.Hell plays without giving away any spoilers in an postapocalyptic scenario in which the sun burned everything down. People try to survive. You know this kind of scenario from movies like Mad Max or The Book Of Eli. However the sun aspect gives it an unused touch.The actors do a great job in making us believe they are in big trouble. In the bright parts as in the dark parts of the movie. The antagonists are also believable in the movie's logic.This is the first feature film directed by Tim Fehlbaum. On the one hand you can argue he is copying big Hollywood films which I would not disagree. On the other hand I find it kind of brave to show the German audience that a post apocalyptic movie can also be made in Germanym with near Hollywood quality and with a small budget of about 5 million Euros. The style is amazing the scenario believable. Plus the film does not show any CGI effects beside the extreme sun bloom which is done digitally and very good. Everything else is based on the characters and their path to survive and find better places to live. The story itself is not very innovative but decent to watch thrilling and without major flaws.As a conclusion This movie is underrated in my opinion. It is brave to make such a movie in Germany if you compare most of the other German movies from the past 5 years excluding Die Welle The Wave. Hell is wellpaced has good actors and a good director who knows what he is doing. If you like films like this you will not get bored.Sure Hell never reaches Hollywoodbigbudget blockbuster quality and the sets are pretty limited. However as a genre film which are SO rare in Germany it works and it is sad this film did not have success at the box office. It deserved better. Especially when looking at the future of German filmmaking which I do not want to be Til Schweigeronly.8  10".

People try to survive. You know this kind of scenario from movies like Mad Max or The Book Of Eli. However the sun aspect gives it an unused touch.The actors do a great job in making us believe they are in big trouble. In the bright parts as in the dark parts of the movie. The antagonists are also believable in the movie's logic.This is the first feature film directed by Tim Fehlbaum. On the one hand you can argue he is copying big Hollywood films which I would not disagree. On the other hand I find it kind of brave to show the German audience that a post apocalyptic movie can also be made in Germanym with near Hollywood quality and with a small budget of about 5 million Euros. The style is amazing the scenario believable. Plus the film does not show any CGI effects beside the extreme sun bloom which is done digitally and very good. Everything else is based on the characters and their path to survive and find better places to live. The story itself is not very innovative but decent to watch thrilling and without major flaws.As a conclusion This movie is underrated in my opinion. It is brave to make such a movie in Germany if you compare most of the other German movies from the past 5 years excluding Die Welle The Wave. Hell is wellpaced has good actors and a good director who knows what he is doing. If you like films like this you will not get bored.Sure Hell never reaches Hollywoodbigbudget blockbuster quality and the sets are pretty limited. However as a genre film which are SO rare in Germany it works and it is sad this film did not have success at the box office. It deserved better. Especially when looking at the future of German filmmaking which I do not want to be Til Schweigeronly.8  10";

The actors are far better than you would expect and in fact Hannah Herzsprung simply rocks in this one this girl has a true survivor sticker all over her face and still you will root for her even when it's obvious.With this kinds of actors and an excellent first act the movie suffers a pale second act in comparison putting this movie in the good category where it could have been great.Still nice scifi end of the world movie that has a very good concept and nice suspense attached to it.I give the movie a plus bonus for not being that harsh as The Road on some scenes where the director prefer to leave us to imagine things instead of just showing us so if you care about the level of graphic violence on movies you can be sure to find very few graphic violence on Hell and this is a nice touch of course you will see people killing each other but it's rare on this one and when it happens it's done without blood or shocking scenes like The Road does. 80 suspense and guaranteed to like if this is your style.If you don't know what to watch on a Sunday night this one is a sure bet even with it's flaws.".

I always thought this movie was called HELL by the meaning it has in English and this was the idea of the director. Reading some previous comments I see it's not like that It seems the director wanted this film to be called HELL just by the brightness and not for the other meaning. But after watch it I can say that in my opinion it can be called by both meanings because both of them fit very well in the plot and the message of the movie! Brightness is constant in the movie but they also live in a world that really seems like hell! The plot begins in the year 2016 after a sudden and brutal increase of the global temperature of the Earth. The Sun is brighter than ever and the water is rare and valuable. It's hard to survive in this apocalyptic scenario because people are in a constant search for food and water We can't see any vegetation just the trunks of the trees and the animals died thirsty.HELL is an action film that resembles to MAD MAX mostly in the scenario and this background of the apocalyptic world. But it's well done the settings are really good as they provide us a vision of a desert world full of death and not life Action is effective and suspenseful some good fighting scenes are done Directing and camera work is very nice too. Acting is also fine.".

Cannibalism has always been a popular aspect of postapocalyptic movies but I think Hell really doesn't get the balance right. Way too much time is spent on the crazy cannibal family and I'm really not all that fond of escape from the crazy cannibal family movies. They're all basically the same and it's become way overdone in recent years. This is actually one of the better crazy cannibal families but it's still kind of boring.I liked the postapocalyptic aspects of this movie and I thought that it could have been much better if they'd focused more on that. They could easily have kept the crazy cannibal family but don't make the whole movie about that. After escaping from the cannibals they could have found a postapocalyptic town that was using slavery to rebuild. Or they find a sick man who wants food and water. Should they give up some of their rations for someone who will probably die soon anyway? But no they just run into a stereotypical cannibal family and try to escape. Boring.If you're desperate for postapocalyptic movies or you still want more cannibal horror movies after seeing Wrong Turn 8 this is a pretty decent choice.

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Fehlbaum's Hell depicts planet Earth as a barren desolate wasteland that was once infested with blooming life. The cinematography of the dry insufferable heat is so containing and properly handled that it almost bathes the viewer in hot flashes to the point where I was totally willing to step outside with no coat in the middle of Chicago cold. In terms of look feel and liveliness it's a seriously effective thriller. As a film adding to the recent popular but rarely impressive genre of postapocalyptic thrillers it's more or less the same thing we've grown accustomed to.Hell also ridiculously titled Apocalypse in some retail chains has one major selling point and that's its producer the iconic German filmmaker Roland Emmerich who has made a name for himself in the field of disaster films such as the American adaptation of the Japanese Godzilla series and Independence Day. Perhaps his producer's credit was earned in the fact that he saw a bit of his most recent film at the time 2012 in Hell. Unlike his picture which hammed up the nonsensical action and took almost nothing seriously in a long winded two and a half hour film Hell capitalizes on character relations and subtlety rather than tossing special effects at the viewer in an apparent contest.We are placed in 2016 and learn immediately that the Earth has warmed at unprecedented rates increasing 10C because of solar flares destroying the atmosphere of Earth. The few survivors must shield their skin with excess clothing gloves smocks and anything they can potentially protect themselves with from the increasing heat of the sun. We soon meet Marie Hannah Herzsprung a young woman traveling the ruins of parched roads with her boyfriend and younger sister. After picking up a man who claims that he can help them right after almost killing all three of them for their diminishing water supply the three make an unplanned stop leaving the sister left in the car which has its windows covered with newspaper and barricaded off. She is taken by a group of survivors who thrive on cannibalism in this newfound hellish world and after her boyfriend splits Marie and the hitchhiker attempt to recover her younger sister before she is subjected to uncertain doom.Fehlbaum treats his characters respectively not having them shout ridiculous lines or commit acts of impulsiveness with not even a shred of a thought process as to why. He makes grand use out of his small cast of newcomers and on top of that creates crafty tension with his cowriters Oliver Kahl and Thomas Woebke using long uncertain shots that focus either on characters or driedout empty landscapes.But the kicker here is the wonderfully captured hauntingly displayed almost blinding cinematography that cinematographer Markus Frderer personifies into its own character rather quickly. He opens the picture showing off the film's inherently brutal climate with no points of being intrusive or to irritate the casual viewer. It's all a means to concoct suspense and atmosphere for maximum effect. Fehlbaum's Hell has its share of ups and downs and after a while you begin to realize you're seeing the same type of areas over and over again. Like movies of its genre it fluctuates between interesting and not repetitive and enticing and beautifully stylistic and much of a muchness. Thankfully its negative traits are minimized because the film never overstays its eightynine minute welcome and provides us with smarter entertainment than I'm sure many of us were expecting.Starring Hannah Herzsprung Stipe Erceg Lars Eidinger Lisa Vicari and Angela Winkler.

It's a nice thing he was earnest and the fellow seems like a very nice guy.Which can't be said about a lot of the characters in this movie. Unfortunately after a very strong beginning though he movie falls back into clichs. And not good ones. Add to that some weak acting there is an older German TV soap star on board who is particularly bad. The director told us he got her into the movie but that she didn't seem to grasp the ideas they were trying to portray ... which seems to be sort of an explanation concerning her acting and a soso script and the movie does get weaker towards the end.Which again is a shame because I like the idea and I think it's a good thing they dare to make a genre movie in Germany. Of course the director being in every city made the movie win an audience award. People even told me they gave the movie a better review because he was so likable. That's nice for him but shouldn't affect the voting process in general. But there you go Not great but not a really bad movie either".

	schema:headline " German shot at 'The Road'";
	schema:reviewBody "Imagine you are a writerdirector who saw 'The Road' and now want to make a movie ''just like that'' but you lack the budget the cast and the writing. Your result may resemble 'Hell' a German foray into the postapocalyptic genre. Don't get me wrong here being a fan of both dystopian narratives and German film 'Hell' really did pique my curiosity but sadly failed to meet expectations.What does appear striking is the strong Road semblance its creators obviously wanted to give the whole thing even down to the canned peaches. What may have doomed the whole enterprise from the getgo is the fact that Hillcoat's adaptation of McCarthy's novel is one of the best pieces of postapocalyptic fiction ever made. Setting the bar at this height does not bode well for Fehlbaum's endeavor.Heightened solar activity has heated up Earth's atmosphere leaving its surface an inhospitable and barren place where plant life no longer can sustain the blistering heat. The remaining survivors fight for Earth's scarcest resource  water. Rumors have it that water still can be found in the higher regions of the German Alps destination of our group of survivors Marie Leonie and Phillip.Evidently the movie was shot on a very tight budget. The only noteworthy CGI is the bloom effect of the glaring sun which is simple but does its job. Other than that the film does little to convince us of the inclement world the characters amble around in. There are no money shots to speak of crucial to establishing a fictitious world the only rewarding part in sense of immersion is the rest area right at the beginning. Whatever setup comes after this locale appears illconceived and lackluster.The cast does not really seem to grasp their characters either dealing further detrimental blows to the credibility of 'Hell''s world. Worst by far is veteran actress Angela Winkler whose delivery is at times comical. Throughout her entire screen time she doesn't seem to be able to make heads or tails out of her role. To a lesser degree the same is true for the rest of the cast. Hanna Herzsprung's decisions are hard to follow her acting is random at best. The same goes for Lars Eidinger who apparently is unsure whether Phillip is an coldhearted realist craven opportunist or takes heart from Marie's actions and mans up after all. Only Stipe Erceg is able to bestow some depth upon his rendition of Tom. All of this however does not stem from bad acting per se  it appears rather obvious that the character design was poorly executed accompanied by a weak director's vision for the characters at hand.This also manifests in many inconsistencies throughout the film. The dangerousness of the sun for example ranges from 'deadly' 2 hours of exposure will burn your skin to 'bright' where people simply 'cannot see so well' but otherwise couldn't care less if they are exposed to the supposedly deadly sunlight. It is pretty much selfexplanatory what this does to the referential frame of the film and it leaves a staunch sensation of arbitrariness.Another dubitable decision is the movie's pacing. Suspenseladen slow takes work well in stretches where this exact sense of suspense is supposed to be conveyed. To choose only slowly paced takes will eventually tire the viewer and lose his attention. And at times the scenes drag along like the nets of an Atlantic trawler. All in all 'Hell' has a net screening time of approx. 80 minutes which is not a lot  but with the few events actually going on onscreen everything could easily be wrapped up in 30 minutes or less. In addition slow paced takes are usually a staple of the horror genre with often visceral effects resolving the tension abruptly in a shock effect way. The overuse of this technique gives 'Hell' more than a hint of horror shocker and in the last third of the film you are not sure what genre you are actually finding yourself in. Whereas the themes and motives are the same as in 'The Road' the genre seems to have shifted in 'Hell'. Statements about the human condition in 'The Road' have given way to a capitalization on shock value in 'Hell'. Which in my opinion is a poor artistic choice.All in all I still welcome Fehlbaum's attempt at postapocalyptic filmmaking a genre among many others neglected by German cinema although the outcome as such fails to convince. I wouldn't go so far as to call 'Hell' bad it certainly is not good but its flaws render the whole enterprise disappointingly boring and lackluster. However this shot at a German postapocalypse is maybe necessary to spark further attempts and may set the stage for more stringent and enthralling works. Or so I hope at least.".

	schema:headline " Geewhiz a manmade roadblock? I bet we could have fun if we got out.";
	schema:reviewBody "Picture this you've been barely surviving in a postapocalyptic overheated world for 3 long years. People have become savages fighting violently over food and water which are extremely scarce. You are aware that malicious humans lurk everywhere. You drive along and suddenly you nearly crash into an obviously manmade roadblock. Do you really stop to look around? Do you actually scatter have a stroll? Do you leave a young girl in the car alone? Doesn't this look to you like a very obvious trap? It should  but certainly not to the morons in this movie. They get played over and over like a bunch of ninnies by a family of semiretarded hillbilly cannibals!The movie has a very bland unappealing look a great problem with most modern horror films. If you're colourblind you miss out on nothing  the movie has only two colors green for indoor scenes and yellow for outdoor scenes. Yeah I get it the Sun has expanded it's very hot all the time bla bla bla. The temperature went up by 10 degrees not bloody 100 C! The indoor greenish hue is almost a coincidental or at the very least ironic tribute to Soylent Green an old nongreenish movie that must have exerted some influence on this movie's creators. Speaking of which that was no surprise at all. The stench of cannibalism followed this movie from the very start it was obviously going to play a role at some point. And yet another such movie presents cannibals as people with superhuman strength and skills. But eating human flesh doesn't give you any such powers or we'd all be munching each other by now right? Where did these people develop such dexterity speed and even webthrowing skills? I have seen seasoned Texan cowboys who'd be jealous of the precision with which these maneating buffoons catch their prey with mere webs. Anyway this family would have to be much larger in order to carry out such a successful operation.Nor do I find a speck of logic in a family of savage butchering cannibals saying their PRAYERS before every meal  aside perhaps in a horror comedy directed by a young Peter Jackson. Real exChristian cannibals would have dropped the Bible and God a long time before starting to stalk maim butcher and cook random humans. Even though I'm an atheist I'd have to side with the religious sheep on this one a true Biblehugger is less likely to start killing people for food and not even temporarily but as a way of life than a nonreligious person simply because a religious nut has larger barriers i.e. bigger walls to pull down in order to commence engaging in an activity that is so blatantly Satanic. I am not saying violent sects don't exist but this is CANNIBALISM we're talking about.Besides I see plenty of trees and other vegetation here. I don't see how this greensurrounded family had to turn to cannibalism so quickly.The older sister is a bona fide retard she makes all the dumb decisions one after another. Her biggest blunder was giving away the location of her wounded hence vulnerable boyfriend to a woman she'd just met 5 seconds earlier  in spite of already having realized that someone had set that roadblock as a trap. So 3 years of bareknuckle struggling in a postapocalyptic dogeatdog world hadn't taught this woman anything at all? If she were really this stupid my guess is that she would have been dead a long time before this wee cannibalistic adventure even began.The less said about her younger sister the better. She is a spoiled backstabbing dumb egotistical little brat and yet it's expected from us to actually care about her ongoing rescue efforts? Couple that with her group's overall stupidity and I see no reason why we should not root for the cannibals to eat them. It's not as if anyone has a future anyway in this totally bleak hopeless wasteland. Unless there's a sequel in which the Sun starts shrinking again  which could make for a great comedy. Hence the predictably inconclusive ending the plot simply had nowhere to go.Still for a German movie it wasn't badly done. 410 is probably the pinnacle for them.".

	schema:headline " No bright ideas in here despite some good effects";
	schema:reviewBody "Hell is actually a play on words as it has not only its special meaning in English but also a meaning in German language where it can be translated with bright. This film indeed shows us a dystopian planet Earth where a few survivors are in desperate search for gasoline and especially water as the planet has drastically heated up in a near future following some dramatic events that are sadly not further explained in this flick. The movie follows four characters that have to work together to survive on their journey through this postapocalyptic world.A surprisingly positive point about this movie is the technical aspect. Especially the special and the light effects are quite professionally done despite a low budget and manage to put you in a deserted and desperate place. Add a very well done soundtrack to this and you have a very authentic and highly atmospheric backbone for this film.The acting is far from perfection but still acceptable for this kind of movie. The growing emotional conflicts between the different characters and a couple of intriguing figures that appear throughout the film keep you seated in front of your television and make you want to know the end of all these events.Sadly the story is rather weak in this promising film. Once the characters are introduced there isn't anything all so spectacular going on. The movie definitely has its lengths and many events are predictable if you know this kind of genre a little bit. There are no twists after all no truly emotional moments that would leave you impressed and after a promising start the film gets quite mellow and even the ending is somewhat disappointing. That's quite sad as this movie could have been at least a very decent alternative postapocalyptic movie with a couple of good ideas. As the ideas are running low after a while and as there are no gripping passages the flick rather feels like a drama and not like a horror movie a thriller or a worked out sciencefiction flick.The further the movie progresses the less original it eventually gets. That's why I would consider you to stay away from this as the film gets more and more disappointing. Watch this only if you know and like some of the actors that all get a lot of screen time and dialogues or if you're intrigued by the good special and light effects that are clearly the highlight of the movie. Apart of the technical aspect this movie remains overall only of an average quality at best.".

Even though the acting is OK the characters never get really that Developed to really care about. To tell you the truth I was rooting for the Cannibal Farmers to win the day .To bad the two Female Protagonists Easily win the day with ridicules ease.Why in the Heck would they leave the main character alone after she has proved to be a tough women who doesn't want to stay their. And the laughable comment that the Grandma farmer makes about the Young girl. saying that the men would wait for her to come of age . Really? they can kidnap a group of strangers for sex and probably for food kill them at will and they will wait for her to come of age?? hahahahaha what ever .

	schema:reviewBody "During the Third Reich of 19331945 Germany's nationalised film industry produced more than 1100 films. Surprisingly only about 250 of these were blatantly Nazi propaganda the vast majority were merely escapist entertainment. But the Nazi leaders who controlled the film industry were clever enough to realise that Hitler's cause could be furthered with movies which subtly advocated German ideals and nationalist causes ... without explicitly praising Hitler nor showing swastikas or other Nazi symbolism.'Friedrich Schiller' is a film which intentionally serves Nazi agenda without being explicitly proNazi. This film purports to tell the story of Schiller the 18thcentury German playwright and blankverse poet. A contemporary and friend of Goethe Friedrich Schiller was an important poet in his own right his 'Ode to Joy' was set to music as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.'Friedrich Schiller' was released in 1940 shortly after Hitler's early military triumphs with the subtitle 'Der Triumph eines Genies' Triumph of a Genius. Movie audiences were clearly meant to see parallels between Schiller and Hitler.In the title role this film stars Horst Casper ... a prettyboy actor whose looks surpass his acting ability. Rather than telling Schiller's entire life story the film emphasises his early years when Schiller was a cadet in the Karlsschule the military academy sponsored by the Duke of Wrttemberg and his service in the Duke's regiment at Stuttgart. During this period Schiller read law and medicine and somehow also found time to write his first play!The film depicts a reallife incident which occurred in 1781. Whilst Schiller was garrisoned with the Duke's regiment in Stuttgart his first play 'The Robbers' was performed at a theatre in Mannheim. Schiller went AWOL from his regiment to attend a performance of his own play. In the movie this leads to a stormy confrontation between Schiller and his patron. Heinrich George gives a splendid performance as the Duke easily outacting the dull Casper.Unfortunately this film tries too hard in its efforts to make 18thcentury historical characters fit into Nazi agitprop. Schiller is meant to symbolise the idealistic visionary ubermensch that rare individual who is innately superior to normal men.The production design and the period detail in this film are impressive and the photography by the great Fritz Arno Wagner is superb. The film editing is better than usual for German movies of this period. But it's all quite dull. I confess that I don't know enough about Schiller to judge the biographical accuracy of this movie but there are several scenes in which the facts have clearly been bent to fit Nazi agenda. I'll rate this movie 4 points out of 10. It has quite a few good points in spite of its Nazi pedigree.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enter a cast of thousands. Schiller as a prototype for Der Fuehrer. The indomitable Heinrich George as a standin for the Old Guard. Hearty laughs and happy endings.This film which I viewed first in the 1960's surprised me with its high production values for a 1940 effort not made in Hollywood. My initial reaction to it was disbelief that the Nazi censors allowed the words of the poet to reflect individual courage in the face of oppression. It was only later I learned from primary witnesses that Germany in 1940 was so much at the top of its game that it did not matter so much what people said or did about classic artists like Schiller as long as it did not border on sedition against the Third Reich directly or bear the stain of Jewish corruption. Oppression as a fact of everyday life for the man in the street was still in its infancy while German armies were rolling successfully across Europe. The enemy was no longer within but without.As in the United States today 2004 virtue could be portrayed as vice and vice versa by ideologues in high places. Words ceased to have any real meaning in and of themselves and were instead regarded as mere tools of propaganda for subverting human rights. Thus the noble strains of Schiller's poetry extolling individual and romantic ideals were made to seem reflective not of freedom but of iconic values and symbols of the state itself as embodied in its triumphant leader.Heinrich George as a blustering old fool steals the show. When the curiously girlish young poet as played by Horst Caspar stands up to him in court and speaks about what his heart feels George explodes and sends him packing. Some fun is made of the local accents and women who fall in a faint at the sight of the brave young poet all in the guise of good fun. A harmless little film in hindsight made grim by wondering whatever happened to all those great costumes and sets when they were reduced to rubble a mere four or five years later. Is there a lesson for us here?".

First lets get a few facts straight. It is well documented that Franco shot the second unit on Chimes at Midnight which included much of the battle scene. This means that Franco shot a lot of coverage of the battle working from a general outline given by Welles. Later Welles took the miles of footage into the editing room and many months later emerged with the shattering sequence that appears in his picture. Franco obviously had nothing to do with this editing process and as far as I can tell has never claimed otherwise. To compare the battle scene in The Bloody Judge with Welles' magnificent achievement is grotesquely unfair as I am sure that Franco was allowed minutes rather than months to assemble The Bloody Judge for exhibition. Given the strictures under which he was working Franco his cast and his collaborators should be commended for having produced a film with such a high level of professionalism.

	schema:reviewBody "Jess Franco's Il Trono di fuoco aka. The Bloody Judge of 1970 is one of a bunch of early 70s exploitation flicks inspired by the success of Michael Reeves' 1968 masterpiece Witchfinder General starring the great Vincent Price. People familiar with Jess Franco's cinema might expect an immensely sleazy and gruesome film that mainly takes place in torture chambers but the film is actually tame for what one might expect. Even though there are a bunch of very brutal scenes the level of sleaze and violence is quite low for a Jess Franco film and the film is not even nearly as nasty as other popular 'Hexploitation' films of the time such as the ultragruesome Mark Of The Devil from the same year. Equally surprising is the budget that was obviously quite high for Jess Franco standards as realistic costumes and nice settings are provided.Horror icon Christopher Lee who worked with Jess Franco on several occasions plays Lord George Jeffreys the infamous and merciless judge and Lord Chancellor in England torn by strife between the reigning King James II and William of Orange. Convincend of doing what's necessary the cruel judge mercilessly persecutes 'traitors' who sympathize with the King's opponent William of Orange as well as 'witches' who are accused of being in league with the devil...Christopher Lee is as always great in his role as the merciless judge who is based on the infamous reallife 'hangingjudge' George 1st baron Jeffreys. Beautiful Maria Rohm who starred in many Francohighlights most memorably in Venus in Furs and Count Dracula plays the female lead here and she fits in her role very well. Jess Francofans will also recognize another regular in his films Howard Vernon who plays the executioner. Another great enrichment to the film is the great score by Bruno Nicolai. Jess Franco one of the most prolific directors ever has directed a bunch of absolutely awesome films as well as total stinkers. The Bloody Judge is definitely one of his better films even though in my opinion not one of his masterpieces and a more than decent historical horror film. Highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "Jess Franco's Il Trono di fuoco aka. The Bloody Judge of 1970 is one of a bunch of early 70s exploitation flicks inspired by the success of Michael Reeves' 1968 masterpiece Witchfinder General starring the great Vincent Price. People familiar with Jess Franco's cinema might expect an immensely sleazy and gruesome film that mainly takes place in torture chambers but the film is actually tame for what one might expect. Even though there are a bunch of very brutal scenes the level of sleaze and violence is quite low for a Jess Franco film and the film is not even nearly as nasty as other popular 'Hexploitation' films of the time such as the ultragruesome Mark Of The Devil from the same year.

Like you could see IMDb never made notice of this version so I thought it must be wrong on the DVD but no it clocked in at exactly 103 minutes. It's English spoken until the extra minutes appear they are in German but the subtitles stays intact. The extra minutes are no more then a torture scene with full nudity the others include all nudity with a love scene between the bloody judge and the witch the last extra is a lesbian scene in the torture room with frontal bush nudity. Thinking of the year it was made 1970 it was normal that it was cut out. Anyway the storyline does refer to the real history but the movie is way too long. There is a lot of blah blah and the torture scenes are really laughable. You only see blood but it never runs or you never see cuts made by the executioner. A shame could have done better by Franco. The performances are really good but the suspense isn't there due the lack of storyline they really refer to much to history. It is nice to see how they made you say you are a witch. There are better witch hunt movies out there I guess would Lee never appeared in it it would be a forgotten flick. It's not for the geeks of horror just one of the Jess Franco flicks with the usual TA features. It's available in his 103 minutes in Belgium with the German pieces in it judge it for yourselves".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bloody Judge is unquestionably one of Jess Franco's finest accomplishments and there are several elements that contributed to this. First of all Christopher Lee depicts another unforgettably meanspirited and frightening horror protagonist. This doesn't always guarantee a great movie mind you as Franco and Lee previously collaborated to make a couple of sequels in the Fu Manchu series and they were dreadfully boring films. The character of medieval witch hunter Judge Jeffries clearly suits Lee a whole lot better than the oddly mustached oriental mastercriminal and his performance confirms this. Secondly for one of the few times during his entire career Jess Franco could actually rely on a decent budget! There was enough money for fancy costumes and atmospheric scenery and even the editing and cinematography were clearly handled professionally. Finally you can hardly go wrong with the subject matter of medieval witchhunting political corruptness vile torture footage and robust executions. Although clearly inspired by the popularity of Witchfinder General starring Vincent Price The Bloody Judge contains more than enough own ideas and ingenuity to be considered as a success in its own right. The film opens with the extended and compelling trial of a young girl accused of witchcraft leading to her relentless execution burning at the stake. The long opening adequately introduces the character of Judge Jeffries but the actual plot only unfolds after this. The executed girl's sister flees up the country and falls in love with the son of an eminent politician who also happens to rebel against the corrupt English crown. The obsessive Judge Jeffries orders his followers to capture all the rebels and submit them to torture but the army of William of Orange is slowly approaching England to conquer the crown. The amounts of graphic violence and  especially  gratuitous sleaze are admirably kept rather low and this in favor of character development and tension building. Naturally there are a handful of brutal sequences on display notably the interrogation of poor Alicia but The Bloody Judge is mainly story  atmospheredriven. Franco regular Howard Vernon Dr. Orloff! has a small but terrific role as the sneering executioner Ketch. Like another reviewer already stated Vernon here strangely resembles Marty Feldman when he played Igor in Young Frankenstein. Maria Rohm is enticing and beautiful as ever playing Mary or that wench as people insist on referring to her. The Bloody Judge is a good film that easily deserves a spot in my Jess Franco top five alongside The Diabolical Dr. Z The Awful Dr. Orloff Faceless and Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun.".

This is Franco on a larger budget than usual but also to my mind a compromised Franco. The print I watched the English version featured no nudity and very little gore. Lee was excellent as usual in the title role playing the power crazy witchfinder Judge Jeffreys but without the usual Franco sleaze the story failed to hold my attention throughout. If you haven't seen any of the director's work this might be a good jumping on point but afficionados of the erotic and surreal 'Vampyros Lesbos' or 'Succubus' might find this one a bit of a snooze.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Witchfinder General 1968 The Bloody Judge was part of a small subset of films from the late 60's  early 70's that can best be described as historical horror movies. In these we have a true historical subject which is played up in such a way that it crosses over into the territory of the horror film. Seeing as this was a point in time where there was a plethora of period set costume horror flicks anyway I suppose it makes a lot of sense that these films were made too. Like a lot of continental offerings from the period this one throws in a lot of sadistic torture nudity and sleaze as well and so covers the erotic horror subgenre too. This is hardly surprising when you take into account that its director was the legendary Jesus Franco who was something of an expert at this kind of thing.The Bloody Judge came out at a point when Franco was enjoying the most high profile time of his career and so this one like a few others he made at the time is pretty high budgeted by his subsequent standards. It has good locations and a fine cast and benefits from professional editing and photography as well. It was also one of several collaborations Franco had with horror stalwart Christopher Lee too. Unlike their earlier Fu Manchu collaborations the role of the infamous Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys  aka 'The Hanging Judge'  was much better suited to Lee. He is very good as this cold central character although he seemingly was not best pleased at all when he saw the finished film presumably as a result of the salacious content Franco is famed for. The cast is good beyond Lee too we have the beautiful Maria Rohm the fine character actor Leo Genn and last but not least Franco regular Howard Vernon in a great over the top turn as a torturerexecutioner.Like Witchfinder General before it and several others too this one is set in witch hunting times. It's a period in history peculiarly well suited to horror movies. Most costume horrors tend to be set in the later Victorian period but when we go back further into the far scarier unenlightened years of the 1600's we are squarely in a historical period where many very horrible things occurred and it is very well suited therefore to horror stories. Like most historical films this one also takes considerable liberties with the actual history to be honest. But let's be fair lots of critically acclaimed big budget historical movies do exactly the same  Braveheart for instance  and if they can then why bother complaining if these far smaller films do a similar thing.For my money this is one of the better Franco films out there. I think the story and central character are good ones for the treatment and the production value is good enough to pull it off. The smattering of salacious content throughout didn't do it any harm and simply added to the entertainment factor to be perfectly honest. This maybe isn't of the level of the more personal delirious Franco efforts such as Vampyros Lesbos but it's definitely one of his most well made. I enjoyed it a fair bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Bloody Judge is set in England during the year 1685 under the rule of King James II loyal James supporter Judge George Jeffreys Christopher Lee is the Lord Chancellor  is feared for his harsh sentences or torture  execution. Judge Jeffreys sentences Alicia Gray Maragret Lee to death for Witchcraft Jeffreys then speaks with Lord Wessex Leo Genn  discovers that his son Harry Selton Hans Hass Jr. has been having an affair with Alicia's sister Mary Maria Rohm  is known to be in contact with rebels. Mary  Harry help the upcoming invasion by Monmouth in hope of overthrowing King James II  William of Orange taking his place Jeffreys suspects that Harry is a traitor  fears for his own position if King James was ever defeated but Jeffreys falls for Mary. As the fighting across England intensifies  the rebels gain in strength  number  start winning Jeffreys orders the execution of 500 known traitors in a sign of defiance including Harry  Mary...This Liechtenstein Spanish German  Italian coproduction was directed by the prolific exploitation  sleaze merchant Jess Franco now I have never hid the fact that I think Jess Franco is one of the two worst director's ever along with Jim Wynorski but with a resume totaling two hundred odd films even Franco was going to make one or two good ones  The Bloody Judge is definitely one of his best films. Obviously made to cashin on the success of Witchfinder General 1968 the central figure here is Judge George Jeffreys who was a real person he was apparently nicknamed 'The Hanging Judge'  was widely know for the cruelty of his sentences. Even if the central character is somewhat historically accurate the film itself isn't which is unsurprising given that Franco is a talentless hack I just love insulting the guy sorry. For instance the Monmouth rebellion actually failed  I seriously doubt he fell in love with a young girl. Anyway The Bloody Judge is a real mixed bag of genres with large doses of costume drama historic epic biography horror sleaze sex  war film with none particularly gelling together that well. The torture scenes look out of place between the rather dull historical dramatics  none of the character's come across that well for instance Judge Jeffreys is fairly one dimensional as the script never tries to dig into his psyche or flesh him out as a person. Why was he the way he was? Was he just a sadistic  cruel man who hid behind the law to satisfy his brutal fantasies  desires? Did he genuinely believe that what he was doing was right?

	onyx:emotionText "The Bloody Judge is set in England during the year 1685 under the rule of King James II loyal James supporter Judge George Jeffreys Christopher Lee is the Lord Chancellor  is feared for his harsh sentences or torture  execution. Judge Jeffreys sentences Alicia Gray Maragret Lee to death for Witchcraft Jeffreys then speaks with Lord Wessex Leo Genn  discovers that his son Harry Selton Hans Hass Jr. has been having an affair with Alicia's sister Mary Maria Rohm  is known to be in contact with rebels. Mary  Harry help the upcoming invasion by Monmouth in hope of overthrowing King James II  William of Orange taking his place Jeffreys suspects that Harry is a traitor  fears for his own position if King James was ever defeated but Jeffreys falls for Mary. As the fighting across England intensifies  the rebels gain in strength  number  start winning Jeffreys orders the execution of 500 known traitors in a sign of defiance including Harry  Mary...This Liechtenstein Spanish German  Italian coproduction was directed by the prolific exploitation  sleaze merchant Jess Franco now I have never hid the fact that I think Jess Franco is one of the two worst director's ever along with Jim Wynorski but with a resume totaling two hundred odd films even Franco was going to make one or two good ones  The Bloody Judge is definitely one of his best films. Obviously made to cashin on the success of Witchfinder General 1968 the central figure here is Judge George Jeffreys who was a real person he was apparently nicknamed 'The Hanging Judge'  was widely know for the cruelty of his sentences. Even if the central character is somewhat historically accurate the film itself isn't which is unsurprising given that Franco is a talentless hack I just love insulting the guy sorry. For instance the Monmouth rebellion actually failed  I seriously doubt he fell in love with a young girl. Anyway The Bloody Judge is a real mixed bag of genres with large doses of costume drama historic epic biography horror sleaze sex  war film with none particularly gelling together that well. The torture scenes look out of place between the rather dull historical dramatics  none of the character's come across that well for instance Judge Jeffreys is fairly one dimensional as the script never tries to dig into his psyche or flesh him out as a person. Why was he the way he was? Was he just a sadistic  cruel man who hid behind the law to satisfy his brutal fantasies  desires? Did he genuinely believe that what he was doing was right? The script never even tries to answer this. Lasting for about 100 minutes  although perfectly watchable the majority of The Bloody Judge is quite dull sure there are occasional scenes of torture nudity  execution to spice things up a bit but The Bloody Judge is largely a fairly slow moving historic period drama with blackmail betrayal treason rebellions secret love affairs corruption  abuse of power  lots of people riding around on horseback.Released under a plethora of titles including Night of the Blood Monster Throne of the Blood Monster Trial of the Witches Witch Killer of Broadmoor  Witches' Trial among other's.

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I've found some time to post my thoughts on this film. I had already discussed it briefly with Francesco via email in Italian but this thread has been quite revealing for me as well.Well to begin with I did not find the film to be as bad as many have claimed and I see that Francesco hasn't changed his mind in this regard dull and uninvolving it may be but it is also intermittently enjoyable particularly Christopher Lee and Leo Genn's numerous confrontation scenes for what it is. Even when considering the very few Jess Franco movies I've managed to watch in this one year I wouldn't classify THE BLOODY JUDGE 1970 among his best work moreover it never quite approaches let alone reach the cinematic quality of Michael Reeves' far more psychologically compelling WITCHFINDER GENERAL 1968 witness the two films' very different conclusions  in Franco's film the villain is justly 'punished' for his crimes while the two lovers emerge unscathed and the 'revolutionaries' triumphant a pretty bland 'happy ending' if you ask me WITCHFINDER GENERAL still has one of the bleakest wrapups to a film I've ever seen spoilers ahead I'm afraid! Ian Ogilvy driven overtheedge by the social and personal injustices he has witnessed including the unrepentant deflowering of his girl Hilary Dwyer by the dastardly Vincent Price savagely hacking the latter to pieces with an axe while the former tied up in a castle dungeon looks on horrified as much for what is happening before her as the awful realization that the couple's 'pure' love has been inevitably and permanently scarred by the experience and screaming her lungs out  on which the scene freezes! Quite a difference no?To get back to THE BLOODY JUDGE I think that Christopher Lee's uncommitted performance he may have been interested in the project initially but no doubt his enthusiasm dissipated considerably when he realized that no serious attempt at authenticity would be made. Besides because Lee's character is so rigid a motif visually counterpointed by his hardly ever emerging outdoors thus appearing constantly cramped as much by his surroundings as by his own physical condition the very Word of the Law he exercises and the implacable religious fervor prevalent at the time his role is nowhere near as iconic as Vincent Price's had been no matter what the DVD's liner and sleeve notes claim! The film's saving graces basically lie in Manuel Merino's lush cinematography economically the production was mostly shot on real locations and Bruno Nicolai's sprawling yet melancholic score. However I feel that Franco the auteur was not really inspired by the material at hand resulting in an almost completely impersonal direction in fact it only comes alive inside the creepylooking Howard Vernon's dungeontorture chamber where Margaret Lee's ordeal is particularly striking eliciting another fine if alltoobrief performance from an underrated EuroCult actress of the 1960s but then the sudden change in style and emphasis is extremely jarring as if these scenes had strayed from a totally different picture! The nudity especially the entirely gratuitous romanticinterludeinthehay between Maria Rohm and Hans Hass Jr. even if not explicit was quite unnecessary here even the notorious 'forced lesbian sequence' though exquisitely filmed doesn't really belong here. Regarding the latter I tend to share Glenn Erickson's viewpoint as expressed in his 'DVD Savant' review of the film 'The moment pointed out by liner notes writer Tim Lucas as 'incredible transgressive erotica' is a bafflingly inane scene where Maria Rohm licks the blood from the body of a hanging female corpse. The display is so pitiful it isn't even pornographic. It is beautifully scored by Bruno Nicolai however.'The way I see it Rohm performed this dubious and quite irrelevant act of her own free will or perhaps more accurately in spite of herself  that is driven to such an extremity of degrading behavior by the sheer physical and psychological torture she has gone through in Vernon's custody. But then this scene is immediately followed by the one in which she is seduced by Judge Jeffreys himself and where she apparently regains enough of her senses to want to kill him! Which brings me to this part of one of Francesco's earlier posts in this same thread'As usual I'm in absolute minority in valuing THE BLOODY JUDGE as the worst of the three bad Franco films of the CHRISTOPHER LEE COLLECTION. But in order to explain on the basis of what criteria and valuationscales I rate this film even lower than the Fu Manchus I want to make one only example the scene in which Mary attempts to stab Jeffreys. He's turning his back to Mary she grasps the dagger and runs towards the Judge who doesn't realize what's happening then she lifts up her arm and finally ..... finally does she stab him? no instead of stabbing him she stops her arm and cries!!! obviously the man turns round and disarms her putting at end one of the most embarrassing Franco's sequences ever even worse than SADOMANIA's stuffed crocodile IMO.'Well in Franco's defence I'm sure that having Mary Gray hesitate and cry out at such a crucial moment could only be a sign of her essentially virtuous character she OUGHT to find the act of murder repellent no matter what Jeffreys did to her and that is exactly why I feel the preceding 'erotic interlude' to be so uncharacteristic! Still Francesco I can think of any number of far more embarrassing moments in either of Franco's Fu Manchu filmsP.S. By the way I've just watched the trailers for Blue Underground's upcoming DVD editions of Franco's THE GIRL FROM RIO 1969 and SADOMANIA 1981 and I must say that I'm less than intrigued by them  especially when considering that for some reason they seem to have a higher pricetag than the standard BU fare! It WOULD be nice to collect all of BU's Franco titles  including the disappointing MARQUIS DE SADE'S JUSTINE 1968 which I did watch or rather Anchor Bay UK's R2 equivalent though only as a rental  but at least in the case of the two awful Fu Manchu films I had an excuse to buy them that excuse of course being THE BLOODY JUDGE itselfeven if the remaining title in 'The Christopher Lee Collection' CIRCUS OF FEAR 1966 is actually superior!I refer to other quotes from online reviews I have read of this DVD Glenn Erickson once again hits the nail on the head sorry Tim with the following stance'Even less understandable is the championing of Jess Franco's direction which is only slightly better than his sloppy work on the Fu Manchu series. The liner notes make the laughable assertion that the battle scene herein proves that Franco was clearly the auteur behind the muchapplauded knight's battle in CAMPANANDAS A MEDIANOCHE CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT the great Orson Welles film on which Franco assisted. The generic and lackadaisical fight in the woods here looks like random coverage. We have no idea who is fighting who or which side our rebel heroes are on. If the color costumes and location weren't such a good match we might think it was stock footage from another show. Franco may very well have done the excellent unique battle scene in the Welles film but I doubt it and wouldn't trust Franco's word on the matter. THE BLOODY JUDGE would be the last film to suggest a connection.'Having only recently viewed Welles' Shakespearean masterwork for the first time myself I was immediately struck by the realism of the battle sequence its roughandready quality as much the result of a limited budget as Welles' own penchant for skimping over the 'details'. Still I could detect little if any similarity to what Franco shot for the later film it's one thing to provide a hastilyassembled skirmish viewed from both sides but another thing entirely to do so in style and the equivalent scenes in THE BLOODY JUDGE struck me as very ordinary indeed!And this from the 'Monsters At Play' review penned by Carl Lyon 'This group which include a guy named Satchel? and one of the creepiest executioners ever even have a calligraphic letter 'J' emblazoned on their chest like demented superheroes.'This anachronistic flourish is perhaps an amusing reference to the many vaguely cartoonish spyspoofs Franco made during this same era including the two Fu Manchus thus linking the roguesinhighplaces of yesteryear  flanked by their amoral henchmen who seem to have crawled from under stones  to the powermad villains of modern times and their endless parade of 'faceless' subordinates.My rambling thoughts on this film lead me now to examine some of its more noticeable deficiencies  first of all the double irony of the ending as it stands now  Jeffreys awaiting to be executed but dying instead of a heart attack  was probably unintentional but the fact that three separate endings were shot and used for different versions which is not the same as having a more explicit take of a given scene speaks volumes about the film's essential lack of focus resulting in audience frustration and subsequent detachment none of the characters is very interesting and the two that are  Lee and Genn  are poorly developed Maria Schell's gravesounding blind woman is an unfortunate miscalculation in my opinion especially as she doesn't add that much to the proceedings why is there such a VITAL need then for the young lovers' union to be blessed by her rendering their capture by Jeffreys' men alltooconvenient! the incessant mumbling of peasantfolk at Jeffreys' trials is positively irritating!Finally we come to the DVD itself picture and sound quality are of the standard we have come to expect from Blue Underground. The extras are a well of information and entertainment the controversial featurette is a very well done piece perhaps the best one yet on a FrancoBlue Underground DVD.In all fairness Christopher Lee did not deserve the backlash that he received for his comments first of all he admits that he doesn't like the 'modern' trend in horror films and therefore he is right in claiming that he has not made one for a long time as for his 'disgust' at the exploitative content of the film itself as well as Franco's subsequent work he is only offering his personal opinion and so none of us should take offence! What IS rather hard to believe however is that he did not know such scenes were in the script to begin with it's true he isn't in any of the footage concerned at least physically but really the script is so filled with this execrable material that I doubt they were added later  unless he only read his lines when given the script or else he accepted the part without reading it at all which then means that he got all that he deserved!It's a pity that the lengthy deleted scene could not be reinstated into the film probably due to its ragged state as it certainly smooths the passage from Rohm's grief over her sister's death to her blooming romance with Hass which is now rather too precipitous. The rest of the supplements  alternate footage trailer posterstills gallery talent bios  are rather nice to have too.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all Night Of The Blood Monster is a stupid and misleading title. Bloody Judge is exactly what the excellent Christopher Lee portraits in this big budget yeah Jess Franco with money!?! witch hunting flick. The plot is almost the same as Mark Of The Devil and Witchfinder General also from that period. It's beautifully shot and filled with impressive battle scenes and lots of politics based on a true story!. If you see the uncut LBX version you'll get a sleazeorama of torture nudity whipping etc. Franco regular Howard Vernon is overthetop as the chief torturer made me think of Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein!. Franco and Lee should be proud of this film think of that when you're watching Francobombs like Golden Temple Amazons and Man Hunter. Vintage Eurohorror at it's best!".

Bloody Judge is exactly what the excellent Christopher Lee portraits in this big budget yeah Jess Franco with money!?! witch hunting flick. The plot is almost the same as Mark Of The Devil and Witchfinder General also from that period. It's beautifully shot and filled with impressive battle scenes and lots of politics based on a true story!. If you see the uncut LBX version you'll get a sleazeorama of torture nudity whipping etc. Franco regular Howard Vernon is overthetop as the chief torturer made me think of Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein!. Franco and Lee should be proud of this film think of that when you're watching Francobombs like Golden Temple Amazons and Man Hunter. Vintage Eurohorror at it's best!";

The story is set against the background of William Of Orange  he of Battle Of The Boyne fame trying to get his hands on the English crown and the political intrigue involving the fall out . The narrative then revolves around Judge Jeffries and isn't a million miles removed from the feel of WITCHFINDER GENERAL . That said if you've seen Michael Reeves 1968 movie and compare it to this one you start understanding why the prior film gains its sometimes bewildering reputation as an under looked classic horror drama . Reeves film was shot in English locations and had a rather effective performance from Vincent Price as Matthew Hopkins which many people consider Price's career highlight . Here however it's painfully obvious the locations are filmed in Europe with mountains in the background which isn't a common geographical characteristic of the Hampshire countryside . There's also obvious dubbing which means the over emphatic regional accents gives the film an unintentional feeling of Monty Python rather than serious horror".

	schema:reviewBody "Sir Christopher Lee is excellent in this period drama from legendary cult filmmaker Jess Franco. The setting is 17th century England during a period of civil unrest. Lee stars as Judge George Jeffreys a harsh and unforgiving character who tries various unfortunate people for such things as witchcraft and treason. He shows no favoritism even going after Harry Selton Hans Hass Jr. the son of his associate Lord Wessex Leo Genn and Harry's beloved Mary Gray Maria Rohm. It's all in the name of indulging his political ambitions and sexual desires.Some Jess Franco fans will end up less than satisfied as this isn't as utterly sleazy as much of Francos' 1970s output. Have no fear though there are a couple of torture scenes albeit not nearly as graphic as what we would see today a bit of female nudity and one memorable scene of depravity. In this viewers' own humble opinion this can rank right up there with Francos' best as this is a slick and meticulous film with fine production values decent action scenes and an exemplary cast. Considering its themes it would make a fine companion piece with Michael Reeves' Witchfinder General.Lee may not be playing a very nice guy but he's extremely commanding as always and we even get to hear some of Jeffreys' inner monologue as he decides that the ends are justifying his means. The always wonderful Genn who replaced Dennis Price provides indelible support. Franco regular Howard Vernon Milo Quesada Margaret Lee and Pietro Martellanza all help to add gravitas to the proceedings. And the ladies are quite lovely to look at especially Rohm another frequent player in the Franco filmography.This might not be to every Franco fans' tastes but if one doesn't care too much for his trashier output they're advised to seek this one out. The alternate title Night of the Blood Monster does it no favors as it makes it sound like it's a horror film which it really is not.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:headline " A handsomely mounted but somewhat lifeless historical drama from Jess Franco";
	schema:reviewBody "In observance of Christopher Lee's passing I decided to rewatch this Jess Franco film  one of several Franco made for the lovably shady Harry Alan Towers. I last saw it ten years ago and all I remembered was a then shocking scene in which Lee's handdouble molests an accused witch in exchange for her lover's life. The film is set during and after the Monmouth Rebellion during which the Duke of Monmouth the illegitimate son of Charles II attempted to depose James II and claim the English crown. The real life conflict is pretty interesting and parallels modern events in several ways but the film follows a different path. In the wake of the surprisingly successful Witchfinder General 1968 producers scrambled to cash in on it by making increasingly sleazy and violent witchhunting films. Thus a legitimately interesting historical figure and his political dealings are sidelined by fictitious nonsense about torturing and executing witches. The film is sumptuously photographed by Manuel Merino features a typically great soundtrack by Bruno Nicolai and is skillfully directed by Jess Franco who was reaping the benefits of the bigger budgets that Towers afforded him but the pedestrian script derived from a story by Towers lets the film down. The scenes of torture lack the disturbing authenticity of their equivalents in Witchfinder General and they're certainly not sleazy enough to compete with other classics of this subgenre Franco would explore similar ground to far greater success with The Demons 1973. Thankfully Lee is in fine form here bringing his usual presence and professionalism. While the dolled up women fail to convince as Restorationera witches Lee's diligent research and attention to detail result in a frighteningly plausible human monster Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys the Bloody Judge of the title. In an interview included on my DVD he talks about how much of his performance is based around the painful kidney ailments Jeffreys suffered in real life. This is never directly referenced in the film but it demonstrates the thoughtfulness and dedication that Lee brought to the table even when the producer was more interested in making money than exploring history.In short I would mostly recommend this only to diehard fans of Lee or Franco. There are several more interesting movies of this type and certainly better ones to explore from either man's oeuvre including the several projects they made together. On that note skip this one and watch Eugenie...the Story of Her Journey Into Perversion 1970 instead.".

Jeffreys by historical account was a severe issuer of justice in the wake of Monmouth's rebellion and up until the Glorious Revolution. His portrayal as the stern lustful judge is welldone but the rest of the film is just mixed up.While I always appreciate a nice nude scene there were some in this film that were just there to keep the audience interested. Some of the torture scenes are heavily erotic in terms of the BDSM aspect. Including a scene where the main female character licks the body of a chained and tortured and nude woman. It is a rather long scene and really makes no sense...The jailers had been ordered to bring this woman to the judge but instead they strip her down and she voluntarily decides to give another woman a tonguebath while they eagerly watch. It was a bad porno intro scene if you ask me.Anyway...there is some history here...Monmouth's Rebellion and the politics of the Glorious Revolution play a role but not enough of one to make this an interesting film.The horror aspect is really not there...the torture scenes are not horrifying scantily clad beauties being randomly tortured isn't enough to classify this as a horror film.The love story is odd as well...highly unlikely that a nobleborn man would fall in love with a 'wench' from the town. And that story is interspersed with everything else not giving it enough room to grow even if it were plausible.You can probably go without seeing this movie...also the version I saw had a couple of sections where the dialogue went German with English subtitles. This occurred at the especially graphic sex and sextorture scenes leading me to believe that the original of this movie had those edited out to avoid a XXX rating or a ban by some nations.

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually one of Jess Franco's better films a relatively high budget goes a long way in creating some authentic locations and costumes in this historical drama. The film is also refreshingly free well not totally of the pointless zoom shots of which Franco was so proud. The original title was NIGHT OF THE BLOOD MONSTER but as there are no monsters involved it seems to bear little relation to the film and THE BLOODY JUDGE is indeed far more apt. Christopher Lee plays the cruel judge who has blood on his hands as he finds all suspected witches guilty and sends them to be burnt alive.The film is very similar storyline to WITCHFINDER GENERAL an obvious influence as well as MARK OF THE DEVIL. The film has a lot going in its favour but ultimately it fails to be a masterpiece due to the confusing editing and disjointed feel to the whole thing. While the threadbare plot is nothing new it gives ample opportunity for Franco to delight in what he likes best naked women and plenty of torture scenes including a woman being whipped and the most winceinducing a bloodied woman stretched on the rack.Christopher Lee gives a tourdeforce performance in the title role and he's perfectly cast as the cruel tyrannical lawman. His portrayal of the corrupt and seemingly powerful leader who is plagued by inner demons is an insightful one. Lee is surrounded by some top Euro crumpet indeed Franco fills out the cast with lots of beautiful women who get variously tortured and murdered. Franco favourite Howard Vernon enjoys himself as an executioner.Those who enjoyed the aforementioned classic with Vincent Price will be sure to delight in this very similar film. Attention to detail is surprisingly thorough and the costumes and sets are brilliant. Without the grisly torture sequences the film would be an interesting engaging historical story of a barbaric time in Britain but with them it becomes an accurate portrayal of the violent and perverse state that the country was in. Worth seeing for Lee's memorable performance alone this may not be a very good film but it's definitely better than you might have come to expect from exploitation king Franco.".

	schema:headline " Lee's Great Performance Makes the Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Bloody Judge The 1970  12 out of 4 Jess Franco directs this tale of Judge Jeffries Christopher Lee a sadistic and evil judge who would constantly force women to be tortured and eventually burned at the stake for a variety of crimes but mostly stuff to do with Satan. After sending an innocent woman Margaret Lee to her death her sister Maria Rohm joins forces with a man Hans Hass Jr. and the two plan on bringing the judge down. THE BLOODY JUDGE has been shown in countless versions over the years and even when it was first released it seemed like every country got their own version. Some focused more on the story while others focused on either the sex or violence. The edition released by Blue Underground clocks in at 104minutes and it's certainly the longest that's ever been released and includes a few torture sequences including one where Rohm is forced to lick the blood off of another woman. This film has several problems with it but overall it's a fairly good movie and one really could argue that it's one of the best films technically speaking that Franco has ever made. The budget was cut short before production but the director still manages to get some pretty good stuff including the cinematography which makes the film seem like a bigger budgeted film. Another major plus are all the sets and costumes which again make the film look much more expensive than I'm sure it was. We also get a very good musical score by Bruno Nicolai. Franco's direction is able to build up a pretty good atmosphere as you really do feel as if you're back in the days where this sort of thing goes on. Of course it doesn't hurt that you've got Lee delivering one of the best performances of his career as the sadistic judge. Lee might object to the violence gore and nudity but when he's on the screen he's certainly giving it his all. You can just look into his eyes and it's as if the actor is possessed with the spirit of Jeffries because he's just so cruel and cold in the part. Rohm is as beautiful as ever and does a nice job in the role of an innocent woman who finds herself being tortured and raped. Hass is rather bland in his role but we do get Howard Vernon playing one of the torturers. The nudity level is quite high and if you're easily offended you should be warned that a lot of it comes from women being chained up and tortured. The violence is also fairly high but while it's more graphic than something like WITCHFINDER GENERAL it's still miles short of what we'd see in other films like this including MARK OF THE DEVIL. The one major flaw with the film is the fact that it runs too long and there are way too many slow spots where nothing much is happening. It also doesn't help that it's really hard to care for any of the characters. With that said even those who spit on Franco should find enough here to enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "My review is based on the recent DVD release which is more explicit than the version released in theaters. However both versions were rather explicit.I am not the most prudish person out there so don't automatically think I am just a nut based on my summary. Saying the film is 'rather pornographic' is not something I say lightly and I am surprised that none of the other reviewers found this film offensive. But in addition to having a lot of nudity some very explicit most of this nudity was sadistic in natureshowing women getting raped or being tortured. Woman after woman appeared in the film naked or seminaked and drenched in blood while being brutalized. Now the film was about the evil abuses of the British courts in the late 17th centuryso some brutality is inevitable. However women are simply objectsobjects to be brutalized for some voyeuristic fantasy.The film is about a particularly evil judge Christopher Lee who takes great delight in sentencing people to death and maltreatment. While he personally doesn't even see the results of his sentences he knows what sort of atrocities his men do and he is completely indifferent. In addition late in the film he rapes a comely prisonerso he's obviously a pretty horrible person. Most of the film consists of either showing women being savaged or showing the 'good guys' in their crusade to rid the country of an incompetent king James II as well as his evil minions including Lee.While this COULD have been a very good film after all it's a very important part of British history that's been mostly ignored in movies it isn't. It is excessive and gross throughout. The actors appear to try their best with the material but how can actors get noticed when the film has little plot at times and lots of drooling sickos molesting and beating women? Even if you are a fan of Christopher Lee like me I can't recommend the film. However if you'd like a similar and not quite as excessive film try watching Vincent Price's WITCHFINDER GENERAL 1968. While not exactly the same plot it doesn't mention the transition from James II to William of Orange during the revolution as it was set about 40 years earlier in history and also a bit graphic it is about an evil judge who delights in torture and rape to deal with witches...or pretty much anyone who doesn't do his bidding. And fortunately the film doesn't feel like a snuff filmlike THE BLOODY JUDGE Il trono di fuoco.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to Michael Herbig's Wickie movie was written and directed by Christian Ditter. Herbig one of Germany's most famous comedians did not return to the action here. But it did not really hurt the film it rather helped it. Herbig's small role in the first film was pretty cringeworthy and the script is not worse than the one from the first film either. There the kids were abducted here Wickie's father is. Ditter worked on the Vorstadtkrokodile duology before two other German kids films.Maybe the best part about this film here is Valeria Eisenbart playing a viking girl who looks more like a pirate girl. Her character adds a lot to the film and may also have been the main reason why she was cast for the Fnf Freunde films afterward. Wickie's love interest from the first film is also back but plays a smaller role here. However Eisenbart cannot really save the film. The humor is fairly weak again and there were quite a few cringeworthy scenes for example when Wickie is announced the new leader and captain of the tribe in the absence of his father. The Eskimo scenes felt truly random. The animation with the sparkling stars did not fit the situations at all and the grande finale in the ice cave did not really wow me either. The main antagonist is played again by the late Gnther Kaufmann. Hmmerle in the lead role is decent but also forgettable for the most part. If you are familiar with German cinema you will find Christian Ulmen Elyas M'Barek and a few more known actors in very small roles.The best thing about this film apart from Eisenbart was maybe the music. The Ein bisschen Frieden sequence was good and the Hey Wickie main theme was also a lot better than in the first film.There are many great German kids films these days such as the aforementioned Fnf Freunde movies but the two Wickie films are sadly not among them. It does not look like they will make a third one anytime soon and I'm fine with that. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fun kids film thats enjoyable when you have kids around.Before I review few words please to let you know that I am just sharing this review to keep up with my discipline of writing and sharing reviews as and when I see a film in a theater or on Big Screen. I caught up with this film yesterday night at the Children's film festival at Lalitha Kala Thoranam with my nephew and my sister. It was fun in many ways to be seeing kids film with so many kids around. This is a German film and I am surprised how many kids gathered to see this and my nephew was interpreting most of the film perfectly fine I was in awe with the knowledge and ideas todays kids have. The movie is a fable like story where a boy loses his father to an evil man and must get him back. It was a simple enough story that was made interesting by some wonderful shots. It is an adventure that shot akin Harry Potter. I believe so many will mostly like this considering the simplicity it has. The film is done simply with noble intention of presenting a story with a moral. The boy rises above odds and uses his powers and gets back his father and wins over the evil. The production qualities were good and certain shots made in Computer Graphics were amazing. The art direction was great too. But I am not over impressed by the story as it is more a common place story than a different or a special one which you might expect at a film festival. Also I loved a few dialogs which were humorous. The acting by most actors was very funny even silly and yet so apt. It's good that most of the acting brought out laughs.I am going with 35 with this film. Above all I loved the atmosphere and watching kids laughing and screaming at movies.".

	schema:headline " Worthy tribute to Conrad's writing and philosophy";
	schema:reviewBody "Konrad Korzeniowski at age 15 ran away from his native Poland to seek fortune in the world  the same as Yanko Gooral in this film  and fetched up at Marseilles. There he signed on as crewman on a merchant vessel and spent the next 15 years sailing the seven seas. At 30 years of age he landed in London and decided to settle. He married and began writing novels  in English. Now what kind of English he learnt aboard merchant sailing ships late in the 19th Century might well be imagined Greeks Italians Chinese Filipinos Indians Galicians.........  However his novels are among the greatest literary achievements in literature in the English language. His first novel near 1900 but as he had not been schooled in the Victorian style his narrative was entirely different. Basing himself on his own experiences roaming the wild and wide seas where he even went through a shipwreck his novels were on the one hand resounding novels of adventure if not of the swashbuckler type but backed up by that deeply rooted Russian philosophical sense of feelings and human emotions. His novels are not simply yarns' as such nor are they simply romantic nouvelles' nor are they simply autobiographical they are combination of all these and much more. Today among the best pieces of literature ever written in English we have Lord Jim' and Nostromo' two gigantic tales with superb human and humane backgrounds.Simply watching a film based on a Joseph Conrad novel is not enough to reveal all the invisible profound thoughts the real human philosophy of life how humans think and react under different situations. To really understand this author it is imperative that you slowly read and digest his works. Perhaps you should start with Almayer's Folly' before embarking on the two previously mentioned masterpieces.However Swept from the Sea' based on his story Amy Foster' does wonderfully well in not only showing the story but also giving us a glimpse into the powerful thinking of Joseph Conrad. This point was evidently on Ms. Beeban Kidron's mind when she set out on making this film. Ably helped by her cast the result is pretty good even more than good. Vincent Perez is not bad even quite good at times Rachel Weisz has made the job of her life in a highly concentrated reading and the supporting cast like Ian McKellar and Kathy Bates is topnotch stuff. The filming sequences on the Cornish coast in the deep south west of England especially with the fog curling round the forelands and creeping up the inlets and into the harbours or in the pouring rain gives excellent ambientation to the telling of the story. John Barry's musical apportation was the same as always such that if I had closed my eyes I might well have been watching Dances With Wolves' qv however it fitted in with the proceedings and the photography well enough.Filmed on the wild coastline of Cornwall southwest England now tamed by the August hordes of campers and footpathers carvanners and English language learners IMDb lists Pentire Point on the northern coastline but I cannot help thinking that I saw some village streets such as in Mullion Coverack or even Mousehole pronounced muzzle on the south coast of that beautiful holidaying area of England. The famous author John Le Carr also has his home down there.This is a film worth seeing even for the most pedantic and enthusiastic readers of Conrad's novels such as I precisely because I think Conrad himself would have been quite pleased with Ms. Kidron's work with Tim Willocks' very correct adaptation for the screen.  But whatever happens do not pass up reading and seeing Conrad's Masterpiece converted into a masterpiece for TV Nostromo 1996 mini qv.".

If you have felt like the outsider ever tried to shut off your emotions in order to stop others from hurting you  you will have no trouble relating to the character of Amy Foster.  The acting was well done I am not an expert at English dialects although I'd say the accents were as adequately done as the actors who attempted the Newfie accent in The Shipping News.  I love historical tales Jane Austen is a favourite and thoroughly enjoyed this one as well. 8 out of 10".

If I can say nothing else I would like to say I'm glad that I was allowed the opportunity to watch it. Ian McKellen as always created a spectacular character. His character Kennedy is the physician in the town that the main character Yanko washes up on. Kennedy is thoughtful and well presented. Another example of these magical characters within this story is Miss Swaffer played by Kathy Bates.

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie because I was trying to watch as many Rachel Weisz movies as possible inspired by her acting in The Mummy Returns.  I must say this movie is a gem I would have otherwise missed. I think this movie is all about subtlety of character.  The whole enigma around Amy Foster exists only because people don't appreciate the subtleties of her personality and interactions with others.  As Dr. Kennedy says in his narration her silence was not out of inaction or stupidity rather it was a way of communicating either disdain disinterest or disapproval for how others were treating her.  Amy's main way of communicating aside from her silence was through her eyes.  Even though Yanko learned to speak English he also appreciated and learned to communicate in Amy's own language. I liked Vincent Perez's acting in this movie.  His Russian accent was pretty authentic.  The other British accents seemed to be mixed between various regions. I'd say this is probably the best acting I've seen out of Rachel Weisz in the five of her movies I've seen.  However I notice that those expressions which I felt were so striking in this movie for this character are rather stereotyped expressions that she uses in general.  I don't know whether that is what the directors are looking for or if this is one of the few acting flaws that Ms. Weisz might yet overcome. Overall score 810".

If you listen carefully to what he is actually saying in the movie he is speaking Ukrainian. For example in the scene later in the movie in which he is feverish he keeps repeating a phrase over and over again. The phrase that he is saying is Dai meni vodi. In English translation he is saying Give me some water. In addition the immigration details of his circumstances and trip would fit with immigration from Ukraine or borderlands between Ukraine and Poland although he is not speaking Polish at the turn of the century. He plays chess which would be consistent with Ukrainian heritage among others. Finally his clothing and the type of dance he does with his son is Ukrainian in style. The expansive arms and the gentleness with which he is dancing speaks more of a Ukrainian dance style than a Russian style. However the most obvious and relevant point is that the language he is speaking in the film is Ukrainian not Russian. Unfortunately many people confuse Russian culture with Ukrainian and other East European peoples. IMDb probably should correct its description of this film for accuracy.".

The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. In regards to the type of story and the setting I can't help but think that a threepart miniseries would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film. I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character.".

The locals are smallminded. Rachel Weisz shows her quiet sadness acting skills. There is plenty of death and tragedy. The start is too slow. It doesn't need to do the flashforward. It doesn't need to show Yanko's homeland. All it really needs to start are the bodies washing ashore. The style could also be more epic.

Although her character is largely silent throughout this film she has enormous screen presence standing out even amongst this allstar cast.I won't comment too much on the plot as I am sure it means different things to different people but we enjoyed the humanity and liberal views of the doctor and the squire and the contrast with the ingrained xenophobia of the working men  perhaps a bit trite since this seemed to us unVictorian and closer to what you might expect in the present day but on the other hand maybe it was already in the Joseph Conrad story I don't know I haven't read it.Negative pointsother users have commented on the cinematography I found it rather flat for example the weather never seemed to change very unBritish! and I did not feel the crispness of the seaside atmosphere was captured.  The locations mostly looked to me like Yorkshire rather than Cornwall and there were few long shots usually difficult because there is an electricity pylon or other modernday eyesore in the frame but these problems can be overcome...also the accents ... Vincent Perez was particularly good but Rachel Weisz was too wellspoken for a servant girl does her accent ever change?? and none of the farmers or fishermen seemed to have a Cornish accent ... except Zoe Wanamaker made a halfdecent effort.".

The shortest way I can describe it is Amy has a sad family secret which makes her the 'outcast' of the town. Yanko is a Ukrainian that is the sole survivor of his ship wreck. As his language is so odd to the people of Cornwall they just assume that he is dim in the head. They are both outcasts. Amy Foster feels for him as they are both living in their hard  outcast time and he falls for her. It is so difficult for both of them just get one foot forward in their life or in any sort of a relationship with their yucky surroundings. If you do not feel for this film these characters you have no soul. Post Script Ian McKellan Kathy Bates  Joss Acklund are fantastic in this movie.".

I want to say what I think about that because I have seen this situation many times in different actors and actress. I think it's not only the directors or the character but the casting.

That was all just one sentence folks!What makes the above onesentence summary such a shame is that writer Davis did seem to have some interesting ideas to convey and actor Davis conveyed some of them quite engagingly.  More frustrating still is that Director Davis did an excellent job of pacing the movie and adding cute visual ideas on a low budget and did a SUPER job of making satiric statements through wardrobe choices. Yet Director Davis hadn't a clue how to direct actor Davis who in turn threw away some of the best lines written by writer Davis.  It is unknown to what extent coProducer Davis played in the ultimate copout decisions alluded to by the others in arriving at the unsatisfying ending that left so many of us feeling betrayed or cheated. But at the same time it is clear that Julie Davis is a woman of great wit intelligence and talent that is worthy of harnessing.

I should have turned the TV off 15 minutes into this thing but sometimes I get the urge to rubberneck at ugly train wrecks like this one all the while wondering exactly how much money was wasted in producing it as well as wondering why the Sundance channel was airing it instead of a test pattern or an infomercial.".

Her grouchy publicist is a lesbian and tries to kiss her passionately out of nowhere and I'm not sure if she was trying to be funny or what. Both Amy's parents and her married friends spend all of their time talking about Amy. Everyone's lives center around Amy! Not one single scene is believable. Not one line uttered is believable.

I think she is a better DirectorWriter then Actor but her acting didn't take away from the film.This movie is a lighthearted comedy about the differences between men and women.....simple as that.";

I have to say that this film looked damn good from what I saw. I decided to rent it on a more sober evening. This film turned out to be the biggest movie rental mistake of my life.There are a few laughs to be had and I really did like the cast BUT THE STORY WAS RIDICULOUS. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!Women need a man to be complete? I am no feminismactivistman hatergirl powerfreak....but c'mon. Women NEED men and that's what makes us smarter? I like guys as much as the next redhead but women NEED men to be complete like men need us to change the channels. I mean WTF? Women and men may want each other and that's great to me but this overly needy film almost made me throw up. I didn't get this movie. First she's against men then she needs them. Then she doesn't. Then she does. Then she is controlling and giving every woman a bad name. Then she can't and won't have sex and then she does. Then she is crazy. She even got a priest to quit his job and he was happier that way.Help?! If this movie comes on cable see it. Then you can either agree with me or think I am a nut. DO NOT RENT IT. I'll never get my 4.10 back and I am sad about it. I should note that I expected to LOVE this movie. How disappointing is that?".

	schema:headline " Every romance has a climax. I am sorry but this movie only brings back bad memories.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood had to bring out a movie just like this one. Firstly the name used for me had to be the name then the topic following the name is also very creepy and ironic. I will explain later why I feel the way I do about this movie and what I will describe are the thoughts and ideas that I have had when it comes to the whole deal that I guess is Amy's Orgasm'.Amy Mandell is a sophisticated beautiful 29yearold selfhelp author who having been burned by men over and over has made it her mission to convince women that they don't need men to feel fulfilled. Desperately lonely and having trouble practicing what she preaches Amy meets Matthew Starr a shock jock known for his sexist onair antics irresistible charm and sexual prowess. Amy finally throws down her guard and dares to experience the most elusive orgasm of all love.  This movie was written and directed by its star Julie Davis which created some problems for me. Firstly the screenplay while not being completely bad had some downfalls. At times the main character of Amy was hard for to me like or even understand. While some of the other characters were a bit too much such as Amy's parents and her priest who I feel is the most unrealistic character I have seen in a movie for a long time. Then look at what was contained in the movie's screenplay with all these different notions of love and relationships. In the end I felt that the story overanalysed love and started to become boring repetitive predictable and confusing.  Davis did a pretty good job in directing the movie although I did have problems with her overall visions for the film. I was not a big fan of the way that we hear all these various voices churning through Amy's head as they really do show that this girl has no right to give out advice on love when she is totally confused on the issue herself. However I did like the movie's preempting about what sorts of situation Amy might like to be in via her very deep sexual fantasies. Amy Mandell Davis is a woman famous for writing a book called Why Love Doesn't Work' loved by many thousands of women but widely criticised by the media. It was a very open role from Davis as she would show herself in many personal predicaments and then would also talk about many issues that most of us shrug away from.  While on her interview bandwagon Amy is interviewed by Radio DJ Matthew Starr Nick Chinlund who initially we are meant to think is a really sick jerk. But as Amy and the audience get to know Matt he shows himself to be a pretty reasonable sort of guy someone Amy could love. While I like Matt as a movie character it is all a bit too freaky for me for two reasons. One my name is Matt and the situation I found myself in just a few years ago was with a girl named Amy. This movie had to use those two names! And two I once wanted to be a radio DJ like Matt making AO seem all the more coincidental. We also meet some other interesting characters in AO. Amy's publicist Janet Gaines Caroline Aaron is a strange woman and we learn quite quickly what sort of person she is. While Amy's parents Mary Ellen Taylor and Charles Cioffi are very cold and callous when it comes to their daughter and what has happened in her life.  Yet Amy's friends young couple Don Mitchell Whitfield and Elizabeth Jennifer Bransford help their friend feel better about life and love. However the priest Jeff Cesario is character who I am sure many people would love but I did not appreciate here.This movie also reminds of other things I have seen on TV and in cinema lately. Firstly the downer for this movie is the way it brings back bad memories of a film that did not like the disgraceful 2001 Josh Hartnett film '40 Days and 40 Nights'. The area AO reminds me of that film is the stupid way it involves religion within the context of a film that deals primarily with a human view on sex just not good enough if you ask me. The other thing is how much better CBO's Sex and the City' handles all the issues involving relationships love and sex. Unfortunately AO was unsuccessful in dealing with these issues.AO also brings back some bad personal memories for me. An example of this is the moment in the film where Amy asks Matt a very personal question about his sex life. Now while most people would have no problem with questions of this nature being asked of them I have regretted admitting this to other people especially those who did not deserve to hear about it. I have also learnt that this movie's was originally titled Why Love Doesn't Work' a much better title than Amy's Orgasm in my opinion. I am a bit confused as to the change in name for the video release. If any other name had been used in this film I think I could have stomached it more than I have but by using the name AMY' it really does bring back memories for me of a person who I have forgotten. I have also forgotten the personal things that she told me about her life like her deep sexual feelings her very lurid sex life and what many of her orgasms were actually like. To say that these words and images affected me is an understatement. So a movie with this name was always going to be difficult for me to like which just so happens to be the case.CMRS gives Amy's Orgasm' 1.5 Bad  Ok Film".

An American Crime chronicles the startling and horrific events that led to the death of sixteen year old Sylvia Likens. The story we're told comes directly from the court transcripts in the case of Baniszewski vs. The State of Indiana. As the story unfolds we slowly spiral from a normal small town world populated with youthful innocence to one of absolute and inexplicable horror.The story of the events that led up to Likens' death is short and tragic with many people to fault including her own parents and sister. Her parents negligently entrusted her and her little sister's care to a woman they had only met once. This woman Gertrude Baniszewski was mother to a brood of children and accepted Sylvia and her sister into her home for the simple fact that she needed the money the Likens were offering. But Baniszewski wan't fit to care for the Likens' daughters and within a few months Sylvia had become the victim of Gertrude's escalating abuse. Sylvia eventually became a prisoner in Baniszewski's basement for an excruciating 27 days where she was abused and tortured by Baniszewski her children and also a number of other neighborhood children. How could this have happened? How could so many people be involved in such a horrible crime? How could her own sister not have gone to the police before it was too late? After Sylvia died as a result of her beatings Baniszewski's was found guilty of her crimes and sentenced to life in prison. Her children and the others involved were also found guilty and sentenced each one eventually serving two years in prison. While Baniszewski's crimes are unforgivable the thing I personally found most disturbing was how her example led to her children's and the other children's acts of cold cruel brutality.The world we are introduced to in AAC is not sensational on the contrary it is simple ordinary common and comfortable. The production design and cinematography work in harmony lulling the viewer into believing they are witness to a more innocent time and place and as the story builds the Norman Rockwell veneer slowly begins to chip away until it is displaced by a world of suffocating doom. The resulting effect is that AAC gets under our skin and disturbs us in a profound way since these crimes could have been committed in our neighborhood by our neighbors and possibly by people we knew and trusted. Most disturbing of all is the realization these crimes could have involved us.It would be easy to demonize Baniszewski and all the others involved in Likens death but writerdirector Tommy O'Haver chooses to humanize them instead. In doing so their horrible acts of abuse and torture linger and beg the recurring question how could they have done this? When we see the faces of the children in court we don't see the faces of psychopaths we see innocent children with no explanation for their actions. Only Baniszewski herself comes across as a detached delusional and remorseless criminal and Catherine Keener has to be applauded for somehow managing to add complexity and insight to someone guilty of such crimes. Keener's subtle performance aside the standout in this movie is Ellen Page who breaks our heart when we watch her stripped of her innocence.Before AAC Page drew raves for her performances in Hard Candy and Juno. In both those films she played a precocious smart assed hipster who had the world on the tip of her little finger. Here Page plays Likens as a sensitive kind and considerate sixteen year old and when the world comes crashing down upon her the suffering she endures is heartbreaking and convincingly rendered by Page. I'm sure few will agree with me but Page's breakthrough performance isn't in Juno it's in An American Crime.".

	schema:headline " A nonfiction horror film hard to watch but important";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the world premiere of An American Crime at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Among the several decidedly downbeat films I saw this past week this one was by far the hardest to watch. But something about it is compelling like craning your neck to see what horrors can be spotted at the scene of a car crash. You know it can't be anything pretty yet you can't take your eyes off it. Perhaps it was knowing that the film is in fact based on a true story. The opening courtroom scenes and disclaimer that actual transcripts were used make that clear. There's something about a true crime drama that triggers a desire to sit through whatever terrifying images lie ahead. And the images conjured up here are bonechilling.In 1965 Betty Likens Romy Rosemont and her husband Lester Nick Searcy decided it was best to leave their two daughters with a neighbor while they went off with a traveling carnival. So Sylvia Likens Ellen Page and her sister Jennie Fae Hayley McFarland settled in with the Baniszewski clan. And what a clan it was. Mother Gertrude Catherine Keener already had five of her own in tow and now she added two more. What happened then well documented in the record is now played out for us with horrifying realism.This is Keener and Page's film despite the large ensemble cast assembled for the story. And both actors create frighteningly devastating portrayals of characters we still can't quite believe really endured these horrors. Mommie Dearest doesn't hold a candle to Keener's Gertrude and Page is as heartbreaking as any victim I've seen in modern cinema. Both turn in awardwinning performances that left me with chills.In addition to the numerous family members an assortment of school chums has the opportunity to get involved in some way. Coy Hubbard Jeremy Sumpter is the boyfriend of one of the Baniszewski brood. Known to most from 2003's Peter Pan we can't help but feel that he will be the hero here. Teddy Lewis Michael Welch is an enigma from the start. One of our most prolific yet underrated young actors today Welch is perfectly cast as the boy whose blood runs hot or cold depending on the prevailing winds. Other notables include The West Wing's Bradley Whitford as prosecutor Leroy K. New.This is a period piece set in the mid60s and the costumes sets and palette of colors effectively evokes that era to a T. Much of the film's look can be attributed to the cinematography of Byron Shah who had two films here at Sundance his The GoGetter was one of my favorite film' at this year's festival.An American Crime is not for everyone. It's a horror film that isn't a work of fiction. If it was from the hand of Stephen King it would be scary and delicious. Instead it's scary and nauseating. Yet it deserves the label important because the subject matter is worthy of discussion. And that's because the horrors exposed in this film are still occurring today. That's the real crime.".

	schema:headline " A harrowing and baffling account of an unimaginable crime";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been waiting to see this film for over a year now because this is a case that has haunted me for years and I am very familiarized with the facts of the case. I finally got to see it's USA premiere on Showtime tonight. I was of course like everyone else blown away by Catherine Keener and Ellen Page's performance and was quite impressed with the caliber of talent in the entire cast. Everyone seemed to play off of each other very well and all seemed to handle the extremely difficult subject matter very maturely. There were just a few things that baffled me about the filmFirstly the soundtrack. Now I do understand that this was a 'period' piece set in the 1960's and that music from the 60's is appropriate but to me it is much more impactful to have no music at all especially during some of the more hard to watch torture scenes. Some of the music did not seem to match what was going on on screen.The other thing that baffled me was the 'dream sequence' toward the end that showed Sylvia actually escaping and reaching her parents and one of her torturers was helping her to escape. Yes I realize that this scene was added for more dramatic purposes and it was effective when it turned out to be an outofbody experience for Sylvia but I really think they could have done without this scene and dealt more closely with the actual facts of this case.Also it seemed to me that the director was trying to portray Gertrude and Paula Baniszewski as almost sympathetic characters when in reality they were monstrous in their actions and merciless with their sadistic torment of this young woman. For example Paula did hurt her hand while punching Sylvia and had to put it in a cast but in reality it did not end there because Paula used her cast to further beat Sylvia. Paula did not defend Sylvia against her mother and was in fact in some ways even more callous than her mother. An example of this would be the scalding baths that they gave Sylvia which was not touched on in the film but after these baths Paula rubbed salt into Sylvia's wounds.Gertrude was much more active in the torture in reality and she showed absolutely no remorse or even recognition for her actions until many years later at her parole hearing when she was finally released. The only person who actually did show even the slightest bit of mercy towards Sylvia during her ordeal was Stephanie a fact that is not touched on in the film. I can certainly understand why the producers would choose to leave out certain specifics of the tortures that Sylvia endured because they do not feel that an audience would believe it however if you are going to make a film like this I believe it is essential to let the viewers know the full extent of the torture she endured. Viewers need to know that after the 'church dinner' that is shown in the film Sylvia was forced to eat a hot dog with everything on it and consume her own vomit because Gertrude thought that she made a pig of herself at the picnic and NOT because she met a boy at the picnic as the film portrays. Certain specifics of the Baniszewski's everyday life were also omitted. I believe these are important elements to the case. If you are going to try to portray Gertrude as some sort of desperate housewife who was stricken by poverty and caved in to her own inner fury than the viewers need to see that the Baniszewski household had no phone no stove just a hot plate and that it's kitchen drawers had only 1 spoon. Also a vital example of just what sort of person Gertrude is would be to let the viewers know that while the children slept on dirty urine soaked mattresses and there were not enough of these for all of the occupants in the home Gertrude had a complete bedroom set in her room.Ordinarily I would not stress these facts so heavily but the producers of this film would like to lead the viewer to believe that it is based entirely on fact and they stress that with a disclaimer at the beginning of the film and while I do realize that for dramatic purposes certain things had to be added and deleted it should not dilute the fact that a young woman was murdered in a cold calculating maniacal manner the likes of which had never been heard of before and that there is absolutely no room for sympathy for her torturers especially Gertrude and Paula. Regardless of these facts I personally feel that films like this are vital viewing because they touch on subject matters that people generally do not talk about. If more people talked about them perhaps a life could have been spared here. Kudos to the director for taking on this subject matter and to Keener Page and the rest of the cast for having the courage to take on such a horrific topic.".

	schema:reviewBody "First things first 'An American Crime' is not for everyone. Even stern stomachs will feel sick with upset and aggression during this film. It isn't pleasant and being based on a true story just makes the whole picture worse. However this film is incredibly important. The horrific case of Sylvia Likens is not particularly well known in the UK which is sad but this film drums in to the viewer just how evil and sadistic Likens death was at the hands of Gertrude Baniszewski. The film tells the tale of Sylvia Ellen Page and her younger sister Jennie Faye Hayley McFarland moving into the Baniszewski household after their parents Lester Nick Searcy and Betty Romy Rosemont Likens have to extend their work as Carnival workers in the state of Indianapolis. The film then tales the true tale of horror upon Sylvia committed by Gertrude Catherine Keener and her evil children.As I said earlier this film really is hardgoing it packs a punch that most horror or psychological thrillers lack quite possibly because this is entirely based on true events rather than a fictitious narrative. It leaves the viewer with continuous emotions towards the Likens girls especially Sylvia. At some points it seems almost unbearable to watch yet you just can't take your eyes off the screen. Page delivers once again magnificently she really helps us build that all important 'audiencecharacter' bond that's needed in this picture to truly understand it. She exposes raw and powerful talent in this film almost like she is actually going through the same agony and despair as Sylvia Likens really did she is painfully convincing and yet again she fails to disappoint.Keener is also exceptionally good as Gertrude. Her performance really touches a nerve within the audience making us loathe her even more each second she is on the screen. I was also surprised just how good the child actors and actresses are in this film. McFarland is just grand as Jennie her life is so mixed she wants to defend Sylvia but is petrified of what will happen to her if she does and her performance really makes this point clear.All in all 'An American Crime' is brilliant it builds towers or tension emotion and aggression. This is the first film that's ever made me cry. This is a great film that should be seen by all but due to it's content probably won't be.".

	schema:headline " A good movie but...";
	schema:reviewBody "An American Crime is based on the true story of the murder of Sylvia Likens. The acting in the movie was superb in particular Ellen Page and Catherine Keener. Had this been a fiction story then the plot and characterization would be nothing short of fantastic. However this was NOT a fiction story and what is glaringly obvious about this film is how the writers have downplayed how evil and demented Gertrude Baniszweski truly was. The story does not cover most of the brutal torture Sylvia endured on a random basis before she was trapped in the basement. For example in reality Gertrude had a fondness for kicking Sylvia in the crotch to the point where Sylvia's autopsy showed a shattered pubic bone.This movie instead tries to portray a troubled yet at times sympathetic Gertrude. I don't agree with how the viewer is made to sympathize with Gertrude and to not view her not as a monster but as a seminormal person who was for reasons of poverty frustration and fear of society's judgment of her children driven to commit this heinous crime. I know the director was trying to avoid over the top sensationalism with this story but if you read the accounts of what ACTUALLY happened in this case you will find this movie to be quite a dulled down version. All in all it's worth viewing.".

	schema:headline " An Overlooked and Deeply Disturbing Film";
	schema:reviewBody "httpeattheblinds.blogspot.comNot many films make me feel sick to my stomach and not many make me feel such a profound sadness that I'm helpless to do anything but cry. An American Crime chronicles the startling and horrific events that led to the death of sixteen year old Sylvia Likens. The story we're told comes directly from the court transcripts in the case of Baniszewski vs. The State of Indiana. As the story unfolds we slowly spiral from a normal small town world populated with youthful innocence to one of absolute and inexplicable horror.The story of the events that led up to Likens' death is short and tragic with many people to fault including her own parents and sister. Her parents negligently entrusted her and her little sister's care to a woman they had only met once. This woman Gertrude Baniszewski was mother to a brood of children and accepted Sylvia and her sister into her home for the simple fact that she needed the money the Likens were offering. But Baniszewski wan't fit to care for the Likens' daughters and within a few months Sylvia had become the victim of Gertrude's escalating abuse. Sylvia eventually became a prisoner in Baniszewski's basement for an excruciating 27 days where she was abused and tortured by Baniszewski her children and also a number of other neighborhood children. How could this have happened? How could so many people be involved in such a horrible crime? How could her own sister not have gone to the police before it was too late?After Sylvia died as a result of her beatings Baniszewski's was found guilty of her crimes and sentenced to life in prison. Her children and the others involved were also found guilty and sentenced each one eventually serving two years in prison. While Baniszewski's crimes are unforgivable the thing I personally found most disturbing was how her example led to her children's and the other children's acts of cold cruel brutality. The world we are introduced to in AAC is not sensational on the contrary it is simple ordinary common and comfortable. The production design and cinematography work in harmony lulling the viewer into believing they are witness to a more innocent time and place and as the story builds the Norman Rockwell veneer slowly begins to chip away until it is displaced by a world of suffocating doom. The resulting effect is that AAC gets under our skin and disturbs us in a profound way since these crimes could have been committed in our neighborhood by our neighbors and possibly by people we knew and trusted. Most disturbing of all is the realization these crimes could have involved us. It would be easy to demonize Baniszewski and all the others involved in Likens death but writerdirector Tommy O'Haver chooses to humanize them instead. In doing so their horrible acts of abuse and torture linger and beg the recurring question how could they have done this? When we see the faces of the children in court we don't see the faces of psychopaths we see innocent children with no explanation for their actions. Only Baniszewski herself comes across as a detached delusional and remorseless criminal and Catherine Keener has to be applauded for somehow managing to add complexity and insight to someone guilty of such crimes. Keener's subtle performance aside the standout in this movie is Ellen Page who breaks our heart when we watch her stripped of her innocence.Before AAC Page drew raves for her performances in Hard Candy and Juno. In both those films she played a precocious smart assed hipster who had the world on the tip of her little finger. The subsequent backlash that came from the ridiculously over hyped phenomena of Juno called into question Page's ability to play anything other than what she herself seemed to be a precocious smart assed hipster with the world on the tip of her finger. I too doubted her ability to do much else but after watching ACC I'm now eating my doubt for lunch. Page plays Likens as a sensitive kind and considerate sixteen year old and when the world comes crashing down upon her the suffering she endures is heartbreaking and convincingly rendered by Page. I'm sure few would agree with me but Page's breakthrough performance wasn't in Juno it was in An American Crime.RIP Sylvia Likens 19491965".

Then you remember during portions of this movie that it was based on actual events and when the credits roll you're hit with this overwhelming since of sadness and grief that makes you want to tell your parent or parents that you love them and that you're thankful for them. While your mind processes what you've just seen it's hard because it's so shocking and real and you want to shout at the top of your lungs SAVE THIS GIRL! I guess it could just be me but it had powerful emotional effect on me. I've seen other movies about true stories but other than Schindler's List nothing had such an impact until now. There was a Lifetime movie that made me angry and sickened me that turned out was fictional that I wished they would have said before the movie began its not based on actual events. My advice is if you think you can handle the emotions you'll feel after this movie then watch it. If you don't think you can then watch it with another person.

She was starved placed in scalding baths and suffered extreme and prolonged abuse. I'm not voyeuristic but I think that the film really lacks the details of the sequence and scope of events to provide the emotional and intellectual impact that the Likens case calls for. In contrast The Girl Next Door appears to go a little too far in portraying a couple of events that may not have happened I hope!  but I believe that The Girl Next Door will leave you with a better sense of the true nature of the tragic murder of this young girl.".

	schema:reviewBody "If this movie were purely based on fiction it would still be excellent with great acting from a superb cast and competent direction and screen writing. In that case its job would be a lot easier howeverfictitious characters and the things that drive them and move them to the actions that propel the plot need to be explained and portrayed only to the point that we are willing to suspend whatever disbelief remains and to embark and go along for the ride.But the events depicted in this movie are true if anything they are understated. As the unbelievable and at times unbearable cruelty and hypocrisy unfolds before our eyes we want to know how this senseless purposeless meaningless crime could have happened we want to know why. Of course we will never really know the answer but this movie gives it a shot and with some success. Keener has the difficult job of portraying a monstrous character in a way that let's us get an insight into her side of the story no matter how sick wrong confused and depraved it may be. There are times when we might even feel a degree of empathy for that creaturean enormous feat for Keener considering that her character is a woman who tortured and murdered a defenseless child given into her care for no particular reason whatsoever. The choice of Keener for this role has been criticized on the grounds that she is too attractive compared to woman she plays but to me it seems that this is a good thing and an example of downplaying some less important aspects of the real case to help us get access to its essence. Making her look less repulsive than the real Gertrude makes it easier for us to get in touch with her and to care at least a little about her.Sylvia the victim is played by Page who runs the gamut from carefree teenager to resignated torture victim and adds another topnotch performance to her already impressive resume. Her character does not have to explain quite as much as Keener's but there are still some open questions we want to have answers towhy did she submit for as long as she did why did she not run away or resist in some other manner? The supporting cast though mostly young turns in some excellent work as well. The performances of McFarland Graynor and Peters are the ones that stick in my mind after watching this film depicting traits and character arcs that would not be out of place in Lord of the Flies.I wanted to give this film 910 basically to save some headroom in case something even more impressive came along. But what am I holding out for? This film is taking me on a roller coaster ride into human depravity its cast does a great job at offering haunting attempts to explain that which cannot reasonably be explained and as the credits rolled I was left bewildered incredulous outraged sad  what more can cinema do?".

As the unbelievable and at times unbearable cruelty and hypocrisy unfolds before our eyes we want to know how this senseless purposeless meaningless crime could have happened we want to know why. Of course we will never really know the answer but this movie gives it a shot and with some success. Keener has the difficult job of portraying a monstrous character in a way that let's us get an insight into her side of the story no matter how sick wrong confused and depraved it may be. There are times when we might even feel a degree of empathy for that creaturean enormous feat for Keener considering that her character is a woman who tortured and murdered a defenseless child given into her care for no particular reason whatsoever. The choice of Keener for this role has been criticized on the grounds that she is too attractive compared to woman she plays but to me it seems that this is a good thing and an example of downplaying some less important aspects of the real case to help us get access to its essence. Making her look less repulsive than the real Gertrude makes it easier for us to get in touch with her and to care at least a little about her.Sylvia the victim is played by Page who runs the gamut from carefree teenager to resignated torture victim and adds another topnotch performance to her already impressive resume. Her character does not have to explain quite as much as Keener's but there are still some open questions we want to have answers towhy did she submit for as long as she did why did she not run away or resist in some other manner? The supporting cast though mostly young turns in some excellent work as well. The performances of McFarland Graynor and Peters are the ones that stick in my mind after watching this film depicting traits and character arcs that would not be out of place in Lord of the Flies.I wanted to give this film 910 basically to save some headroom in case something even more impressive came along. But what am I holding out for? This film is taking me on a roller coaster ride into human depravity its cast does a great job at offering haunting attempts to explain that which cannot reasonably be explained and as the credits rolled I was left bewildered incredulous outraged sad  what more can cinema do?";

The sadistic and evil Gertrude decides to punish Sylvia in her descent to hell.First of all I must confess that An American Crime disturbed me. Based on the true story of a hideous crime judged in April 1966 this movie discloses the story of a poor girl that was abused tortured humiliated and killed by a dysfunctional and despicable family of monsters and their nondifferent friends. In spite of being a drama this movie is scarier than most of the horror movies because it is simple and real therefore credible and recommended for very specific audiences. The future star Ellen Page the always excellent Catherine Keener and the novice Tristan Jarred give performances that worth nominations to the Oscar. The screenplay beginning in the trial of Gertrude Baniszewski uses flashback to tell the sad story of Sylvia Likens keeps the attention until the very last scene Ellen Page's character is charismatic and sweet while Gertrude and their children their friends and even Jennie for her omission and fear are despicable monsters. Again I am fan of horror genre but I was emotionally shaken with Sylvia Likens' fate. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Um Crime Americano An American Crime".

	schema:reviewBody "What a tragedy that I will never have an opportunity to see this film in a theatre. The cast alone that includes the currently very popular Ellen Page should have merited something better than Saturday night Showtime.Because of this the impact will be blunted however even in its limited presentation the film was stunning and will easily end up among my favorites for the year. The quiet contemplation of the mood and the selection of a hideous story from postBeaver Cleaver trivial innocence prelate 1960s tumult creates a moment so far outside our expectations of this nonsense daily on 247 news channels that its impact nails you full frontal.I particularly like some of the discussions of this film that complain that it was not graphic enough and because of this didn't hit people 'in the gut.' This alone warrants a short meditation.To paraphrase one of the best commentaries I've read on this thing there is an inner sadist in all of us. America's history of violence and tolerance of violence just gives license to bring it out more often and intensely. And despite our strong sense of individuality and our braggadocio about freedom we have this very strange conformist streak. The confluence of these two conflicted tendencies can lead to bad places.This film meditates subtly and yes beautifully on all of this. By eschewing potential excesses that some complaining viewers apparently desired the story puts us in a disturbing place where we might not suspend disbelief and acknowledge the raw emotions as something potentially alive within.I believe it is this troubling recognition of possibility that branded this film in various ways keeping it from ever being seen in a theatre. By exposing it first on pay TV the unwashed masses might easily mistake it for a poorly done version of sensational MSNBC serial killer crap. Stuff like this is pleasurable to many because it lets them wallow 'down with the sickness' while pretending they are above it.There is a wonderful moment in the story when the almost involuntarily sadistic mother utters 'there are things in life we have to do whether we like them or not.' I can't help but think this was borrowed from the sadistic father figure in the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' a film that many wanted this to be so as to give them some form of absolution from their own demons 'An American Crime' exposes.".

	schema:headline " Disturbing True Story That Everyone Should Watch";
	schema:reviewBody "An American Crime was a disturbing movie about the evil within all of us. The most horrific part is that a group of people could have performed such torture to an innocent human being because they were following the commands of an imbalanced woman. It was directed by Tommy O'Haver who also directed Ella Enchanted. You wouldn't be able to tell by watching this film. It was a rendition of a shocking true story that occurred in the 1960's where a suburban mother tortured and murdered a 16year old girl. It stars Ellen Page Juno XMen and Catherine Keener Being John Malkovich The 40 Year Old Virgin as the main characters.The actors did an amazing job in bringing to light this crime that is horrifying even in today's standards. Page was believable as the illfated Sylvia Likens. She was very innocent and likable and this is coming from someone who usually can't stand her acting. When she was being tortured I believed in the pain and suffering that the real Likens probably endured. Keener played Gertrude Baniszewski with such precision that it was eerie to watch. I researched the crime and saw the real pictures of the two women and they were perfectly cast.It is disgusting that humans are so easily swayed to cause such destruction to one human being. Baniszewski's children didn't bother me because they were brainwashed by this sick woman. The neighborhood children are the ones that shocked me the most. They were evil to come to this house every day to torture this girl. You have to wonder how they were raised to have committed such an act. Maybe it's true that all of us have a bit of good and evil inside us. Caging and torturing another being is probably the most evil thing that someone can do and maybe this brought out that side out of them. It makes me even sadder that her sister didn't do anything to stop the crime. She says she was frightened. However seeing your sister hurt in that way didn't prompt you to talk to you one of your teachers or another adult about what was going on? In the real story she did talk to an older sister of hers about what was going on. The older sister contacted Child Protective Services. Nevertheless when they arrived they were told that Sylvia had runaway and her sister verified the story. I have never been put in that position but I would never allow someone to harm my two sisters in any way.I still can't stop thinking about this movie a day after watching it. It's definitely a movie to watch. I don't think I could watch it again because it was too disturbing but I'm glad that I watched it.".

Gertrude takes in laundry to support her household and requires her young children to work toward the same goal. A friction develops between Sylvia and Jenny and the children by Gertrude's illicit adventures as well as covert sexual similarities surfacing in her children and at 'family meetings' Gertrude doles out punishment for Sylvia  punishment including cigarette burns coke bottle insertions branding etc.  all of which are undeserved and eventually lead to Sylvia's imprisonment in the basement where Gertrude and her children and their friends daily torture Sylvia. Eventually Sylvia dies and Gertrude and family are brought to court for charges of firstdegree murder and variations thereof. The court proceedings under the leadership of lawyer Leroy K.

The acting is superb by both the lead actors and u do not need to actually SEE violence to understand the extent of trauma suffered by the one who is tortured. Also movies like these have a better effect if its implied rather than just shown crudely. The extent of pain felt by the real Sylvia can probably not be shown on a screen. People need to understand this instead of just abusing and cursing the movie. I have seen movies like Irreversible and Martyrs even Jack Ketchum's Girl Next Door but none of them made me as sick as An American Crime. Its surely the power of the acting and direction. Specially the scene where Gertie asks Sylvia to stick a coke bottle up her... I was SO shocked and I felt I couldn't go on watching it but the movie the subject the fact that it is her real life story sort of compels you to go ahead with it. Imagine if you can even watch it on screen... how the victim must have endured it. Hats off to the makers for letting the world know about Sylvia's story. I highly recommend each and every person to watch this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was at the world premiere of this film at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. I read the blurb in the program book but had no clue what I was in for. The film starts out with a girl talking. After you watch the film you realize it is a dead girl talking. I had no idea who Sylvia Likens was much less what she had endured as an abused 16 year old until I saw this film. Ten to twenty minutes into the film I could feel several knots in my stomach and an exhorbitant amount of rage because of the images I was watching. This film is heavy and hard to watch. So heavy that chaos errupted in the movie theatre when an audience member who sat behind me collapsed. This was not an elderly person I might ad. He yes HE was probably between 2528. At first I heard people whispering that an elderly lady suffered a heart attack then people started to scream for the lights to be turned on and for the projectionist to stop the film. The lights were turned on and the film was stopped. It almost seemed like someone had placed a bomb in the theatre because people where heading for the exit others where frightened and did not know what to do and others just sat in their chair waiting for the film to continue. Of course the next day this was the talk of the town. Back to the film. I have never seen a girl tortured in the ways Sylvia had. I love disturbing films... I watch French film all the time...but I have never seen anything like this. And I must say after watching the film I went back to my condo to look up the case on the internet and must report that the film is not exploitative. As a matter of fact it places the events quiet mildly compared to what really happened. Even though this movie is very unpleasant to watch it is important every American and foreigners alike watches this film so they will never forget what children are exposed to when abused. How little power they have and how they really depend on their caretakers to take care of them until they reach an age they can fend for themselves. We hear these cases on television almost every day of a child being abducted. But in this case the child was not abducted she Sylvia and her sister were abandoned by her parents. I believe her parents got off easy. I was so filled with rage both her parents deserved the same torture and faith Sylvia did. They made the conscious choice of bringing this girl into the world and they'd dumped her off to strangers. I'm sure they never imagined what would happened to their daughter. A lot for this case is to blame for the times they lived in. Apparently Indiana and other mid west areas where evangelical and believed in corporal punishment in those days and when they heard the torturous screams of Sylvia neighbors just thought she was getting what she deserved by being a bad girl. In there eyes she was being corrected. Besides the sick lady that took care of Sylvia the seven children that lived with her unfortunately did not know any better as they too join in the torture fest as they called upon other neighborhood kids to have fun with Sylvia by torturing her. I read on the internet that a few of the neighborhood kids to helped torture Sylvia are still alive and kicking today. One is 58 years old he was 15 at the time and apparently just recently lost his job after word about this film and his involvement in the case turned up. I hope this film helps to shed light to all of those crud of the earth who are still left on this earth living who tortured that girl when they were young and stupid so they will never forget what they did. I hope someone will always recognize them walking on the street to remind them how much of a low life and human waste of a person they are. They may be the brothes now fathers loving husbands and whatever else...but they will never stop being monsters rooted in evil who destroyed a spirit for their amuzement. Too bad they can't be tried again but there is always the judge and jury of public opinion which Im sure as long as we know who you are you will always be reminded of your heinous crimes. I applaud the filmmaker and actors for making such as exquisite well acted directed and visually engaging film. Hopefully after you have seen this film you too will never forget Sylvia.".

It is a very touching film as it forces you to see the strength it takes to protect your family from evils that are affecting you and evidently you yourself.Ellen Page's Acting is on topform in this film. She's very convincing. In fact all the acting in this film is extremely good. And the amount of violence isn't heavy at all although some people find some scenes hard to watch. However everything in the film is crucial to the story. And ultimately this is a story of a girl who was stricken by misfortune. I believe her story was told well. But I'm sure there's more to it. Although if hit by such grief I wouldn't mind warning the world of such ill adventures.Overall this film should be given a metaphorical standing ovation.

The young child is very brave but also confused and never forgets her adopted parents.  This story leaves you feeling desperate for all those involved.  The scenes of the girl in her early years with her adopted parents are very powerful and poignant.  They are so genuine and sincere in their love for the child and they hope she will never have to leave them but deep down they know that some day it will happen and it happens when they are least expecting it.  I can't imagine the pain those two people went through as well as the child and yet there is more to come.  I spent the whole film fighting back the tears I was completely absorbed by the depth of feeling.  Some have said this film was flawed in some aspects but I'm no film critic and I have to say that I was so involved with the story and first class acting that if it was flawed I didn't notice.  It is slowpaced but justly so.  I was happy with the ending and felt it resolved nicely.A note about the acting which was superb throughout.  I'm a big fan of Tony Goldwyn who is perfect in these roles.  The young Suzanne was delightful and incredibly genuine as were the adopted parents that were so authentic.  The teenage Suzanne was also very naturally interpreted and believable. All in all a fine film.".

In those respects it is flawless. There are enchanting and disturbing pictures of life in America and Hungary. The story is at once sad and heartening. It is a film of contrasts skillfully presented. It draws the emotions of the viewer along with it and evokes genuine sympathies for all the characters. That is rare in any film.A young girl is torn between her youthful memories of one world and one set of parents while trying to grow up in another world with her real family that she seems to barely know. She is caught emotionally between her memories of two diverse worlds. The conflicts come to a crisis when she is 16 and she decides that she must return to Hungary in order to resolve them. I was so enthralled by that premise and the skill with which the story was crafted that I was engrossed from start to finish. I'm not even sure if I blinked the entire time. The scenes on the Hungarian side paint a poignant picture of people trying to live under the hopelessness of the communist regime after the invasion by the Soviets in 1950.Natassja Kinski is superb. Her role is a departure from past efforts but she as always delivers a sterling interpretation of her character. But Scarlet Johansson and Kelly Endresz Banlaki really steal the show. Their performances as Suzanne are understated and genuine. There are some minor plot flaws in An American Rhapsody but they are inconsequential compared to the superb emotional ride the story provides. Watch this one for the dramatic and irresistible acting.".

It's features an amazing personal story of the early Cold Warera immigration to America of a Hungarian family and it was really incredibly done.  We love Scarlett Johansson Ghost World who plays the 15yearold but the girl who plays the lead character at age 6 is one of the most loveable child actresses ever Nastassia Kinski as the mother is great Tony Goldwyn as the dad is good the pair who play the Hungarian rural couple especially the man are fantastic.  Hungary and Budapest too play a key role.  The movie will sicken you somewhat about the Americaintheearly60s mentality sicken you because you know how much a part of all of us it is.  As one reviewer said this is no State Departmentbacked immigration story.  And it will make you fall in love with the Hungarian countryside.  It's a terrific moviegoing experience.  I cried several times throughout.Because of how little marketing and buzz the movie has generated I fear it will come and go in a flash that's why I issue this appeal.By the way don't go expecting great filmmaking techniques and perfect direction it's her first movie and mistakes were made.  But the experience if you go in the right frame of mind is great.  It's in English.".

True the ending was a bit abrupt and sappy but I thought it was a nicely made film all in all. Well acted especially by Scarlett Johansson and Kelly EndreszBanlaki who both played the central character of SuzanneZsuzsana at ages 15 and 6 respectively.Natashia Kinski played well too and has aged gracefully playing a woman in her into her late 30s or early 40s I suppose. I was particularly impressed by her Johansson's and Tony Goldwyn's apparent mastery of Hungarian no easy language I can assure you. Much of the film is set in Hungary with Hungarian subtitles and alternately in America in English. I speak it only moderately well so perhaps a real Hungarian would criticize the accent but to me to whole blending of cultures and settings was surprisingly authentic and compelling. It really captured the time and places for me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The following paragraphs contain SPOILERS. In An American Rhapsody there is no apparent climax as some critics have been eager to point out. And rightly so I think. I suppose Suzanne is the defined protagonist  the story is autobiographical and told from Suzanne's point of view. But each of the other characters could justifiably claim that nebulous title. Certainly while there are many conflicts and powerful dramatic moments and while sadly Suzanne must make a choice there is no wrong antiprotagonist option. Each opposing choice is as right or wrong as the other. So in the end there is no emotional moment of truth that proclaims itself. Her decision is uncomplicated and stated with a simplicity that defies conventional dramatic practices one is stunned by how quickly that simple moment of truth passes.SPOILERSIn the period of Hungary's futile battle for independence from the repressive communist yoke Margit and Peter along with their young daughter Maria make their run for freedom. The dangers for their baby Suzanne are too great so the terrible decision is made to leave her behind with her grandmother who in turn must pass the child over to a good dependable rural couple  only moments before she herself is arrested and taken to prison. For six years Suzanne lives an idyllic life with her loving surrogate parents. Finally Margit and Peter are successful in their neverending efforts a get their baby back with them in America. At this point although unrecognized by all concerned the six year old Suzanne meets her first betrayal. She was told she was coming to America for a visit but finds out soon enough that it's to be her permanent home. There are moments of frustrated rebellion for the child until that poignant scene in the park when her gentle loving father promises that when she's older if she still wants to he'll let her visit her other parents in Hungary.SPOILERSTen years later sixteen year old Suzanne still savors her memories of and mementos from that early idyllic life in Hungary. But she is also thoroughly Americanized. She smokes heck back then darn near everybody smoked she hangs around with the gang and reflecting her adolescent hormones she's got a guy  all normal teenage behaviors that frighten her mother and lead to several typical parentchild arguments. But the panicked mother takes a major step beyond typical  leading to a frightening and memorable scene. SPOILERSuzanne wakes up to find that her mother has had bars put on her window  the image of the shocked Suzanne looking out through the bars is emotionally staggering to watch. Her mother has also put a latch on the bedroom door that can only be opened from the outside. Effectively her mother has made her daughter a prisoner just as she felt she was back in Hungary. And Suzanne strikes out for freedom as dramatically as her mother did. As a result when she asks her father to keep his longago promise he realizes he must give her a chance to revisit her family back in Hungary.SPOILERSBack in Hungary she finds the love between her and them as strong as ever. But life there isn't the same as her memories  and she also is different. And her understanding of her real mother's motivations is changed. So she has that heartrending decision to make between people she loves and people she loves. And it's that decision that slips by without fanfare. Which is as it should be. It fits. Eva Gardos was not giving us a conclusion so revolutionary as to call for dramatic scenes of introspection or indecision or conflict. Only one factor in the end moved Suzanne and she spoke it and that was that.The cast was outstanding. Natassja Kinski's Margit was deeply affecting. Scarlett Johansson proved with her sensitive truetolife portrayal of Suzanne that her earlier moving reading of the role of Manny in Manny and Lo was no accident. Scarlett is among the best in the business. Six year old Kelly EndreszBanlaki played the conflicted confused and betrayed young Suzanne with stunning depth.Eva Gardos has moved the art of cinema into a new and more profound dimension.".

In it you are seen that the importance of family can be over shadowed by the care and love provided by a surrogate family.  The performances of the actresses playing Suzanne are all excellent but the girl who portrayed her as a five year old child in Hungary and her arrival in Californian Kelly EndelezBanaki was particularly outstanding.  Her performance will be remembered.  I found Nastassja Kinshi and Tony Goldwin to also be very real.  It is a very rewarding film.Another commentator compared the film to Sunshine another film developing a somewhat similar story but isolated on the Jewish community of Hungary. It is a longer more powerful story and one that I have had Jewish friends tell me in someways is to horrific in its treatment of Hungarian Jews.

During the trip she knew how much selfless love she had from the adopting parents grand mother and particularly her own mother to whom she was defiant. Knowing that she was loved she could overcome the crisis. I recall the days of my daughter's crisis in the same age with Suzanne. Though the film has historic locale of Hungary in the cold war what the film portrays is something universal which has strong power to make people empathize. Scarlett Johansson acted Suzanne in her adolescent age very well. But the adopting parents were most impressive. If I loved my daughter his way she would not have a crisis.".

	schema:headline " This movie makes me cry every time I see it!";
	schema:reviewBody "I am not an avid movie watcher so I had never seen this until my daughter checked it out of the video store. From the very first scene until the final credits I was mesmerized. There was not a single scene that I did not find captivating. At the end I was sobbing like a baby.I think that a quality necessary to make a story this gripping is that it has all the elements that are common to the human experience  but with circumstances that make everything exaggerated. It is easy to identify with what these characters are going through but at the same time the situation is so unique as to stimulate the imagination and cause the viewer to see the world through different eyes. The story is both familiar and strange at the same time.The acting was outstanding especially the performance of the little girl who played Suzanne at age 6. It amazes me that a child so young could pull off a performance with this kind of depth and insight. I also loved the couple who played her foster parents  the foster father was just oozing with personality and character. The actors who played Peter and Margit did a first rate job as well.I really wish I could find out more about the true story this was based on. My only criticism of the movie was that so many questions were left unanswered...Did the grandmother ever see Margit again? Did Suzanne ever again visit her Hungarian foster parents after her trip to Budapest at age 15? Did the culmination of this story really solve the family's relationship issues for good? Did Margit ever have the courage to return to Hungary and face the ghosts of her past? My daughter says that the mark of a good story is that it leaves you wanting more  so that must mean that this is a really good story. After seeing it forthe first time I watched the video 4 times before letting my daughter return it. I hope Eva Gardos writes a book about her life someday. I would be willing to read a detailed account of her experiences. What a yarn! Whew!".

	schema:reviewBody "Margit Nastassia Kinski and Peter Tony Goldwyn live in Hungary during the early fifties. As Peter relates a good deal of his friends have been sent to prison for no good reasons and his publishing business shut down. In addition Margit experienced a traumatic loss which changed her forever. Therefore they make plans to escape from communist Budapest and immigrate to America. They plan to take their two daughters along but a last minute horrendous glitch makes it necessary for them to leave their one year old daughter Suzanne behind and in the care of a peasant farm couple in the Hungarian countryside. Climbing under barbed wire and around spotlights they make their escape with their older daughter. Yet understandably when they make it to Los Angeles Margit and Peter never stop writing letters to government officials in order to secure the immigration of their little lost girl. Suzanne meanwhile loves her adoptive parents and simple home. Yet when she is six Suzanne is torn away from the only mother and father she knows and sent to America to meet and live with her blood relatives. After such turmoil for everyone will happiness follow? This is one great movie that will have you crying at the beginning the middle and the end. It is based on a heartbreaking true story and it is certainty that any viewer will be tremendously moved by its happenings. The cast is stupendous with Kinski and Goldwyn doing a wonderful job as the brave but sorrowful parents. Scarlett Johanssen plays Suzanne as she ages and she is terrific but so is the little lady who plays the younger version left behind in Hungary. Then too the settings costumes cinematography script and direction are all top notch. In summary no one who loves motion pictures should really miss this film. It has a story that grabs the viewer by the heart and never ever lets go.".

One unfortunately has to be suspicious about any such first film a director puts together about his or her own life. Few could pull that off to produce a masterpiece. The tale surely a moving intriguing even fascinating one is not told too well. Still I will recommend this film for two BIG reasons. If you're not interested in what I deem to be problems with the film move on to the last para.The language problem the constant dilemmas the filmmakers had to face about when to use dubbing when not also depending on which market you want to sell on when a character should be speaking in American English in English with a Hungarian accent in Hungarian with an English accent or Hungarian obviously must have posed a great difficulty in handling the task of storytelling and would have made suspending disbelief a bit more difficult for the audience anyway. But English with a Slavic accent as English with a Hungarian accent really doesn't work well when you hear it. OK for an American with no Hungarian connection it can be alright. But there were problems if you put yourself beyond this too. Beside errors in telling the story the Hungary showed in the movie is just not real. It's interesting that among the comments so far I have only seen a guy from Kent the UK point that out even contrary to some others who found the atmosphere of the Hungarian scenes authentic. I have felt neither the political situation get across to the viewer nor local culture being authentically presented. Altogether the mood of the era is not captured at all not translated to the mainly American audience that may still of course feel as though it would be.So why would I still recommend the film? On the one hand Eva Gardos doesn't do justice to herself for the story is really damn interesting. Not just because of the role history plays in it but because you have women in the focus here and so you're guaranteed to see strong female characters. Or not exactly guaranteed for I have seen films with women in the focus end up differently but in 'American Rhapsody' this is something that actually works well. It's primarily one person's responsibility I believe. She is the other reason you have to check this movie out. After the film I looked up her name on IMDb thinking it was time for some talentspotting. 'Scarlett Johansson'  OK I decided to remember the name. Next week one TV channel played 'Lost in Translation'. She was in it so I decided to watch it. Just guess if I started disliking her after that . I'll help you out. Whenever I walk across the Szchenyi Chain Bridge here in Budapest I think with amazement of her having walked across there in 'American Rhapsody'.".

She simply did not have the wherewithal to deal with being uprooted and transplanted with no warning no preparation. No six year old not even any 16 year old or 40 year old for that matter could deal with emotional trauma of this magnitude. I was left wanting to know MUCH MORE about this family ... did they return to visit Hungary? Did they openly keep in touch with the foster parents?

Which fits the title of this film. Suzanne was born near Budapest in 1950 and when she was a small baby her mom dad and sister managed to escape to America but she was left behind with grandma and then raised by a childless couple who in essence became her parents. This film is her story. The critic Ebert has a good summary.some SPOILERS follow  tread carefully the rest of the way.We see her as a 5yrold happy with her family oblivious to everything else and the fact that her biological family was living in California. When grandma was released from imprisonment she came to take little Suzanne to the city for a visit but instead had prepared for her to fly to America. Mom dad and sis are thrilled with the reunion but little Suzanne while enjoying the visit to this wonderfully different world was anxious to get back home. In a short conversation with dad Tony Goldwin on the park swings he says Give it a chance if you still fell this way after you grow up I'll see that you go back to Budapest.Suzanne at 15 is played by Scarlett Johannsen of Horse Whisperer and Man Who Wasn't There an angry and rebellious teen with a very overprotective mom Nastassia Kinsky who locks her in her room after finding her with a boyfriend.  Suzanne had never accepted her transplantation to America and asked her dad for the trip he had promised 10 years earlier. She went she saw she met her adopted family she visited her grandmother. Her discovery was how much her grandmother had risked and went to prison to protect baby Suzanne. And the fact that her mother witnessed her father being killed by a Communist soldier because dad arose to protect his daughter from the soldier's unwanted advances. This put into perspective her mom's overprotectiveness and her distaste for Hungary. So Suzanne went home to America with a fresh perspective satisfied with her visit to the old world. Good film wellacted although as Ebert points out is resolved in the end in a rather quick and simple manner considering how the story was intricately woven from the beginning. For anyone who enjoys a genuine human story this is a good one.".

Her discovery was how much her grandmother had risked and went to prison to protect baby Suzanne. And the fact that her mother witnessed her father being killed by a Communist soldier because dad arose to protect his daughter from the soldier's unwanted advances. This put into perspective her mom's overprotectiveness and her distaste for Hungary. So Suzanne went home to America with a fresh perspective satisfied with her visit to the old world. Good film wellacted although as Ebert points out is resolved in the end in a rather quick and simple manner considering how the story was intricately woven from the beginning. For anyone who enjoys a genuine human story this is a good one.";

However there is an added depth to her as an actress and flashes of her famous father can sometimes be seen in the brilliant subtleties of her craft.

I just hope that reviewer hasn't seen many films in order to make that statement. This is worse than most TV or direct to video films and respected critic Roger Ebert gave it three stars!?. The direction starts off promising. The escape from Communist Hungary is recreated in black and white that has the look and feel of an old film but after this it descends into  mediocrity with a strong reliance on flashback and heavyhanded symbolism. The acting is pretty average all around except Scarlett Johanssen whose portrayal of the teenage Suzanna was good given the limitations of the script which is pretty limited. What lowered it below being an average sentimental TV drama was a general lack of respect for the history and culture of Hungary. The representation of 1960's Hungary is dreadfully inaccurate with various factual errors. Although much of the Hungarian scenes were shot on location in Budapest the rural scenes were suspiciously Romanian. Much of the language was blatantly an English script translated and therefore the Hungarian language is often used inaccurately and unrealistically particularly the phrase I love you which is not said in the same way as in the English language. The final insult is that much of the traditional Hungarian music in the background wasn't actually Hungarian but of Slav origin. Although apparently a vaguely autobiographical story of Eva Gardos the director this film shows remarkable ignorance to it's subject matter. Not recommended and certainly not an example of a new dimension in filmmaking by any standards.".

Being of Hungarian origin it was hard to overlook certain shortcomings with regards to the use of language and music. There are certain situations where i thought the use of the Hungarian language would have been more forceful and certainly more emotionally satisfying as opposed to using English. And while the movie was made with American audiences in mind nevertheless this type of small movie should be able to get away with the use of subtitles all the way through. As far as the music was concerned it was not even of Hungarian origin in most cases. Considering the title used the word rhapsody there would have been scope for the use of genuine Hungarian music.The director's stated ambition  in the audio commentary  was to portray all the characters in a sympathetic light so that we  the audience  do not feel more emotional attachment towards one set of parents over the other. Well maybe it is me but I did feel more sympathetic towards one set of parents than the other. Which makes the ending all the more less satisfying and somewhat rushed. As if somebody said but we need a feel good ending. If only life would be so simple.On the positive side the performance of the 6 year old Susannah or Zsuzsi is quite remarkable. To have such a range of emotions displayed by a child of that age is simply unique. The look of the movie is also well thought out with the use of the black and white at the beginning and later reverting to full colour.Ultimately it is a movie that will satisfy the general American audience but for those that have personal experiences similar to those in the film will find the whole experience somewhat wasted. The potential was there.... my score is 310".

I kept wondering why the family wasn't physically disciplining the child and treating the adolescent's I hate you statements with the contempt they deserved.I also disliked the withholding of information about the particular motivation for Kinski to leave Hungary for later dramatic effect. Even if the event is true it was something that could have happened anywhere in the world  and therefore not particularly a reason to leave one country rather than another. Moreover there was suficient reason for the family to wish to leave Hungary in any event.Nastassia Kinski and Tony Goldwyn were wonderful  as was everyone  particularly the surrogate mother the grandmother and the child at the heart of the movie.

	schema:headline " The Harlequin Has the Last Laugh";
	schema:reviewBody "It is not necessary to have seen John Hurt's previous portrayal of Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant to appreciate this new film but it is interesting to consider the subtle but different tones of each. The first was a cottoncandy confection that delighted on its own terms in spite of being based upon Quentin's much more somber autobiography. The current film is also sweet but it incorporates some of the more serious issues of Quentin's later life namely his seemingly indifferent cavalier response to AIDS and how he dealt with growing old. Quentin was misunderstood in life because people gay and straight viewed him as a harlequin but anyone who has had the pleasure of reading his books which this film curiously barely mentions knows that he was a sober ferocious intellect who while flamboyant in approach and appearance was a product of his time and came to us as a famous person late in life inevitably possessing in the 1970's '80's and '90's at least some of the Edwardian notions that informed his youth in the 1920's and '30's. This film achieves the formidable task of presenting Quentin both as he appeared publicly and as he thought privately. One can only imagine how difficult it must have been to construct the script. It was inspired to have utilized the framework of Quentin's relationships with various people upon which to construct the biography. By showcasing Quentin's friendships with a literary figure his friend from Christopher Street magazine an AIDS figure the young anguished painter and a performing artist the film reflects important facets of his personality and helps to illuminate the sometimes perplexing concept of the world according to Crisp or what he in life famously termed Crisperanto. Quentin's dialog in the film may sound epigrammatic to some but that is how the gentleman actually spoke and he had a great deal to say.These considerations are perilously academic however. What is important is that the film is in and of itself magnificent. One is tempted to observe that John Hurt does Quentin better than did Quentin himself. It is difficult to take one's eyes off of this intricately prepared compelling actor. How astonishing are those scenes that show Hurt as Quentin playing Queen Elizabeth I in a film waxing ruefully upon the ravages of aging as he really was in his tiny apartment hair down balding elderly alone tilting his head back upon theater stages in cafs or while simply walking down the street to achieve that rollicking laugh that so soothed and beguiled.

	onyx:emotionText "It is not necessary to have seen John Hurt's previous portrayal of Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant to appreciate this new film but it is interesting to consider the subtle but different tones of each. The first was a cottoncandy confection that delighted on its own terms in spite of being based upon Quentin's much more somber autobiography. The current film is also sweet but it incorporates some of the more serious issues of Quentin's later life namely his seemingly indifferent cavalier response to AIDS and how he dealt with growing old. Quentin was misunderstood in life because people gay and straight viewed him as a harlequin but anyone who has had the pleasure of reading his books which this film curiously barely mentions knows that he was a sober ferocious intellect who while flamboyant in approach and appearance was a product of his time and came to us as a famous person late in life inevitably possessing in the 1970's '80's and '90's at least some of the Edwardian notions that informed his youth in the 1920's and '30's. This film achieves the formidable task of presenting Quentin both as he appeared publicly and as he thought privately. One can only imagine how difficult it must have been to construct the script. It was inspired to have utilized the framework of Quentin's relationships with various people upon which to construct the biography. By showcasing Quentin's friendships with a literary figure his friend from Christopher Street magazine an AIDS figure the young anguished painter and a performing artist the film reflects important facets of his personality and helps to illuminate the sometimes perplexing concept of the world according to Crisp or what he in life famously termed Crisperanto. Quentin's dialog in the film may sound epigrammatic to some but that is how the gentleman actually spoke and he had a great deal to say.These considerations are perilously academic however. What is important is that the film is in and of itself magnificent. One is tempted to observe that John Hurt does Quentin better than did Quentin himself. It is difficult to take one's eyes off of this intricately prepared compelling actor. How astonishing are those scenes that show Hurt as Quentin playing Queen Elizabeth I in a film waxing ruefully upon the ravages of aging as he really was in his tiny apartment hair down balding elderly alone tilting his head back upon theater stages in cafs or while simply walking down the street to achieve that rollicking laugh that so soothed and beguiled. Because portraying Quentin is by definition flashy Hurt at first may appear mannered and theatrical but if one watches closely he will realize that the actor knows precisely when less is more. His performance is in fact careful. It is vigorous but not exaggerated and the effect is remarkable.Those who approach An Englishman in New York armed with old political animosities from the Act Up era are missing out really because as troubling as Quentin seemed in his attitude towards AIDS he did try to atone for it in his own way even people with huge and gracious hearts can sometimes find it impossible to say I'm sorry and because he blazed so uniquely and with such genius in innumerable other areas.

Brilliantly written and acted! John Hurt's performance is absolutely phenomenal and as otherworldly as Quentin Crisp was. Denis O'Hare's acting ability is fully on display throughout the film providing a touching portrayal of someone who loved and cared for Quentin Crisp. Jonathan Tucker is a star and is spectacular in his role. Swoosie Kurtz and Cynthia Nixon provide colorful portrayals of two women in Quentin Crisp's New York life. Could not ask for a better cast.

	schema:headline " A great piece of work with so much to say";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fascinating film on so many levels but most notably from a production point of view because Hurt is reprising a role he played 35 years previously as a much younger actor. What makes the piece even more perfect is it picks up where the other film The Naked Civil Servant left off.Quentin Crisp  the one time naked life model and civil servant has gained celebrity due to his ITV film 'The Naked Civil Servant'. He is given the opportunity to fly to New York for one month to give talks however once he arrives in the big apple he falls in love with a city which seems to offer him everything he ever dreamed of. Quentin quickly gains residency as 'a legal alien'. However he faces some hard lessons about the vastly changing face of not only public homosexuality but also the world in general.My opinion of an Englishman in New York is it's a flawless piece of work. It's rare a film can deliver such a sharp but honest message which is relevant to today's society. In the original 1975 piece Quentin was abused and attacked by 'hetrosexual' society not only for being gay but being different. In an Englishman in New York everything has flipped. The heterosexual world seems on the whole to adore him and be accepting of his eccentric and overtly homosexual persona. However now his victimisation comes from the gay community who are excluding their own if they do not fit the very strict criteria of what they deem 'attractive'. Once upon a time Quentin was celebrated in the gay community as a brave pioneer of human rights. Now he's seen as a ghastly old queen who represents every gay stereotype a homosexual man is fighting against.Hurt plays Crisps exasperation to this new rejection with perfect understated brilliance. It becomes very apparent that Quentin was fighting the cause for individuality and the colonisation of the gay community was not actually what he wanted. He seemed to long for a world where every individual was accepted on their own merits and not because they fit criteria of a certain group. WHen Quentin discovers the seemingly universal ambition of gay man is to be a caricatured clone of the male heterosexual stereotype  you can almost hear his eyes rolling. It's also saddening to watch the world speed by Crisp in fifth gear as he tries to get his head around the aggressive fad that is AIDS. This lesson being a particularly poignant one he has to learn.Even after seeing 'The Naked Civil Servant' 20 years ago I had always seen Quentin Crisp as representative of tolerance toward homosexuals. After seeing 'An Englishman in New York' I now see him as someone far more important. Crisp represents tolerance toward individuality and our right to be whoever we want to be without fear of exclusion. As the song says If Manners maketh man as someone said Then he's the hero of the day It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile Be yourself no matter what they say.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Hurt inhabits this character completely. This is not a sequel to The Naked Civil Servant it is a continuation of the story of Quentin Crisp. Quentin Crisp was a flamboyant and insightful 'homosexual' who after spending the first 73 years of his life in notsogay olde England moved to New York and was embraced by the art and literary communities there. He spoke in quotable soundbites that challenged the world's assumptions and people's perceptions of each other through the stories he told.His live performances were more of Q and A between himself and the audience as he never failed to provide an opinion about any idea presented to him.This film fearlessly bases it's integrity on John Hurt's performance and he doesn't let anyone down. Having played Crisp previously in a film based on Crisp's own book The Naked Civil Servant Hurt leaves nothing unpacked in his rendition of Crisp. When I think of Crisp now I see John Hurt's face.Storywise I found this film very informative about a lesspublic time in the life of a courageously defiant man who refused to let society keep him in the closet both in England and the U.S. Finally I got some clarity on why Crisp fell out of favour during the beginning of the AIDS crisis. It's unfortunate that Crisp's analysis of AIDS as a fad turned out to be true in some ways. Perhaps the disease isn't a fad but certainly people's fear and behavioural changes were temporary as we now see in increasing infection rates of young people. If only his insights weren't treated as simplistic in the midst of panic or if Crisp had had the fortitude at 75 to lead a change in attitudes the fight against this disease might have followed a different trajectory. Unfortunately that was not Crisp's role to play.If you enjoyed The Naked Civil Servant you will likely find this film equally interesting. Hurt is remarkable and Crisp's perspectives are still relevant.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Crispe was one of the most important people of the second half of the twentieth century. If he had heard me say that he would have laughed as uproariously as it was possible for him to do by which I mean give a severe chuckle. What do I mean by saying it? I mean that he was an individual to the furthest and truest extent in a world made dull by a stifling mass conformity. In addition he was brilliantly witty and extraordinarily intelligent and wise. He always claimed to be a homosexual but my wife and I always suspected that he may have died a virgin as he was sublimely asexual in person and the idea that he might ever have been physical with anyone seemed frankly inconceivable. Quentin was above all a narcissist and proud of it. He was driven into narcissism by the sameness of the human environment and I believe that if he had been an animal assuming that he had been allowed to be also articulate he would have been much happier because animals do not all look alike whereas humans deceive one another by all having two arms two legs faces etc. so that they have the illusion that they all somehow have something to do with one another which they do not. We were fortunate to know Quentin in both his London and New York environments though we saw him rarely. People who missed his amazing oneman show in a large London theatre years ago can never know what they missed because it was one of the most scintillating live performances possible to see anywhere at any time. It was all on the theme of 'personal style' a subject which was a favourite for me to discuss with him. He was somewhat jealous that I had known Tallulah the one person in the world he most wished he had met and we often recurred to the subject of Tallulah as the Queen of Style. John Hurt has done a wonderful service to posterity in capturing Quentin on film almost to perfection. He has mastered every detail of his mannerisms his movements his walk the turn of his head his gestures his manner of speaking and his facial expressions. The only thing missing is the purple tint which Quentin added to his hair. It was so eerie seeing John sitting there in that lower Manhattan diner. I could just see Quentin eating his melted cheese on toast he loved boring 'school food'. This is one of the greatest acting achievements of our time in terms of portraying a real life character. My wife and I hosted a dinner party many years ago for both John and Quentin who did not see that much of each other and it was so intriguing listening to them bantering back and forth which they did somewhat shyly. The photos of them were marvellous with them reflecting each other's glow and their arms around one another. John Hurt has never had as many opportunities to be the lead actor in films as he should have had. That is because except in SINFUL DAVEY in his youth perhaps he was never a natural 'romantic lead'. The inevitable nature of popular story lines generally condemns many actors and actresses to supporting roles no matter how brilliant they are. And so it is that John has made something like 150 films because everybody wants him but has never been Brad Pitt for which I am sure he is eternally grateful though to judge from his attraction to women you would imagine that John might secretly have been Brad Pitt after all in ways best left to the imagination. Drollery has always been a specialty of John's and that is remarkably attractive as a trait. And so we come to the film. Trying to write a script like that is no easy task and the writer has done a good job without being particularly brilliant. The lighting was not that good at times and the direction was good without being brilliant either. The trouble with falling short in the production itself is that a subject like Quentin demands the best. However we must be grateful for what we got. The film features a spectacularly good performance by Jonathan Tucker who was so brilliant in THE DEEP END 2001 see my review. He plays the young gay artist Patrick Angus whom Quentin befriended with great sensitivity and intensity. Denis O'Hare is admirable as Quentin's friend Phillip Steele. Rather too much is made in the film of Quentin's unfortunate flip remark about AIDS being a fad which landed him in a lot of trouble. There is no doubt that Quentin was the victim of hysteria and was excessively criticised for a mere passing witticism or what was intended as such however stupid it may have been. But one very touching scene of a huge butch gay man attacking Quentin for it in the street and then sobbing uncontrollably about his dying boyfriend really brings home to us the mass grief associated with this terrible disease and how wrong a stray remark can be when it wounds those who are suffering deeply. After all who of us has not lost a friend to AIDS? One reason why this film is not as exciting a film as one would have wished is that Quentin was a quiet and subdued person. Despite his carefully designed gauche appearance Quentin was remarkably demure. Perhaps we are all a bit too jaded and expect too many thrills in movies. One thrill which I wish everyone had had the opportunity to enjoy was to know Quentin Crispe. This film goes some way towards filling that gap and we must be grateful to it and to John Hurt for his magnificent efforts to bring Quentin to life as vividly as if he were really there in front of the camera.".

Despite his carefully designed gauche appearance Quentin was remarkably demure. Perhaps we are all a bit too jaded and expect too many thrills in movies. One thrill which I wish everyone had had the opportunity to enjoy was to know Quentin Crispe. This film goes some way towards filling that gap and we must be grateful to it and to John Hurt for his magnificent efforts to bring Quentin to life as vividly as if he were really there in front of the camera.";

I suspect the main cause of this is that the source material simply doesn't provide a lot of scope when a story starts with its protagonist in his seventies and having finally gained acceptance and even celebrity the timespan is inevitably somewhat short and there isn't a great deal more that can happen to him. Even in situations which could and would have been threatening to the younger Quentin Crisp his elder statesman status effectively restricts the repercussions.As a result more or less the only 'plot event' of the film is the arrival of AIDS in New York with even that seen largely through the effects on Crisp's career of a single dismissive quip his reasoned attitude is that making too much of AIDS will only bolster public perception of homosexuals as diseaseridden outcasts but this doesn't go down well among his target audience. Otherwise An Englishman in New York consists largely of bons mots little snippets of Crisp performing and delivering his famous lines whether to an audience of one or to a small studio gathering.That said given the limitations of its material the film manages to pull off the difficult trick of its predecessor presenting its deliberately flamboyant overthetop protagonist as a sympathetic human being whose pose we not only condone but find ourselves applauding. I generally shy away from 'gay issues' but find myself feeling here for the people he meets and the prejudice he encounters both from them and on their behalf. In some ways it is as hard to be a determinedly effeminate homosexual among the butch 'clones' of an outofthecloset New York as among the disapproving middle classes of prewar England.John Hurt does an excellent task in portraying the physical aging of the character and of course it is a great bonus to have the same actor appearing in both films with a genuine generational timelapse between them. It is just a truism that  despite Quentin Crisp's muchrepeated prediction that every year things are going to get worse  happiness as the proverb has it simply doesn't make for such an enthralling story as do troubled times and this is essentially a depiction of a man who has finally come to terms with the world and it with him. As such it is wellmeaning and pretty well executed but not a particularly unmissable experience. And inevitably it is less touching and less striking than its predecessor.".

	schema:reviewBody "One would think that anyone embarking upon a followup to the groundbreaking Naked Civil Servant of 30plus years ago would at the very least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired vision but no. Here we have a sort of biopic of one of the most stylish people of the late 20th century that itself boasts no style whatsoever. True the filmmakers have assembled some outstanding actors  and handed them a chipped mug of drab gruel to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong starting with the script which is another one of those TVmovie condensations of great lives wherein every other line is a famous quote by the subject and every other scene is an inyourface introduction to the next pivotal character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a stateside entertainer Denis O'Hare as the editor of a gay periodical who hires Crisp as film reviewer becomes somewhat alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of 80's AIDS activists and then returns to the fold as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenarian Jonathan Tucker in a fine performance as a shy insecure painter of gaythemed canvases who is befriended by Crisp and finally Cynthia Nixon as performance artist and WomanAboutBohemia Penny Arcade who intrigued by Crisp's persona offers him a spot in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer but is given no chance by the script to embody the downtoearth and streetwise Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a oneroom flat in an old tenement building in Manhattan's East Village. He famously said that he never cleaned because after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse or something like that. But looking at the depiction of that flat in this film you'd never get the flavor of that dustiness. He frequented a local coffee shop on a busy avenue and would be seen pretty much each day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we get a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the streets of New York scenes have a sterile unreal look with no sense of the period. The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After nearly 35 years he can still grasp the essence of this peculiar postEdwardian Englishman and put it across to third millennarians. His every line every gesture is exquisite. In the later scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to suit that of a person whose life is winding down toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this realm that when one grows very very old one's skin takes on the character of a smelly overcoat that cannot be removed and one longs for death. One senses that feeling in Hurt's performance. So for him and him alone this film is worth a look.".

The first 20 minutes is good the story seems promising and the French man is hilarious. Then the next 75 minutes is just Shammi Kapoor trying to woo Sharmila Tagore repeatedly and it really isn't amusing or charming but kind of a drag. If the director was someone as skilled as Hrishikesh Mukherjee it could have been different but that's not the case here. Shammi Kapoor had potential but too bad he didn't always take care of himself. Then the last hour is just a trite conflict nothing remarkable. Everything was great but the story was average  and that is important.

Jenny is bright pretty hard working but also naturally gifted. The only problems her father may perceive in her life is her issue with learning Latin and her dating a boy named Graham who is nice but socially awkward. Jenny's life changes after she meets David Goldman a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family that his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys.

	schema:headline " An educated mind is not necessarily an open one";
	schema:reviewBody "In the cinema certain historical periods have become associated with a particular set of ideas. The 1960s represent change progress and excitement whereas the 1950s are frequently regarded as a period of stifling social conformity. Of course the swinging sixties did not necessarily start to swing on 1st January 1960 and in retrospect the first few years of the decade seem to have more in common with the conformist fifties than with the swinging London era of the later sixties. Certainly many young people during this period regarded London as a dull conservative place and looked eagerly to foreign cities especially Paris as being more exciting and radical. There was an enthusiasm for everything French French philosophy French literature French cinema French fashions even French jazz and French cigarettes. This Francophilia doubtless included elements of wishful thinking De Gaulle's Fifth Republic was a more conservative place than many Britons realised but it was nevertheless an influential phenomenon. It is a phenomenon explored in Julian Barnes' novel Metroland later filmed and also in this film.The main character is Jenny a teenage schoolgirl living in the London suburb of Twickenham in 1961. Jenny is highly intelligent and is studying hard with a view to taking the entrance exams to Oxford University. She is not however really sure why she wants to go to Oxford except that she is being pushed to do so by her parents who feel that university is the best place for her to meet a wealthy husband.Jenny's life changes when she meets a handsome and charming older man named David. They quickly become close friends and begin dating. David is clearly wealthy and claims to be an art dealer and property developer. More important to Jenny however is his knowledge of culture. He is well up with all the latest intellectual and artistic fashions from France and takes her to concerts and jazz clubs. What really impresses her is that he takes her to Paris. Eventually David proposes to Jenny and she accepts and drops out of school without taking her Alevels her Oxford ambitions abandoned.Many parents would be worried about the idea of their sixteenyearold daughter being romanced by a thirtysomething man especially if his influence leads her to neglect her education but Jenny's parents especially her complacent Philistine father seem strangely unconcerned. His argument is that as Jenny has now found a wealthy suitor there will be no need for her to use Oxford as a dating agency. His one objection to David as a soninlaw seems to be that he is Jewish. AntiSemitism was unfortunately widespread in British society at this period. Yet it is obvious to the audience that there is a darker side to David's character. His business methods are to say the least not beyond reproach the character may have been based upon the notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman and he never takes Jenny to his home always meeting her in a luxurious flat belonging to his friend and business partner Danny. Eventually even Jenny herself begins to suspect that David is not all he seems.The title An Education can be understood on two levels. As a comingofage drama it narrates Jenny's metaphorical education in the wider sense of learning lessons about life. Yet it obviously also deals with her education in the narrower literal sense of the word. It raises similar issues to another great British film Educating Rita namely whether it is formal academic education or informal education to be gained in the outside world which is the more valuable. Jenny drops out of school because she believes that she can better acquire knowledge both of high culture and of the ways of the world through her life with David than through academic study. Jenny's vision of her future life envisages her living with David in Paris on the Rive Gauche reading Sartre smoking Gauloises and going to the cinema to see the latest productions of the Nouvelle Vague. It seems hard to blame her for this conclusion given that in the film the main advocate of the life academic is her headmistress an intellectual snob and virulent antiSemite The Jews killed Our Lord! who serves as a reminder that an educated mind is not necessarily an open one. It is only when she becomes disillusioned with David that Jenny starts to reassess her priorities.Her performance in the lead role has led to Carey Mulligan being hailed as the new Audrey Hepburn although the main point of resemblance seems to be that at one point in the film Jenny sports as many young women doubtless did in the early sixties a Hepburnstyle hairdo. Nevertheless on the basis of this performance Mulligan would appear to be a highly promising star in the making perhaps the new Keira Knightley. Although she is actually 24 she always seems entirely believable as a naive young teenager. Other good contributions come from Peter Sarsgaard as the smooth reptilian David Alfred Molina as Jenny's comical blustering father Rosamund Pike as Danny's airheaded mistress Helen and Emma Thompson in an excellent cameo as the obnoxious headmistress.Period drama is something the British cinema often does well and An Education falls within this tradition even though it has a Danish director Lone Scherfig. 2009 has already seen two good British costume dramas The Young Victoria and Dorian Gray but An Education is an even better one. It is not only a study of a girl on the verge of womanhood but also an exploration of issues such as social class racism and the value of education. One of the best British films of recent years. I hope that the Academy will remember it when next year's Oscars are being handed out. 910".

	onyx:emotionText "In the cinema certain historical periods have become associated with a particular set of ideas. The 1960s represent change progress and excitement whereas the 1950s are frequently regarded as a period of stifling social conformity. Of course the swinging sixties did not necessarily start to swing on 1st January 1960 and in retrospect the first few years of the decade seem to have more in common with the conformist fifties than with the swinging London era of the later sixties. Certainly many young people during this period regarded London as a dull conservative place and looked eagerly to foreign cities especially Paris as being more exciting and radical. There was an enthusiasm for everything French French philosophy French literature French cinema French fashions even French jazz and French cigarettes. This Francophilia doubtless included elements of wishful thinking De Gaulle's Fifth Republic was a more conservative place than many Britons realised but it was nevertheless an influential phenomenon. It is a phenomenon explored in Julian Barnes' novel Metroland later filmed and also in this film.The main character is Jenny a teenage schoolgirl living in the London suburb of Twickenham in 1961. Jenny is highly intelligent and is studying hard with a view to taking the entrance exams to Oxford University. She is not however really sure why she wants to go to Oxford except that she is being pushed to do so by her parents who feel that university is the best place for her to meet a wealthy husband.Jenny's life changes when she meets a handsome and charming older man named David. They quickly become close friends and begin dating. David is clearly wealthy and claims to be an art dealer and property developer. More important to Jenny however is his knowledge of culture. He is well up with all the latest intellectual and artistic fashions from France and takes her to concerts and jazz clubs. What really impresses her is that he takes her to Paris. Eventually David proposes to Jenny and she accepts and drops out of school without taking her Alevels her Oxford ambitions abandoned.Many parents would be worried about the idea of their sixteenyearold daughter being romanced by a thirtysomething man especially if his influence leads her to neglect her education but Jenny's parents especially her complacent Philistine father seem strangely unconcerned. His argument is that as Jenny has now found a wealthy suitor there will be no need for her to use Oxford as a dating agency. His one objection to David as a soninlaw seems to be that he is Jewish. AntiSemitism was unfortunately widespread in British society at this period. Yet it is obvious to the audience that there is a darker side to David's character.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember this film getting quite a lot of critical praise when it came out and so I was intrigued to see what all the fuss was about. Of course it got nowhere near being shown in my local cinema and so I waited patiently for it to show on TV. A screenplay by Nick Hornby based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and set in London in the early 1960's it has all the hallmarks of a decent production. You'll be glad to know that I agree with the critics yes it's pretty good. There were a couple of points where it could have gone off the rails but fortunately it stayed on the tracks and we have a fine piece of work.Jenny Mellor is a bright sixteen year old student whose parents have ambitions for her to study at Oxford University. She is slightly disenchanted with her lot though and yearns to go out and experience the world while she is still young. By chance she meets David a man more than twice her age who recognises something in her and takes her to see the sights. Two friends of his Danny and Helen come along and Jenny goes to concerts sees art dines in fine restaurants and even visits Paris. David does all this with Jenny's parent's permission he is very persuasive. Of course all is not what it seems and her world is about to take a massive jolt and the many arguments she has made against conformity are about to be tested.This is a very well made film which features a standout performance from Carey Mulligan as Jenny she was really outstanding in the part. Peter Sarsgaard was suitably suave as David as was Dominic Cooper as Danny. Both Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour did a good job as Jenny's parents Jack and Marjorie. Rosamund Pike played the part of the rather dim Helen very well and Olivia Williams did a very good job as Jenny's teacher Miss Stubbs. Finally a mention for Emma Thompson who had a nice cameo as the headmistress.This film asks a lot of questions about how some parents try to control the lives of their children although it's not the main point of the story. I really liked the way it was written but I still felt one or two bits could have done with tidying up I'm sorry I can't be specific  spoilers. Having said that I did enjoy it very much and I really liked the ending. I would definitely watch it again sometime Recommended.My Score 7.610".

	schema:reviewBody "An Education works little wonders even if it's an imperfect film. There's much to recommend about it as this season's British indie movie with something different going for it. It's something about its character and the circumstances of what happens to her that's fascinating sixteen year old Jenny Carey Mulligan a smart girl with a love for Parisian culture and music and movies is pressured to get into Oxford not even so much for the English degree to teach English or Latin as case might be but for the status. Enter in David Sarsgard an older man who rides up to Jenny one rainy day and offers her a ride home. From then on its a romantic affair between the two where he whisks her to wonderful jazz clubs and auctions and even eventually to Paris. A twist happens late in the film that turns all of this upside down but I dare not reveal it here.What makes it interesting is not so much the teen girl with adult male aspect on that side of the coin it's like a British version of Manhattan only told from the girl's point of view and a less conflicted man in the situation but how the relationship is perceived by her parents and peers and teachers. This isn't some illicit affair to be kept under wraps but something that refreshingly for a movie at least is out in the open and with that comes the awkward stares and upturned eyebrows and as well the charm that David exudes on Jenny's parents. It's as much a film about romance as it is about class about how Jenny fits in or could fit in to a society in Britain in 1961 and how David fits in and how her parents see her fitting in or for that matter how David fits others in as a property reseller to the black community. And of course the aspect of Oxford vs. getting married the only options for Jenny at a crucial point.And now for the rest of the good and... well not so much bad but just underwhelming. The good is this newcomer Carey Mulligan. One can't wait but to see her in other films she's a natural at playing a great range of emotions required for this complex character a girl who thinks and acts and talks like a woman but yet still sort of a girl at the same time see Jenny's trip to Paris for that. Supporting players like Molina and Williams are also very good giving their scenes the proper 'umph' needed and gravitas in some key scenes. Sarsgaard fares a little less well with a good performance but less than convincing accent. The screenplay by Nick Nornby for once he's adapting a book! and it's written with a natural ear for the way characters at that time might speak. The direction is clear and concise and just handsome enough to be competent. The last ten minutes however seem rushed on all of the ends of the storytelling after such a good momentum has been building on the crest of Jenny's future.It's a very good movie where we care about the characters and see some life lessons learned with usually unsentimental results. It's a tragiccomic crumpet of a movie dear and serious amusing but very telling about human nature. 7.510".

He's a smiling gangster really though the storytelling shows some skill in revealing the ugliness only in little gradual bits until bam! Comes the big shocker. Not that by then it's much of a surprise.David rescues Jenny Ms. Mulligan and her cello from a heavy downpour  already his sleek purple Bristol car is a strong hint of his subtle mixture of poshness and sleaze  and before she can say I'm a virgin he's taking her to classical concerts auctions of BurneJones paintings and jazz clubs with freeflowing champagne. With them are David's cohort and business partner Danny Dominic Cooper and Danny's dumb blonde girlfriend Fanny Rosamund Pike. Danny's sleeker and more handsome than David and where he lives is packed with handsome artworks. We don't see where David lives and when we do we find out why.Helen who's never read a book let alone Camus exists to set off Jenny's intelligence and wouldbe sophistication. Jenny listens to Juliette Greco's smoky chansons gratuitously spouts French quotes the French existentialist and dreams of Paris  anything to escape this dull country which has not begun to swing yet since its only 1961. She's not so good at Latin but at her girl's school her literature teacher Miss Stubbs Olivia Williams appreciates her and wants passionately for her to go to read English at Oxford a phrase the film explains so insistently you'd think academic British were a completely foreign language too.What's a bit hard to believe in this otherwise routine tale based on a memoir by writer Lynn Barber and turned into an easyto digest screenplay by Nick Hornby is the way Jenny's parents go along with the idea of David this mysterious and oily older man taking their collegeprep daughter off to fancy watering places unchaperoned he tells a string of lies to soften them up some of them unbelievably crude like his remark when first introduced to Jenny's mom You didn't tell me you had a sister. This compliance is justified by the fact that for her mother Marjorie Cara Seymour and timid but bumptuous dad Jack Alfred Molina marriage to a man with money which David evidently has wherever it comes from is as good as going to university maybe better. In any case Jenny doesn't keep any of what's going on a secret in fact she boasts of it to her classmates and the teachers know too. The only sign that all morals haven't been relaxed yet is the headmistress a wasted Emma Thompson who sees Jenny as disqualifying herself for Oxford the school or respectable life.Carey Mulligan blooms before our eyes in this movie and its worth watching for that. There's a squirmy pleasure in observing her scenes with Peter Sarsgaard and David is a good role for him. This is a character who is always acting so if Sarsgaard never seems natural that well fits the part. The whole trouble with 'An Education' is that everybody gets off too easy. David whose declared Jewishness almost seems like evil typecasting is a thoroughly despicable person when we really get to know him how come he just gets to slither away? Jenny never suffers any lasting ill effects of her misbehavior even though everybody knows about it. Conflicting morals in early Sixties England are never a hardship for her or well dramatized in Hornby's simplistic plot. She's never confused and it all turns out just fine. Good for her but it leaves one with a queasy feeling not only because of the reptilian behavior of the boyfriend but because consequences are simply ignored unlike in the much more hardscrabble film about a young girl's virginity actually made in 1961 Tony Richardson's fine 'A Taste of Honey' written by Shelagh Delaney. How can Jenny be a heroine if she has no real challenges to face? This doesn't feel like 1961 London after all. It's just another modern take on a sassy young woman's premature liberation.".

Good for her but it leaves one with a queasy feeling not only because of the reptilian behavior of the boyfriend but because consequences are simply ignored unlike in the much more hardscrabble film about a young girl's virginity actually made in 1961 Tony Richardson's fine 'A Taste of Honey' written by Shelagh Delaney. How can Jenny be a heroine if she has no real challenges to face? This doesn't feel like 1961 London after all. It's just another modern take on a sassy young woman's premature liberation.";

Her father Alfred Molina does not allow her to play music and wants her to study so she can get into Oxford and meet a nice man. As David charms both Jenny and her parents he becomes the eligible husband that her parents were hoping for and studying for Oxford becomes redundant which ultimately brings the biggest question that the film poses is an education necessary for Jenny to experience her desires and yearnings.The two lead characters are played with perfection by American indie star Sarsgaard Kinsey Jarhead Garden State and Orphan and newcomer Mulligan however it is the latter that steals the show. So rarely is such headstrong determination vulnerability and such a true desire to experience such joie de vive encapsulated in a performance but Mulligan nails it and I predict an Oscar nomination for her if not a win.The film is complete with beyond competent direction by the Danish born Scherfig and a smart screenplay from Hornby only his second screenplay and first that is not adapted from one of his own stories along with stunning performances from a strong supporting cast with notable mentions to Olivia Williams as Jenny's teacher Alfred Molina as Jenny's overbearing and yet anxious and vulnerable father and scene stealing moments from Emma Thompson and Sally Hawkins.Expect to see An Education at the top of the upcoming best lists of 2009 and even at the Kodak theatre in February next year with high chances of collecting Oscar gold. It is also without a doubt the ultimate must see film for a liberal arts student.".

In spite of the fact that his proposal is apparently an impulsive response to a moment of jealousy as well as the fact that he never not once invites her to his home or says a single word about his family she accepts his ring and drops out of school. That's not only an example of Jenny being naive it also reveals how the writer the selfaggrandizing memoirist Lynn Barber manipulates her story beyond plausibility apparently in order to crucify her father.Which brings us to Dad a thankless role played by Alfred Molina using only two notes in his otherwise fulloctave range. As a father he is straight out of an essay by an aggrieved teenager. Accorded no complexity no depth not even any consistency Dad begins as a dictumspouting martinet determined to get his only offspring into Oxford but then in a character change as abrupt as Dr. Jekyll's he completely reverses himself when Mr. Fortyish shows up with his posh car lavish gifts and equally lavish whoppers. Suddenly Dad thinks it's a jolly grand idea that his 17yearold daughter quit school and marry an older man about whom he knows next to nothing. The father is a callow teenager's vision of an injudicious parent a character sculpted by vindictive hindsight not mature insight. The mother is better only for being mostly silent and longsuffering. No insight there either.The film tries to seduce the audience the way Jenny is seduced with the fast car great art and music posh clothes and champagne.

	schema:reviewBody "'An Education' is a film rife with one implausible character after another. For starters when we're introduced to the protagonist high school student Jenny she seems way too sophisticated for a 16 year old. The main problem is that Carey Mulligan who plays Jenny is 24 years old in real life. Why didn't they cast a teenager?Then there's the problem of the girl's father Jack. At first he appears extremely petulant a caricature of the pushy parent who wants their child to succeed at any cost. With his insistence that Jenny study night and day in order to get into Oxford we're first led to believe that he's the film's antagonist. But soon when conartist David appears on the scene Jack is suddenly reduced to unprincipled buffoon. I say buffoon because he's so easily taken in by David's schemethat David is actually an Oxford alumnus and knows famous Oxford professorauthor C.S Lewis. If this was a real character wouldn't have Jack made a few simple inquiries to determine whether David was telling the truth or not? In very simplistic fashion the implication here is Jenny's sudden embrace of a life of crime is due to Jack's lack of principles. David basically buys Jack's acquiescence in allowing Jenny's trips away from home and ultimately accepting the idea of Jenny and David tying the knot. Somehow all this so easily rubs off on impressionable Jenny. The gutless father figure is nothing newjust think of Jim Backus strutting around in an apron in 'Rebel without a cause'.Perhaps the moment I found to be the most incredulous was Jenny's sudden transformation from earnest student to unsavory bad girl. Even with the father acting the way he did would she have so suddenly embraced David once she discovers that he's a con artist? I would think that a normal teenager would have been very alarmed that she was now in the company of a bunch of criminals and fear would have entered into the equation. But what was Jenny's reaction? A mild protest and then David sweeps her off her feet.David was disappointing in that he was such a tame sociopath. What are his crimes? Well he steals an antique map from a house that's up for sale and arranges for minorities to move into apartment buildings scaring elderly tenants and then buying the apartments from them when they decide to leave at cutrate prices. Oh yes he also cheats on his wife. Equally disappointing is the couple he hangs out withexcept for one scene where there is a confrontation with Jenny they really have little to do.Every melodrama needs a villain and that is of course the headmistress of the school Jenny attends. After she finds out David is Jewish she blurts out that the Jews killed our Lord. Not only is she depicted as a vile antiSemite but she cruelly rejects Jenny's request to be reinstated. Only Jenny's kindly teacher is willing to give her encouragement.If you think about it everyone seems to get a 'pass' in this movie except for the headmistress. Even David despite his philandering ways is not such a bad guy and is not truly held accountable for his amorality precisely because he is such a charming character the film's scenarists imply that he too is a 'victim' of his environment. There is nothing subtle about 'An Education'. It's an oldfashioned morality play where the good guys educated professionals triumph over shiftless petty criminals who hang out at such unsavory venues as dog tracks and seedy nightclubs. Everything is tied up in a nice ribbon at the end when both Jenny and her father repent and Jenny is miraculously accepted into Oxford.'An Education' is a tawdry little tale that has already garnered a good share of undeserved accolades. It does boast a nice recreation of early 60s London along with a brooding score but in terms of psychological insight and depth of character it totally lacks any kind of aesthetic credibility.".

Although based on a memoir it is hard to believe that the young lady's parents would be so gullible and idiotic as to let her go out of town for overnight stays with an older man they know nothing about. The screenplay is somewhat plodding leading to a clichd ending.".

But even if you miss the point it still remains an aesthetic masterpiece. You can feel genuine 60s atmosphere all around the characters have quite diverse and interesting personalities and are yet well defined the lines are intelligent and yet often exhilaratingly funny. And the cast was just amazing. I was intrigued by an arcane Peter Sarsgaard carried away by the effectual mimic of Carey Mulligan I was amused and felt yet identified with Alfred Molina's funny inhibitions and I literally melted away from Rosamund Pike's sweetly silliness.I have to admit that after watching it the first time I didn't understand the moral of the whole story. The fact that David was married seemed to me as an unfortunate circumstance that shouldn't have kept the girl from doing what she enjoys and living her dream. When she was accepted at Oxford her problem still hadn't been solved. She would have be doing what she declared to be boring. Once again her life would have lacked excitement and pleasure.But... You have to remember what gave her that excitement in the first place. Everything David possessed whether material or nonmaterial he acquired dishonestly. And as easily something is acquired or achieved as easily it can be taken away. That applies to both his wealth and his personal life. In his professional life he chose the easy path by stealing and in his personal life he made it easy for himself by lying. When Jenny found out about him being married the whole dream just vanished into thin air. Now let's just imagine for a second that the police found out about David's criminal activities... He would have been left with nothing. Just like what happened to their relationship. Easy come easy go.When Jenny said The life I want there's no shortcut she understood that if you want to possess something permanently there is no other way than to earn it with your own sweat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film with high expectations which is never a good thing. I wouldn't say that I was let down but I definitely was not astounded. I was hoping for the Oscar performance of the year not just a good film. That being said I feel my resulting view is somewhat tarnished by my jaded attitude. Had I gone into it with no expectations my opinion might be different. Or maybe not.First off Carey Mulligan is extremely natural charming and compelling in her role as the witty intelligent Jenny. There is talk of her receiving an Oscar for her performance. To that I must express my doubts however. Mulligan fits her role beautifully but it's not a very taxing role to fit. The wideeyed school girl who gets duped by the older man we've seen it before though maybe not as welldone. She was a joy to watch and very charming but nothing that I would call astounding. I didn't feel moved or changed by her performance. Do I have much more respect for her as an actor? Absolutely. Am I left breathless by her performance? No not quite. I'm not even saying that good acting has to be dramatic but she portrayed Jenny beautifully up until the end when she showed very little depth of character. Her emotions seemed brittle and really only bordered anger. Even in the scene that she breaks down I felt for her but I did not feel a true sense of hurt only sadness. Did she really love David? Carey has so much talent but she definitely has some learning to do in film. I look SO forward to seeing her in other roles and watching her challenge herself. As for now she rests upon a talented hopeful.As for the film itself it conveyed very little message. The setting was perfectly portrayed. Now I did not grow up in the 60's but seeing films and documentaries as well as speaking to others who have I think I can say the film did the time justice. Not once did I question the dialogue or fashions. Mostly I felt the film captured the 60's mentality and way of life. Many are expressing concern over the age difference between Jenny and David but to be honest those were the times. Many young girls WERE duped by older men especially lavish glamorous ones like David and his friends. If nothing else this movie is worth watching for the supremely welldone costumes makeup and overall period correctness. You certainly feel the fun of the 60's. The plot itself is compelling until towards the end. David and Jenny's relationship is definitely understandable and charmingeven if you don't completely trust David you fall in love with him through Jenny's eyes. His friends are likewise charming and humorous and you are sucked into their way of lifeparties jazz drinks and cigarettes. At the same time I felt The Talented Mr. Ripley showed the lavish lifestyle a little better. Where An Education excelled in portraying the 60's I felt it did not expand enough upon any one theme. Did they want to show the destructiveness of a lavish lifethe booze and jazz? Well you caught a glimpse... Or maybe the love David felt for Jenny? That we never even truly understand. Why Jenny? Why this school girl? Yes she was sophisticated but why marry her? I suppose it was just his playboy character as his wife points out but even that is not expanded upon. What this movie lacks is closure. Closure on their relationship closure on the two friends Danny and HelenDid Danny love her was he jealous or was he just concerned for an innocent girl? I will say Rosamund's character was extremely well playedit takes a very intelligent actor to play a very unintelligent person well. And the last five minutes could have been an 80's montage not to be crass. The depth was severely lacking. So she loses everythingdoes she cry? Maybe for three seconds after it immediately happens during a touching scene between her and her father the parentsanother aspect left rather 2dimensional. But after that she seems to lack a sense of depth unable to portray all that has happened. So she studies hard and ends up at Oxford. First of all how she was able to do that is never explained. Second it was extremely neatly tied with a bow. And thirdly what on earth is the message? Had David not been married would she have chosen marriage over an education? We never really understand what there is to gain from an education.If this movie were merely about a tragic incident where a girl gets mixed up in the fastpaced lavish world of the 60's seduced by an older man then An Education portrays it perfectly. However the film attempts to convey a message that is not fully conveyed. Education is better than throwing life away for marriage. This is never truly explained though. The former part is extremely well done. You become pulled into the lifestyle just as much as Jenny. But you also take away from the experience as much as she doesvery little. The movie was nice to watch charming and as seducing as David himself. But it will not blow your mind. It could have been brilliant had some better choices been made.Overall a joy to watch. I recommend seeing it but just be aware of its flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "With excellent acting and excellent visuals this is a good film as a Chaucerian cautionary tale or a retake on Congreve it succeeds in buckets. But more even than the excellent script by Nick Hornsby is a marvellous performance by Carey Mulligan.It tackles what is an incredibly sensitive subject more so today than even in its setting the relationship between a teenager and an older man with definite aplomb. What could have been either an anachronistic script filled with moral sensibilities that didn't surface in 1961 or a cheap and tawdry sensationalist production is handled with verve humour and brings both the wonder of first love and the seductive ability of that love to steer lives in directions we'd rather not go out in ways that work very well indeed.Carey Mulligan has more than a touch of sensibility about her and is obviously the more mature yet still a naive genu  her performance is to be admired for its ability to not switch characters but rather hold a fast course that is totally believable. I seriously cannot think of any debut in the past 20 years that has this weight. Like Taylor in National Velvet or Johnny Mill's daughter in Whistle Down the Wind you just know you are watching something very special indeed.All the parts are very well written by Nick Hornsby and what we get is both complex and light a witty drama with depth that truly evokes the postSuez and Macmillan era Britain before the Beatles but a Britain full of a generation who didn't wanted to be reminded of rationing and the Blitz who were searching to get away from the drudgery of a boring jobforlife that was killing their parents by degrees.While there are moments of real unease not surprisingly given the subject matter there is nothing to not recommend about this it is thoughtful funny intriguing and marks the start of a significant career for Carey Mulligan who will certainly become one of the leading British actresses of her generation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jenny Carey Mulligan is a 16 yearold girl who is attempting to get into Oxford University and has high promise of doing so due to her exceptional intelligence. However she feels that life is far too linear and she wishes to be able to express herself by listening to French music and going to the cinema and theatre whenever she can but her parents forbid this for the most part. On a chance encounter Jenny meets David Peter Sarsgaard an older man who allows her the freedom to live life the way she wishes to do so.An Education is adapted from the memoir of the British journalist Lynn Barber and is a comingofage drama set in 1960's London. The story unfolds in a very standard fashion but it is the very core themes of the narrative which keep it engaging. The main theme of the film revolves around the importance of a rationalized living such as getting a formal education and having the chance of being boxed into a typecast versus living life to the full and having an existence on the foundation of enjoyment. The films is also evenly paced and while it is a fun and interesting watch there is a slight mishap to the overall narrative structure which hinders the film greatly. While the film is set up by trying to understand how Jenny feels about her current life compared to the life she could have the film does little to dwell on the realistic consequences of the actions made by many of the characters especially Jenny. Any poor decisions she makes in her life are gazed across far too quickly and those by other characters are none the better. It is a disheartening aspect to the story and one which would have made the film more cohesive with it's message.Nevertheless there is not much else to criticize the film for. The acting for instance is superb with some natural performances. Most of the screen time is dominated by Mulligan and then Sarsgaard. While the chemistry between both never really works all the time they are still appear amply suited. The rest of the cast all support these two and even the likes of the talented Emma Thompson and Alfred Molina never imbalance the fine equilibrium. Each character also comes across as unique. For example where Mulligan's Jenny is rational and tries to act sophisticated Rosamund Pike's Helen is ethereal and frivolous. These contrasts seem simple but they work in addressing the core concerns of the film.Director Lone Scherfig does an amazing job with her creative vision of the script even though she does not create a unique cinematic experience. For the majority of the film the camera work is understandably controlled and helps to convey the characters as they ought to be. However as if to aid the thematic notion of the film when Jenny in introduced to a more a world of artistic expression Scherfig is quick to make the camera work more loose and free heightening the film's very premise of rationality versus emotion.Beyond some implied sex and nudity An Education contains little in terms of content with violence and language.There is a charming simplicity to An Education which allows the narrative to unfold without any hindrance. The acting is great the direction is just as good and the story has some important messages to impart to audiences. Though as a comingofage story An Education steers clear of trying to have an impact with its core themes and ultimately suffers for convenience.Durban International Film Festival 2009".

The rest of the cast all support these two and even the likes of the talented Emma Thompson and Alfred Molina never imbalance the fine equilibrium. Each character also comes across as unique. For example where Mulligan's Jenny is rational and tries to act sophisticated Rosamund Pike's Helen is ethereal and frivolous. These contrasts seem simple but they work in addressing the core concerns of the film.Director Lone Scherfig does an amazing job with her creative vision of the script even though she does not create a unique cinematic experience. For the majority of the film the camera work is understandably controlled and helps to convey the characters as they ought to be. However as if to aid the thematic notion of the film when Jenny in introduced to a more a world of artistic expression Scherfig is quick to make the camera work more loose and free heightening the film's very premise of rationality versus emotion.Beyond some implied sex and nudity An Education contains little in terms of content with violence and language.There is a charming simplicity to An Education which allows the narrative to unfold without any hindrance. The acting is great the direction is just as good and the story has some important messages to impart to audiences. Though as a comingofage story An Education steers clear of trying to have an impact with its core themes and ultimately suffers for convenience.Durban International Film Festival 2009";

But she is also another one of filmdom's 16goingon20 heroines. It's understandable that she was vulnerable to the attraction of her playboy lover. But she was also supposed to be a very smart person. Smart enough to have seen that all was not as it should be. But the biggest gap was in Alfred Molina's role. Here is this stick in the mud father whose idea of the perfect gift for a 17 year old is a Latin dictionary. Yet he opens his arms to a suitor twice his daughter's age no questions asked. Yes I know he was blinded by the shine of all that money. But how many fathers no matter how obsessed with money would send their teen age daughters off for the weekend with a relatively middleaged lothario. Maybe Brittany Spears' father but not a proper Englishman in the 1960s".

	schema:reviewBody "I must disagree with like most people on this film in the fact that it was far below the rating it was given and disappointed me when I went to see it last night in every way possible. This is simply because of the storyline of the film and how it was presented. It could have been a good movie I thought it was going to be after everything I heard of it but I came out the film feeling most disappointed.What is the message we are getting from this film? A young girl Jenny 1617years dates a bloke double her age after he gives her a lift home and then she keeps seeing him everywhere and they go out like most people would no problem there. The problem arises in that he is DOUBLE her age and to me just acted like a pervert and stalker all the way through. Surely Jenny would have had to meet him more times get to know him and then decide to date him. Which brings us to another fault in the film her family doesn't even care. See now any family including my own would at least advise her against this bloke and talk to her about it tell her the precautions the pros and cons. at least let her know that they care and are there for her. Then her family should not let her stay with him over night after knowing him for a few daysweeks but they do and then do it again in Paris! As if once wasn't enough lets let our only daughter go off with a strange older bloke which remember both family and daughter haven't known for very long to a different part of the world and not even flicker an eye lid about it. Of course she will be fine it's England nothing happens in 50 years ago England! Does it?Then after knowing he is a thief and that he robs older women all she seemed to do was think its cuteamazing or something. I was pleased when she walked away but she stopped!! Why?!?! Why I ask you is it right that he is a thief and basically a scum of a bloke and she willingly goes alongfalls in love. He asks her to marry him after trying to find a ring in the boot of his car after saying 'it might not fit but it will do'. And she AGREES!! How long has she known him?? What does she even know about him?? Nothing as we find out later in the film.She quit school why? She could have carried on while dating this bloke but no quit school and then feel oh so bad when she is rejected from school once braking up with this bloke. And under no circumstances should she have got into Oxford. Its fg Oxford for Pete's sake she quit school and only seemed to read a book after not being allowed back into school. Then gets a letter saying she is in. WHY?!?!?! I don't care if it was back 50 years ago Oxford is hard to get into and for the likes of her that quit school and didn't care about it she shouldn't have been allowed in.And another thing why didn't anyone seem to say anything to her they all went along with her plans like she was the Queen and knew everything. Oh no wait she's 1617!!!! But even knowing her age and that she is a school girl she was the boss of everyone and knew what she was doing better than all the older women and men in the movie. So what the heck lets be run by school girls get rid of the Queen we want Jenny the woman of all knowledge and sense of the world!This was a STUPID movie and a waste of 20!!! Unless you are a retard and see nothing wrong with what happened in the film then go for it blow your brains out watch the film. But for those who claim to be intelligent I would recommend staying away from this movie. Have some sense which the film lacks a lot of.".

Mullingan plays a 16 year old girl who is very smart literate charming but not experienced yet and she plays it with great selfconfidence which goes unrealistically with her youth. And there isn't much else than confidence and serenity in this performance. I wasn't convinced. I hope Carey Mulligan gets nominated though.The movie itself is okay watchable but it didn't challenge me enough. It lacks freshness. It's very Hornbylike. I know he only adapted a memoir here. But the material is similarly uninspiring to his however lovely books and movies based on them. What's the message here? That appearance can be deceiving and that education is a good choice. Well yes. So I would say a decent juvenile film with good performances from just everybody.".

It's nowhere near as bad as 2008's The Reader one of the worst films in my lifetime to be nominated for Best Picture but at least with that one you could see the Academy going glassyeyed and groaning Holocaust... masterpiece... in the same tone with which a zombie goes braaaaiinnns... while An Education is just glossy mediocrity like being served fancily prepared tofu. You can acknowledge the effort but you're still eating tofu.Let me see if I can find enough plot to even talk about Carey Mulligan plays Jenny a bright 16yearold schoolgirl in 1961 England who dreams of attending Oxford. She's seduced by a 35yearold playboy played by Peter Sarsgaard who introduces her to art films jazz nightclubs and Paris. Jenny enchanted by all this culture has to decide whether to stay true to her dreams of Oxford or get married and live life for love and art. And that's damn near it. I've left out of the final fifteen minutes or so out of respect for the spoiler code but that's a tragically complete synopsis up to that point. We spend untold stretches of time watching Jenny make loveydovey eyes at Sarsgaard or being awed by all the culture and holy yawn. There's a few other characters but they've fled my memory so quickly I'm halfconvinced I was zapped by that Men in Black redlight device immediately after watching.The film contains possibly the most boring virginity loss subplot in the history of on screen teen characters losing their virginities only saved from the precipice of completely forgettability one of the most awkward and bizarre movie scenes of 2009 in which Peter Sarsgaard gives Jenny a banana and tells her to loosen herself up with it before they have sex for the film time. This is not played for laughs. It just happens. It was so inane I was half convinced I was having a fever dream but looking back on it no even my darkest subconscious couldn't come up with a scene like that. No one could come up with a scene like that except evidently screenwriter Nick Hornby.Whatever else the film does wrong everything Carey Mulligan is quite charming and charismatic in the lead role and managed to keep me awake through stretches that would have been cinematic warm milk with pretty much any other British actress I can think of young enough to play a teenager. She has a bright career ahead of her. But nonetheless don't see An Education. If I could talk to any critic championing this film I would love to ask which scene exactly they think will linger in memory either collective cultural memory or their own by 2012 because every second of this film is leaking out of my mind like water through wicker.".

	schema:headline " Though it fails to answer all of the questions that it raises it is still an occasionally romantic picture and also a very funny one too";
	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1960's a sixteenyearold school girl named Jenny Carey Mulligan is bored with her extremely strict schooling life and feels devoid of any fun. She is surrounded by incompetent males including her uptight father Alfred Molina and also a nervous boy named Graham Matthew Beard who likes her. One afternoon Jenny is walking home from school in a downpour. She is given a ride home by David Peter Sarsgaard who sees her cello case and tells her that he is a lover of music. With this common interest they both take an immediate liking to each other. David suggests his intentions by leaving flowers outside Jenny's house and by also inviting her out with his friends as well. Despite their age difference they start a romantic relationship.It is easy to see screenwriter Nick Hornby's attraction to this project based on a memoir by Lynn Barber. The previous film Hornby wrote was About a Boy and while An Education is not in the same league as that film there are certainly similarities between the stories. This is also about an older man who takes a much younger child under his wing to show them a better life. For much of its length the film is a highly idealised view of the freedom of the 1960's. Though at times it may seem too picturesque and sweet this is precisely the point of the film in reflecting the way that Jenny is entirely wrapped into her new found freedom and lifestyle. From jazzy nightclubs country sides and swanky apartments this is a glamorous film at times even more so when actress Carey Mulligan begins to look like Audrey Hepburn. The brief scenes in Paris are particularly romantic too.For many of its qualities however the film is problematic because of the subjectivity towards Barber's memoir. The dominance of Jenny's perspective throughout the film ensures that the audience is never exposed to as much detail about David's character as we would like. In a very different role to the one he played in Garden State Peter Saarsgard is quite charming. Yet by the end of the film despite some revelations such as his occupation we are left questioning his actions and his interest in Jenny beyond a merely perverted nature. For Jenny though the film's ending ties up her mistakes and grief extremely quickly and neatly without a great deal of reflection. Regardless Cary Mulligan is lovely as Jenny a radiant and cultured girl looking for enjoyment who falls entirely ahead of herself. By surrounding Jenny with a strict and frustrated person like her father along with the bumbling Graham the need for a strong and complete male in her life like David seems vital for her. Alfred Molina is particularly good as Jenny's neurotic father and he has some of the film's funnier moments.The film lightly touches on the subtext of the freedom that women were denied in this period. Jenny is told by her headmistress that if she is found to have lost her virginity then she will not be wanted at the school while there is also suggestion that if she gets married she will not need an education at Oxford. Though these dilemmas and issues are not particularly explored to any great extent or depth they are still relatively interesting to look back on now.An Education is quite a small British film and one that will be a minor entry into the future career of Carey Mulligan. Its message is a simple one in that the best things in life are not always around the corner but have to be worked for and earned for the greatest fulfilment. Though it fails to answer all of the questions that it raises it is still an occasionally romantic picture and also a very funny one too.".

After all the ads focussed on its romantic comedy aspects directed by Rob Reiner When Harry Met Sally and starred Bruce Willis who had just undergone a public divorce.In retrospect it's easy to assume why it got panned... this is NOT a romantic comedy although there are comedic elements.  Those expecting a HarrySally II would be clearly be disappointed.  Those expecting some insight to Bruce Willis' marriage too would be disappointed.  The film is neither of those things.Of course had the associations not existed and the ad campaign refocussed its efforts the film would be far better respected.  That's why time will be very kind to this film.Not everything works. Some scenes like the language of the women are too profanitylaced to sound like real women making David Mamet's writing seem like Jane Austen by comparison.  There's a terrible scene with Willis in a restaurantunrealistic unfunny.Why then recommend the film?  Because the agony the depth of painful emotions are real.  Find a better acting job by Willis or Pfieffer.  Find one!!!  Can't be done.Do you not see it?  Do you not recognize that this film has one foot firmly planted in the light comedy world and another foot firmly planted in the incredible realism almost too realistic angst of a failing marriage?  Do you not see it?  Do you not hear Reiner's concerns projected in the scene where Willis requests to Reiser his dream of writing a book on his grandmotheris this not Reiner saying that he WOULD go further with the serious story here but the audience too set by his own past achievements will not let him?  Is this not exactly what happened when Story of Us was released?Don't be fooled.  This is one serious movie.  It should be required viewing for all engaged couples. It's a fantastic wakeup call. The circumstances that lead up to the arguments are simplified but the emotions are raw.  I repeat time will be very kind to this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer for The Story of Us I thought that this film was going to be different from anything I had ever seen. I had been disillusioned by all these movies coming out that are basically the same and it was sort of refreshing to see that finally someone was trying something different. So I set my plans to include this movieuntil I heard the reviews. Everyone seemed to hate this filmeven my movieloving cousin admitted she walked out in the middle because she couldn't stand it. She told me that it's more of a married person film than a film for teens like us so I canned my idea. BIG MISTAKE! I wish I could have seen this marvelous film on the big screenthere's something about actors that makes them seem so much better when their faces are as big as you are. Not that that's necessary. After finally seeing the film my mom bought it and forced me to watch it it just made me realize why almost every movie now is a cliche some people cannot appreciate truly unique art which is why I think this movie caught a bad rap.I honestly cannot say I have any firsthand experience on the subject of divorce. My parents are still married and have never really had to consider that option. I am still at that stage where marriage is a distant pitstop on the road to my future. So why did I love this movie? It told me the truth. All of my life I have seen love depicted as an allpowerful allconquering thing. And I have no doubt that it isthis movie told me that too. But it also showed me that maybe being in love isn't always a perfect happy thing. You've got to take the good and the bad. Ben said it best when he told Katie Nobody said it was going to be easy. Finally. Finally someone tells me it's NOT going to be easy. Now some people think that this film will make you not want to get married. I feel quite the opposite because it shows you that if you truly love your partner you can get through the tough stuff.I don't understand how people can say this movie had bad acting. Were they watching the same movie I saw? Both Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer were amazing in this movie. I swear that as I watched them I completely believed they were a married couple. And the passion that went into their arguments was not overacting as I have seen it dubbed. Have you seen married people fight? It's just like that. And the good thing is the movie didn't choose sides. It just showed the arguments and the feelings behind them and left no one looking the bad guy. And Michelle Pfeiffer's beautiful performance during that closing monologue was worth watching the entire movie even if you didn't like it. And the cinematography was brilliant. Sometimes flashbacks in movies can be risky especially if they happen often as in this film. But the movie just seemed to flow wonderfully and Katie's flashback in the car on the way to pick up the kids from camp is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It's amazing to see 15 years of marriage in 15 seconds and not feel shortchanged. That scene captured everything brilliantly. And Eric Clapton's music adds a lot to the movie. He is definitely talented but it's also because the music seemed to capture the mood of the film. All in all this was an amazing experience and is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's funny entertaining moving and very wellmade. I'd recommend it to anyone. Even if you don't like it you will take something from it.".

	schema:headline " Everyone's marriage nightmare come true";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a disturbing bittersweet romantic comedy about two people who's 15 year marriage is unraveling.  Actually it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy.  Ben and Katie Jordan Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been.  He is spontaneous romantic and impulsive with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper.  She is pragmatic a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations and a high need for control. She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight. They both blame each other for their disappointments.  The pattern is clear. He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening.  She then throws up every mistake he's ever made and every fault he's ever had.  This goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits.  Like moths to a flame they keep returning for another scorching.  This film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society.  The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man with the exception of wife beating to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together.In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film Rob Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story evolved.  As it turns out it was a montage of all their own marital problems.  So the film was in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.As filmmaking it was terrific.  Rob Reiner weaves the story together expertly creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship.  The film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character.  It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film something of a departure for her.  Bruce Willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up.  Actually he was quite good as the impulsive childlike romantic but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment he played the scenes too harshly almost commando style.Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship.  He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.The problem is the story.  Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face.  But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis.  It is really The War of The Roses lite only it takes itself too seriously.  No one I know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks no less 15 years.  The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers' skin after a while.  It is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant.  The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don't go home feeling like you've had a nice evening.So while it succeeds as filmmaking it fails as a film.  I gave this film a 610.  There were so many good elements to it that I can't see trashing it. But the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.".

I realized that no one I talked to at first had shared his or her lives with anyone for any more than a few years. This film deals with the daily wear and tear of ANY truly longterm relationship. It is an accurate albeit theatrical portrayal of the way high ups and devastating downs that can come to two people who love each other  hate each other  need each other  want each other desperately  hate each other some more and finally love each other again. I concluded that those who had never been to the end and I mean the it's over and I am outta here end of a relationship and still been able to pull away form the precipice and put things back together again just didn't have a clue. So there my partner and I were after 16 years together truly touched by all that we saw nodded our heads to laughed at and balled our eyes out over and in the end really uplifted by in this gem of a film. Michelle Pfeiffer's final monologue alone would have been worth the price of a movie ticket just to watch  All Actors should be made to watch her has she creates brilliant comedy by bursting into tears.

All I will say is that it's probably not for the younger crowd. In all honesty if I had seen this film in my early twenties and I'm now almost 40 I wouldn't have appreciated its subtlety on long term relationships. It's aimed at those of us who have been married or in a long term relationship. Although I don't have children the rest of this movie had many oh yeah moments for me. The Story of Us is a complex yet ultimately simple explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them but that if you're both willing to work on make the relationship all that much richer for it. Wonderfully thought provoking. If you have ever been in a long term adult relationship I'd be hard pressed to see how you COULDN'T relate at the very least on some small level to this film.".

So real well for the most part you'll laugh you'll cry you'll hold your breath you'll just want more. The moments were very real and welldone and I agree that Willis and Pfeiffer rendered stellar performances. It WAS a romantic comedy. Did YOU see it?! Such a wellwritten script and excellently directed. Virtually no complaints from start to finish. Although admittedly I watched an edited version and missed all the language. Anyone who's been married any length of time and especially for a number of years will appreciate the reality and depth of emotion and meaning in this poignant movie. Sense of humor required.Totally worth seeing again and again!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie holds so much truth it cannot possibly be watched by anyone man or woman who are or who have been in a serious relationship without any such crying at some point during it or at least being strongly enough emotionally affected to do so. I cried. I cried before the opening credits song was more than a few lines in. It spoke to me like few movies have. It is the first movie about the subject of love that I've watched since I became this involved physically and emotionally with my wifetobe. That alone makes the movie have an impact on me good or not. That it dealt with a subject that has so recently become so important to me. A successful marriage. But while I was this into the film while it had this impact on me... I can't claim that it was great. The performances are. The editing is. The script is. Most of the parts are. But somehow the sum it just doesn't add up to being that... great. It might be that the ending feels flat. It might be that the movie offers no answers only observations. The movie goes back and forth between present day chaosunhappiness and fond memories... these were particularly difficult to watch without crying. This works to the film's advantage and creates a sense of more than a nonlinear timeline a lifetime years upon years of memories returning to this old married couple. The story of two people who love each other... they do. They've just tired of each other of the differences of the arguing. Comes very close to being great but it just doesn't quite make it I'm afraid. Worth watching for any fans of the genre and has plenty of insights to offer. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a serious relationship. 610".

The final scenes with Pfeiffer's frightening display of multiemotional skill at once excellent and utterly ghastly  betrayed the characters. Normality was implausibly resumed and Pfeiffer came across as at fault for taking the whole film to get real and Willis looked much relieved that she'd taken the sanity pill and he could quit trying to change himself.And the end was a surprise.

	schema:reviewBody "Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer are Ben and Katie Jordan in The Story of Us' Rob Reiner's latest directorial effort. The Jordans have been married for 15 years and have reached a turning point in their relationship. Authors Alan Zweibel and Jesse Nelson explore the past and present of the couple in a mosaic of vignettes throughout the years they have been together. There are scenes of joy laughter anger and frustration. The film basically takes place in the present as the teenage son and daughter leave for summer camp. The couple decides to separate during the summer vacation to reevaluate their situation and spare the children any suffering. The scenes jump back and forth revealing the deterioration and lack of any real communication in their day to day life. Zweibel explained in an interview that the screenplay was somewhat autobiographical but when he realized the script was somewhat onesided male he joined with Jesse Nelson to rewrite the script and deliver a more realistic and evenhanded reflection of the marriage. They are fairly successful. However Willis' Ben seems to be the more sympathetic of the two. In one scene Ben has just begun dinner out with his two best friendsa married couple played warmly and humorously by Rob Reiner and Rita Wilson. In a loud eruption of anger and resentment he voices his emotions disrupting the quiet tone of the restaurant. He leaves the table and paces outside on the street. In this tenderly revealing scene Willis without a word shows the lifeshattering trauma he is going through. Willis has developed into a fine and subtly sensitive actor. Just when the audience thinks all of its sympathies are on Ben's side Katie has a 3minute monologue in which she spews out her reactions to all that has happened. Pfeiffer's performance here is also a tour de force. If only what has come before had the power of these two sequences. Eric Clapton's music effectively underscores the highs and lows his song quietly framing the beginning and ending of the film. Married folks will definitely identify with this couple. One could hear the sounds of recognition from the audience at the screening I attended. It remains to be seen if this story will attract and entertain a wide range of moviegoers.".

This is the type of movie that can be deeply appreciated. I know it's a movie but it is much more than that if you've experienced even just a little of the trouble that they had in it.";

Having been there myself I thought the characters seemed very realistic. I sometimes felt like she was me. Especially the scene where the parents were in bed with them. I can think of times when my own mother's words were spinning around in my head while I tried to talk with my spouse. The moral of their story I think is never stop trying.

The script is simply brilliant. It's a delightful realistic touching and insightful story of us. It represents so many typical things of life we're all familiar with that it becomes an enjoyable yet true to life love story.Director Rob Reiner did a great job in making this film. The most surprising thing about his directing is the way in which he manages to do something which is actually against the rules of film making. At certain moments he allows his main characters to watch STRAIGHT into the camera as they look back upon their lives and 15 years of marriage. This technique creates a different almost interactive impression which is normally only used on television shows interviews and commercials. In doing so the director creates a virtual connection between the actors on screen and the people watching the film.Talking about characters who would Rob Reiner want for the married couple? This is another great thing about The Story of us. The actors are very well chosen. Bruce Willis does a great job and hereby proves that he's really grown as an actor throughout the years. I don't think he could have done the same great performance 10 years ago when he was still dodging bullets in Die hard. But even better is the acting of Michelle Pfeiffer. Now I know it's hard to stay objective about her acting once you've seen her but I think apart from that everlasting beauty this performance of hers is quite outstanding. And if you disagree with me on that take a look at her famous monologue at the end of the film. This should prove of what a great actress Michelle Pfeiffer truly is!Of course practice makes perfect! And to make sure that both actors would appear natural on screen Bruce Willis started flirting with Michelle Pfeiffer everytime he saw her on the film set. After all their characters were married to each other for 15 years and their job was to give that exact same impression. Although the flirting with Hollywood's most beautiful actress must have been a true joy for Bruce Willis it also improved the acting of both actors.Last but not least there's Erik Clapton with his many wonderful songs which you can hear throughout the entire film.All things considered The story of us is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen".

	schema:headline " Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer make the perfect romantic couple but the story is a mess. 12 out of ";
	schema:reviewBody "THE STORY OF US 1999 12Starring Bruce Willis Michelle Pfeiffer Rob Reiner Rita Wilson and Paul Reiser Director Rob Reiner   Running Time 95 minutes   Rated R for language thematic elements and sexrelated material By Blake FrenchBruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer make the perfect romantic couple they're cute cuddly and warm. Their smiles and joyful expressions make one wonder why no other casting director has come up with the idea of having the two of them star in a romantic comedy before. Unfortunately Rob Reiner's The Story of Us isn't about marriage love at first sight or happy times but about an unhappy couple's divorce procedures and how two people can fall out of love in a matter of time. How depressing indeed. The film consists of dozens of unorganized flashbacks explaining to us the up's and many down's of a married life in America as well as the two past love birds Ben and Katie Jordan's attempts to keep their marital problems from their two young children.The individual scenes featuring Ben and Katie either bonding or fighting are at times quite powerful and involving as well as some emotionally on target moments along with some funny humor presentbut all the good sequences are brief and choppedup. The story is so uneven it's very hard to become intrigued with anything going on. There is a nice sequence that takes place in Italy where Ben and Katie try to escape from their problems and jump start their lovewhat they don't realize is that their good old selves will be waiting on the front porch when they return home.  The problem with the film's singular scenes being effective is that they do not all fit together like they should not to mention the heartache to develop and introduce the main characters through the flashbacks.  That is not an easy thing to do and The Story of Us is not a smart enough movie to figure out how to do those things properly. The characters are acutely quite the treat. They are wonderfully played by top notch actors some not commonly known for such roles as these including Bruce Willis Michelle Pfeiffer Rob Reiner Rita Wilson and even Mad About You's Paul Reiser. There's much charming romantic chemistry between Willis and Pfeiffer but like I said all the characters do is argue and swear at the other. The kids aren't detailed enough to care about thus we don't care about the turning point in the middle of the film. Pfeiffer's performance at the very end of the movie where it should be serious and intense comes off as whiny sissified and annoying. I can't figure out how she screwed this one up. She's a good actress right? The structure in The Story of Us is anything but ordinary. Author Thomas Pope once said that there is such a justification in the extremely rare case of a movie being about life the structure called life. There are certain incidences here that have a first act second act then conclusion but no outright formula. But in this rare exception the structure's material is fitting. Life has no structure to it and for this movie to contain such realism it must also not. This makes the story believable engaging and realistic this reminds me of what many couples go through in present day in America. The Story of Us contains such a flawed motive it's hard to imagine how this project could have worked. While I won't reveal the film's ending I will say that the filmmakers throw their preparation for a depressing finale out the window and give us a conventional but satisfying conclusion. Perhaps if the writers would have used the flashbacks in sequence order or taken a completely different view at the events maybe through the eyes of the kids possibly then the movie would have been a success. It is hard to tell really. I personally think this film was doomed before it got the green light. It isn't the actors' faults nor necessarily the director Rob Reiner. It's just everything combined in a negative way.There is a scene in The Story of Us where the meaning of the message in this movie flashes before our eyes. It is a sequence present in the film's trailers and is made up of Katie's brief intercut flashbacks reflecting back on all the good and bad times of the their 15 year marriage. The scene works in every way possible. And in some ways it makes a long story short for us summing up the entire film's existence. I don't know why this scene is so effective but I do know one thing if the entire movie was as focused and meaningful as that we may have had something here.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.".

Unfortunately Rob Reiner's The Story of Us isn't about marriage love at first sight or happy times but about an unhappy couple's divorce procedures and how two people can fall out of love in a matter of time. How depressing indeed. The film consists of dozens of unorganized flashbacks explaining to us the up's and many down's of a married life in America as well as the two past love birds Ben and Katie Jordan's attempts to keep their marital problems from their two young children.The individual scenes featuring Ben and Katie either bonding or fighting are at times quite powerful and involving as well as some emotionally on target moments along with some funny humor presentbut all the good sequences are brief and choppedup. The story is so uneven it's very hard to become intrigued with anything going on. There is a nice sequence that takes place in Italy where Ben and Katie try to escape from their problems and jump start their lovewhat they don't realize is that their good old selves will be waiting on the front porch when they return home.  The problem with the film's singular scenes being effective is that they do not all fit together like they should not to mention the heartache to develop and introduce the main characters through the flashbacks.  That is not an easy thing to do and The Story of Us is not a smart enough movie to figure out how to do those things properly. The characters are acutely quite the treat. They are wonderfully played by top notch actors some not commonly known for such roles as these including Bruce Willis Michelle Pfeiffer Rob Reiner Rita Wilson and even Mad About You's Paul Reiser. There's much charming romantic chemistry between Willis and Pfeiffer but like I said all the characters do is argue and swear at the other. The kids aren't detailed enough to care about thus we don't care about the turning point in the middle of the film. Pfeiffer's performance at the very end of the movie where it should be serious and intense comes off as whiny sissified and annoying. I can't figure out how she screwed this one up. She's a good actress right? The structure in The Story of Us is anything but ordinary. Author Thomas Pope once said that there is such a justification in the extremely rare case of a movie being about life the structure called life. There are certain incidences here that have a first act second act then conclusion but no outright formula. But in this rare exception the structure's material is fitting. Life has no structure to it and for this movie to contain such realism it must also not. This makes the story believable engaging and realistic this reminds me of what many couples go through in present day in America. The Story of Us contains such a flawed motive it's hard to imagine how this project could have worked. While I won't reveal the film's ending I will say that the filmmakers throw their preparation for a depressing finale out the window and give us a conventional but satisfying conclusion. Perhaps if the writers would have used the flashbacks in sequence order or taken a completely different view at the events maybe through the eyes of the kids possibly then the movie would have been a success. It is hard to tell really. I personally think this film was doomed before it got the green light. It isn't the actors' faults nor necessarily the director Rob Reiner. It's just everything combined in a negative way.There is a scene in The Story of Us where the meaning of the message in this movie flashes before our eyes. It is a sequence present in the film's trailers and is made up of Katie's brief intercut flashbacks reflecting back on all the good and bad times of the their 15 year marriage. The scene works in every way possible. And in some ways it makes a long story short for us summing up the entire film's existence. I don't know why this scene is so effective but I do know one thing if the entire movie was as focused and meaningful as that we may have had something here.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.";

His only comfort comes in the form of the woman he lives with Jezzie Elizabeth Pena and his chiropractor Louis Danny Aiello.

	schema:reviewBody "After reading several reviews on this film I thought I would add my two cents. This remains one of my favorite movies and I never hesitate to take in another viewing. A lot of people seem to be noting the loose script and story elements as the film's weaknesses going so far as to call it messy and incoherent. The fact that even after seeing it several times there's still some mystery in it still some ambiguity as to the possible meanings to all of the things that go on with Jacob is what I find most appealing. It's not a film like the Sixth Sense where all of the pieces fall into place at just the right time and you know exactly where you stand. It's something rather that is left to the imagination of the viewer a rare thing when audiences en mass want clear cut explanations and easy answers hence the success of Sixth Sense a great film in it's own right but the complete opposite of this one. The visuals are incredible and highly influential. The techniques used in this film have since been overused and distilled throughout various horror movies and music videos but without ever coming close to the power of the original which presents some of the most psychologically terrifying images ever to appear on screen. I think it's hard to come to this movie for the first time today and experience it the way you could have eleven years ago when these type of images had yet to be seen and were exposed to completely unsuspecting audiences. The best way to see this movie is with absolutely no knowledge of it beforehand. The mood is perfect. The acting is great the dialogue is outstanding. Danny Aielo explaining to Jacob about angels and demons still moves me to this date and the two simple words suddenly spoken to a disbelieving Jacob from some unseen source while in the Asylum scene still terrify like no other movie can. Also this may be the Home Alone kid's best film.The extra scenes on the DVD range from average to terrifying including the omitted antidote scene something I'm glad I didn't see when I was younger because it might have scarred me for life . Also there is a perplexing and scary scene omitted at the end where Jacob confronts Jezebel. There is alot of digital grain in some of the shots. I would like to see a better quality DVD put out for this one but I'll take what I can get with the added scenes. See this movie then see it again and then see it three years later. Don't overanalyze and worry if some of it doesn't make sense after all it's not all supposed to.".

	schema:headline " The grandfather of rubber reality films";
	schema:reviewBody "The film begins with Jacob Singer Tim Robbins and his platoon in Vietnam. When they're suddenly attacked it's chaos and the platoon appear to be the victims of some kind of chemical warfare. Jacob is stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Suddenly without explanation we see Jacob back in New York City. He's returned home from the war and he's trying to get his life back on track but he keeps having odd experiences seeing odd frightening people and having close calls with death. He cannot tell dreams from reality. What happened to him in Vietnam? Jacob's Ladder is the grandfather of the rubber reality films that became so popular throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The films with the most direct influence from Jacob's Ladder have appeared more recently Memento 2000 Mulholland Dr. 2001 The I Inside 2003 and The Butterfly Effect 2004. Less obvious but also strongly influenced are films such as Abre los ojos 1997Vanilla Sky 2001 eXistenZ 1999 The Thirteenth Floor 1999 and The Matrix 1999 as well as films where the rubber reality is usually played more straight such as The Sixth Sense 1999 and The Others 2001.Of course like any artwork Jacob's Ladder has its precursors too such as the short story by Ambrose Bierce called An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge which was originally published in 1891 and later used as a basis of a silent film called The Spy 1929 and then a French short entitled La Riviere du hibou literally The River of the Owl the latter also airing as an episode of The Twilight Zone 1959. There is a very strong religiousmythical allegory running throughout the filmseen in everything from the JudeoChristian nature of the character's names and the title of the film itself to character interests as Jacob begins extensively studying demonology the occult and so forth in an attempt to figure out what is happening to him. We are also treated to subtle connections with other works such as philosopher Albert Camus' novel L'Etranger The Stranger which Jacob is reading in the film when we first see him on the subway and there are many at least subtle stylistic and content precursors such as Altered States 1980.In light of the subsequent instantiations of the film's brand of rubberizing reality as well as the more purely stylistic elements that have been used to often excellent effect in later films such as the hyper kinetic figural motion that found its way into William Malone's films House on Haunted Hill 1999 and Fear dot Com 2002 Jacob's Ladder may seem relatively transparent or even tame. It's certainly easier to reach an interpretation for this than for a film like Mulholland Dr. where director David Lynch is purposefully obfuscatory. Still Jacob's Ladder is one of the better films of its kind. Director Adrian Lyne achieved a continually offsetting creepiness that is rarely matched and some scenessuch as the gurney journey through the increasingly dilapidated hospital corridors could not possibly be topped.Seen in the context of Lyne's other films Jacob's Ladder is all the more surprising as the bulk of his career has been focused on hyper sensual and sexy dramas and thrillerssuch as 9 12 Weeks 1986 Fatal Attraction 1987 Indecent Proposal 1993 Lolita 1997 and Unfaithful 2002. Jacob's Ladder has its share of eroticism however mostly through the gorgeous and impassioned Jezebel Elizabeth Pena even though her most heated moment has her appropriately fraternizing with a demon.Lyne's relatively straightforward approach to the film's elastic ontology especially in conjunction with his tendency to be forthcoming and thorough in explaining his view of the plot a predilection shared by scriptwriter Bruce Joel Rubin may be unfortunate in that there is an interpretation of Jacob's Ladder accepted by a vast majority as the right answer. That's a shame because there are countless possible readings of this material differing views on everything from the general crux to the smallest minutiae. Part of the inherent beauty of the film is that any scene or set of scenes may equally be taken as the real events and any of the dialogue may be taken as providing clues to your preferred interpretation.Robbins' performance is important to the film in that he is the focal point of almost every scene and has to convincingly play a vast range of emotions he does so with finesse. The rest of the cast is noteworthy even though their questionable nature gives them a lot of leeway in terms of verisimilitude and consistency.But the real driving force that makes Jacob's Ladder such a success is its eeriness. This is a horror film after all both on psychological and more apparent supernatural levels. Lyne continually and disconcertingly pulls the rug from beneath not only Jacob but the audience as well yet manages to never make a viewer feel lost instead producing an eagerness to solve the mystery while you root for Jacob.".

	onyx:emotionText "The film begins with Jacob Singer Tim Robbins and his platoon in Vietnam. When they're suddenly attacked it's chaos and the platoon appear to be the victims of some kind of chemical warfare. Jacob is stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet. Suddenly without explanation we see Jacob back in New York City. He's returned home from the war and he's trying to get his life back on track but he keeps having odd experiences seeing odd frightening people and having close calls with death. He cannot tell dreams from reality. What happened to him in Vietnam? Jacob's Ladder is the grandfather of the rubber reality films that became so popular throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The films with the most direct influence from Jacob's Ladder have appeared more recently Memento 2000 Mulholland Dr. 2001 The I Inside 2003 and The Butterfly Effect 2004. Less obvious but also strongly influenced are films such as Abre los ojos 1997Vanilla Sky 2001 eXistenZ 1999 The Thirteenth Floor 1999 and The Matrix 1999 as well as films where the rubber reality is usually played more straight such as The Sixth Sense 1999 and The Others 2001.Of course like any artwork Jacob's Ladder has its precursors too such as the short story by Ambrose Bierce called An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge which was originally published in 1891 and later used as a basis of a silent film called The Spy 1929 and then a French short entitled La Riviere du hibou literally The River of the Owl the latter also airing as an episode of The Twilight Zone 1959.

But director Adrianne Lynn will show us Jacob's nightmare. He will take into the depths of one man's hell and in the process attempt to explain poor Jacob's psychosis.Jacob SInger Tim Robbins returned from Vietnam different. He is now haunted by horrid visions of demons strange entities and people who may or may not want to hurt him. He confides in his girlfriend Jezzie Elizabeth Pena but she cannot fathom the horror that Jacob is experiencing. He seeks guidance from his chiropractor Danny Aiello an old friend who holds some all too wise wisdom. And Jacob is still broken by the death of his young son. He still mourns despite seeming to begin a new life away from his old family he is divorced. Yet when he is on the subway he sees a man with what appears to be a tail. When at a party he witnesses his girlfriend dance erotically with a winged creature. And then there are the faces faceless beings that shake rapidly. Is Jacob crazy or did something happen in Vietnam? Jacob's Ladder is scary not because it is filled with gore. No one is eviscerated maimed or disembowled. The true terror is psychological touching the very core of what can disturb. We are not frightened shielding our eyes from the screen hiding in the shoulder of a significant other. No we are unsettled yet mesmerized astounded by what we are seeing. The most frightening images are the ones you can't look away from.Take for instance the scene with Jacob on his bed grieving over the loss of his son. We see the desolate apartment we hear the quiet and we feel his anguish. The fact that we see a man violently vibrate his body howling and shrieking a horrible sound is off settling. That man is not supposed to be there. Jacob knows that. We know that. Yet the director Lynn knows this as well. And by incorporating an image so... unusual at such an abrupt moment it shows us the level that the film has taken. Lynn is now able to do anything show us anything. He has become the puppeteer not only of the characters but of the audience. When a director takes away your entire sense of reality he becomes dangerous and the audience is more alone than ever.The ending is a matter of perspective and interpretation. One can look at it as closure. Another can look at it as a cop out a display of cleverness. But everything that has been leading up to it has been exhilarating a true showcase of the surreal. The fact is one cannot leave Jacob's Ladder normal. You just can't. The film requires too many emotions. It requires too much thought. Even for a person who admires the film even likes it I still cannot end the movie without feeling different silent perhaps cold disturbed yet maybe even enlightened.This film could have not been made now. There is just no way that the quality would still remain nor the genuine terror. Today psychology has been replaced with clich and story has been replaced with CGI. To think of truly great horror none have ever been made post visual effects era. The fact that this film is not ruined by quick editing over stylized cinematography and flashy effects is a testament to the time in which it was made. The dry washed out color grainy gritty appearance and subtle ambient score are all a credit to the late 80's early 90's an era where the practicality of effects added to the realism not detracted. Because of this the story plot and characters take over a rare occasion in today's films.The brilliance of Jacob's Ladder arises form the film's ability to only show us the door. The director describes it to us and only hints at what is behind. We as the audience are required to figure out what is truly inside and ultimately open it. The problem with modern genre movies is that the director opens the door for us. Why can't we choose to examine the door and only wonder what is behind it? Wy can't we decide if we want to open it or not? Well in the case of the film it is not a door but a ladder. We have to decide if we want to venture up or down. For me... I ventured up.".

Anyway this is a highly fascinating and entertaining thriller about a Vietnam veteran who always feels like there is somebody or something out to get him. He feels this way because he keeps seeing strange images and many people in which he comes in contact with appear to have horns growing out of their heads and whatnot. Him and his war buddies believe that these strange occurrences are the result of something that happened during the war. The best element of this film is its atmosphere and paranormal feel which will really give you the creeps as well as have you guessing what the cause of the strange occurrences that are affecting Jacob really are. Well worth viewing and if it doesn't grab you on the first viewing don't hesitate to try it again you may enjoy it more. 810.".

	schema:headline " Outstanding Tale of Psychological Terror";
	schema:reviewBody "N.B. Spoilers within. If you have never seen Jacob's Ladder do not read beyond this first paragraph. I would never ruin the special experience for the firsttime viewer. Just know that it is not for the faint of heart but that none of its disturbing material  which there is a lot of  is gratuitous I promise you. If you're up for the film's emotional intensity graphic visual style and thoughtprovoking plot then see it. Period.This entire movie except for a single scene I can think of takes place in is made of Jacob Singer's mind. He is on a long agonizing search. What really happened to him in Vietnam? Why are demons tormenting him? Why are secretive army thugs harassing him? Why is his very existence a disintegrating fugue between three worlds? Is he even alive or is he experiencing hell? Ultimately what is the meaning of his life? Roughly in the manner of Slaughterhouse Five Jacob lurches uncontrollably between 'Nam life with Jezebel and life with Sarah and their two sons. Which is real and which is only a dream? We are kept guessing and this really propels the story forward. Jezebel is a purposely complex character highly sensuous feisty and impatient compassionate and concerned. Sarah and the children are all about stability and love. 'Nam is of course Jacob's worst nightmare. But his deepest anguish is the loss of his youngest favorite son Gabe who died in a tragic untimely accident.Evil seems to be winning the war through much of the film but Jacob's visits to his chiropractor Louis are oases of relief and Light. Louis is literally the film's guardian angel sage mentor savior. Not only does this angel bravely extract Jacob from a hellish entrapment in the hospital his wise words see below revisit Jacob in the penultimate scene and help him achieve his final release. The appearance late in the film of the Chemist offers another temporary reprieve from the terror if only because he has an important piece of the Truth.Jacob's Ladder of course does not belong to the traditional horror genre. It is far richer a uniquely psychologicalhorror film. It is so effective because the viewer is inside Jacob's mental state experiencing the horrors and fears as he does. For all the emphasis on evil there is a thread of Good often in symbolic Christian guise which structures the film in a long tradition. The main characters' names Jacob in the Bible the personification of personal struggle Jezebel thought of through the ages as all that is wicked in Woman yet our Jezebel here is much more Sarah astonishing beauty Eli the Old Testament priest and judge and Gabriel the Left Hand of God chief messenger who is sent to earth to prophesy and aid. There is Jacob's Ladder the gateway by which angels pass from heaven to earth and back. And there is the welcome presence of Louis who quotes Meister Eckhart the 14thcentury Christian mystic and philosopher. In Jacob's most crucial meeting with Louis he hears Eckhart's decisive wisdom. To crudely paraphrase in death or in one's fear of it let go of all earthly concerns and the demons will release you.Director Adrian Lyne is brilliant here this film has to be his magnum opus to date. He works effectively between sustained eeriness flatout terror and meditative quiet. Every technical element is impeccably realized and integrated and the acting is firstrate. The character of Jacob has to be one of the most beaten down harried confused and embattled I've ever seen yet he is a fighter to the end. He drives himself toward the answers. Tim Robbins could have easily slipped into overdone caricature but he finesses the role admirably. Elizabeth Pena captures the many shadings of Jezebel. Danny Aiello conveys persuasively Louis's strength and serenity. And kudos to writer Bruce Joel Rubin who  after all of the dark demonic struggles and bewildering reality bending  rewards Jacob and us with a transcendent resolution to the greatest questions there are at the end.I won't even bother with what is real and what is not and what is what except to say that the film may or may not be a take on the great Ambrose Bierce short story An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge. Despite any concrete interpretations even by its director or writer their own creation defies easy answers. I welcome a film of diverse readings. It means very different things to different people it says something new with each viewing. Personally speaking I don't watch this film often it has a powerful spell over me that I don't want to lose. A last word about the music Maurice Jarre's haunting and unsettling score perfectly supports the story. His contribution to the feel of the moment is immense. Finally there is the coup of using the song Sonny Boy which becomes a leitmotif for Gabe the absolute love of Jacob's life. It's an astounding fit ...You're sent from heaven and I know your worth  You made a heaven for me right here on the earth  When I'm old and gray dear promise you won't stray dear  for I love you Sonny Boy. Early in the film we briefly see Jacob bouncing along in his Postal truck he is casually singing a broken version of the song. At Gabe's first appearance the song sounds as if from a magical music box. A minute later father and son sing it together as Gabe is tucked into bed. But in a jawdropping stroke the classic version by Al Jolson wafts into the air just after Jacob is pronounced dead in the final moments it continues through the fadetoblack and into the credits...it segues into the beyond. Is it the last thought Jacob has on earth?".

	onyx:emotionText "N.B. Spoilers within. If you have never seen Jacob's Ladder do not read beyond this first paragraph. I would never ruin the special experience for the firsttime viewer. Just know that it is not for the faint of heart but that none of its disturbing material  which there is a lot of  is gratuitous I promise you. If you're up for the film's emotional intensity graphic visual style and thoughtprovoking plot then see it. Period.This entire movie except for a single scene I can think of takes place in is made of Jacob Singer's mind. He is on a long agonizing search. What really happened to him in Vietnam? Why are demons tormenting him? Why are secretive army thugs harassing him? Why is his very existence a disintegrating fugue between three worlds? Is he even alive or is he experiencing hell? Ultimately what is the meaning of his life? Roughly in the manner of Slaughterhouse Five Jacob lurches uncontrollably between 'Nam life with Jezebel and life with Sarah and their two sons. Which is real and which is only a dream? We are kept guessing and this really propels the story forward. Jezebel is a purposely complex character highly sensuous feisty and impatient compassionate and concerned. Sarah and the children are all about stability and love. 'Nam is of course Jacob's worst nightmare. But his deepest anguish is the loss of his youngest favorite son Gabe who died in a tragic untimely accident.Evil seems to be winning the war through much of the film but Jacob's visits to his chiropractor Louis are oases of relief and Light. Louis is literally the film's guardian angel sage mentor savior. Not only does this angel bravely extract Jacob from a hellish entrapment in the hospital his wise words see below revisit Jacob in the penultimate scene and help him achieve his final release. The appearance late in the film of the Chemist offers another temporary reprieve from the terror if only because he has an important piece of the Truth.Jacob's Ladder of course does not belong to the traditional horror genre. It is far richer a uniquely psychologicalhorror film. It is so effective because the viewer is inside Jacob's mental state experiencing the horrors and fears as he does. For all the emphasis on evil there is a thread of Good often in symbolic Christian guise which structures the film in a long tradition. The main characters' names Jacob in the Bible the personification of personal struggle Jezebel thought of through the ages as all that is wicked in Woman yet our Jezebel here is much more Sarah astonishing beauty Eli the Old Testament priest and judge and Gabriel the Left Hand of God chief messenger who is sent to earth to prophesy and aid.

It's precisely with the spectator that Lyne and Bruce Joel Robin the scriptwriter play with. They take a malicious pleasure in getting the spectator lost in a real maze where seem to border dream and reality. Like Tim Robbins you look for the clue to the mystery. This clue may be the chemist which Jacob's meeting at the refreshment bar truck. This chemist will lead the plot towards an amazing conclusion.In Adrian Lyne's movie there's also a part of the fantastic genre that is very well exploited at first common and normal living conditions but that are little by little overcome by the unreal the strange and the fear.The movie also enjoys an outstanding performance to begin with Tim Robbins.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the kind of movie that is sorely missing from today's theatres. While numerous directors and writers too numerous to count are trying to take horror films in new original and relevant ways Jacob's Ladder will stand the test of time as a cult film that is truly terrifying and goes the extra mile by containing both criticism of military politics and an incredibly dense emotional subtext none of which overwhelms the final product.Current horror films take the concept of gore jump scares and soundtrack to the utmost extreme sacrificing mood tension and restraint which are the biggest assets to a horror film. Jacob's Ladder utilizes every tool in the horror palette that it needs while remaining true to its own ethos. The best scene to fit this example is the party where one of the characters quite literally dances with a demon. In a more contemporary horror film we would clearly see this demon shots might be in slow motion to emphasize the sexuality in it we would probably get creepy soundtrack music the character in question would probably get torn apart and at least part of the demon would likely be CGI. Instead the demon is seen in flashes that are quite unclear which gives the viewer the idea that what they're NOT seeing is more terrifying. The sequence takes place in real time with appropriate dance music in the background without sacrificing the sexuality and the meaning of what is happening this gives it a more realistic feel to the viewer. All the visual effects are in camera but never in the same shot as the protagonist offering a distance that allows for interpretation is what the protagonist seeing reality or an illusion?This one scene which is by no means a plot spoiler is indicative of the technical formal and metaphorical mastery of this film. The explanations for what is seen in the film are critical without being overbearing and toe the line for believability while leaving space for interpretation. The mood conveyed by the film is consistently dark darker than most any other film could hope to achieve. It's so dark in fact that a large majority of people were practically catatonic leaving the original cut of the film.This film fires on all cylinders the directing writing acting music special effects production design message mood and tension are always kept exactly where they should be. Simply put it's a dark masterpiece.".

A small group of US soldiers are joking around but suddenly they are attacked by the enemy apparently! As the attack starts some of the GI's suffer from strange attacks and everything turns into chaos. Jacob Singer Tim Robbins is wounded by a bayonet but we don't see by who and why. The rest of the movie revolves around this day and what really happened.Singer drops to the ground in Vietnam and we are taken to New York. The war is over and Singer has recovered from his wound and is now working as a postman even though he took a PhD before going to Vietnam. The reason After the war he didn't want to think anymore. He has left his wife Sarah and now lives with his girlfriend Jezebel Elizabeth Pea. Sarah and Jacob had three children together but one Gabe Macaulay Culkin was killed in an automobile accident before Jacob went to Vietnam.Jacob suffers from eerie attacks in which he is hunted by inhuman beings. At a party he has one of his attacks and he sees Jezebel dancing and having sex with a demon on the dance floor looks like something from a hentai cartoon. One day Jacob receives a call from one of his old Vietnam buddies. He suffers from the same attacks and he is convinced it's demons and he's going to hell. He is freed from his torment when his car blows up just after he and Jacob parted. It turns out that the whole platoon is suffering from the same attacks and they believe that the army must have done something to them. They ask a lawyer Geary Jason Alexander to take their case and he initially accepts.Now the movie turns momentarily into a government conspiracy thriller because Jacob learns that his army buddies have abandoned the case and so has the lawyer. Jacob is pretty sure that the army has pressured them out. He is proved correct when he himself is forced into a car for a 'friendly' conversation with a couple of government thugs. Jacob fights them off and jumps out of the car. The landing hurts his weak back and he is taken to a hospital after he has been robbed by Santa Claus who steals the wallet with Jacobs only picture of Gabe. The movie is also known as Dante's Inferno and we understand why when Jacob arrives at the hospital. This is my favorite scene in the movie  as if hospitals weren't scary enough There are limbs and blood all over the place and strange and deform people crowd the hallways. The Evil Doctor deservingly credited as such on IMDb! tells Jacob that he's dead. Louis Danny Aiello who is Jacob's chiropractic gets him out.Home again Jacob is contacted by Michael Matt Craven who worked as a chemist for the US army in Vietnam. He tells the story about The Ladder  a drug designed to turn soldiers into killing machines. The drug was first tested on animals and Vietcong soldiers with incredible and scary results  Jacob's platoon was the first US test subjects. They turned mad and killed each other! In this scene Lyne proves that the imagination is far better than any images when Michael tells about the drug testing  Michael never thought people could do such things to each otherEarlier in the movie Louis told Jacob which is the essential quote of the movieEckhart saw Hell too. He said The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life your memories your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you he said. They're freeing your soul. So if you're frightened of dying and... and you're holding on you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth.Now Jacob returns to the house where he lived with Sarah. His dead son Gabe comes to get him. Hand in hand with Gabe Jacob walks up the stairs into the light. The demons have turned into angels and Jacob is in heaven! Now we are taken back to Vietnam where Jacob dies in a MASH unit  the doctors couldn't do anymore but they notice how peaceful Jacob looks. The only REAL things in the movie was the first and the last scene  the rest was a dreamhallucinationdivine interventionI consider this to be Tim Robbins best performance ever and Adrian Lyne's best movie  a somewhat overlooked treasure not on the horror board where most have seen it. The brilliant score by Maurice Jarre and beautiful cinematography by Jeffrey Kimball True Romance and Stigmata creates the perfect mood and atmosphere for this thoughtful experience. The movie isn't filled with special effects  often they just hint what's going on and leaves the rest to the imagination. The fast motion head jerks are very powerful and the same goes for the scene where Jezebel's eyes turn black  a scene also used very effective in The Passion of the Christ. My rating 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Can you say disturbing? Well that adjective surely fits this unusual movie one I've only viewed once but plan on seeing again sometime this year. It's a strange film and could be taken a number of ways. For instance it has some twisted theology but yet could also be used as a tool for evangelism. It's a difficult movie to interpret but a commentaryinterview extra on DVD does explain some questions one would have after watching this because a lot of people apparently misinterpret this film. It's not family fare I'll tell you that. The language is brutal and there are some scenes in here that are not for the feint at heart. The lead character played by Tim Robbins is a tortured soul and plays that role well. Most of the story is told in flashbacks as a man is dying and is going through the final stages of death recalling some key moments in his life. Those moments are magnified the bad being shown worse than what it was and viceversa. The main message here is As long as you are afraid of death the evil demons will torment you but when you let go and aren't afraid anymore you'll find those demons to be angels.This is the kind of film you could probably write long long essays on. Suffice to say it's quite different can be very offensive but  if you're willing to take a shot at something different and unpleasant at times  it is definitely worth checking out and then discussing.".

The hallucinations become increasingly bizarre as Jacob struggles to overcome the painful memories of his son played by Macaulay Culkin who was killed while he was in the war.Lyne uses seemingly ordinary images to evoke the fear and sickness that Jacob suffers with from vapid shower curtains and naked spines to the grotesque slab of meat inside a refrigeratorall induce a sense of estrangement and insanity.

At times flashes of a later life i.e. an afterlife appear on screen that seem to foreshadow his inevitable fate. Jacob begins to see literal demons infiltrate his perceptual awareness haunting and tearing at his soul causing him to sink lower and lower into the depths of madness as he struggles to let go of his memories and embrace death. But are these demons real or are they simply figments of his hallucinatory imagination? Along the way he shares multiple conversations with his guardian angel chiropractor Louis Danny Aiello who imparts very peculiar almost preachy wisdom to Jacob to help him calm his hellish nightmares. Quoting from Meister Eckhart the master of Negative Theology he says Eckhart saw Hell too he said 'the only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of life your memories your attachments. They burn them all away. But they're not punishing you' he said. 'They're freeing your soul. So if you're frightened of dying and and you're holding on you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth.' Most of the time the viewer is unaware of where the story is headed. It's like an LSD trip gone seriously wrong and without that backup friend to soothe or provide remedy. It's also somewhat reminiscent of C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters very selfaware of the macabre and forces you to ponder uncomfortable subjects. The film is one of my favorites as it merges the gap between the two worlds we exist inthe dark one and the light onenot to forget exposes the two voices that exist inside us allthe devilish one and the angelic one.

	schema:headline " Great Film Spoilers here";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers hereThis story focuses on a Vietnam veteran named Jacob Singer who is experiencing flashbacks in his present life.  He is losing his hold on reality and nothing seems real.  These flashbacks of Vietnam horror are mixed with present and taking over his thought process.  He is having problems existing and remaining sane.  Ving Rhames and Jason Alexander have minor roles but are effective.  The real star of the film is Tim Robbins who is excellent.  Jacob is a nervous wreck and very vulnerable.  His character displays a great range of human emotions and one is often questioning who is Jacob Singer what is his identity??  It is blurred through the different symbolic characters that exist in his mind.  His women in his life  his wife Sarah and Jezebel his chiropractor and his Vietnam veteran buddies.  Yet he is not set and committed to either one of these characters except two.  Firstly he loves and misses his dead son Gabe. He genuinely loves his son and that love is what allows him to let go of the world and ascend up his own ladder to the afterlife.Secondly he escapes to the character of Danny Aiello when he needs healin g and help.  Throughout the film one is questioning the validity of what is really occurring.  Is Jacob dying?  Is he in a living hell?  Or is he just plain insane?  He cannot trust many people except Louis played by Danny Aiello his chiropractor.  Louis reveals the truth of the film near the end that Singer is in between heaven and hell and not letting his soul ascend to Heaven.  He has to let go and allow the angels to take him up to Heaven. Otherwise the devils will perpetually stalk him and make his life a living hell.  The drug twist was an interesting curve that was effective yet I am glad the movie did not end on that note.  It would have seemed an unnatural conclusion given Jacob Singer's experiences in the film.  It was not a nightmare nor any dream or hallucination.  It was a true experience in all the sense of that word.  The events characters and manifestations that are shown in the film come from Jacob's mind in a sincerely truthful way. They all are symbolic of different aspects of Jacob's psyche.  It is like a dream but dreams are not as symbolic as Jacob's experiences here.  It is much more than any dream. It is an altogether different form of reality. It is the place where reality seizes to exist.  It is the playground of one's own mind dreamlike yes but not a dream.  The mind is of itself and creates images that are representative of his whole existence and being. His entire life exists solely in his mind at this point.  Physically he is not on earth anymore but in a type of purgatory of the mind. Essentially the whole film is what he sees in his mind on his deathbed the horror of death the fear of hell and of staying on Earth when your place is in heaven.The ending features a great camera shot.  Singer is lying dead on an operating table and the doctors walk away from it wondering this man's name. This takes away from the uniqueness of Jacob Singer the person.  It depersonalizes him.  Instead of having a peaceful deeply emotional ending where he is walking to Heaven it ends on an impersonal almost apathetic note with a subtle hint of uncertainty.  It brings up a fundamental question  what happens to someone when they die??  No one really knows and there will always be uncertainty.  Thus one cannot be certain that Jacob Singer went to Heaven in this film.  If it had ended on the shot of him going up the stairs with his son him ascending to Heaven would most certainly be true.  Yet at the end he is just one man who has died in Vietnam.  It is a cold and somber ending.  Though he is peaceful and dead his ties to the world have been severed.  This is a great conclusion for it takes it away from the personal nature of the main character and it focuses on the more significant question of what death really is??  To the rest of the world Jacob Singer has died and is just another dead body who is done singing'.  Yet personally in his mind Jacob is going to Heaven and is sure of it.  I love how subtle this idea is brought up here.  The uncertainty of the 'undiscovered country' is a question that no one can answeryet everyone asks.   This is a very compelling story with a satisfying ending.  It also has a good number of curves along the way that give it good sustenance.".

He wakes up in New York subway while going home late night after working overtime in the post office. He is divorced from Sarah Patricia Kalember lives with his colleague and lover Jezebel Elizabeth Pea is a small apartment in Brooklyn and misses his young son Gabe Macaulay Culkin who died in an accident where Jacob feels responsible for. Along the next days Jacob is chased by demons and finds conspiracy in the army while having different visions of different moments of his life.Yesterday I saw The Jacket and I decide to see once more Jacob's Ladder maybe for the fifth time. This anguishing and intriguing story is one of the most original and unique I have ever seen and has been plagiarized many times mainly in the foregoing mentioned The Jacket. Tim Robbins gives another topnotch performance in the role of a troubled man resolving his life due to the feeling of guilty for the loss of his younger son. Bruce Joel Rubin who also wrote and produced Ghost Jacob's Ladder and My Life shows that is very connected with spiritual issues approaching this theme in his films. The Brazilian title of this movie Alucinaes do Passado Hallucinations From the Past wrongly induces the viewer and destroys the dubious sense of the original title Jacob is the lead character Ladder is the name of the experiment his platoon and him had been submitted in Vietnam but the interpretation of Jacob's Ladder in the Bible is that this is the only means to reach the total ecstasy the plenitude however we need first supersede the obstacles that we find in our ascension. Further Jacob experienced a vision in which he saw a ladder reaching into heaven with angels going up and down it a vision that is commonly referred to as Jacob's Ladder from Wikipedia. Another interesting aspect is that all the characters have biblical names. For example Jezebel is considered the most wicked woman in the entire Bible the character of Elizabeth Pea was responsible for the separation of Jacob and Sarah and maybe he was blaming her for keeping him far from his family and Gabriel is the angel that explained signs from God and announced the conception birth and mission of Jesus to Mary. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Alucinaes do Passado Hallucinations From the PastNote On 19 May 2009 I saw this movie again now on DVD.".

	schema:headline " An Excellent Movie Full of Symbolisms";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some movies that really set a great precedent and Jacob's Ladder is a leading example. Long before movies like The Sixth Sense or The Others were out Jacob's Ladder was one of the first movies to play so artfully with combinations of the natural and the paranormal the real and the surreal and most importantly a movie that manages to bring the viewer completely by surprise in the end by making everything seen up to that point shown in a different perspective. The film is full of symbolisms which are capable to be grasped by someone only if heshe sees the movie more than once. It is not a horror movie yet there are some scenes that can definitely scare you quite much.In brief it is a GREAT 10 out 10 THOUGHTPROVOKING movie but be prepared for a hard ride when you watch it!And now let me express my thoughts of how I interpreted it. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD I subscribe to the following theory as expressed in several variations by other reviewers in this forum Jacob gets hit by friendly fire in Vietnam and his fellow soldiers try to rescue him yet to no avail in the end. This is the real part of the film which ends with the two doctors claiming that we lost him in the last scene.The surreal part that is taking part in Jacob's mind or soul throughout this period is that he descends to hell subway straggles with demons Jezzebel evil doctors Santa Claus in the street security men etc. but finally the angels chiropratic Sarah dead son chemist show him the way up to heaven. Throughout this process he is punished for his noughty thoughts or maybe acts that he had with Jezzebel when he was married he is told the truth about what happened to his ladderdrugged battalion chemist and he is taught to live with the fact that he has to reconcile with what haunts him and pass away peacefully chiropractic.It is interesting to note that the film plays with many symbolisms Biblical names Jacob Jezzebel Sara hellish subway where everything is locked stairway to heaven with shining light Jezzebel burns Sarah's and kids' photos in fire demons with horns and tails Jake burns in fever etc. Moreover the idea is that only Jake is salvated his friends try to break free with him but finally are doomed to stay in hell.I think that the more ones sees the film the more heshe will find out new things. EXCELLENT!".

Long before movies like The Sixth Sense or The Others were out Jacob's Ladder was one of the first movies to play so artfully with combinations of the natural and the paranormal the real and the surreal and most importantly a movie that manages to bring the viewer completely by surprise in the end by making everything seen up to that point shown in a different perspective. The film is full of symbolisms which are capable to be grasped by someone only if heshe sees the movie more than once. It is not a horror movie yet there are some scenes that can definitely scare you quite much.In brief it is a GREAT 10 out 10 THOUGHTPROVOKING movie but be prepared for a hard ride when you watch it!And now let me express my thoughts of how I interpreted it. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD I subscribe to the following theory as expressed in several variations by other reviewers in this forum Jacob gets hit by friendly fire in Vietnam and his fellow soldiers try to rescue him yet to no avail in the end. This is the real part of the film which ends with the two doctors claiming that we lost him in the last scene.The surreal part that is taking part in Jacob's mind or soul throughout this period is that he descends to hell subway straggles with demons Jezzebel evil doctors Santa Claus in the street security men etc. but finally the angels chiropratic Sarah dead son chemist show him the way up to heaven. Throughout this process he is punished for his noughty thoughts or maybe acts that he had with Jezzebel when he was married he is told the truth about what happened to his ladderdrugged battalion chemist and he is taught to live with the fact that he has to reconcile with what haunts him and pass away peacefully chiropractic.It is interesting to note that the film plays with many symbolisms Biblical names Jacob Jezzebel Sara hellish subway where everything is locked stairway to heaven with shining light Jezzebel burns Sarah's and kids' photos in fire demons with horns and tails Jake burns in fever etc. Moreover the idea is that only Jake is salvated his friends try to break free with him but finally are doomed to stay in hell.I think that the more ones sees the film the more heshe will find out new things. EXCELLENT!";

A phenomenal script side by side with a talented cast that keeps you mesmerized for its entirety.  Furthermore if you have the chance see the deleted scenes on the DVD and laserdisc?.  There is one that stands out. Near the end a scene was deleted.  It is absolute poetry and frankly I can't believe it was left out.

	schema:reviewBody "Years after surviving his time in Vietnam Jacob Singer is still traumatised and suffering from violent flashbacks. He is separated from his wife and is keeping it together the best he can  but things are starting to happen to him. Entrapment in a closed subway station is the start of it with monsters and demons also closing in on him. When he meets an old army comrade who is also having the same experiences he finds hope  but it is short lived. Jacob soon comes to realize that the army must have done something to his whole unit that is only catching up with him now.I have seen this film a couple of times and there is something about it that means I will probably come back to it within a few years. The plot is difficult to say the least but also comes across as pretty easy to get into  it is only really in the final scene that I have myself forced to question everything I had seen. Of course this is not to say the film has a 'normal' storyline to it because it doesn't  it is weird full of visions and the plot although seemingly easy to follow is still very strange. The film takes us into two different paths and both of them make as much or as little sense as each other and the film never actually lets me decide which one of the several ideas is true it is too easy to just say 'he is dead and it is all a dream' and instead I always find myself trying to work out more about it. I wonder is Singer dead and this is a sort of purgatory? Is he suffering from the effects of drugs? Is he mad? Or is it just a dream? It may frustrate some viewers but for me part of the appeal is that it could be any or none of these things.It is hard to really describe and I know that it may annoy and alienate some viewers but for me the strange mix of material really works. Boiled down to its essence the film is consistently creepy but also rather harrowing at points. The images are weird and well delivered halfseen and a little disturbing  it is not the normal stuff of horror movies but comes across a little more up market it is less about gore than it is about the mood that the images present. Lyne directs with a really cold air and it makes the film all the creepier but he also gives us enough of a human story so that flashes of Singer's family children and dead son are rather moving and engaging. Of course this is only helped by a great central performance by Robbins who conveys a palatable sense of fear throughout but also blended with a real tragedy that helps me get into the story. He is supported by a cast that looks better over the years with many of those in small roles becoming much more famous since this Rhames Vince Alexander La Salle Culkin. Pena is pretty good and Aiello is enjoyable even if I didn't totally understand his role in the context of any of my theories. It is Robbins' film though and he helps us get to the core of the paranoia and fear that the film is trying to get across.Overall this is a very good film if you enjoy alternative horror  creepy rather than gory. The plot may frustrate because it doesn't give you an easy answer  in fact the ending just makes the whole thing harder to understand and hold together. It is a strange film with images and such that stick with me after each viewing  not frightening so much as it is just a little unnerving. The sense of paranoia andor the descent into hell is well delivered and the mystery of the plot is enough to bring you back more than once. Not a perfect film but many of its flaws are also some of its strengths.".

He made of Billy's weakness a separate entity. Painful creepy. Stanley is goes without saying sublime. Another superlative characterization in her far too brief film gallery.

Judith Donner in her only role brings a subtle naturalness as the child Amanda who they borrow from a wealthy couple. Also good were Mark Eden and Nanette Newman who's married to the film's director Bryan Forbes as the child's parents Mr. and Mrs. Clayton. John Barry's score brings various shades in many chase scenes and some quietly chilling ones involving Myra and Billy. And Forbes brings measured tension in many pointofview shots. The suspense involves psychological emotions that cut to the bone and brings a compellingly British flavor to the concluding scenes. So for all that I highly recommend Seance on a Wet Afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years the Oscars have often gone to performers and films that seemed to make little sense at the time and subsequently failed to stand the test of time. While Julie Andrews was certainly marked for stardom her singing nanny did not hold a candle to Kim Stanley's tourdeforce as Myra in Seance on a Wet Afternoon either in 1964 or in 2004. One wonders in retrospect if any of the voters actually saw this brilliant minor masterwork. If they had how did Richard Attenborough's performance get overlooked? His subtle underplaying as the passive husband is in perfect sync to Stanley's showy turn as the medium and deserved Academy recognition as much as and perhaps more than his direction of Gandhi. The taut screenplay and direction by Bryan Forbes the fine black and white cinematography by Gerry Turpin and John Barry's music also deserved recognition. Unfortunately Hollywood was into big musicals in 1964 and the Academy's nominations were showered on My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins while more serious fare such as this film was overlooked. While Lady clunks along today as a leaden stagebound adaptation and Poppins does not seem quite as charming as it did Seance on a Wet Afternoon and the two brilliant performances at its center remain as riveting as they were 40 years ago. Fortunately the Academy has shown some maturity in recent years and films such as this are more often recognized which raises their profiles and brings them to the attention of viewers who might otherwise miss them. Without any recognition other than recommendations from those few who have seen this characterdriven suspense gem Seance has been little seen and remains a cinematic jewel that awaits discovery and its deserved place among British film classics.".

Myra is trying to explain to Billy why they must carry out this plan and turns off the music playing to make herself heard. A few seconds later she says Who turned off the music? Billy replies You did dear. Myra says Now why would I have done that? Billy resignedly says You're right. It must have been me. This brief scene effectively outlines the nature of their dysfunctional relationship.And while we cannot condone their behavior we can sympathize with the characters. Ultimately Billy loves his wife despite her selfcentered and unhinged behavior. We understand his love for her because despite her actions she is quite vulnerable.I've heard some stories and movies described as ghost stories without a ghost. I never really understood what that meant until I heard Seance described this way. Both of the main characters are definitely haunted Myra by her childhood the death of her son and her own frustrated ambitions and Billy by the memories of a life without purpose. In fact the only purpose in his life comes from his wife Myra. That alone helps explain why he would go along with Myra's mad kidnapping scheme. It also helps build the suspense when Myra insists that they kill the child. Billy seems to like the child but we have plenty of examples of Billy going against his better judgment to carry out Myra's commands. Not until the very end do you know if he did or didn't do what Myra asked.This is an excellent suspenseful movie with two superior performances. The characters of Myra and Billy Savage will stay with you long after the film ends.".

It's unclear whether the husband played by Attenborough actually believes anything supernatural is going on because as the story progresses what does become clear is that his wife played by Stanley is having or has already had a serious break with reality.A word of warning to those thinking this is a movie about the supernatural given the film's titleit is not although some may see something of the supernatural in the wife's delusional mode of existence.

The way Forbes handles the exposition withhelding information from the audience long enough to keep them guessing releasing them in an ambiguous fashion to maintain an aura of mystery all the while not forgetting those little casual moments that don't advance the plot but allow the material to breathe and the characters to emerge thridimensional and human instead of drab caricatures drawn as plot devices is a masterclass in storytelling that one would expect from a master of Bergman's calibre. The second half steadily accelerates building up tension between the kidnappers and between them and the police with some absolutely riveting pieces of suspense such as the cat and mouse game in the subway or the mother of the kidnapped girl making a sudden appearance at the house her daughter is being held to participate in a seance where the medium foreshadows her daughter's fate while she remains unaware right down to the brilliant conclusion around a seance table where stage actor Patrick Magee has a cameo Mr. Alexander from a CLOCKWORK ORANGE Seance is a terrific piece of filmmaking that will particularly appeal to horror fans.

	schema:reviewBody "Assisted by her reluctant husband a delusional but clever psychic with a fondness for opera carries out a child kidnapping scheme to help boost her mysticism business. The film's premise is interesting but the plot is slow and tedious. Many scenes especially those shot outdoors could have been shortened or even deleted. Blatant plot holes and a sputtering finale further weaken the screen story.If the plot is weak the acting assuredly is not. Richard Attenborough as the meek husband is excellent. Even better is Kim Stanley as the psychotic psychic. Indeed Stanley's performance which earned her an Oscar nomination is the main reason to watch the film. Her method acting is perfect for the role. At times almost whispering her lines she gives an instinctive and highly mannered performance that reminds me of another method actress the brilliant Geraldine Page.Mercifully the film is shot in BW. The best scenes are interior scenes wherein the stark contrast in lighting combines with minimal dialogue and at times only the ticking of a clock in lieu of dialogue to bring about the kind of brooding and dreary atmosphere one would expect for a psychological thriller.The best approach to this film is to ignore the details of the flawed plot and focus instead on the psychology and motivation of Kim Stanley's character.".

No violence yet there is an underlying threat throughout. The creepy Victorian house adds atmosphere but it is the location shots that are excellent. Attenborough is convincing but it is Kim Stanley who shines quite apart from disguising her American accent she is absolutely faultless. Forbes' interview on the DVD is fascinating. As he states there is not a cardboard film set in sight it is all on location. The interview adds so much and should be viewed after the film as he answers all the questions you are asking while watching. John Barry's score is also excellent especially the use of violins in the scene in the Rolls Royce. A 60s black and white classic. that deserves to be reappraised in coming years and will stand as one of Forbes' greatest moments as a director.".

More than once I have tried to accept at this point that the jig is up and I find I often focus on Billy the police  anyone to avoid watching poor Myra because Stanley's performance is so powerful it's nearly too uncomfortable to watch. But as she continues she reveals information that she couldn't possibly know  information that Billy has kept from her. Has everyone else noticed this? This would transform the entire story or for me it would. Does she indeed have the gift that Arthur advised her of or helps her with? It would appear she does. It would seem that her grief histrionics and loss of ethics among other things mask a brilliance. She has devised a hoax to increase her notoriety so has she failed this gift by not respecting her own unique ability? Does Billy act as if he believes she has a gift or does he quietly acquiesce to this as well creating a silent climate of non belief? Either circumstance though different could drive someone crazy. Has anyone by chance read the novel? I probably should . Perhaps it clears this up. Sorry for all the questions. Thoughtful complex psychological atmospheric film.".

Attenborough creates the image of a middleaged man who suspects that he was lucky to get the wife he has and who wants more than anything to live a normal familyoriented life that seems to always remain just beyond his grasp.Seance on a Wet Afternoon is not a masterpiece but it is a subtly and intensely disquieting film the kind that lingers in your head long after you've seen it.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "Julie Christie's combination of talent beauty and brains has enthralled me over four decades. Nearly a decade ago her Oscar nominated performance in Afterglow established that she was not a spent force while playing a gracefully aging wife of a handyman in the US. One thought that would be her best turn at geriatric impersonations.Less than a decade later Christie comes up with an even better performance of a woman coping with Alzheimer's disease in a debut directorial effort Away from Her of Canadian actress Sarah Polley. I saw the film today at the ongoing International Film Festival of Kerala India where Ms Christie serving on the jury for the competition section introduced her film thus It is immaterial whether you are rich or poorwe cannot predict what can happen to us. Enjoy the film with this thought. Ms Christie probably put in her best effort because the young director considers Ms Christie to be her adoptive mother having worked together on three significant movie projects in five years. The film's subject brings memories of two similar films Pierre GranierDeferre' film Le Chat that won a Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for both Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret in 1971 and Paul Mazursky's Harry and Tonto which won an Oscar for the lead actor Art Carney in 1974. This performance of Julie Christie ranks alongside those winners.Today geriatric care is a growing problem. This film is a sensitive look at parting of married couples when one of them needs institutional care. Ms Polley's choice of the actor Gordon Pinsent is an intelligent one as the film relies on his narration and Mr Pinsent's deep voice provides the right measure of gravitas. Olympia Dukakis is another fine actor playing a lady who has quit quitting. So is Michael Murphy doing a lengthy role without saying a word.The strengths of the film are the subject the direction the performances and the seamless editing by the director's spouse. It is not a film that will attract young audiences who are insensitive. Yet the film has a evocative scene where a young teenager with several parts of her body pierced by rings is totally amazed by the devotion of the aging husband for his wife. So in a way the film reaches out to different age groups. Though it talks about sex it can be safe family viewing material.Chances are that most viewers will love the film if they are interested in films that are different from the American films that get shown in multiplexes to quote a character in the film. More importantly this film advertises the problem of Alzheimer's disease eloquently and artistically. It prepares you for future shocks.".

Even as it deteriorates the brain  and the film about this tragic process  retains its surprises and wonders and to the very last scene of Away from Her you cannot sit back and assume you know what will happen. You don't the film's unpredictability is one of its great assets.Add to Polley's script based on Alice Munro's The Bear Came Over the Mountain and direction to Christie's and Pinsent's magnificent individual and ensemble acting a cast to treasure. Olympia Dukakis and Michael Murphy play a couple whose lives unexpectedly intertwine with Grant and Fiona's. Kristen Thomson steals whole scenes from the principals as the head nurse at the institution where Fiona is placed warm supportive nurturing and altogether wonderful the nurse has one quick exchange in which she shows another side and another attitude  and this slight glitch makes the character even more real and sympathetic. Away from Her is not a tragedy it's a drama which moves and uplifts. It includes charming and funny moments but even the humor has depth.

	schema:reviewBody "I remember the last time I saw my mother. I sat on the end of her bed strumming guitar and singing a song she used to sing to us as children. I hoped she might remember it. She would probably not however recognise her son. Or even speak. She had Alzheimer's.After selfrighteous 'disease of the week' movies such as Iris it is maybe hard to imagine a riveting nuanced love story of depth and imagination one centred on loss of memory but Away From Her succeeds in spades.Fiona Julie Christie has been married to Grant for 44 years. They have reached a stage of lifetime love based on deep knowledge of each other and acceptance of past misdemeanours. Then Fiona's memory starts to fail. As her Alzheimer's begins to need 24hr care she checks in to Meadowlake residential centre. There she not only forgets who her husband is but develops an affection for another patient  an affection that holds all the tenderness she used to share with her now onlooking husband.Says Producer Simone Urdl The role of Alzheimer's in the film is a metaphor for how memory plays out in a long term relationship what we chose to remember what we choose to forget. And our ability to recall things as Oscar Wilde pointed out is highly selective.Secure in the knowledge that he has given his wife many years of happiness Grant glosses over his unfaithfulness in their younger days. But Fiona's early memories stay longer and come back to haunt him. To bring his wife joy now he is driven to encourage her towards that which gives him most pain.Away From Her takes us from frozen luminescent miseenscene of the couple's secure existence in snowdrenched rural Canada to the handheld cameras and uncertainty that hits in Meadowlake. Excerpts from Auden's Letters From Iceland are sprinkled into the script like shards of crystalline beauty. Julie Christie for whom the lead role was written exudes dynamic good looks and the vibrancy of a young woman bathed in such warmth and passion of years. When she asks Grant to make love to her before leaving there is an urgency and scintillating sexiness about her.Away From Her sparkles as we watch Grant walk his emotional tightrope. The movie is made with such surety that it comes as a shock to realise the director is a first time filmmaker in her twenties. Sarah Polley evokes Bergman as she too touches wordless secrets only the cinema can discover. This talented young woman is highly selective in her acting roles and now behind the camera impresses with her insight and intelligence.My last conversation with my mother before she was institutionalised or I even realised what was happening was a long distance phone call. After chatting happily for five minutes she said quite chirpily and very politely What's your name again? Memory is not always a twoway process. Nor objective. But like this film it can be mesmerising heartwrenching and a remarkably intimate vision.".

	onyx:emotionText "I remember the last time I saw my mother. I sat on the end of her bed strumming guitar and singing a song she used to sing to us as children. I hoped she might remember it. She would probably not however recognise her son. Or even speak. She had Alzheimer's.After selfrighteous 'disease of the week' movies such as Iris it is maybe hard to imagine a riveting nuanced love story of depth and imagination one centred on loss of memory but Away From Her succeeds in spades.Fiona Julie Christie has been married to Grant for 44 years. They have reached a stage of lifetime love based on deep knowledge of each other and acceptance of past misdemeanours. Then Fiona's memory starts to fail. As her Alzheimer's begins to need 24hr care she checks in to Meadowlake residential centre. There she not only forgets who her husband is but develops an affection for another patient  an affection that holds all the tenderness she used to share with her now onlooking husband.Says Producer Simone Urdl The role of Alzheimer's in the film is a metaphor for how memory plays out in a long term relationship what we chose to remember what we choose to forget. And our ability to recall things as Oscar Wilde pointed out is highly selective.Secure in the knowledge that he has given his wife many years of happiness Grant glosses over his unfaithfulness in their younger days.

	schema:reviewBody "Sarah Polley still well under thirty has taken one of my favourite Alice Monroe's stories and created magic with the script casting and production of a remarkable and memorable film.The effect is profound. You are watching actors at the peak of their craft Julie Christie playing Fiona Anderson Gordon Pinsent Grant Anderson and Olympia Dukakis Marian and there is never a false move.But beware this is a movie for grownups and is reminiscent in some ways of The Dead. Do we ever really know someone even though we have lived and breathed their air for over forty years? The tragedy and sometimes humour of Alzheimer's Disease is portrayed beautifully. The occasional lucid moments offering hope only to be followed often quickly by the bafflement of the dementia.But to focus solely on the still breathtakingly beautiful Julie and her brilliance in depicting a woman in the throes of the disease is to diminish the film as it is not only about that. It is about the secrets of the marriage the incarceration of a loved one in a home the despair and sometimes desperation of the spouse left operating in the outside 'real' world the sometimes outrageous bondings of the inhabitants of the group home and the compromises reached by all.There is much symbolism in the movie the snow was particularly meaningful and many wonderful almost unnoticeable 'sidebits'  Olympia trying to pass off a store bought cookie as homemade for one  that bring this movie to wonderful heights. The attention to detail is amazing. I've visited these homes and this was real down to the eccentric and often comically expletiveladen talk from the elderly inhabitants. Polley shows remarkable restraint in just allowing one of these eccentricities to run through the film when it might have been tempting to lay it on a little more thickly.Though never sentimental and often humorous the world through Grant's eyes is vividly portrayed and his anguish is palpable as he witnesses both the disintegration and reinvention of his beloved Fiona. A heartbreaking powerful and moving story brought beautifully to the screen. Bravo to all concerned. Oscar worthy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A couple washes up after dinner. He washes while she dries. They savour the memory of the delicious dinner they just shared. They are smiling and in love after fortyfour years together. In a moment of silence he casually hands her the frying pan he has just cleaned. She dries it with her towel walks to the freezer and puts it inside. She exits the room as if nothing out of the ordinary has just happened. All he can do is watch if his intentions are to be sensitive. This is the context in which we are introduced to Grant and Fiona Gordon Pinsett and Julie Christie in the first feature film adapted and directed by Canadian actress Sarah Polley AWAY FROM HER. Polley brings unapologetic honesty and sympathy to the lives of these two characters. After a lifetime together they will be torn apart by Alzheimer's. Neither can do anything to stop it. He can only watch her mind disappear while she tries to enjoy the undetermined lucid time she has left. It is Polley's delicate and respectful hand that guides the viewer to see past the surface of misplaced kitchen apparel and see the longing for tenderness that is had between as it lingers longer than fading memories.Memory comes in and out in AWAY FROM HER. With the image often filling with white and veering on blurry like a blinding snowstorm Polley sets the tone from the start. Memory is a hazy concept. Alzheimer's is a cruel game that has Fiona having difficulty maintaining her shortterm memory like why she left the house or common words while some of the most painful memories in her life seem like they will never be forgotten. Her story unfolds as she decides to admit herself to a retirement facility so that her husband needn't be responsible for her. This particular home enforces a policy where new residents are not allowed to have any contact with the loved ones they left behind for the first thirty days after they are admitted. When Grant is finally able to return to the residence it isn't clear whether Fiona even recognizes him and worse yet she has found comfort in the company of another man Michael Murphy. As painful as this reality is Polley cuts away to another time and place throughout this build allowing us a glimpse into where Grant will end up as a result of all this change. As a result the film feels interrupted. It is one of few mistakes made by this novice filmmaker but fortunately not one that makes the film any less painful.Polley directs three beautifully nuanced performances from her leads. As Grant Pinsett is bewildered stubborn and hopeful depending on the moment. Despite all of his frustration he is constantly searching for understanding and resolve for the memories even he has difficulty letting go of. Olympia Dukakis joins the cast as Marian the wife of Aubrey the man Fiona befriends in the residence. She is a tough woman brass because she has to be. For Grant she represents what he could have become had it been decided that he would care for his wife himself. Her life is one that was surrendered to supporting her husband through his illness forcing personal happiness to be removed as a possibility. Naturally given the nature of the part it is Christie that pulls the viewer deep into a mind that is falling away. In one scene Grant brings her home for a day. She marvels at how it was kept so well after all this time. Though the home she is seeing was her own for over twenty years she looks on it as if it belonged to someone else. The way her eyes take in the surroundings an environment that she should know intimately suggests a sense of attachment intrinsically linked with a saddened detachment. She should know this place these things and one some level she does. She does not understand why she should feel a sense of familiarity just that it is so. It is as though memories flood back to her but they aren't her own.AWAY FROM HER is a fantastic first film from a talented Canadian actress with great promise as both a perceptive writer and skilled director. It is also a lesson in patience and learning to let go. Not for the viewer but for those on screen. Grant must always exercise restraint while allowing the love of his life to find solace in another man. After all what matters most is that she be at peace. As big a task as this is Fiona must do even more. She must accept that the life she knew is behind her and that the one ahead of her is new necessary and one that might fade away from her as quickly as it happens to her.".

	schema:headline " Promising directorial debut for Sarah Polley";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a story about Alzheimer's Disease AD its effect on those who suffer from it and principally the difficulties that it poses for relatives who see their loved one decay mentally before death. Julie Christie plays Fiona a woman whose dementia progresses rather rapidly. Her husband Grant is dejected with their predicament as Fiona is moved to a specialized facility and within it between wards dealing with patients with differing levels of impairment.The depiction of dementia through the character of Fiona and other patients around her is good but not excellent. From my avowedly limited and not professional experience with ADafflicted close and distant relatives numerous visits to a number of nursing homes  from the fancy to the abject  and long hours roaming the often depressing corridors of the wards observing the behavior of old folks whose minds had gone potty I believe I picked inaccuracies in the behavior of Fiona and her fellow seniors that threw me off. It is not uncommon at the early stages of AD to think that the person may be pretending. Grant thinks that way too at first. I had to agree with him. I had trouble accepting an AD sufferer at the advanced stage of not recognizing a loved one of more than forty years still displaying a keen shortterm memory capacity. Could it be that Fiona what exacting some kind of revenge on Grant past dalliances? The depiction of nursing homes and the commentary about AD is accurate. Sarah Polley has clearly spent time visiting such places. From what I understand she had to deal with her own mother's dementia for about five years. She has first hand experience. The only thing missing in the film is the sometimes lackadaisical attention by bored staff you see in real life. But who knows Canadian senior care may be a lot better.The story has an important additional element in the form of Marian played superbly by Olivia Dukakis whose husband has advanced AD. She illustrates the wrenching decisions that families face. Send the demented relative to an expensive nursing home and go broke doing so or keep the patient at home and live progressively more hellish days. That aspect of the disease jives perfectly with the shared experience of Grant and Marian as they deal with spouses that become unable to reciprocate the love they are given.The patients at the nursing home are actors. Despite their best efforts I found the depictions short of perfect. It is really difficult to ape exactly the tentative and struggling moves of a frail body or the glazed eyes of a lost soul who no longer can comprehend the world.The aforementioned criticisms should be considered minor. Sarah Polley's first venture as a director shows she has what it takes. That is helped by a very good adaptation to the screen of Alice Munro's short story. Overall the casting is excellent.Funded by the Ontario province at a cost short of C5M and shot in that province. Don't miss it.".

	schema:headline " A Nice Movie but a Woefully Inadequate Depiction of a Horrible Way to Die";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't bother to read any of the positive remarks about this movie because what the harshest critics have to say about its flawed depiction of the disease process is essentially correct and constitutes the film's most glaring flaw. It presents a woefully inadequate picture of Alzheimer's Disease as anyone who has had to deal with it personally can well attest. I have read however that attachments between demented patients do occur and also that the disease brings out different aspects of the victim's personality as one might expect  people tending to anger in their normal lives become even more bitter and angry once they become afflicted. Similarly naturally flirtatious or promiscuous people tend to exhibit disturbing exaggerations of that behavior therefore the story isn't entirely implausible just unlikely. It is a nice movie when appreciated on its merits alone. The main problem is that the writer and director used the disease merely as a prop to develop the plot which didn't reflect reality convincingly. Others have alluded to the incontinence one of the most dehumanizing aspects of the disease or the mental confusion and the increasing inability to speak sensibly. Another aspect is socalled shortterm memory loss and its immediate effects. For example I remember my father a highly intelligent and purposeful man before he was diagnosed with the disease sitting at the dinner table with his arms on his lap and banging them on the underside of the table because he forgot the table was there and he was trying to use his arms to make a gesture. He did this over and over again each time saying Ouch! then immediately forgetting that he'd just hurt himself and doing the exact same thing yet another time. It seemed to me that his arms were taking a real bruising but nothing much could be done about it. That was following the first round of serious deterioration in his mental faculties when he seemed to be in good humor and had not yet turned bitter and angry and paranoid or become incontinent and far more confused. Just a year later after more serious deterioration he was dashing out of the house and running around my parents' wealthy neighborhood with his clothes put on wrong scaring people he came across and being picked up and brought home by the police. The combination of not knowing what they are doing while knowing just enough to be both very slippery and a real danger to themselves is a very disturbing aspect of the disease. Only the wealthiest families like the Reagans can afford to keep the patient at home and hire expensive livein care. Most people are forced to sell the patient's home in order to afford the lessexpensive care facility. Alzheimer's Disease is a terrible way to die perhaps worse than cancer because it goes on for so long and just gets worse and worse. And these facilities in concert with the doctors treat the patients with powerful potentially deleterious drugs in order to keep them under control anxious to get them to the final stages more quickly where they are easier to manage and less likely to jump up and head for the door. In fact the institutional staff obviously prefers them when they are further along that is in a wheelchair that can be parked facing the wall for hours at a time. The loved ones of certain patients will bribe the staff members to give special read minimal attention to their afflicted relatives while less fortunate patients are more or less ignored. The movie didn't adequately deal with this seamy reality but then again movies seldom do deal with death in a truly realistic and convincing manner. They tend to romanticize it or soft pedal it which is what was done here.".

In both cases I watched as the disease progressed from early warning signs to the neartotal dementia that necessitated admission to a facility I admitted my mom just a few months ago. To say that I have a lot of firsthand knowledge and experience as a caregiver and as a witness to the ravages of Alzheimer's is an understatement. Therefore I have to say that I found this film so unrealistic that my husband and I were shaking our heads through much of the poorly written dialogue and actually LAUGHING out loud many times at things that definitely were not intended to be funny.Everyone is heaping kudos on 27yearold writerdirector Polley but I found her inexperience and naivete regarding the subject matter glaringly obvious. Julie Christie's character was WAY too selfaware  nobody with Alzheimer's would say many of the things she did nor would they willingly be skipping off to an Assisted Living facilitynursing home when there is no apparent need for her to go there for some time perhaps years.And speaking of the facility I have toured a lot of them and I can promise you the scenes depicted in this film are not the norm. Never is the alwaysattheready Executive Director there at the door to greet you and take you to your loved one. You're lucky if you get a hello grumbled in your general direction  that is if they have any idea who you are or who your loved one is. And the head nursecaregiver who seems to have all the time in the world to sit and chat  and most unbelievably to pass judgment on the husband for past indiscretions that she's somehow gleaned from his cryptic comments  is completely absurd. It's unusual to find a caregiver who speaks English much less one who could be a psychologistmarriage counselor in her nonexistent spare time.I really honestly wanted to like this film and I absolutely love Julie Christie and Olympia Dukakis but I was so very disappointed. And while I can't imagine Julie Christie winning an Oscar for a role that is so poorly conceived and written I would give one to the makeuphair stylist. I have never seen anyone with Alzheimer's look onemillionth as good as she did and that flight of fancy alone is worthy of some serious Academy love.".

	schema:headline " Great Acting poor screenplay";
	schema:reviewBody "It is often said that a picture is worth a 1000 words. In some ways that is true about this movie and in other ways it is not. For those unfamiliar with Alzheimer Disease AD it was educational. For anyone who has had to care for a close relative afflicted with Alzheimer Disease or Parkinson's Disease the movie depicted the hopelessness one feels when having to care for the afflicted persons who know how devastating these diseases are and for which there is no cure. In this sense the picture is worth a 1000 words but the picture distorts time in that the progressive deterioration caused by AD takes place over a period of several years while in the picture it happens in a period of about four months.The screenplay begins and ends in a winter. There are no other seasons depicted. It may have been that because the film was shot on a tight budget which did not allow the filming to include the other seasons and that may be why the time line was so unreal.This screenplay written by Sarah Polley was based on a short story The Bear Came Over the Mountain by Alice Munro published in the New Yorker Magazine in December 27 1999. Unfortunately Polley butchered the story which was tightly written and very interesting and for this she was unjustly nominated for an Academy Award. She also did a horrible job directing the picture One can read the short story in about 15 minutes. The movie lasts 110 minutes and yet leaves out some of the most important parts of the short story so that the viewer never knows the complete story and it makes the movie disjointed. Polley often uses quotes from the short story in the screenplay but they lose their meaning when the material from the story on which the quotes are based is omitted. For example the dialog that ends both the movie and the short story was based on events that occurred earlier in the marriage between Fiona Julie Christie and her husband Grant Anderson Gordon Pinsett which were vaguely alluded to in the movie but much more explicitly detail in the story. Thus the conclusion lacks any punch. It was the same earlier events which set up a discussion between a nurse Kristy at the nursing home and Grant in which she tries to explain the close relationship between his wife and Audrey another elderly patient at the nursing home. If one had read the story the explanation had real meaning but in the context of the movie in which the material supporting the explanation was omitted it had little impact.Making the movie harder to follow was the decision to use flashbacks jumping back and forth between a conversation Grant had with Marian and other parts of the story leaving the viewer disjointed and confused. Flashbacks would have been more effective had they been used to tell about earlier events between Grant and Fiona that set up the story as was done in the short story.There are also two sex scenes in the movie that were not in the short story. The first is unreal and the second one detracts from the whole theme of the story which is Grant's absolute devotion to Fiona at the stage of their marriage. It really detracted from the secondary message which depicted AD. It was off message. The movie has a very confusing ending which leaves a viewer bewildered. It left too many loose ends. It leaves the characters and the viewers in a predicament. The predicament was in part a result of a gratuitous sex scene and partly because much of the last part of the movie was a gross departure from the short story so that the movie ending made no sense at all. Had not. The parts of the short story Polley chose to omit could have been included in the screenplay without lengthening the movie had not Polley wasted so much time on meaningless diversions from the short story.Another problem with the movie is that the nursing home is rather luxurious. It is not the type of nursing home that one would find for patients with ordinary income. Grant and Fiona were not wealthy. Grant was a retired professor who was forced to retire early on a reduced income and they lived in a home that Fiona's parents had left Fiona. So there was no explanation as to how Grant was able to afford the cost. Yet we know that it was expensive because Marian the wife of Audrey who Fiona befriended took Audrey out of the nursing home because of the high cost.While Polley used much of the dialog from the short story she added some of her own. At one point Grant meets Marian the wife of Audrey. When they departed in the movie Marian says to herself What a jerk! referring to Grant. That is not what happened in the short story. When he departed he felt depressed that he had not succeeded in persuading Marian to send Audrey back to the nursing home and he said to himself What a jerk she would be thinking now. In the short story that ended his relationship with Marian but that is not what happened in the movie. What followed in the movie ruined the movie.That does not take away from the superb acting performances of both Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsett which for no other reason makes the movie worthwhile watching. It is unfortunate that Sarah Polley did such a miserable job writing the script and directing the movie so that a 1000 pictures were not worth the last three words which are the essence of the story. Which proves that film making often is unable to project the power of the written word.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is often said that a picture is worth a 1000 words. In some ways that is true about this movie and in other ways it is not. For those unfamiliar with Alzheimer Disease AD it was educational. For anyone who has had to care for a close relative afflicted with Alzheimer Disease or Parkinson's Disease the movie depicted the hopelessness one feels when having to care for the afflicted persons who know how devastating these diseases are and for which there is no cure. In this sense the picture is worth a 1000 words but the picture distorts time in that the progressive deterioration caused by AD takes place over a period of several years while in the picture it happens in a period of about four months.The screenplay begins and ends in a winter. There are no other seasons depicted. It may have been that because the film was shot on a tight budget which did not allow the filming to include the other seasons and that may be why the time line was so unreal.This screenplay written by Sarah Polley was based on a short story The Bear Came Over the Mountain by Alice Munro published in the New Yorker Magazine in December 27 1999. Unfortunately Polley butchered the story which was tightly written and very interesting and for this she was unjustly nominated for an Academy Award. She also did a horrible job directing the picture One can read the short story in about 15 minutes. The movie lasts 110 minutes and yet leaves out some of the most important parts of the short story so that the viewer never knows the complete story and it makes the movie disjointed. Polley often uses quotes from the short story in the screenplay but they lose their meaning when the material from the story on which the quotes are based is omitted. For example the dialog that ends both the movie and the short story was based on events that occurred earlier in the marriage between Fiona Julie Christie and her husband Grant Anderson Gordon Pinsett which were vaguely alluded to in the movie but much more explicitly detail in the story. Thus the conclusion lacks any punch. It was the same earlier events which set up a discussion between a nurse Kristy at the nursing home and Grant in which she tries to explain the close relationship between his wife and Audrey another elderly patient at the nursing home. If one had read the story the explanation had real meaning but in the context of the movie in which the material supporting the explanation was omitted it had little impact.Making the movie harder to follow was the decision to use flashbacks jumping back and forth between a conversation Grant had with Marian and other parts of the story leaving the viewer disjointed and confused. Flashbacks would have been more effective had they been used to tell about earlier events between Grant and Fiona that set up the story as was done in the short story.There are also two sex scenes in the movie that were not in the short story. The first is unreal and the second one detracts from the whole theme of the story which is Grant's absolute devotion to Fiona at the stage of their marriage. It really detracted from the secondary message which depicted AD. It was off message. The movie has a very confusing ending which leaves a viewer bewildered. It left too many loose ends. It leaves the characters and the viewers in a predicament. The predicament was in part a result of a gratuitous sex scene and partly because much of the last part of the movie was a gross departure from the short story so that the movie ending made no sense at all. Had not. The parts of the short story Polley chose to omit could have been included in the screenplay without lengthening the movie had not Polley wasted so much time on meaningless diversions from the short story.Another problem with the movie is that the nursing home is rather luxurious. It is not the type of nursing home that one would find for patients with ordinary income. Grant and Fiona were not wealthy. Grant was a retired professor who was forced to retire early on a reduced income and they lived in a home that Fiona's parents had left Fiona. So there was no explanation as to how Grant was able to afford the cost. Yet we know that it was expensive because Marian the wife of Audrey who Fiona befriended took Audrey out of the nursing home because of the high cost.While Polley used much of the dialog from the short story she added some of her own. At one point Grant meets Marian the wife of Audrey. When they departed in the movie Marian says to herself What a jerk! referring to Grant. That is not what happened in the short story. When he departed he felt depressed that he had not succeeded in persuading Marian to send Audrey back to the nursing home and he said to himself What a jerk she would be thinking now. In the short story that ended his relationship with Marian but that is not what happened in the movie. What followed in the movie ruined the movie.That does not take away from the superb acting performances of both Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsett which for no other reason makes the movie worthwhile watching. It is unfortunate that Sarah Polley did such a miserable job writing the script and directing the movie so that a 1000 pictures were not worth the last three words which are the essence of the story. Which proves that film making often is unable to project the power of the written word.";

Incidentally I find extremely silly and unwarranted the recent warning by some hysterical group when in her acceptance speech at the SAG awards Christie joked that if she forgot the name of anyone it's because she was still in character! The film is undeniably moving as we see the aging heroine degenerating to the point that she can't even recognize her own devoted husband Gordon Pinsent and even attaches herself to a fellow patient Michael Murphy at the clinic to which she's eventually admitted. Ironically considering the accolades showered upon Christie I feel that it's Pinsent who's the real protagonist here quietly despairing yet brave in coping with the heartbreaking situation unsurprisingly he strikes up a friendship with Murphy's own wife  played by Olympia Dukakis. On the other hand the viewpoint of the younger generation obligatory in our zealouslyPC world is present here  though in a somewhat idealistic manner if you ask me  via a teenager who chats with Pinsent during one of his visits to the clinic and in a deleted sequence is revealed to be a neighbor of Dukakis and occasionally takes care of Murphy for her.Actually this isn't the kind of film one would expect an emerging young director to make  particularly since it has aspirations of being a Bergmanlike chamber drama which while fairly compelling and austere aided with respect to the latter by the snowy Canadian setting clearly lacks the necessary depth which a master craftsman would otherwise bring to such material.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film feels like actress Sarah Polley saw The Notebook and said to herself I could make a better movie than that. And that's what she did. Based on an Alice Munro short story this follows an elderly man Grant Gordon Pinsent whose wife Fiona Julie Christie is suffering from Alzheimer's. He realizes that he cannot care for her alone so they decide together that she must enter a nursing home. The establishment they choose has a policy that new residents cannot have visitors for a whole month it helps both the patients and the staff cope with the change. When Gordon is finally allowed to visit he finds his wife has forgotten him and has become involved emotionally with another man Michael Murphy. It sounds heartbreaking and it is but the film isn't a tragedy. It's a love story one of the most beautiful I've seen in a long while. It's incredibly observant about human life and it mostly remains very subtle. Sarah Polley is if you don't recognize the name the girl from Atom Egoyan's films The Sweet Hereafter and Exotica. Now 28 she directs with more confidence than any of the directors nominated for Best Picture this past year. She stumbles a few times especially early on when establishing Christie's disease but never fatally. The acting is probably the main draw. If you're a Christie fan don't miss this. However Gordon Pinsent does the real heavy lifting. He's a mostly unknown character actor a lot of television stage and if you see the film it won't surprise you voice acting but for this he deserves to be remembered for a very long time. What a fantastic performance he gives. Also great are Olympia Dukakis as Murphy's wife and Kristen Thomson as a nurse sympathetic to Grant's pain. As an Altman fanatic I love Micheal Murphy. Unfortunately he is given almost nothing to do. Too bad this was released too early for the Academy Awards. Christie could have easily gotten in as the aging legend and at the very least it would have gotten more people to go see it. If you can't catch it now keep an eye out for the DVD.".

What's a husband to do? In the best Bergman tradition young directoractress Sarah Polley moves the plot and camera slowly peppering it with nuanced twists that satisfy our dramatic interests but leave plenty of room for the meaningoflife philosophies.Polley and her source Alice Munro succeeds with the thesis that adults need to be given freedom to be who they are at the place they are in their lives. Life for Fiona begins again with tending to Aubrey while Grant stews thinking she may be paying him back for his affairs with students. Maybe so but Christie's acting is so good Oscar worthy that she clearly seems to be in the thrall of Alzheimer's yet lucid enough to remember those indiscretions. Such is the mercurial nature of the disease that longterm memory may linger whileshort term is a victim.K. D. Lang singing Neil Young's Helpless is an inspired touch for the denouement of this beautiful romance. I don't think there could be a better dramatic introduction to the challenges of Alzheimer's than Away From Her.".

In the best Bergman tradition young directoractress Sarah Polley moves the plot and camera slowly peppering it with nuanced twists that satisfy our dramatic interests but leave plenty of room for the meaningoflife philosophies.Polley and her source Alice Munro succeeds with the thesis that adults need to be given freedom to be who they are at the place they are in their lives. Life for Fiona begins again with tending to Aubrey while Grant stews thinking she may be paying him back for his affairs with students. Maybe so but Christie's acting is so good Oscar worthy that she clearly seems to be in the thrall of Alzheimer's yet lucid enough to remember those indiscretions. Such is the mercurial nature of the disease that longterm memory may linger whileshort term is a victim.K. D. Lang singing Neil Young's Helpless is an inspired touch for the denouement of this beautiful romance. I don't think there could be a better dramatic introduction to the challenges of Alzheimer's than Away From Her.";

Gordon Pinsent and Julie Christie play a retired college professor and his wife who have to cope with the onset of her Alzheimer's Disease.

The movie is definitely set in Canada  not Canada standing in for some part of the United States whether named or unnamed but Canada. And in contrast to a Hollywood movie I saw the same night the cars have dirt on them. Aside from the pain of watching a loved one's mind slip away which unfortunately is a very relateable situation the disjointed narrative technique that writerdirector Sarah Polley uses is at first a little distracting. The scenes of Gordon Pinsent looking for an address eventually bear fruit but the payoff is a long time coming.It's good to see a film attempt to tackle a serious subject maturely but it's not the easiest viewing.".

	schema:headline " Independent and artsy this is basically a twisted love story";
	schema:reviewBody "Away From Her is gaining some huge notoriety and critical acclaim and I can't say I'm surprised. Not because I agree but because it reeks of artistry purposeful directing to try and make a beautiful image of something that will move people rather than directly entertain them. My hate goes off to newcomer and very young Canadian director Sarah Polley for taking on this kind of content and coming out on the other side with rave reviews but for myself personally it didn't move me as much as kind of disgust me in a way. The film was slow moving a snail's pace a little confusing with the chronological order and no instructions on how to follow it and it went on far longer than it needed to. That being said there is some powerful performances that I absolutely adored and honestly made the film for me. Otherwise I was rather disturbed by the fact that anyone could be moved or romanced by the film which features a couple who is supposed to be 'madly in love' having been married for forty years but the husband has had an affair and then moves on to sleep with another woman which is 'okay' because his wife has Alzheimer's and has taken to another man. There is nothing sweet or romantic about the film and in fact is more confusing and rather odd romantically than anything. Rather than being about a man dealing with his wife's increasing Alzheimer's it's about relationships between four aging people thrown together because of Alzheimer's.I've seen some reviewers and spoke to some people who were just impressed with Gordon Pinsent. I couldn't disagree more!! I think Pinsent's performance as husband Grant was powerfully subtle and he did so much performing with his eyes and his movements and I became an instant Pinsent fan. He is terrific despite the fact that I didn't like his character after discovering he had cheated on this woman that he adores so much and sleeps with another woman after that. Still his performance was great. Julie Christie absolutely stunning on screen at 67 years old she was absolutely beautiful as the ailing wife Fiona. Christie does a magnificent job of showing us what Fiona has been like her whole life in a short amount of time and then what it would be like to watch her succumb to the ravages of the disease. Christie as Fiona is strong and brilliant a sweet soul and independent and we watch her go into this delicate emotionally distraught woman suffering from Alzheimer's. Olympia Dukakis plays a small role as the wife of a man suffering from a debilitating disease that leaves him mute and crippled. Dukakis is fiery and strong but shows a softer side as her character unravels. Michael Murphy plays the muted husband Aubrey who falls in love with Fiona in their retirement home leaving their spouses at the sidelines. Murphy has a tough role to play doing everything with his body language and eyes but he does a great job of almost coming across as an adversary to Pinsent's Grant. Kristen Thomson turns in a small but very memorable role as Fiona's nurse Kristy who befriends Grant in his time of turmoil. I enjoyed her character and thought she was very interesting and a good solid performance. Wendy Crewson was also notable as the rather hard headed and stern head of the retirement home Madeleine.A superb Canadian cast to say the least with a terrific Canadian director performing a story by a classic Canadian Author. There isn't anything wrong with any of this and the Canadian content is clear and concise and it's worth seeing. The only shortcoming is it's length and it's misrepresentation as a story about a man dealing with loss of his wife whom he loves dearly to Alzheimer's. This is a far more twisted love story and if this is a realistic portrayal of the way love and marriage and dedication is handled than I am saddened and very afraid for us. I encourage adults to check this one out and see if you agree with me or not?? I was also not fond of the fact that the script to see to force in the F word on several occasions and only the F word for no other reason then for it to exist. It isn't often a film is made with older actors as the main character portraying themselves as older citizens so I encourage anyone to check it out. But it's slow and it's content might surprise you. I don't think it quite deserves all the hoopla surrounding it. 610".

His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his timetested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game as well as postmodern life may be passing him by. Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young PresidentCoowner of the team Christina Pagniacci now coming into her own after her father's death.

	schema:headline " Very Underrated and Well Overlooked";
	schema:reviewBody "It seems that many people dislike this movie and I can see why. First of all it shows that professional athletes are far away from being perfect. A lot farther than we would like to believe. The movie shows that many athletes as we know are just out their for the money. It also shows the corruption in the owners and politicians. But for me all of this is good thing. I like seeing a movie that does not include glory in sports.Another aspect of the movie was the cast. I thought the cast that was put together was very well put together. I was especially surprised at the performance of Cameron Diaz. I thought she played very well as the viscous and corrupt owner. Specifically in the part were she blackmails the mayor into giving the team money for a new stadium. Jamie Foxx also gave a very well played performance as the new upcoming quarterback. His role shows that he has become sick with fame and fortune and has seem to forgotten who helped to reach his superstar status. For example when he ignores most of the plays called in and decides to run the game the way he wants to. He reaches as point were he just flat out ignores everyone. For example he says I'm trying to win coach. I ain't trying to disrespect nobody but winning is the only thing I respect. I think Oliver Stone shows that this is the problem we have in our society that everything is about winning. His relationship falls apart with his girlfriend and seems to believe that their is nothing that could stop him. He almost reaches a point were he believes he is like a god. But he realizes he needs a wakeup call or he will end up like the some of the people around him. I liked the way Dennis Quaid played as the long time starting quarterback who nearly becomes paralyzed. Now my initial reaction after he got hit was that his family would want him to immediately retire. What happened was the opposite his wife wanted him to risk being paralyzed and brain damage so he can get one more contract although Dennis Quaid was trying to explain to her that he is worried about what might happen to himself. Or one of the confrontations between wife and husband when he mentions to her that they should put the kids to bed and the wife responds by sayingWhy can't we hire a maid? This also adds on to Jamie Foxx's role and shows that the players are pressurized by their families towards good decisions and bad decisions and that the families have also lost touch with what is important in life. As well with Lawrence Taylor's role which shows the playerdoctor relationship and the role that age and lack of education forcing players to push themselves over the limit for that last bonus knowing after they retire they may not survive in the real world. LL Cool J's role as the star runningback shows that he no longer cares about the team or the game itself and feels threatened by Jamie Foxx because he has brought a new style of playing to the team and they tend to not agree with each other but above all with this new style of play may not let him reach a certain amount of rushing yards to reach his bonus. Again Jamie Foxx comes into this part of the movie at the end when he hurts his arm but does not tell anyone worried what might happen to his career. I think overall this show that their is too much emphasis in sports and I'm saying this even though I'am a big sports fan.A very interesting part of the movie is the Al Pacino's role as the head coach. His ongoing fighting with Cameron Diaz shows the relationship between owner and coach. The coach wants to win games and have control of the team but the owner wants the money the power and the credit for building a team. Pacino has fallen into a slump and doesn't like the ways are looking for the future of the his job and the sport. For example when he says It's TV it changed everything changed the way we think forever. I mean the first time they stopped the game to cut away to some commercial that was the end of it. Because it was our concentration that mattered not theirs not some fruitcake selling cereal. He believes the game no matters any more it is the money and this is what I believe is the main point of the movie. It is no longer the game that matters it is the people who put the money into it and this is what has been or what will be the downfall of sports or really anything.I think that a good message through all these downfalls is that if you stick together and focus on your goal you will succeed no matter how big the obstacle hence the title Any Given Sunday.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Stone is one of the most if not THE most passionate filmmakers working today.  He's also a talented filmmaker which a lot of people seem to forget.  When both his talent and passion are at full strength the results are impressiveSALVADOR PLATOON JFK NIXON.  When the passion is still there but the talent is tripped up by his passion and ambitions he makes flawed movies which are still powerfulWALL STREET TALK RADIO BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY HEAVEN AND EARTH.  But when he goes outside of his passions for either experimentsNATURAL BORN KILLERS or to make mainstream moviesUTURN he misses wide.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS to me was a worse film but UTURN was in a way even more dispiriting because the former you could at least excuse as an experiment gone wrong whereas the latter screamed Cashin!  You felt after watching Stone was too tired to fight anymore.Well as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY proves Stone like his onscreen alterego Tony D'AmatoAl Pacino may look tired but he's still got fight left in him. Many have seen football as war so it's appropriate Stone has long wanted to make a movie about football.  And as Spike Lee did with HE GOT GAME Stone wants us to see not only the glory of the actual playingas well as how tough it is to earn that glory but also the corrupt forces which are pervading it today.  After all we decry flashy players and then complain about those who are too boring we talk about tradition out of one side of our mouth and demand the game be updated out of the other side we call white players who exhibit boorish behavior colorful while calling black players who exhibit similar behavior punksand that's putting it mildly we complain about players who are overpaid while thinking nothing of owners who spend lavishly on themselves and move teams around we complain about football being too dominated by TV yet sit around like couch potatoes every Sunday and Monday night we react with horror when players get hurt badly and get addicted to drugs yet we yell at them to murder each other on the field and call those who don't chickento put it mildly and so on.This is a wide canvas to cover and yet Stone does a pretty good job of it. Especially good is how the relationship between D'Amato and his new quarterback Willie BeamonJamie Foxx encompasses a lot of that canvas. There are two scenes in particular which stand out one where D'Amato sits with Willie on the plane and tries to talk to him but can't think of anything which doesn't sound patronizing from Willie's point of viewlike music where D'Amato thinks the fact he's mentioning black jazz musicians is supposed to mean something and the scene at D'Amato's house where Beamon talks of how in the past playing for the team was code for Know your place boy and have things really changed?  Willie has to learn that playing for the team really does mean as quarterback getting them to respect you so they'll play for you and Tony has to learn that tradition can't be stodgy that it has to accept change.Stone is less sure in other aspects.  Cameron Diaz does a good job as the team's owner but her character is a little too onedimensional at times. It would have been more interesting to have here not just talk in terms of money but that the game to her really is more interesting the way Willie plays itmaybe I'm biased but I'm a fan of more passoriented games.  And while I don't think Stone is as misogynist as he's been charged with in the past certainly it's evident here.  It's one thing to say there are groupies in football it's another thing to delight in showing them.  There are sympathetic woman here particularly AnnMargaret as Diaz's mother who shows what being a football wife costs and Lela Rochon as Willie's girlfriend who is unwilling to have that happen to herthe scene at the party where she feels both isolated from Willie and the other wives is nicely drawn.  Finally Stone can't resist the ROCKYtype cliches near the end.But though it's flawed there's still a lot of power here.  Except for Lauren Holly who I'm not a big fan of the acting is all around excellent particularly Foxx.  I was particularly impressed with how well the athletes did as actors particularly Jim Brownthough he's an actor so this isn't surprising and Lawrence Taylor.  And of course all the football scenes are terrific and feel real.  It's always good when you see on screen what you can't see watching the game on TV and Stone accomplishes that here. Call it not quite a touchdown but a film which convinces us Stone still has fight left in him.".

Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception.  It is hardhitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY.  It is actually conventional when you think about it like a warped RUDY.  It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success except ROUGHNESS but Oliver Stone in his usual over the top way throws a dizzying mindsplitting film at us much like the sport itself.  This is why I liked it.Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK evident in its editing style.  Fastpaced black and white mixed with color documentarylike methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS NIXON and the ghastly UTURN.  Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does.  Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him.  You certainly get the idea watching this.  Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games.  Pacino also seems to be sleepwalking through the picture.  At times he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be.  Cameron Diaz's character a young chick owner yeah right destroys any credibility the film may have had going in Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie. Her constant bickering is so overdone you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback.  Realisticly speaking this is not a very sane film about football.  It is a maniacal celebration of the game.  The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished.  Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before.  He definitely had some good consultants.  There are some comical cameos  Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches.  Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar.  Stone tries to show us how the game has changed.  He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi dissolves showing Red the Galloping Ghost Grange and even Unitas handing off to Ameche.  TV has changed everything says the coach and he is right.  It seems to be all about the money nowadays.That is the message but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bonecrushing eardamaging football scenes. They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity you feel like playing afterwards.  This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big sweaty men.  Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won? Yes and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is. Basically surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.RATING ".

	schema:headline " Professional Football Meets Its Match in Oliver Stone";
	schema:reviewBody "I thought what a great combo for Any Given Sunday  Oliver Stone and professional football  excess meets its match. So I grabbed a chance to go to the movies with my sons. They got a lot more out of the first and third thirds of the movie that are football games which I couldn't follow at all knowing zilch about football so I missed any references to significances of plays and strategies and didn't recognize the zillion football players past and present in bit parts but I got other visual and music references they didn't.The football field is explicitly a jungle with the sounds like an elephant herd crashing. Of course Stone never says or shows once what he can get across 5 times so the jungle fever point of the primalness of sports as a venue for male violence is accompanied by Native American chants aboriginal and Asian Indian mystic strains as well. I don't know enough about rap to judge those selections  I could tell there were lots of lyrics about niggaz working for The Man type of thing. The second third should have appealed to me as that's when the huge ensemble has personal interactions and we learn all their selfish dastardly unpleasant motivations but I was on sensory overload. Example Al Pacino as the Old Guard Coach calls in Jamie Foxx as the suddenly first string quarterback in a terrific performance for a tte a tte on the pro's of Jazz over Rap as a metaphor of the old football of finesse what? all those flashbacks to black  white football games were of a subtle sport?. But when Foxx walks in Pacino has Ben Hur playing on a widescreen TV. As if we didn't get the point Foxx actually says The old gladiators huh? If we still didn't get the point the conversation keeps intercutting with the chariot race. And if we still didn't get the point of any reference in the conversation to racial issues then intercuts to the galley slave scenes from Ben Hur THEN on top of that the NFL commissioner who puts the Bitch Owner in her place for trying to play with the Big Old Guys is none other than Charlton Heston.No one just has a conversation  everyone shouts usually at the same time so I had to close my eyes and I'm not sure if I missed something.This is Sunbelt Football of expansion teams where the sport is not a FallWinter season  so the women were everywhere in tank tops cleavage midriffs bare and hips swinging even Cameron Diaz as the Bitch Owner. Though all the women are really high priced prostitutes even usually sweet Lauren Holly is a hardened cold Football Wife.What I don't think I missed was Stone's outsize determination to ignore the homoerotic aspects of male sports violence that Fight Club reveled in. Aw come on Stone not a single gay player in the closet? He crowds the behemoths into locker rooms and showers that can barely contain their bodiesbut he's so afraid of showing them in contact that he even at one point has one throw a baby alligator into the shower so they scatter.Everyone is criticized including the sportscasters which Stone revels in playing one I think in general this movie is a show down between Stone and Spike Lee as it takes on more racial issues than he's done in the past. What a coincidence that ESPN is continually badmouthed when there's a big legible credit at the end to Turner Sports Network when this is a Time Warner movie and ESPN's a competitor.Stone of course goes out of his way to link football with war to fit into his oeuvre with battle quotes from Vince Lombardi and some sort of link with Pacino's father dying in WWII that was irrelevant it seemed to me. I think this is Dennis Quaid's at least third football movie and in the genre of such movies as North Dallas 40 Longest Yard Great American Hero etc. and this joins that pantheon as a terrific football movie. The music selections were by Robbie Robertson with Paul Kelly but I'm not sure which Kelly that is and he did as seamless a job as he's done for Martin Scorcese. The music credits at the end were impossible to read  in 3 columns of a vertical font that was like watching the credits on TV  plus the movie continues under the credits so all those who bolted missed the ending.Professional football deserves to be Oliver Stoned. But if I never saw any more football that'll be fine with me. originally written 12271999".

The action scenes combination of rabid mayhem mixed with dreamlike calm and hallucinogenic focal points in the key plays really work.ANY GIVEN Sunday at first glance seems to be a film about how off field actions wether it be playermanagerowner related have effected the game of football itself but it is also about how the game has warped people and corporations around it.JAMIE FOXX is the star turn here with AL PACINO strong as ever delivering a memorable and very different speech typical of the film.If for any other reason watch this film for the music.".

The action scenes combination of rabid mayhem mixed with dreamlike calm and hallucinogenic focal points in the key plays really work.ANY GIVEN Sunday at first glance seems to be a film about how off field actions wether it be playermanagerowner related have effected the game of football itself but it is also about how the game has warped people and corporations around it.JAMIE FOXX is the star turn here with AL PACINO strong as ever delivering a memorable and very different speech typical of the film.If for any other reason watch this film for the music.";

McGinley Aaron Eckhart Charlton Heston Oliver Stone Elizabeth Berkley. Directed by Oliver Stone. Spoilers herein.Any Given Sunday is a film that is a feast for the eyes but not the mind. Stone does a great job for creating a dizzying direction eyeopening visuals and extremely loud sound and he does all of this with the 2 and a half hours that he has to spare with the film but never does go deep into detail on the characters.The story consists of a professional football team struggling with their season. The film opens with a quote from football legend Vince Lombardi and then fades into a football game where the starting quarterback for the Sharks Jack Rooney is hurt in the middle of a game unknown third string quarterback Willie Beaman is sent in for the rest of the season. As Beaman starts rising to fame aging Coach D'Amato and Rooney begin to question if Beaman is worth risking the rest of the season and their chance for the championship as he is trying to make the team win by himself.The performances are pretty good and powerful. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx do great with the lead characters and other familiar faces such as Cameron Diaz Dennis Quaid James Woods LL Cool J Matthew Modine and John C. McGinley in the supporting performances.One thing I did really like about Any Given Sunday is how the action during the games is very realistic gritty and fast. It ultimately captures the intensity and hard work from the sport of Football. But like Natural Born Killers and U Turn the sound is so unbearably loud and images are so fast and dizzying that the film could give some viewers a headache. Stone has been known to cause controversy among his films and this is a way that he seems to do it but it didn't bother me so much as haters of the film. Despite of some of the strengths Any Given Sunday does have a few flaws. The film is unnecessarily overlong overly stylish and underdeveloped. Stone really could have made the film about 2030 minutes shorter and with most of the time the characters are either playing on the game field or yelling at each other. Some scenes showing Willie's rise are no more interesting than a Nike Gridiron commercial or a Michael Bay film. Another thing Stone forgets to do is add emotion to the film and he replaces that with mostly sports action.Overall I really did enjoy this film a lot for it's realistic football scenes and the living hell that the players go through in order to win. But at times it really does try too hard especially when it's absent with a great script and follows clichs of older Football or even gladiator films. But I would recommend it to Stone fans and football fans especially. A very considerate 4 stars out of 5.".

Oliver Stone had directed a film here that crosses all bounderies. You dont have to like the sport or understand it to appreciate how brilliant this film is. It is shot so well it makes you fell you are in the game and as for the soundtrack well that just adds to a mesmerising showpiece. Stars such as Al Pacino Dennis QuaidJames Woods and Cameron Diaz star but for me the real Star of this film is James Foxx who plays the Quaterback who begins to believe his own hype but ultimately understands that it the team that matters. One of the test of a good film is that if you start to look at the clock throughout the film is usually means its not good  this film lasted 2 and a half hours and i never looked at the time. Brilliant. 9 out of 10.".

The 3 dimensional noises in the huddle on the line from the grandstands the growls and other sounds from the players these things made the movie live and my blood boil.  I was breathless.Then these things interspersed with dead silences and slow motion dreamlike sequences gave the action a spiritual quality.I stayed for the credits to see who had done this sound work and I think Wylie Stateman will get at the very least an Oscar nomination for sound design.

Jamie Foxx did a great job you loved him at times and hated him at times and he gave you great reason to do either.  And of course Al Pacino was the man as always playing a coach with heart and blowing you away at the end.  Cameron Diaz was the best wicked witch just a hardcore display of a woman of the millenium. All in all anyone who thinks this movie had no plot wasn't paying attention.  All you have to do is see the change in the characters throughout the movie and what the game meant to each one of them from the owner to the coach to the players to the doctors to the families. Perfect example is the characters of both Ann Margaret and Lauren Holly. There is a lot of meaning in this movie.  Kudos!".

All the characters are fantastic and the story is excellent plus Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz are simply amazing in this! and Jamie Fox is fantastic!. It's loud trashy violent and in your face and you know what I absolutely loved it! plus Al Pacino's speech near the end was truly moving!. Jamie Fox and Al Pacino had some very powerful scenes together and being a huge Football fan I was highly pleased with this film plus it even has a cameo from that idiot Terrell Owens!. Oliver Stone put out another fantastic film here in my opinion and never in my life have I seen such violent football! plus it's extremely well made and written as well. I saw the Directors cut version and I can't see why so many people dislike it sure it's a little over long but never is it boring! plus I loved how it wasn't afraid to go over the line either!. You want a top notch football movie?? look no further then this one it's wonderfully actedwith exciting football action and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Oliver Stone does a fantastic! job here with excellent camera work outstanding angles great slow mo shots cool POV shots and plenty of other cool shots as well plus he kept the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is wonderful!. Al Pacino is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable very intense delivered some great lines as always was fascinating to watch was really into his role carried the film at times and had some wonderful scenes with both Fox and Diazhe was amazing. Pacino Rules!!!!!!!. Cameron Diaz is stunningly gorgeous and actually does an amazing job here she goes toe to toe with Pacino in heated arguments which is pretty damn impressive if you ask me this proves she really can act when she wants too I loved her performance. Jamie Foxx is surprisingly fantastic here and uses his cockiness to his advantage he is very unlikable at the start but turns out to be not a bad guy after all he gave a fantastic performance. Dennis Quaid is really good here as the QB Jack Rooney I dug his character and he was quite likable. James Woods is OK here but didn't have much to do as the Doc and was kind of wasted. LL Cool J is pretty good here and as I said before I think he is a good actor. Lawrence Taylor is actually good here too! I was really surprised. Jim Brown is OK in his small role and did what he had to adequately he is one of the best RB's of all time though!. Matthew Modine Dr. PowersBill BellamyJimmy SandersonAndrew BryniarskiMadman KellyLauren HollyCindy RooneyAnnMargretMargaret PagniacciElizabeth BerkleyMandy MurphyCharlton HestonCommisoner.John C.

Oliver Stone takes you straight into the action and it never lets up. When I caught the trailer before Three Kings I knew this was the movie to see. The best thing about this movie is Al Pacino who uses all his bravura to bring to life a role that was tailor made for his over the top excitement. Any Given Sunday is the movie all football fans have been waiting for.  The only thing that bugs me is that it didn't use NFL teams which I had earlier heard were going to be involved.  But it doesn't take away from any of the excitement which is aplenty.  Go see it again and again and again.".

She is very good as a woman owner of a football team trying very hard to do it as a woman. In addition at times the football action was entertaining. It is the offfield dramas that mar the film substantially.First of all it was a professional football team. In the real world of pro football the quarterback doesn't puke on the field. There are fans watching the game. James Wood's role was largely comical and irrelevant. Since pro football is a multibillion dollar business amoral doctors are not going to be hired or tolerated. It was also almost playoffs. As bad as the sport's world seems players don't party openly do drugs and hire prostitutes right before the playoffs. Even the most irresponsible football players are not that dumb because at that point of the season they wouldn't want the entire team and city hating them. The coach of a football team would be planning plays after the game not drinking at bars and being propositioned by prostitutes. A coach wouldn't openly scowl when his quarterback deviates from the play slightly if it results in a win. Pro football coaches are celebrities and wouldn't scowl when their team won as a result of a player being independent minded. The coach may after the game in the locker room remind the quarterback that there is a game plan. That was another major wrong with this film. There was only a play called in the last few seconds of the final regular season game. Pro football is all about plays. All the coach did was give pep talks.So the film was basically ruined by unrealistic exaggerated scenarios. Stone should have spent more time studying the real game of football instead of some Hollywood interpretation. The acting was good and at times there was an attempt to show that football is a very rough sport. However I can not really recommend this film other than being slightly entertaining and possessing a good cast of actors.".

In adapting social and political mores as in the flavoring or food Koreans tend to take things to extremes.  South Korea with its advertisements on pedestrian overpasses and across the bottom of the television screen is in many ways more commercial and capitalistic than the archetype for such things the United States and its Christians are among the world's most fervent. North Korea as we well know has outdone Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse Tung with its rigid communist orthodoxy.Korea's national epic the intensely romantic Chunhyang story a tale better known in Korea than say Cinderella in the West takes place in an old Korea that was almost a caricature of Confucianist China.  The king was a complete autocrat and the social order was extremely hierarchical. Confucian norms however were supposed to ensure that the despotism was an enlightened and highminded one.  One could not be a part of the ruling bureaucracy without passing rigorous examinations that required knowledge of the Chinese classics and an ability to employ them in artistic expression along strictly prescribed lines.  Education and refinement were supposed to translate themselves into wisdom and virtue in public administration.Although the lower orders may never have had it very good for the most part the system worked. Strong stable dynasties ruled for centuries in China and Korea but no system created by man can guard against all human frailties. The temptation to abuse the power acquired through rising in the governmental organization was great and Chunhyang the Cinderella of this classic tale runs afoul of one of the abusers.  In the process two Confucian requirements come into conflict with one another loyalty of the wife to the husband and loyalty of the subject to the king or his duly vested agent.This is not a straightforward David and Bathsheba story however.  There is just enough ambiguity in the husbandwife relationship to make it a close call for Chunhyang as to which loyalty should prevail.  To her worldly courtesan mother it's not a close call at all.  She counsels the easier route.  But our heroine takes deeper counsel from within herself and follows the harder path that we know as generations of Koreans have known is in closer accord with universal moral law.To say more would be to give away the plot but one wonders with such a chastening tale as this as a part of their heritage how any Korean officials could succumb to the temptation to abuse their authority and engage in corrupt practices.  But East or West the flesh is still weak and the tale still needs retelling there as much as it needs telling here.Plays as we know them were unknown in Korea until the first decade of the twentieth century.  The Chunhyang story was typically performed by a single p'ansori artist.  P'ansori which is quite foreign to the Western ear is a sort of stylized chant in which the rasping tones of the performer help convey the setting and the emotion of the characters.  The singer is accompanied by one other person who occasionally interjects exclamations and encouragement but mainly keeps time with a small barrel drum.  P'ansori performers had to undergo even more rigorous training than opera singers in the West though the purpose seemed to be to tear down the vocal cords rather than to build them up.  A single P'ansori performance lasting sometimes as long as eight hours was a prodigious feat of stamina and memory.  Thought to have grown out of the shaman performances of the southwest province of Cholla p'ansori was acted out by both men and women. For most of the twentieth century the art form was kept alive mainly by kisaengs or females of the roughlytranslated courtesan class of which the Chunhyang character was a part.In the later twentieth century in Korea while p'ansori was taken up by a broader spectrum of society interested in preserving Korea's traditions the Chunhyang story was brought to the public in play opera and repeatedly in film form.  In the early 60s an Irish priest a professor at the Jesuit Sogang University in Seoul even wrote and directed a criticallyacclaimed Englishlanguage Broadwaystyle musical version of the story.Director Kwontaek Im for the first time combines p'ansori and drama in this latest film version.  In so doing he has produced an authentic work of art worthy of a Yi Dynasty scholarofficial.  Also in the best Korean tradition he has gone Hollywood one better at tugging at our heartstrings. The Korean audience on the screen applauds the p'ansori artist at the film's conclusion and the audience of which I was a member in a full openingnight movie theater found itself joining them spontaneously.  I think you will too.Note Don't be alarmed when the opening p'ansori monologue lacks English subtitles.  They'll come soon enough.  To provide them at that point would give away part of the plot.  That's not a danger for the native Korean speakers all of whom would know the plot by heart.".

The film uses a pansori concert as the framework to tell the tale and interweaves the action with the singer's narration to good effect.  The story is classic starcrossed lovers separated by societies rules.  A governor's son falls in love with a concubine's daughter and their love must endure long separation and an evil lord's lust.

	schema:headline " An unusual movie experience";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a Korean film telling the story of two lovers torn apart by class. The son of a governor and the daughter of a courtesan. It has the air of a fairytale and is a very good film.It may be difficult for some people to get into the film in the beginning if you are not familiar with pansori. Pansori is a centuries old Korean form of storytelling in which a storyteller sings the story while a drummer drums and makes short vocal sounds or words of encouragement. It is initially jarring for those of us who mostly watch American and European film but stick with it. I first saw this in a film class and it was among two films that I wrote about for class and liked so much that I purchased on my own once the class ended.As the film begins the viewer is placed in the position of someone watching a pansori performance. From here the film transitions from the world of Chunhyang to the pansori audience. Part of the enjoyment of the film comes from watching the reactions of the pansori audience to the story. It is akin to being in a movie theater and sharing the same experiences with everyone else watching the film.Aside from the format the story itself is enchanting full of love loyalty and courage. The acting is very good and the actors are not bad looking themselves. The pansori performance is a song of the story so it has some poetic qualities that don't necessarily push the story forward but are enjoyable if you are patient. All in all it is a look into Korean culture and storytelling that not many films from America Europe or the rest of the world do for their own cultures. Most films today just stick to the basic narrative design or are pretentious and abstract. This one creates a new experience for anyone who is willing to give it a chance.".

Usually in many a love story a beautiful heroine is likely to be an element of deploying story and get mass concern. After seeing love story movie fans remember the beauty of heroine like Olivia Hussey in Romeo and Juliet or Vivian Leigh in Gone with the Wind. But in this film you may see much more Close Ups of Mongryong than Chunhyang and you may not remember the beauty of HyoJeong Lee. In my opinion HyoJeong Lee may be one of two actresses who fail to get stardom despite her title role of Chunhyang in the history of Korean Cinema  the other one was NaSeong Lee who played Chunhyang about fifteen years ago. Usually contemporary stars or rising stars played Chunhyang  for example legendary EunHee Choi1961 and MiHee Jang1976.And it is related with third factor which is considered very important by Western critics. This film is the first Chunhyang which is combined with 'pansori' Korean epic which is played by one singer and one drummer. The relation of Director Im KwonTaek's 'Chunhyang' and pansori is the same as Francis Ford Coppola's 'Dracula' and Bram Stoker's original.One thing more the marriage of Chunhyang the daughter of excourtesan and Mongryong the son of high bureaucrat can be interpreted equality between ruling class and ruled class. But this interpretation is only as available as the interpretation that the marriage of Cinderella and a Prince means equality between classes in Western culture.".

The number of people devoted to marriage and love these days are on the declining slope and it is in my opinion that modern thinking is to be blamed. However these are two very different contexts.

Perhaps it might be interesting as a learning experience to view Chunghyang with Gladiator to understand that these are two distinct art forms devised by two distinct cultural traditions to tell important stories. I was thrilled to find this film so 'other' so unAmerican so unMTV. A Korean storytellingoperatic tradition is fused with beautiful filming. Dialogue as the actors play out the story is interlaced very comfortably with a storyteller's narrative in a sutrachanting poetic style accompanied by one drummer. The storyteller's voice is a remarkable asset of the film. It has to be experienced to understand its power. I thought the film used very sophisticated editing to blend the highly operatic story line with the teller's narrative on stage and with a wonderful middleKorean as in middleAmerican audience. This omniscient viewing perspective affording views of several different levels of concurrent existence was really wonderful. Then I remembered in the middle of the film that I was reading subtitles without a trace of annoyance or distraction from the visuals. Very nicely done all around. I felt enriched educated and entertained.".

Dialogue as the actors play out the story is interlaced very comfortably with a storyteller's narrative in a sutrachanting poetic style accompanied by one drummer. The storyteller's voice is a remarkable asset of the film. It has to be experienced to understand its power. I thought the film used very sophisticated editing to blend the highly operatic story line with the teller's narrative on stage and with a wonderful middleKorean as in middleAmerican audience. This omniscient viewing perspective affording views of several different levels of concurrent existence was really wonderful. Then I remembered in the middle of the film that I was reading subtitles without a trace of annoyance or distraction from the visuals. Very nicely done all around. I felt enriched educated and entertained.";

I figure it to be a Korean fairy tale given its happy ending and having a moral to the story.I didn't find the story telling method completely successful.  The music and drumming added tension to the film but the Pansori seemed to intrude in the film too frequently describing everything that is going on when it could be done visually rendering many scenes as some sort of announcement not letting the ambiance set in.  The scene of the whipping seemed to be a little forced having the camera show us various audience members crying as if we don't know this is a dramatic situation.  It might have worked better if they let the dialogue be spoken by the character Chunghyang instead of the Pansori since the Pansori does not have much dynamic range in his voicing being always loud.  The character saying it while being whipped gives a different impression than the Pansori screaming it.But all in all still a good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In one of his essays The German philosophercritic Walter Benjamin compared film with theater stating that the lens of the camera replaces the audience as the spectator but because the camera is emotionless the actor is unable to feed off the audience's reaction. However in some films theatrical aspects are not only used but become part of the film itself. For anyone who has watched Ichikawa Kon's An Actor's Revenge or Shinoda Masahiro's Double suicide this is quite evident. While not taking theater into play Im Kwontaek's extraordinarily popular film Chunhyang incorporates the traditional storytelling elements of the pansori a singer and a drummer into play. Instead of just opening the film the viewer is treated to listening to the pansori's storytelling throughout the entire film even having his voice overdubbed over the actors and actresses. While this aspect of the film might be a bit distracting at first especially when the film's action is cut between the stage and the visualized world of Chunhyang it eventually sinks in and one can enjoy being told a story while seeing it acted out by actors and actresses instead of just the realm inside one's head.Chunhyang tells the story of the lovers Lee Mongryong and Sung Chunhyang the former the sun of the governor of Namson and the latter the daughter of a courtesan. A budding scholar who is preparing for the exams that would open to him the world of officialdom Mongryong one day becomes bored with his hours of constant study and asks his servant Pangja to show him some areas of local interest. At one spot he notices a beautiful young girl swinging high in a swing and he falls in love at first sight. He orders Pangja to fetch the girl for him but the servant is reluctant because Chunhyang has a reputation of turning down every man who has shown interest in her. However Pangja does go speak to her but instead of returning with the girl he returns with a message that Mongryong interprets as that Chunhyang wants him to come visit her at her home. On the night he visits Chunhyang the girl eventually agrees to marry him on the promise that he would not abandon her because of their differences in social status. He agrees to do so and so they marry and they seem quite blissful at first until Mongryong's father receives a promotion which requires him to return to Seoul. Because Mongryong has to return to Seoul with his father and because he cannot take Chunhyang with him because being married to such a lowly girl would destroy his chances of taking the exams the young couple must part but Mongryong promises to return for Chunhyang after he finishes the exams. However during the time that Mongryong is away a new corrupt governor takes over the old governor's position and he seems to have an interest in our heroine.Directed by the man who is considered by many to be the father of Modern South Korean Cinema and the director of nearly one hundred films Chunhyang might not at first seem no more than a simple love story but with its elements of traditional storytelling its intermingling of history romance and melodrama it does stand out as a great film within the ever growing number of spectacular South Korean films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Korean film is told through both pansori and liveaction. Pansori is a style of Korean singingdrama that consists of a singer and a drummer and very very long epic stories are sung dramatically. Seeing the robeclad singer gesticulate and dance about with his fan was pretty interesting and a nice lesson in Korean culture. Plus once I got used to the style it was interesting as he narrated large portions of the liveaction story and it reminded me quite a bit of Chinese opera. However and I know this will make me sound rather shallow to some but after a while the singing wore me down and I really don't look forward to seeing many more films in this style. Maybe this is the Asian equivalent of sitting through one of Wagner's operas another endurance test for the audience. In both cases the performances may be four or more hours long! The story itself is an 18 century legend about two young lovers the tragedy that befalls one of them and the very uplifting and satisfying conclusion. The son of a governor falls in love with a concubine's daughter. Despite being from totally different social classes they secretly marry. The young man wants to tell his parents but needs to wait until he takes his civil service test as he wants to make a name for himself before publicly acknowledging the marriage. Unfortunately tragedy strikes when a new governor is appointed. He's exceptionally cruel and unyielding. Exactly what happens next is something you'll have to see for yourself but I can assure you it is very exciting to watch and worth the waitas the film improves the further along it goes.Beautiful cinematography this is a lovely little legend come to the screen. It's well worth a look but I strongly doubt that many Westerners out there will quickly embraced this very unusual film. It takes a bit to get used to the style but it's well worth it.".

He confirms here with his new film a pure gem ! Of course some people let's hope that they won't be too many ! will never be seized by the film reluctant to Pansori melodies and tunes. They probably even won't try their ears offended by this rough singing often panting sometimes slowspeeded or on the contrary very fast and like breathless. How wrong they will be ! Because Pansori this traditional korean narrative song sung by only one singer who plays all the different characters of the story with one drum the puk playing this song tears hearts and souls of those who accept to give themselves to it...And when the tale is as a beautiful and romantic one as Chunhyang's the singer's throaty sounds and the incredibly beautiful pictures fill us with happiness. Im Kwontaek great director moves us not only through the story told by also through his direction. His numerous sequence shots the natural way he alternates closeup and wonderful purefaces shots on one way and splendid landscapes all drowned in gold and light on the other spreads poetry in perfect harmony with the  story told.Maybe the plot social classes differences getting in the way of a love story which is threatened then saved by marital fidelity doesn't bright by its originality. Asian operas novels films are full of that kind of stories. But that's not the important point after all haven't all stories been already told ? The way to treat those stories makes the real difference and the one Im Kwontaek gives to Chunhyang's legend shines bright all around ! The korean director leads two young beginners in the lovers' roles. Yi Hyojeong who is the exemplary Chunhyang is only 17 years old and it was for her as for her partner Cho Seungwoo her first film. She brights with sweetness and he shows real nobility.".

	onyx:emotionText "Im Kwontaek was already known for being korean best director. His former film Sopyonje The Pansori's singer 1993 amongst others was probably the best proof of his talent. He confirms here with his new film a pure gem ! Of course some people let's hope that they won't be too many ! will never be seized by the film reluctant to Pansori melodies and tunes. They probably even won't try their ears offended by this rough singing often panting sometimes slowspeeded or on the contrary very fast and like breathless. How wrong they will be ! Because Pansori this traditional korean narrative song sung by only one singer who plays all the different characters of the story with one drum the puk playing this song tears hearts and souls of those who accept to give themselves to it...And when the tale is as a beautiful and romantic one as Chunhyang's the singer's throaty sounds and the incredibly beautiful pictures fill us with happiness. Im Kwontaek great director moves us not only through the story told by also through his direction. His numerous sequence shots the natural way he alternates closeup and wonderful purefaces shots on one way and splendid landscapes all drowned in gold and light on the other spreads poetry in perfect harmony with the  story told.Maybe the plot social classes differences getting in the way of a love story which is threatened then saved by marital fidelity doesn't bright by its originality. Asian operas novels films are full of that kind of stories. But that's not the important point after all haven't all stories been already told ? The way to treat those stories makes the real difference and the one Im Kwontaek gives to Chunhyang's legend shines bright all around ! The korean director leads two young beginners in the lovers' roles. Yi Hyojeong who is the exemplary Chunhyang is only 17 years old and it was for her as for her partner Cho Seungwoo her first film. She brights with sweetness and he shows real nobility.";

My response to the Pansori sequences was different than some reviewers who found it annoying. Granted I wouldn't sit at home listening to Pansori opera on my stereo. But I found it to be a window into another culture that I've never been exposed to before. It was interesting to see the Korean audience also caught up in the emotion of the story as the Pansori told the tale. And the Pansori was also used effectively to reduce any graphic violence in the film during the violent beating of the heroine by the evil governor. I thought the concept of going up and back between the story and the Pansori telling the story was unique and brilliant. I'm surprised the film received an R rating. Any sexuality in the film was done very tastefully. I think it should have received a PG rating.".

The film uses the framing device of a presentday narrator who accompanied by a drummer sings the story of Chunhyang in front of a responsive audience.The film flashes back and forth between the singer's presentation and scenes of Mongryong Cho Seung Woo a young nobleman who falls captive to the beauty of the commoner Chunhyang Yi Hyo Jeong.

In the interim a tyrant named Byun comes to power in Chunhyang's province and demands that the beauty marry him. She refuses and Byun schedules her for execution  just as Mongryong returns to the province to reclaim his true love.This is a movie that presents a Romeo and Juliet set in premodern Korea. Alsoit is a folk tale in a postmodern form that refreshes both the eye and our ideas about storytelling as the viewer gets a glimpse of Korean culture.After viewing this filmit may linger long in one's memory as the movie is characterized not only of its own way of storytelling but also its rich colors and striking images giving off an iridescent afterglow.".

	schema:reviewBody "If your idea of high filmed entertainment involves a spoiled governor's son from a patriarchal society getting everything he wants bullying his faithful servant marrying and then having awkward sex with a woman he encounters on a lark and a gruff male voice singing everything that takes place from the servant's illicit play in the fields to the scenery that passes by the camera to even the imaginary dialogue taking place within characters' minds this may just be the film for you. And should that terribly longwinded sentence put you off the movie it shouldn't for the story of Chunhyang is a treasured Korean folk tale the narration is presented in the timehonored tradition of pansori an ancient Korean rhythmic narrative singing style accompanied by percussion and the director of this version of the story is none less than the esteemed I'm Kwon Taek perhaps Korea's grandfather of cinema with 99 films to his credit.Lee Mong Ryong played by Cho Seung Woo is the local governor's son and during a visit to the countryside village of Namwon he observes the playful Chunhyang Lee Hyo Jeong swinging from a distant tree. He uses his authority and his manservant Pangja played with astounding relish by Kim Hak Young to visit woo and marry the girl a courtesan's daughter all within a matter of hours and without his own father's consent. All is idyllic for a while until the two lovers encounter the real rough and ready world of Chosunera Korea. When the staccato wailing of the pansori narrator begins to intrude even upon the dialogue of the primary actors it becomes hard to take and nonKoreans are apt to turn away. It is only in the recognition of the centrality of pansori to this story that I was able to stomach it. I'd like to remove pansori from my cinematic lexicon. But the vocal elements of pansori are beautiful in their precision and purity so when it is central to the telling of a historical tale little 21st century me refuses to argue with such history. It would be like asking directors of Shakespearian plays to do away with iambic pentameter.And so Mong Ryong hides his marriage from his father who is appointed a minister for the king in Seoul and must go there. But first as he settles affairs in his district he sends Mong Ryong who leaves Namwon under melodramatic circumstances Chunhyang screaming all the while left behind to face the full brutality of the Chosun Dynasty. She is to become a mistress to the new governor of Namwon but she resists him suffering torture and painful public humiliation. Eventually she is imprisoned and sentenced to die at the new governor's third anniversary of rule.Meanwhile Mong Ryong rides to Seoul where he studies for and takes the royal examination. Earning the highest score he is appointed a provincial inspector beholden to the king. In his duties he comes across Pangja who tells him of Chunhyang's plight. Using Pangja's information Mong Ryong travels back to Namwon and disguised as a beggar infiltrates the governorship there to win back his beloved Chunhyang.Doubtless this film is hokey as its roots are so terribly old but that does not mean it lacks enjoyment. Character interactions clever asides and unexpected dialogue mesh with the ubiquitous pansori chanting to create an undeniably Korean masterpiece. The acting is exquisite with Kim Hak Young standing out but with newcomers Cho Seung Woo and Lee Hyo Jeong in the title role performing beautifully as well.From ancient times the telling of this story has been incidental to the pansori musical presentation. Director I'm is fully cognizant of this fact and determines not to depart from tradition. Instead he focuses on imagery color angles even special effects and other cinematographic treats courtesy of veteran cinematographer Jung Il Sung to bring this film to life even for those turned off by the pansori.A typical Western audience would fail to understand and perhaps even be irked by this unique presentation of a very old Korean folk tale. And while Koreans themselves may be unimpressed by the film by virtue of their sheer familiarity with the story both nonKoreans and Koreans should allow themselves a couple hours to see I'm Kwon Taek's superb rendering of this timeless folk tale.Note I know the director's name is I'm not I'm. The program just sticks the apostrophe in there. Please forgive.".

	schema:headline " Kevin Ma's Review";
	schema:reviewBody "Korea gets its frontrunner for the most cynical melodrama of the year with Love Me Not a beautifully made but emotionally hollow film about a con artist who kind of grows a heart. After a star performance as one of the two sisters in A Tale of Two Sisters talented young actress Moon Geun Young takes on her most mature role yet as Min a blind rich girl who is forced to be the head of her family after the death of her father. Cue Julian a recently released con artist who makes his fortune by swindling rich women. For a melodrama to work likable characters must be crafted for the emotions to resonate. But Love Me Not is a very cynical film  its characters are mean and rarely likable and the hopes for some kind of happy ending are crushed by its thirdact twist. Even at the 30minute mark the audience still struggles to find a character to connect with since Julian is an obvious choice as the one to hate and Min is really just an old miser in the body of a cute 19yearold Korean girl. This also means that unlike most con artist films there's no fun at all in the con  Julian deserves to be hated and he's not really all that clever despite being admired by all of Seoul's shadiest. Perhaps the filmmakers should be given credit for not glorifying the ugly world of cons but they still attempt to make their protagonists sympathetic characters. But when protagonists finally decide to play nice and be friendly to each other it's hard to forget that Min is a bit of an idiot for falling for it. Julian is still just a con artist with a newly acquired conscience who originally intended to kill a blind girl and everyone else is a villain to different degrees. However writerdirector Lee CheolHa probably knows this and he thankfully tones down the usual melodrama for a subdued climax. Expecting a big climax where Julian's scam is revealed and Min breaks down to the tune of a dramatic score fueled by lots of violins? Not happening. While the first act drags slightly Lee keeps the twists coming by keeping the film going at a decent pace without stopping for those big emotional moments. Much of the emotions are muted all the way to the end though it only leads to an ending that's too abstract for its own good. Don't expect Lee to be making an antimelodrama here though Love Me Not is still packed with those clichs that everyone loves. It's just not as painful this time around. Enormous praise meanwhile needs to go to the cinematography by Gang Chang Bae. The film is consistently gray a most appropriate palate given the film's mood but Lee and Gang frame the shots wonderfully to show their stars at their most beautiful. The use of focus is also reminiscent of Asian television ads with its slick visuals and amazing clarity. It's a farfetched call but Love Me Not may be the most beautifully shot Korean film I've seen from 2006. Love Me Not may be really pretty to look at but there's not much beneath its surface. What about the amazing maturity that Moon Geun Young is supposed to show? Moon does seem to have come a long way since the not crazy sister role from A Tale of Two Sisters but showing maturity doesn't mean acting like a spoiled brat. Perhaps it is again at the fault of the script but when even a blind orphaned girl can't garner much sympathy by the second act toning down the mean streak would be a good option. Meanwhile the 34yearold Kim Joo Hyuk fares slightly better in his performance as pseudovillain Julian but he's visibly a few years too old to be Moon Geun Young's older brother. Or perhaps I just found another plot hole. As far as melodrama goes Love Me Not should be applauded for not following a strict formula of clichs even though it doesn't stray too far from it. On the other hand Love Me Not is not much of a con movie because it lacks the fun and cleverness in the central con. As an unintentional comedy Love Me Not has quite a few of those strange moments where characters pop up as if they inherited some kind of Star Trek beaming technology. Thankfully both the stars and the visuals are pretty to look at the cynics will love that the emotions are subdued and I was just glad that the whole thing didn't collapse in the third act. For an idolsfilled film Love Me Not is a solid but imperfect choice. by Kevin Ma".

	schema:reviewBody "There is such an appealing wit and charm about this film that for all it's changes of tone and balance it's still well worth seeing.Set in a Korea of several hundred years ago it's the story of a scholarauthor Yunseo who while investigating art fraud stumbles upon a scribe copying an indecent novel. After token resistance at the appalling idea of one so scholarly as he lowering himself to reading such trash he tries his hand at writing one. As a mental exercise of course.It proves a great success with ahem desperate housewives all over the city. It's such a hit in fact that he is urged to write a sequel. This time he decides to illustrate it with suitably saucy drawings. He enlists the local Chief of police and traditional family enemy Gwangheon who has a talent for art and doodles as a hobby. The problem is the positions Yunseo describes are so outlandish that Gwangheon can't draw them simply because he can't picture them in his mind's eye.Enter the King's wife Queen Jeongbin who happens to have read the books and is tantalised by the thought of meeting the author. In Jeongbin Yunseo finds the perfect muse for his imagination and Gwangheon finds the necessary model for his illustrations. The troubles for both the characters and the film come with Jeongbin discovering that she is being used. The revenge she exacts is way gruesome and the emotional distress of the King at finding out about the affair is really out of place with the tone of the rest of the film.Nevertheless the director and writer Kim Daewoo has taken a potentially gratuitous onejoke idea and fleshed it out in very unexpected ways. Although the film is focused on sexual gratification and sexual repression the ways in which the viewer is shown what it being described  from tiny holograms climbing onto a table to demonstrate a position to the old scribe having his rickety old legs manipulated by Yunseo  have to be seen to be fully appreciated. If you don't laugh out loud several times at the sheer ingenuity of it there just might be something wrong with you.It gets an 810 even though the ending was a bit of a disappointment.".

It covers comedy slapstick drama excruciating torture gore erotica and a plot so twisted it sometimes feel like a complete figment of the protagonist's imagination. Its a simple story of an accomplished author who tries his hand at writing erotic stories as an sport since it was banned in Korea at the time. In the process of writing these stories he uses people for inspiration. And then there is also the plot where the king and queen get involved you should get a fair idea where I'm coming from. So all in all its total entertainment and an lovely film to watch with buddies. However it may not have lasting power and you may not remember it the following day but you certainly will have fun watching it.PS The other person who's commented on this film has mistakenly identified the queen as the king's favourite concubine which is incorrect since the film clearly indicates that the character is the queen's.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS!Save the Green Planet is 2003 Korean film that must be seen to be believed or appreciated. Full disclosure It's one of my all time favorite films from any country.I typically won't bother writing a review for something when so many people have already done so. I try to keep my reviews focused on little known or reviewed works so as to try to help other viewers decide if it would be something they like as so many other IMDb reviewers have done for everyone else in the past. But I felt I almost owed it to this movie to post a review and since this director  writer of this film is soon going to FINALLY work on a new feature film there's no better time than now to review this puppy.I realize this film is not going to be to everyone's tastes. It can be considered being all over the place in tone and story and it will get violent at times. You will definitely want to ignore the whimsical poster  box art that makes you think this is going to be some lighthearted adventure tale that is certainly not the case. What this film is about however is quite difficult to fully describe. In fact you're probably better offer just watching it yourself without knowing anything in advance and forming your own opinions. That's how I first saw it years ago knowing nothing about it prior to viewing it was real late at night back in '04 or so and it was either this Korean film I somehow hadn't heard of or a Lorenzo Lamas helmed low budget action flick. I clearly chose wisely that evening sorry Mr. Latin Heartthrob. As the movie I chose played out I went from this is OK enough to watch to this is a pretty interesting film to this is getting a little bizarre to this a mesmerizing piece of cinema. In all honesty after the credits rolled I was simply awestruck by WTF I had just watched.If you want to watch the movie as I first did without prior knowledge as to what it's about which I fully recommend DON'T READ THIS PARAGRAPH!...Your story involves a slightly off young man who is convinced there are aliens among us that mean to do us harm. With the help of his girlfriend he's determined to rid the world of these aliens and hence 'save the green planet'. He kidnaps what he believes is the leader of these aliens on earth and systematically tortures him to find the truth about the alien plans. Then it's a matter of slowly uncovering whether this captor is just a delusional loon or the key to saving the entire world or somewhere in between.This film runs the gamut from being a standard crime mystery thriller to a torture flick to a simple tale about life  love  humanity to an outrageous scifi film about the beginnings  end of mankind. You name it and this movie probably has it it's as strange as it is grounded as devious as it is poignant as simple as it is complex etc it somehow manages to successfully juggle so many differing emotions ideas and stories together in an astonishingly effortless way that doesn't even seem possible.As for the acting Your lead actor is played Shin Hakyun. He's always been a really good actor but he gives a terrific performance here as the man who's determined to save Earth at all costs. The rest of the actresses and actors involved in this film are all solid to excellent in their performances as well. Job Well Done by everyone involved.Look I'd been a huge fan of Asian cinema in general long since prior to watching this film and it was pretty clear to me that Korea was starting to bring it big time back in the early 2000's with Park Chanwook's vengeance trilogy already under away and a number of decent spy thrillers love stories and romcoms in the bag you couldn't help but notice the talent on display in the up and coming Hallyu industry at that time. But Save the Green Planet was perhaps the final tipping point in my opinion anyway that convinced the non believers once and for all. Most people look to Old Boy's release a year later which is also a movie I dearly love as THE seminal Korean film from that era and rightfully so but you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't at least give this somewhat overlooked film a look see.You might not like it you may love it you be 'meh' about it. Regardless I consider this movie to be mandatory viewing for any cinephile or any random moviegoer for that matter!...I just watched it again a month or so ago and it's as awesome as it ever was! If you haven't seen it I implore you to check it out someday when you get a chance!Bottom Line 9 out of 10 stars!...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!P.S. Save the Green Planet is the only feature film this director ever helmed. That alone is simply astonishing. Word is he's now back though and has signed up one of Korea's highest profile actors to star in the new film he's directing. Hmmmm CAN'T WAIT!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most unusual diversified and courageous movies you might ever see in your life. Don't get fooled by the silly trash cover or the strange movie title the Korean cinema delivers once again a new masterpiece that easily beats any Hollywood movie. This flick is beyond compare and completely unique.It mixes several genres such as comedy drama psychological thriller investigation suspense horror sciencefiction and more. This movie never fails to surprise and switches from slapstick elements and situation comedy to a dark criticism of modern society and melodramatic drama sequences. In one moment you have a quite rough torture scene in a basement with a lot of blood and in the next minute a completely ridiculous sciencefiction tale will be told with a lot of entertaining absurdity. This experimental style fits surprisingly well and the movie doesn't seem incoherent. Everything remains clear and easy to follow which is not always the case in modern Asian cinema. The first fifteen minutes or so may seem strange because this movie is very unique but once you're into it which happens extremely fast you will get drowned into a fantastic story. The movie is funny sad brutal romantic and always energizing.Maybe the ending was a little bit too predictable for me but most of the people who have the courage to check this movie out may still be surprised. There are still tons of surprises twists and special events featured in this stunning flick. The rest of the movie is so close to perfection that I didn't want to give a lower rating than the perfect one. The acting is amazing and diversified. The movie is full of original ideas and surprises. The camera work is very well done and the music is also great. Anybody who likes the world of cinema must adore this maybe with the exceptions of more conservative sciencefiction maniacs as this movie has not a lot to do with aliens spaceships and invasion. It's in fact a very human and somewhat touching film.If you like any kind of original and experimental cinema that is not too surreal and abstract but rather fast paced and diversified this movie is your new bible. This is one of those movies which I would suggest you to see once in a lifetime.".

There are some truly horrifying moments too and it's only when we realise the truth behind the protagonist's irrational and violent behaviour that we can feel heartfelt sympathy for his empty one man crusade against 'alien' invaders.

The systematic torture of Kang takes center stage and is the most meaningful part of the film. This is Jeong's poppunk MTV inspired screw you to the establishment.

And just as MTV pop punk and alternaHot Topic culture are run by Kangcentric business outfits Lee Byeong Goo's unhinged fury is driven by a counter culture that ultimately let him down. His efforts are not an altruistic attempt to save the earth but a misguided jaunt in bully comeuppance. 'Save the Green Planet' is a film where genres cross but never successfully mix. The detective angle science fiction intrigue comic falderal and gory horror are all handled excellently yet are isolated in specific microcosms within the film. The film is certainly satisfying when broken down to its individual elements and influences but fails to coalesce into the brilliant genre crossing stew it could have been.".

I've also seen Old Boy and some actors are in both movies but the acting was great I didn't like Sooni's acting though don't know what was wrong with it just couldn't get the idea what that character was all about anyway.This is semilow budget movie but still the special effects were great and I think that the less CGI the movie has the better. As others have mentioned if you cant stand blood and some very disgusting scenes you shouldn't watch this but other than that this is a must see.And no this is'int 'scifi' movie really it has couple scifi scenes but thats about it.".

Great scene the police is in his appartment the Tv set is tuned to the basement camera and the hostage is in it. He yells 'an UFO outside the window' and with a karate move turns the TV off while the policeman is looking away. This is shown in slow motion. The audience cheered.

I was on the edge of the seat throughout the film. Every time i was about to get bored which i definetely didn't! it was injected with some violence chopping off fish heads but it was beautifully merged in as a whole. The twist was anticipated but what was so good about it was that it kept me wondering throughout the film how it was going to end. Everyone also seemed to have missed what a great job the director managed with the music. The grandscale orchestral music and the punk rock music worked as salt and pepper on a great dish and the sound was superb.The let down factors were mostly due to the script especially the disappointing ending. The director must have realised he had a huge task in his hand after reading the scenario and even though he tried his best some scenes just do not make any sense especially when Byunggu's dead mum appears throwing some pills out. Maybe the film was not scientific enough but i don't think you can apply science into a topic such as Aliens anyway... The blend of comedy thrillerhorror police drama and satire works brilliantly although the fusiongenre diluted the whole point of the story by a fraction. The biggest downside was the crude uninteligent cg effect which was apparently meant to be intentional but the film would have looked so much more polished if they were cut off... and it still would make sense.I give this film an 8.3 simply because it was so easy to get into and i watched it without stopping it once. Breathtaking!".

Realistically it would be difficult to come up with a similar genre of a film that would be as fresh and interesting too. The film did fetch a hot response at the Toronto screening but the director admitted it only lasted in the the local theaters for two weeks his explanation being it was mistakenly marketed as a romantic comedy which it was totally not. I suspect the audience there is not ready for such a movie. On the other hand I believe the North American audience is eagerly waiting for a cult movie like such.Without giving too much away I'd say the director is ingenious.

It has got heart and soul and you can see that the director and the cast really care about bringing to life this story of one of the greatest martial artist in history. However despite how much I enjoyed this film there were a few flaws.First some emotional parts in the story moves to fast and there are scenes f Korean and Japanese customs such as shaving his eyebrows that we don't understand and we are not given an explanation to. Another thing is that some moments of this movie are incredibly exxagerated and some are just made up for the movie. I don't understand why they did this since Oyama Mas had an amazing life without all the made up scenes.Last is the action I hear that most people didn't like the action because the fight scenes were short and brutal. However because I do martial arts and know a lot about Oyama Mas I believe that this was the right way for the movie. This is because Oyama never did any soft kungfu which you see in most movies these days He did hard taekwondo and later created kyokushin karate and he always tried to finch his opponent with one punch. combat is not a dance where you can predict each other movements.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Paramui Paito Fighter in the Wind is based on the events in the life of legendary Korean martial artist Choi Baedal. Or more precisely the film is based on the comic book based on the martial artist's life  a difference that can be felt throughout this entertaining but factually suspect movie. The first of a handful of local films about famous Koreans who lived during the Japanese occupation period ''Fighter in the Wind tells of the early part of Chois life how he sneaked into Japan in the late 1930s in hopes of becoming a pilot joined the martial arts community there and after training by himself in the mountains for 18 months came down to become the top fighter of that country. The film offers a seemingly sentimentalized version of the same story especially playing up the outsider aspect of Choi's experiences of his being a Korean in Japanese society. Given the story's xenophobic elements which include evil yakuzas exploiting Koreans it will be interesting to see how a Japanese audience responds to the film when it gets released there as planned. ''Fighters best moments hint at the moral complexity of films like ''Raging Bull Martin Scorceses boxing masterpiece. At first Chois motivation to become Japans best seems to be connected to righting injustices felt by Koreans in Japan but as he travels to martial arts schools enduring punishment after punishment it becomes less clear as to what he is trying to prove. But such insights are all too brief in the film which is so heavy on the melodrama and action that it's difficult to take too seriously. By the end the story resembles a kung fu film from Hong Kong complete with a geisha girlfriend Ara Hirayama who tries to turn Choi into a lover not a fighter and elder statesmen of the Japanese martial arts community who will go to any lengths to keep a Korean from becoming Japan's best. It's not the most inventive of plots but the film keeps it entertaining throughout.Singer and actor Bi Rain was initially cast for the lead role of Choi but had to pull out due to schedule conflicts. Its a good thing too for the railthin pop singer wouldnt have been able to take the physical punishment the role required. Instead we get Yang Donggeun a burly actor who plays the part to near perfection. Its refreshing to see this young and talented actor take on a substantial role for a change and he brings to ''Fighter the necessary savagery and physical presence to make it work.".

As many reviewers have mentioned the fight scenes in this movie are shorter and more brutal than the average Hong Kong action film but this is easily forgiven as the quality of the filmmaking is so high. Most people watching martial arts movies will find themselves dozing through the story waiting for the next fight but the good storytelling quality acting beautiful cinematography and stylish editing make the story elements of Fighter in the Wind a pleasure to watch.The cast all seem perfectly at home in their roles making it easy to love or hate the characters as required. Dongkun Yang plays Baedal with the right mix of naive idealism and hardheaded brutality. The stunning Aya Hirayama provides a likable loveinterest. Taewoo Jeong is charming as Baedals cheeky conman friend Chunbae and Masaya Kato is suitably arrogant and superior as oldfashioned karate master Kato.This may be a film based around martial arts but it is not a typical martial arts movie. The story features some spectacular fighting techniques from the surprisingly acrobatic Yang but the fighting is an embellishment to an otherwise fascinating and welltold story rather than the focus of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "To be quite honest I didn't know anything about this film before I had purchased it. In fact I had only bought it for two reasons. The first was that I knew it was a martial arts film and two because it featured Masayo Kato who appears in a few movies that I happen to like. However by the time I had finished watching the movie I had to admit that it exceeded my expectations for a few reasons. For instance it had some drama which most martial arts films tend to lack the picture quality was superb and above all it was an autobiographical sketch based on a real life martial arts master.I won't go over the story as I'm sure that a few other people had already given it away anyway. But to those who have criticized the film on the basis that it was boring just because the fights were too quick and not very well choreographed I think it's important for them to acknowledge the fact that this was based on a true story. Most fights really did end relatively quick because of Choi Baedal's lethal blows. In fact it was said that most fights between him and his opponents did not last more than three minutes while other matches ended with only single blows coming from one of Baedal's kicks or punches.Needless to say I did enjoy the film as I've already emphasized above and was glad that I saw it for another reason because I would not have embraced Baedal's depicted character with the same respect that I currently have for the other great martial arts legends the likes of which include Musashi Bruce lee Wong Fei Hong et al.8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I was impressed and satisfied with Fighter In The Wind. Most martial arts movies tend not to be very serious but in terms of grit and realism this was one of the few martial arts movies that maintained complete seriousness throughout.Apparently it is biographical of a real karate master which I didn't realize until the end. It is also apparently based on a comic book version of the story which in hindsight is easy to see in the colorful and visually wellarranged cinematography. Many different environments landscapes and buildings are encountered in the course of the story and they are all beautifully presented. The director is a master at his craft.Baedal's geisha girlfriend played by Aya Hirayama is absolutely stunningly beautiful and the movie is worth watching just for her. But it is a good movie in its own right with a good portrayal of the Korean minority in Japan just after World War II. Although parts of the story and characters lack depth I do find the movie generally satisfying except in one respect As the other commentators point out it doesn't have a great deal of fighting and the fights it does have are brief and relatively unimpressive  all the more so because Baedal apparently doesn't use any specific style. It doesn't ring true either that he gets to challenge every kind of martial arts school from karate to judo and others. Would such schools accept challenges from someone with such an unspecific fighting style? I doubt it. But I'm no expert on this.In any case despite these flaws I think the overall style of the movie is very well made and I enjoyed it a lot. I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of martial arts and action movies.My rating 7 out of 10.".

Throw those expectations OUT and prepare to enjoy a very gripping actiondrama with some of the most beautiful filmwork i've seen in a while. To keep it simple this movie is very exaggerated biography of Choi Baedal Later changed his name to Mas Oyama founder of Kyokushin karate starting from before WW2. The fight scenes are not like standard kungfu flicks. They don't fight for 5 minutes. It's realistic in this sense. They trade a few blows and one or the other falls down in severe pain. This movie screams of a comic book feel. Fight scenes are stopped in midaction to emphasize the form and the impact of the blows the color and framing of each shot is reminiscent of comics as well. It emphasizes Choi Baedal's superheroish qualities. The storyline is very interesting although it runs a little long. Overall its a very beautiful film to watch. Its great to see a movie really focus on the philosophies and ideas of martial arts rather than just the fighting itself. It also deals with the fears mindset of a fighter. Its VERY sad and can sometimes come off as corny but the overall emotional impact is there. Watch it and remember its NOT a pure kung fu beat em up movie and you will enjoy it.".

Its great to see a movie really focus on the philosophies and ideas of martial arts rather than just the fighting itself. It also deals with the fears mindset of a fighter. Its VERY sad and can sometimes come off as corny but the overall emotional impact is there. Watch it and remember its NOT a pure kung fu beat em up movie and you will enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have a problem with this film as it purports to associate itself with Sosai Oyama and hence it may affect the way in which young minds see the great legend. Mas Oyama dedicated his life to karate he didn't aim for fame but instead used it as a tool to spread his message of the benefits of karate it's meaning purpose etc or the search for the ultimate truth. My problem with this film is that instead of furthering Sosai Oyama's message or giving an accurate portrayal of his life this film tends to be full of Korean propaganda. At a certain sequence one of the characters after seeing some moves from Baedal  the hero  notes that it's Tae Kyun  a Korean martial art. At the film's climax it shows how the evil Japanese martial masters conspire to stop this upstart  because he's Korean  from being superior to the Japanese. With the evil syndicate conspiring to assassinate the hero. The film then proceeds to emphasize how the bad Japanese oppress the poor helpless KOREAN who uses a KOREAN martial art to defend the oppressed against the evil Japanese  it's that redundant trust me  and all the Japanese martial masters including the head of the Japanese Martial Arts Association. Hell while we're at it why did they not portray him using KOREAN weapons and items as well! Now I'm not Japanese nor do I have anything against the Koreans but puh lease enough from the Ministry of Propaganda already! First of all Sosai Oyama loved Japan he loved the culture that's why he adopted a Japanese name. He even tried to be a Japanese pilot in World War II to defend the nation he grew to admire a great deal. The leader of the Shotokan at that time was NOT his enemy. In fact Funakoshi Gichin Sensei was gracious enough to have taught Sosai Oyama. An event that Sosai would refer to often in his lifetime as the basis of his karate. Sosai Oyama also studied a form of Chinese Kempo Goju ryu and Judo by the way.As a fantasy period piece this film would've been fine. I liked the sets and how they portrayed post war Japan. Granted there may have been some forms of discrimination at that time but not to the extent this film portrays it to be otherwise the Japanese would not have taught so many of their arts to Sosai Oyama. As a film associating itself with the great legend great care should have been taken as to avoid confusing young impressionable minds.Sosai's message was to strive hard in life persevere overcome all obstacles in one's search for the ultimate truth. Karate being a convenient vehicle in such a search due to it's benefits to humanity if studied arduously and properly. This film instead bastardizes that message and translates it into It is better to be Korean and learn Korean martial arts to get back at the evil cruel Japanese since all their martial arts are crap.For the record I respect both the Japanese and the Koreans. I also appreciate and admire all of their contributions to society. It's with this film that I have an issue with as it tends to affect Japanese and Korean sentiments which until now are quite sensitive. Stay away from this film it is difficult to classify as an art piece action film or as a documentary. It is however clearly a form of bad misinformed propaganda. This is the movie industry's version of an Internet Troll.".

	schema:headline " Formulaic but fairly successful martial arts biopic";
	schema:reviewBody "Fighter in the Wind is a Coreaproduced martial arts biopic about Masutatsu Oyama born Choi Baedal the ethnically Corean founder of Kyokushin karate. I actually went into this film bracing for the worst kind of nationalism that I often expect from Corean film when dealing with Japan but was pleasantly surprised at how subdued it was. In addition to some limited but kinetic fight sequences Fighter in the Wind ends up being a mostly satisfying if limited portrait of a prominent figure of the martial arts world.The fictionalized story covers the early portion of Oyama's life in Japan. While history shows that Oyama had actually trained in two schools of karate before developing his own technique I imagine that much of the actual of events of his life were elided for both running time as well as nationalistic purposes in recentering Oyama as a Corean perhaps to appeal to the Corean moviegoing populace. In addition to watching BaedalOyama get beat up beat people up and become a total badass we also watch him make friends with another ethnic Corean the viceridden best friend develop a relationship with a Japanese woman get schooled by a Zainichi karate instructorcircus troupe guard and spend a chunk of time brutally training in solitude in the mountains.The film follows a rather unsurprising approach that you can find in many martial arts films following the hero's journey as he starts from a scrapping fighter who gets beaten learns and trains with a master and learned to use his skills for good and not selfish ambition is forced to fight to protect someone beats the big bad in the end. Yeah totally formulaic since this film mostly fits the basic formula but like many films before it it works. You see the growth of BaedalOyama's character you see his victory from rather rough beginnings and how he changes the lives of those around him. Basic biopicherofilm stuff. But it's pretty well executed so although it's nothing that's going to amaze you at the same time the character remains interesting enough to keep your attention like any biopic. Unfortunately most of the Japanese villains are painted with a rather broad nearmustachetwirling brush so if you're looking for complexity in your storytelling you won't find it here.The fight scenes while not plentiful are kinetic and hard hitting especially the montage as Oyama takes on school after school of Japan's elite fighters. It's fun to watch the different martial arts interact and it's hard not to root for Oyama's practical underdog style. Photography is pretty good adapting to the different dramatic material well while still seeming cohesive and the film doesn't tank in terms of sonic presentation. The acting was overall good although sometimes I felt like Yang Donggun who played Oyama had a rather limited character to work with but he still seemed to embody that rather simple determination with his posture even if I had a hard time believing that his body was one of a brutally effective fighter.I still have some issues with the probably nationalistically motivated fictionalizations to Oyama's life and the rather obvious badguy characterizations of the antagonists but in terms of an engaging biopic Fighter in the Wind actually manages to make it out okayif you like martial arts. It's no visionary work of art but a rather modestly put together biopic that tells the story of a man whose determination and courage led to greatness. These things work for a reason and Fighter didn't screw it up even if it did nothing astounding. Good for martial arts fans and probably passable for everyone else. 710.".

This film narrates the life of Baedal in a fairly straightforward way following his path to fame amongst fighters  taking on karate judo and even kendo exponents.Somehow this film parallels Stephen Chow's KungFu Hustle which also narrates the life of a nobody to a somebody with a pretty babe in tow for good measure except this one is without the slapstick comedy.The first half plods on as our protagonist is still a greenhorn in the martial arts world. Once you've gotten past the first hour things start to pick up when he trains himself to be the best of the best but towards the finale it somehow hints of Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai. Probably no fault of its own as it explores the same theme amongst all martial arts  honour and justice.The fight scenes which looked spectacular in the trailers actually offers nothing new. Most of it are quick cuts and slow motion and given the premise could've offered more in terms of actual fights.This should appeal to those who wanna know more about the myth behind Kyokushinkaikan Karate.

	schema:reviewBody "OK folks here is the rebuttal to the one star dis Korean propaganda you say? So Hollywood is not biased? What about Hong Kong or Mainland China? What about all the Tibetan films coming out against China. What about all the Japanese assertions of superiority and denials of atrocities during WW2? Get the picture? Let me give you some parallels. If your country was invaded and your culture was systematically erased or someone attempted this and succeeded then you have the situation of Native Americans. If you were used as slave labor you have the situation of the African Americans. Japan tried to do both to Koreans and got away with a lot of it. No reparations I know of came out of it. If you think the Native Americans or African Americans are biased they have a good reason to be and you probably will write it off as the past. Don't write off the past. Don't ignore the Legacy inside people. It will come back to bite you.So be mad all you want and call it propaganda but the people you take issue with suffered devastatingly by the people they take issue with. It is till going on today. Check out what Ichiro said about Koreans during the World Baseball Tournament and see the Korean backlash. You really weren't there or descended from either one of these people so you have a rosy picture of Koreans and Japanese. You don't even know the beginning of the injustices cultural looting rape and pillaging and slavery that went on. So do some research which you haven't and you will better understand why a bias in a film is nothing compared to what actually happened in real life. Don't you think the film makers wanted to create a strong reaction? If you are still reading thanks for indulging me please forgive any unpleasant tone as it was not directed to any particular group. Just toward an attitude of ignoring a whole peoples'sentiment that is more than justified. The future is a result of the past.Heres my biased review Please take with a grain of saltLike Yeokdosan which is a very similar story of a Korean rising in importance to Japan Fighter in the Wind shows a person who overcomes through sheer determination and stubbornness all the popular sentiment of inferiority surrounding him in a nation that is not his. Thus he rises to great status despite the discrimination and attitude of superiority against him. If you would like a less fairy tale and more realistic and slickly produced drama I heartily recommend Yeokdosan which is about a Korean wrestler who becomes a star in America and a legend in Japan.The visuals are a treat. I sense a bit of a limited budget so don't expect the most elaborate settings and extras but enjoy scenes of Power Karate instead of the Hyperkinetic wushu films of late. Yang Don Gun really did a great performance as the MAN. If you saw Rocky or any of Jackie Chan's earlier works you know the story. Underdog gets beat and then underdog finds courage and a trainer and goes back for revenge. Mas Oyama did go to the mountains and discovered something about himself there and the rest is history.If you did just a documentary it would not have the impact that a well produced drama would. You need conflict and memorable characters purposely designed to stir a reaction. You need to show the hatred fear and injustice to get the people into it. The greater the hardship and the odds the more memorable the story and CharacterHero.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK folks here is the rebuttal to the one star dis Korean propaganda you say? So Hollywood is not biased? What about Hong Kong or Mainland China? What about all the Tibetan films coming out against China. What about all the Japanese assertions of superiority and denials of atrocities during WW2? Get the picture? Let me give you some parallels. If your country was invaded and your culture was systematically erased or someone attempted this and succeeded then you have the situation of Native Americans. If you were used as slave labor you have the situation of the African Americans. Japan tried to do both to Koreans and got away with a lot of it. No reparations I know of came out of it. If you think the Native Americans or African Americans are biased they have a good reason to be and you probably will write it off as the past. Don't write off the past. Don't ignore the Legacy inside people. It will come back to bite you.So be mad all you want and call it propaganda but the people you take issue with suffered devastatingly by the people they take issue with. It is till going on today. Check out what Ichiro said about Koreans during the World Baseball Tournament and see the Korean backlash. You really weren't there or descended from either one of these people so you have a rosy picture of Koreans and Japanese. You don't even know the beginning of the injustices cultural looting rape and pillaging and slavery that went on. So do some research which you haven't and you will better understand why a bias in a film is nothing compared to what actually happened in real life. Don't you think the film makers wanted to create a strong reaction? If you are still reading thanks for indulging me please forgive any unpleasant tone as it was not directed to any particular group.

	schema:reviewBody "One major problems I had with this movie is the almost utter lack of character development. The protagonist has very little conversation that reveals his thoughts. Instead the director focuses on his determination which is shown soley through actions rather than words that might provoke a deeper understanding of the character. To sum up my knowledge of the characters Baedal wants to be the best fighter his best friend is a goof and the bad guy is harsh and hates Baedal. Thats about as deep as it gets. Slight exagerration but you see what I mean and I do mean SLIGHT.The second shortcoming was Baedal's transformation to a great fighter. For the most part is was glossed over and unrewarding. We get a glimpse of the brutal training he endured and then miraculously he is like a whole different fighter. When this movie is about the transformation from an average fighter to the best in Japan I expect a little more than that.Lastly I have to knock it down a point for the style of the film. It seems like during some fights they decided to arbitrarily add in special effects. These detract from the movie especially because the rest of the movie is not stylized in that manner Kill Bill for example. Also some of the sets and characterscostumes seemed a little cheesy making me think it was a relatively low budget film. Not what I would expect for a movie from 2004.The disappointing part of this movie is really that they could have done a lot better. The story itself has plenty of interesting aspects that are great for a movie. However the way they chose to present was just plain dull largely due to the reasons I have expressed above. While I was watching it gave me the attitude Oh hes gonna fight this guy maybe it will be cool Okay this is boring when is the next fight?. And its not at all because I'm obsessed with fighting its because the scenes between fights were really lacking.If you want to see a great coming of agemartial arts movie about determination and deep characters I recommend Once Upon A Time in High School. It has everything that this movie lacked.".

The Story is very serious and isn't like most martial arts movies mainly because its based on a true story which gives it its serious feel. the fighting scenes in it are so different from other martial arts movies which i find good in this movie i think if you're karate practitioner like me u'll get a better understanding of the different fight system in this movie as some people didn't favour it because they looked at the movie as an actually fictional martial arts story wen its actually based on a real man and real events a man who could eliminate him opponent in one punch and karate chop a bulls horn off. The actual man Choi Baedel or as his Japanese name which is Masutastu Oyama Went through hard intense training on a mountain away from the public all by himself for 4 years but only stayed there for 18 months going back to the public he fought the worlds greatest fighters some only defeating them in one single punch after there was no human opponent who could match up to his amazing fighting power he started fighting bulls mainly defeating them by karate chopping the bulls horns if I can remember Masutatsu Oyama fought 55 bulls in his life time killing 11 of them and knocking the rest out. Because of his powerful karate chopstrike he was named the God Hand as well as the USA called him The most toughest man in the word This movie portrays his first part of success as the worlds toughest fighter greatest martial artist ever lived.

For instance right from the start he's Korean but goes to Japan during the WWII era to become a fighter pilot which doesn't work out for him because of course they don't let him become a fighter pilot. But why in the world did he think this was a good idea in the first place? Join the country that's devastating his own? Willingly go to a place where they don't like him? I'm already confused.

The unskilled afraid young Korean in the racist Japan community having to take on bullies underworld and surviving. The guy who watered himself out of terror became the best fighter in the world. This film gives him space and time to evolve and make us know him better over time. This is how you get attention from the audience Hollywood!! Many lessons can be taught to western action movie makers even to this day 11 years later. The human aspect of the hero taking beaten letting us see his wounds care for him... Seeing his knuckles and body bloody and beaten. Showing us his suffering. Even more showing us how he fought his own demons and set his mind to victory how he decided to take off to the mountains and train how much he wanted to become better and stronger. Not only as a fighter but as a person as well. This is what makes him exemplar to us watching. I know that this is not Oyama's 100 real story but i do not care. Character build up minimalistic editing and great fight scenes made me fall in love with this movie.I will never forget his notion about fighting and perhaps dying. His deepest fears.

	schema:reviewBody "Baramui Fighter is a very well done biopic of the Korean national hero Choi Bae Dal who was one of the best martial arts fighters in the whole world and who has gone through loads of hard times as being a part of the Korean minority in Japan that has been shattered by the Second World War and the following cruel occupation by American soldiers and the slow return to form of the country.The movie surely idealizes a little bit too much the main character with this homage and the story reserves not many surprises. A poor Korean boxer gets in trouble with local authorities isolates himself in the mountains after the tragic assassination of his idol and comes back to become the country's best fighter before he realizes that there are more important things than fighting for its own honour. The story includes some philosophic parts a typical but very well played subtle love story and a load of breathtaking fighting scenes.It's not only the solid acting or the very well done but not outstanding fighting scenes that make this movie quite entertaining but the authentic portrait of the hard life in Japan after the war. The scenes in the poor quarters of a big Japanese city including gang fights conflicts with brutal local authorities and an emotional melting pot of honour identity and passion that are questioned make this movie very addicting. Especially the first fortyfive minutes or so of the movie are great to watch the rest is your solid standard martial arts flick.In the end anybody interested in Japanese and Korean culture and history might highly adore this movie. Martial arts fan will also like this well done film. Those who like the more emotional and philosophic parts might give this movie some credits but might claim that it could have been more profound. This flick is clearly better than many recent Chinese and Japanese martial arts movies but it can't keep up with the classics of the genre.Note that the very diversified soundtrack of the movie from tradition folk music o symphonic metal came as a positive surprise to me.".

The scenes in the poor quarters of a big Japanese city including gang fights conflicts with brutal local authorities and an emotional melting pot of honour identity and passion that are questioned make this movie very addicting. Especially the first fortyfive minutes or so of the movie are great to watch the rest is your solid standard martial arts flick.In the end anybody interested in Japanese and Korean culture and history might highly adore this movie. Martial arts fan will also like this well done film. Those who like the more emotional and philosophic parts might give this movie some credits but might claim that it could have been more profound. This flick is clearly better than many recent Chinese and Japanese martial arts movies but it can't keep up with the classics of the genre.Note that the very diversified soundtrack of the movie from tradition folk music o symphonic metal came as a positive surprise to me.";

The protagonist starts from the bottom  both physically and mentally goes trough some devastating crisis only to get out stronger every time.Not only the main character goes trough changes the movie itself moves from one state to other.

My interest in Korean film has evolved from watching Friend a couple of years ago to seeing the simply amazing Old Boy last year. So expectations were high but unfortunately Fighter in the wind was unable to deliver.Fighter in the wind is about a Korean martial artist who comes to Japan at the end of World War 2. He suffers many humiliations and finally decides to train and become the most powerful martial artist in Japan.I can certainly appreciate films that are more focused on being poetic than on fighting. But still when i see a movie that has fighter in the title and revolves around a martial arts champion i expect much fighting. But this is where Fighter in the wind ultimately fails. The fights are quite many but short and not very wellmade. I have come to expect a certain level of choreography and style to the fighting in Asian cinema but here it falls short in this regard. Also the main character is not very likable or rather we never get to know him well enough to form an opinion. The story feels shallow and i never get a real feeling for what drives him.So painfully enough i have to say that this is not a very enjoyable movie. It's beautifully made with nice cinematography and also some strong acting from especially the talented Kato Masaya. But still it fails to entertain. Overly long and with a story that doesn't really seem to go anywhere and characters i could hardly care less about this is not a Korean film to remember.I rate it 410.".

Portraying him like a lonely Korean wanderer traveling the country beating up Japanese masters is silly since the respect and devotion that he always manifested for Budo and ancient martial traditions. For a period of his life he studied under a Korean master but that was again on Japanese soil and the martial art was Gojuryu Karate.Another pathetic attempt from Korea to downplay their archrivals the Japanese.

	schema:reviewBody "Touted as the biggest love story in Korea in 2005 it is no surprise why the hype. BasedInspired by a true story there had been a handful of such movies in the recent weeks You are My Sunshine is your typical melodramatic romance with leads so cute and pretty you can't help but be captivated as you embark on their journey of love.It brings to mind a frequently asked question whether it is better to love or be loved. Seokjoong Hwang Jeongmin is a affable simple minded hillbilly farmer who dreams of getting married to the woman of his dreams and settling down in a cattle ranch. Luckless in love he contemplates going abroad to look for a Filipino wife just as one of his buddies did. But anyhow soon after he meets Eunha Jeon Doyeon a coffee girl who also moonlights as a karaoke hostess and falls head over heels with her.Eunha is a complex woman with a shady past but although we were not told exactly what from Doyeon's portrayal it doesn't take a genius to warrant an accurate guess. She's extremely guarded and frosty having lost hope in men but eventually gets touched by Seokjoong's sincerity. Who says your average joe couldn't snag that hot babe if he tries doggedly hard and is thick skinned about it? And thick skinned he sure is as he forges ahead in marriage despite objections from his aged mother. The movie then moves onto a different plane looking at societal prejudices against people of certain trades as well as misinformation about the disease AIDS. Eunha's past catches up with her shades of BanderasJolie's Original Sin here and Seokjoong learns of her being inflicted with the disease. Eunha disappears and the village folk gets flustered in having to undergo HIV testing putting the blame of the introduction of the disease on Seokjoong.It's always difficult when you want to shake off the past but yet get haunted by its ghost. You're seeking a new and ideal life and it's always blissful to be with a loved one. You know the romance bit pauses and the melodrama sets in after the introduction of the exboyfriend and the pacing of the movie suffered with the discovery of the illness thereafter.I was waiting for scenes which will turn on the tear ducts. There were ample potential ones like the uneventful searches the longing the loss but they were all building up the emotions to that one scene near the end where you really feel the love lost of being so close yet so far the longing feeling to hold your loved one in your arms to embrace them in warmth to keep them safe from harm and to shower them with your love. Damn power and really heartwrenching although it sort of looked comedic at the start.As the alternative to another Korean romance Daisy this one tended to be a little more intimate mature and being less flashy. If you're up for some good old fashioned weepy then You are My Sunshine is your choice between the two.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEAD...taken from a reaction paper I wrote for Social Science Class..My Sassy Girl is a 2001 film by Korean director Kwak Jae Yong formerly known for the straight melodramas he directed. It was based on the novel with the same title compiled from the journals posted on the Internet by Kim Ho Seok about his relationship with a girl. The film catapulted its lead actress Jeon Ji Hyun and its lead actor Cha Tae Hyun into superstardom. It spawned viewers' interest in romantic comedies although it was never recognized in the west.My Sassy Girl starts out with GyeonWoo a nave but eccentric 25 yearold college student who doesn't have a clear direction in life. He narrates how his parents raised him like a girl and how his parents' constantly telling him he was smart caused him to become lazy. His life then becomes intertwined with that of a bizarre girl whom he meets at the subway. She was drunk and wasted when he first saw her and before passing out at the subway she calls him 'honey'. He was then forced to take responsibility for her and that night he carried the wasted girl on her back all the way to a nearby motel. Hilarity ensues in the following scenes as GyeonWoo and the girl share funny moments together such as hitting each other on the subway playing squash the ball always hitting GyeonWoo squarely in the face dancing in the disco with their high school uniforms on and exchanging shoes the girl wears sneakers while GyeonWoo wears heels.The early parts of the film showcase the girl's bizarre attitude. The girl can be seen arguing with strangers writing synopses of action movies passing out after drinking three glasses of beer and hitting GyeonWoo all the time telling him 'wanna die?' and using him to get her way. GyeonWoo on the other hand succumbs to all the girl's whims and does everything for her. The first half of the film is filled with pure physical comedy and witty hilarious sequences.What sets this movie apart from others is how the second half of the film which consists of pure melodrama is connected to the first half. The second half explains the girl's bizarre attitude and unfolds all the drama behind the girl's comedic behavior in the first half. GyeonWoo battles a conflict with himself and finds it hard to let the girl go after 'healing her sorrow'. The latter scenes in the film are so dramatic that it 'turns grown men into crybabies' quoted from the International Movie Database. Jeon JiHyun's acting versatility added to the second half's strong impact on the viewers. A very ingeniously written script turns the laughing audience into a crying one in a short span of time.However sad the second half of the film may be the 'overtime' part of the film wonderfully concludes all the comedy and drama that unfolded in the preceding two parts. Gyeonwoo and the girl go along with the sad fate that befell them continuing their own lives. The ending which I will not reveal for I recommend that people watch it could be considered as one of the greatest ones in the history of filmmaking. It left no questions unanswered and it concluded all the subtle hints that the earlier parts gave. It left me and other members of the audience laughing in tears.The uncut version of the film lasts 137 minutes 2 hours and 17 minutes quite long for a romantic comedy. But it was so craftily and carefully written that one would not notice time ticking by. Every scene in the film gives the viewers something to laugh cry or think about. There was no dead air in the story. The cinematography of the film was excellent for it captured every scene perfectly also showcasing the beautiful environment of Korea along the way. The soundtrack very much added to the emotion of the film's most significant sequences. George Winston's rendition of 'Pachelbel's Canon in D' invokes a very romantic and joyous feeling that is indeed felt in the scene where GyeonWoo gives the girl a rose during her class at an allgirls school while she was playing the piano. Shin Seung Hoon's 'I Believe' the movie's main theme served its function well as the tearinducer in the most dramatic parts of the film. After watching the movie only hearing the song brings me to the edge of tears as I remember the saddest parts of the film.Jeon JiHyun's acting in the film was very superior. She does very well in portraying the unnamed girl yes the girl's name was never mentioned in the movie. Her very strong charm and acting versatility she laughs threatens GyeonWoo and cries in one scene makes the film very appealing even to grown men who grew up watching action movies. Her performance in this film shoved her into the limelight and made girls want to be like her and made boys want to be with her.Cha Tae Hyun did justice to the role of GyeonWoo. Just looking at him makes you laugh and his being punched slapped and manipulated by the girl is one of the big factors in the film's success as a comedy. His performance in the film made him one of Korea's 'most wanted dates' according to a survey on Korean girls.Some of the very notable characteristics that I found in the film were 1. It had no kissing scenes 2. The girl's name was never mentioned although she played the biggest part in the film and 3. There were no 'I love you' lines in the entirety of the film.After watching the uncut version of the film I saw tears in the eyes of most people in the audience. I could most probably say the movie has been successful in moving its viewers.Jeon Ji Hyun won the 2002 Grand Bell Best Actress Award for her performance in this film. Cha Tae Hyun won Best New Actor at the 2002 Korean Oscars for his performance in this film. My Sassy Girl was number one at the box office for six straight weeks in Korea and sold over 20000 tickets per day in Hong Kong at the time of its release in 2001. It was the second highest grosser of that year accumulating more box office loot than SHREK HARRY POTTER or LORD OF THE RINGS. It was the Best Asian Film at the 22nd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Just this year Dreamworks an American film company has been planning for a Hollywood remake of this film. How great could this film get? My Sassy Girl is a film close to my heart. It is not only a lighthearted comedy that delves into the culture and behavior of Asian teenagers. This movie shows that there are so many different ways of expressing your love without saying 'I love you'. It is a movie that proves 'fate is building a bridge of chance for the one you love'.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful RomanceComedy which manages 'real' emotions!";
	schema:reviewBody "Minor SpoilersThis film is one of the greatest RomanceComedy movies ever made and as such I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah that's right. It's a mostly true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company Shin Cine. Finally Korean director Kwak Jae Yong 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters 'Kyun Woo' Cha Tae Hyun and 'The Girl' Yes her name is never actually given played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out but not before calling Kyun Woo Honey. This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well at least half way down the platform before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well He gets a down right scary weird psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A Hit him B Humiliate him or C Get him thrown into Jail. Yes she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo and we the audience can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted sometimes you laugh with him mostly we laugh 'At him' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless and I can honestly say I have never ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a RomanceComedy film it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story to an 'Ashes Of Time' style periodswordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail Which at first may seem trivial or pointless will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story it also makes the film nearly infinitely rewatchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching less comedic romance angle you wont lose interest.

	onyx:emotionText "Minor SpoilersThis film is one of the greatest RomanceComedy movies ever made and as such I feel I will have a hard time doing it justice with a few lines written here. The story was first seen online as an internet diary written by Korean student Ho Sik Kim. And is claimed to be based on a relationship with a girl he actually met. Yeah that's right. It's a mostly true story! Then the story was bought by Korean film production company Shin Cine. Finally Korean director Kwak Jae Yong 'Sketch of a rainy day' was brought on board to direct. The rest as they say. is history.The entire movie revolves around two main characters 'Kyun Woo' Cha Tae Hyun and 'The Girl' Yes her name is never actually given played by the wonderful Jeon Ji Hyun. The story begins when Kyun Woo meets the girl on a train platform late at night. See she's drunk. Very drunk. After making a fool of herself on the train she passes out but not before calling Kyun Woo Honey. This leads the other passengers to believe that she is his girlfriend. In turn our wimpy hero feels obliged to take care of her. So off he goes. Well at least half way down the platform before dropping her onto an empty bench. But do you think he has the heart to leave her there? Of course not. That's one of the things that makes this film special. Kyun Woo may be a bit soft. He may be even just a tad pathetic but his heart is in the right place. All he wants to do is help the girl. But... What does he get in return? Well He gets a down right scary weird psychopath of a girlfriend who takes every opportunity to either A Hit him B Humiliate him or C Get him thrown into Jail. Yes she's pretty mean. Or is she? Is there more to her than both Kyun Woo and we the audience can see? Maybe his wish to help her is not totally unjustified.One of the greatest achievements of this movie is in it's two leads. Considering nearly the entire movie focuses on just two people. The stars did a very good job of keeping up 'very' good chemistry. These are two wonderful actors who portray all the emotions needed and at a very high level. Cha Tae Hyun in his first role manages to keep Kyun Woo on just the right side of Bumbling Shy and even Pathetic. At no point in the movie does he annoy and that's a hard task indeed. He's always laughable. Granted sometimes you laugh with him mostly we laugh 'At him' but that never stops you from thinking you'd like to have him as your friend. Jeon Ji Hyun however is just incredible. She is the best actress of her generation. I don't just mean in Korea. I mean PERIOD. She fills the character of 'the girl' with depth charm and overall a sense of reality which in a film that occasionally becomes far fetched is an excellent achievement indeed. She is incredibly expressive. Most of the time she doesn't even need to say anything. Her face says all we need to know. Some of her expressions are just priceless and I can honestly say I have never ever seen them captured on film before. i'd be 'more' than a little surprised if she doesn't become more of an 'international' star in the next few yearsThe film features a wide range of genre's. Although It is primarily a RomanceComedy film it also has a dash of action courtesy of the girl's 'Scriptwriting' hobby. This leads to all manor of imagined scenarios staring Jeon Ji Hyun. Be it parodies of 'The Matrix' in her 'Demolition Terminator' story to an 'Ashes Of Time' style periodswordplay movie later on in the film. These scenes while not exactly furthering the plot are really well done and a nice little break from the main story.My favourite aspect of the film is how the director gives little hints and tips as to what is happening in the story without actually telling us. Each and every small detail Which at first may seem trivial or pointless will come back to play a major part in the film later on. Apart from being a really neat little way to tell the story it also makes the film nearly infinitely rewatchable. You can come back to it again and again and you'll always notice something new which enhances the plot. By the time you get to the midpoint of this film you 'will' care for these characters. As it approaches a more touching less comedic romance angle you wont lose interest. It's clever funny touching and romantic.The only people who may not like this will be those allergic to romantic films. Even then I feel you may just be surprised. I cannot recommend this film enough. If you don't watch it. You only have yourself to blame.";

	schema:headline " SPOILER Excellent movie that worth seeing the 2nd time to enjoy the detail";
	schema:reviewBody "The attention to detail the depth and width of the plot is amazing.  The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time.  There are several plots in the movie.  I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love it may give that impression to some people.  It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes.  You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER The Character The girl always think she is special she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to?   She is very selfcentered proud witty remember how quick she get GyunWoo out of class? talented kendo piano squash dance not afraid of how people look at her live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that GyunWoo is smart from their parents because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe.  He is a sensitive person probably due to his girlish upbringing.GyunWoo is quite layback and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning.  And that's one of the reason the girl said 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending.  For the first 3 years they meet they are not really ready for each other due her exboyfriend exbf and personality.  They are at the crossroad so they eventually have to split.The Story In the subway GyunWoo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her exboyfriend.  She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc.  Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart' so he have no option but to take care of her.  As a proof of GyunWoo getting her attention is that she scold at the youngster who wears pink.  She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special.  This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same bluecolored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only GyunWoo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not.  They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call GyunWoo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious.  It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with GyunWoo that she indeed think GyunWoo has so much resemblance with her exbf.  So she phoned GyunWoo to come out for the 1st time.  Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police stationAfter GyunWoo left the girl on a bench he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later.   Later he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie I was distracted by my laughing but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel.  The phone call is made by the girl's parent.  That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him.  And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop?  And why does the coffee come so late? Why does the girl slap GyunWoo so often? Is there any meaning behind?The Girl always tries to be different.  She doesn't like people dress alike she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee beef stew in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script GyunWoo asks why don't they kiss at the end?  He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl director says that this script movie is not a melodrama. Then how come this movie is a action movie?Also the first script prophesize the girl saving GyunWoo in the playground later.For the second script I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes GyunWoo into the water is she wants GyunWoo in the water too. She wants GyunWoo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned implied when the girl staring at a pier with the exbf's mother later.  Assuming that she don't know whether GyunWoo can swim or not the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her by a simple drowning accident.  The story did not tell how her exbf drowned whether the girl is present or not.  But if the girl was at the scene at the accident that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died which I biasedly assume.  Nevertheless the girl found peace of mindsatisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy the boy will not be drowned.  She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House' the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine.  But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior.  So why she said that?  Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty angry with herself on not loving her exbf as much any more. Or at least she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mindpresent life.  Rationally she knows this is the thing to do to face it to leave away from the ghost of his exbf.  However she is not as 'special' as she would like that she still long for him since she is attracted to GyunWoo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like GyunWoo.  Who else look like GyunWoo?  He should be the exbf.  The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl although the girl never know this.  Well I may be stretching that a bit here but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving GyunWoo under gunpoint she cried.  She is actually talking to herself this time.  She think that her dead exbf want her to live well.  She says if she needs to learn what love is she need to live well.  To live well love is essential but this is what a dead man cannot give her.  This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene GyunWoo say what had happened is as if what he have planned.  He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances the answer she give on how she view about her pain view of good lifelove must be authentic.  It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected the ends is.    And the last slap on his face is always good.  It means she cares.Part 2 GyunWoo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant.  Then GyunWoo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because GyunWoo will not ask that when the girl is around. GyunWoo want to understand her pain try solving it.  The girl bring GyunWoo there a lot.  By now GyunWoo is really a replacement for his exbf and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile.  And GyunWoo said that she pretends to be happy every time in this restaurant because he knows she has lots of memoryhistory with her exbf in this restaurant.  And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called GyunWoo and why she have to kill him?  If the director really meant the bad guy  her exbf because they are lookalike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf it means the girl try forget him.  And interestingly the girl comes from future so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script she says 'Someday I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually it means 'Today she meet someone important to her GyunWoo that will be suitable for her in the future'.   Then GyunWoo says 'if you do ask him to take you if it's possible!'  GyunWoo is urging her to let himself to take her!   GyunWoo looks very serious at this moment.  This is not a joke of 'You sassy girl let someone come from a UFOfuture kidnap you!'After the 3rd script they always ride subway together play squash phone each other every night and wait for GyunWoo at school etc.  The girl really starts to love him ever since GyunWoo chase her on high heel.  The longer he runs the longer she loves him.  She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain  she is even nice enough to him to run back home for an umbrella.  Each day she likes GyunWoo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. Party because she love them too she refrain herself from seeing GyunWoohave to dealt directly with her parents about this.  So GyunWoo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi GyunWoo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement.  He tries to heal her pain but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone she no longer needs him.  He is well aware that the 'action''power' is always initiated from her.  But just for this moment it does not matter he enjoys every moment with her.  He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what GyunWoo think is correct she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time they don't meet each other for such a long time that GyunWoo think they are over.  So it's not too surprising for GyunWoo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny though gross.This time the girl has a blind date.  She definitely is not the one who arrange it her controlling parents do.  She call GyunWoo for help GyunWoo is her 'friend'.  She has to call and give GyunWoo a chance here since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving.  GyunWoo must be very sad when he left the restaurant.  He gives up on her.  He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want GyunWoo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in GyunWoo. GyunWoo is not necessary GyunWoo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it.  But after the 10 rules she can no longer deny GyunWoo is the one who makes her happy not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing GyunWoo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded GyunWoo as painkiller.  But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action to accept GyunWoo as 'another' important person in her life.  GyunWoo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at GyunWoo is painful.  He reminds her of his exbf every time.  They look and seem to act alike.  She has to completely remove her exbf first love I believe's image before she can really love GyunWoo.  But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind at the same time.When GyunWoo is writing the letter saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain she express that her exbf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different she hope she have the will to overcome but no she is still helpless.  She cannot avoid thinking of her exbf when seeing GyunWoo.  She is sorry for that.They have to split GyunWoo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years.  She goes away for GyunWoo.  GyunWoo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates he is committed.The way they pile up the stones and how GyunWoo remove it onebyone instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime  It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now.  It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep.  And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when GyunWoo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant.  A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her.  This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you I met his mother OFTEN she wanted to introduce a nice men to me BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time.  Also it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce GyunWoo to her when GyunWoo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell GyunWoo all this right away.  And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year.  However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important he makes her know that GyunWoo is still very much in love with her.  Time means nothing to him just for her NB. This is what the theme song aboutThe girl called GyunWoo's phone but the number has been changed.  She cried. Wondered if they ever met again when she is ready for him now after 3 years.  Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again.  Then she smiled.  But why she smiles?  Maybe she has just remembered how GyunWoo pretended the voice message long time ago?  Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly?  The tiny touches let audience imagines and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance?  Very often fate only give you 1 chance.  Once you lose it you lose it.  GyunWoo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said 'I think I met a man from the future from your GyunWoo's future.'  Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps GyunWoo or everyone else?  But this time she meant instead of the girl coming from future it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles.  Many subplots.. The Platform plot  After the 10 rules GyunWoo stands on the verge of subway platform as seen on the surveillance camera. Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time?  He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met.  Then He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie when she stands on the platform edge again we only saw her feet.  But what's really on her mind?  Is she expecting GyunWoo will pull her back again this time?  Now they have lost contact will coincidence let them meet again?  Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet?  Nevertheless the subway come she has to reluctantly drag her feet back behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate.  This is the place she is going to suicide where they met where they miss each other where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot  At the girl's third script she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie UFO  time machine.  Then she prophesize GyunWoo will like to travel back in time the oldaged GyunWoo.  She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together?  Did the girl left GyunWoodied before the invention of time machine?  Well this is a story not being told. However it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule.  How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule she feels that GyunWoo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree?  Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her?  Yet the old man's answer is honest enough because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old GyunWoo.  And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? GyunWoo cannot really replace a tree.  But with the help of the old GyunWoo he can. This is a secret because the old GyunWoo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading GyunWoo's letter a UFO passes by even with sound effect.The old GyunWoo was there inside the train when they met.At the end she said 'I think I met a man from the future from your GyunWoo's future'.  This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script  For the 2nd time I see this movie I cannot fully grasp this script.  But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met.  She know she get drunk easily it easier to do it that way.  She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death.  This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive which simply meant lovers should better die together.  Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform?  It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy at least at the beginning. The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide.  But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone.  We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action.  But naturally she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway!  The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived.  But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with GyunWoo she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her.  He have no choice he have to leave her.  For her to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date or any other guy but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is Fate vs. Coincidence  Tons of coincidence happened here GyunWoo is a lookalike know the exbf's mother is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same Blind date at the same night the handkerchief which is the first favor of both her exbf and GyunWoo give is greenish they both first met in subway they have meet all of the 5 twins without them recognizing....At the end of movie GyunWoo asked 'Is that coincidence?'  This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence.  Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one builddesire of it.  He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie while let both characters work hard forbuild up their good ending which many people will regard that as fate.Examples of building chances The old GyunWoo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young GyunWoo's effort.  And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own by making themselves available for each other.  If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle there is no point of meeting again.  And now GynWoo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved?  GyunWoo and the girl met on the 1st year of his death anivesary.  And the girl actually thinks her exbf want to introduce GyunWoo to her.  Maybe a supernatural plot is included here too!  Have her exbf arranged their final meeting by his mom etc?  Even GyunWoo does not considered himself look like his cousin but the girl her exbf his mom doesBy the director's definition it is their fate to be together eventually.".

	onyx:emotionText "The attention to detail the depth and width of the plot is amazing.  The movie is so good that it provide good entertainment to many audience.I cannot grasp all of it till I saw it the second time.  There are several plots in the movie.  I am learning more about the movie when I am writing this.It's NOT only a love story of how 2 people with contrasting personality fall in love it may give that impression to some people.  It's NOT a normal dumb boy chase beautiful girl flick.STOP READING and see the movie again if you really think this movie is just a romantic flick with funny jokes.  You will enjoy it more.SUPER SPOILER The Character The girl always think she is special she say that explicitly when she is crying at the hillside and which beautiful girl doesn't? Or at least everyone else wish to?   She is very selfcentered proud witty remember how quick she get GyunWoo out of class? talented kendo piano squash dance not afraid of how people look at her live in a quite well off family etc.The director has to stress that GyunWoo is smart from their parents because viewer may not really notice that if they don't really observe.  He is a sensitive person probably due to his girlish upbringing.GyunWoo is quite layback and yet to determine what he desire or want in life in the beginning.  And that's one of the reason the girl said 'I have met the boy from the future' at the ending.  For the first 3 years they meet they are not really ready for each other due her exboyfriend exbf and personality.  They are at the crossroad so they eventually have to split.The Story In the subway GyunWoo gets the girl's attention immediately since he looks like her exboyfriend.  She may actually intentionally grasp his attention by vomiting etc.  Then she announces to the public right away that he is her 'Sweet heart' so he have no option but to take care of her.  As a proof of GyunWoo getting her attention is that she scold at the youngster who wears pink.  She thinks he is special and no one else should wear the same color for the one she thinks special.  This point can verified again in the park which the guy who smokes and wear the same bluecolored sweater. She knows she is beautiful and clothing matter a lot for her or those she cares.It is quite deceiving that most viewer will initially think that only GyunWoo is attracted by the girl and a normal boy chase girl story starts. But it's not.  They both are attracted to each other at their first sight.To call GyunWoo 'sweet heart' may come from her subconscious.  It is so important to her to understand herself that she need to confirm with GyunWoo that she indeed think GyunWoo has so much resemblance with her exbf.  So she phoned GyunWoo to come out for the 1st time.  Phone number probably obtained during their stay at the police stationAfter GyunWoo left the girl on a bench he forget the girl's handbag and he have to return it a few steps later.   Later he forget her handbag again in the rain. This time leads him to visit the girl's home for the first time. We can see that every detail is well layout intentional in this movie.First time I see the movie I was distracted by my laughing but now I know the reason why police rush up to the motel.  The phone call is made by the girl's parent.  That's one of the reasons why her parents' are not approved of him.  And they know it's all lie when he try explaining why the motel's lighter is in his pocket.Is there any meaning for the kids to all suddenly gone when they are in the coffees shop?  And why does the coffee come so late? Why does the girl slap GyunWoo so often? Is there any meaning behind?The Girl always tries to be different.  She doesn't like people dress alike she doesn't like those people ordering the same golbangee beef stew in the restaurant.Why are they using the same motel room the second night? On the first night the innkeeper says there no room left from 1st to 3rd floor so on the second night the same thing happened coincidentally all other rooms are occupied.Do your recognize in her first script GyunWoo asks why don't they kiss at the end?  He is actually talking about why they do not kiss in this movie. Then the girl director says that this script movie is not a melodrama. Then how come this movie is a action movie?Also the first script prophesize the girl saving GyunWoo in the playground later.For the second script I will talk about that later.The reason why she pushes GyunWoo into the water is she wants GyunWoo in the water too. She wants GyunWoo in some way connected to her exbf too. Her exbf drowned implied when the girl staring at a pier with the exbf's mother later.  Assuming that she don't know whether GyunWoo can swim or not the girl is confident that she can rescue him OR she hope this boy will not just leave her by a simple drowning accident.  The story did not tell how her exbf drowned whether the girl is present or not.  But if the girl was at the scene at the accident that means she have learnt lifegaurding after he died which I biasedly assume.  Nevertheless the girl found peace of mindsatisfaction that she knows if she is together with any boy the boy will not be drowned.  She wants to try and confirm that with this boy.In the playground's 'Ghost House' the girl say the pain one suffered from being dumped will be gone quicker than one can imagine.  But it looks like it is contrary to her own behavior.  So why she said that?  Actually the girl is not just grieving for the death of her exbf at this stage. She is also guilty angry with herself on not loving her exbf as much any more. Or at least she is struggling with try keep loving him or kicks him out of her mindpresent life.  Rationally she knows this is the thing to do to face it to leave away from the ghost of his exbf.  However she is not as 'special' as she would like that she still long for him since she is attracted to GyunWoo the first time they met.The soldier claimed the guardhouse sergeant looks like GyunWoo.  Who else look like GyunWoo?  He should be the exbf.  The director maybe even hinting that he is not that good to the Girl although the girl never know this.  Well I may be stretching that a bit here but considered so many detail in this movie have an explanation I won't be surprised if this is what the director meant.When the girl is saving GyunWoo under gunpoint she cried.  She is actually talking to herself this time.  She think that her dead exbf want her to live well.  She says if she needs to learn what love is she need to live well.  To live well love is essential but this is what a dead man cannot give her.  This is her struggle.At the end of the playground scene GyunWoo say what had happened is as if what he have planned.  He intends to understand the girl better at her birthday. At this stage all he know is the girl is devastated from a breakup but not much else. Under such a stressful circumstances the answer she give on how she view about her pain view of good lifelove must be authentic.  It's something hard to achieve by a normal date on this girl. Although the means is not what he expected the ends is.    And the last slap on his face is always good.  It means she cares.Part 2 GyunWoo noticed somehow notice the girl in the restaurant.  Then GyunWoo goes back alone and asks around about this picture because GyunWoo will not ask that when the girl is around. GyunWoo want to understand her pain try solving it.  The girl bring GyunWoo there a lot.  By now GyunWoo is really a replacement for his exbf and he knows. He tries to be nice and smile.  And GyunWoo said that she pretends to be happy every time in this restaurant because he knows she has lots of memoryhistory with her exbf in this restaurant.  And she comes back with him often.Not too sure why the bad guy in the 3rd script is called GyunWoo and why she have to kill him?  If the director really meant the bad guy  her exbf because they are lookalike and the director don't want to give a name to her exbf it means the girl try forget him.  And interestingly the girl comes from future so the director may think she can only forget him some time in future?After the script she says 'Someday I'll meet someone from the future'. Actually it means 'Today she meet someone important to her GyunWoo that will be suitable for her in the future'.   Then GyunWoo says 'if you do ask him to take you if it's possible!'  GyunWoo is urging her to let himself to take her!   GyunWoo looks very serious at this moment.  This is not a joke of 'You sassy girl let someone come from a UFOfuture kidnap you!'After the 3rd script they always ride subway together play squash phone each other every night and wait for GyunWoo at school etc.  The girl really starts to love him ever since GyunWoo chase her on high heel.  The longer he runs the longer she loves him.  She remains jubilant that night. Even in the rain  she is even nice enough to him to run back home for an umbrella.  Each day she likes GyunWoo more and more.Their parent controls her too much. Party because she love them too she refrain herself from seeing GyunWoohave to dealt directly with her parents about this.  So GyunWoo doesn't have any news from her for a long time until their 100th day when their parent give her pressure.In the taxi GyunWoo wonders if she still needs him as her exbf's replacement.  He tries to heal her pain but he thinks the irony is that once the pain is gone she no longer needs him.  He is well aware that the 'action''power' is always initiated from her.  But just for this moment it does not matter he enjoys every moment with her.  He ask the taxi driver to let them stay together longer.Maybe what GyunWoo think is correct she doesn't need him anymore. That's why once her parent again pressured her this time they don't meet each other for such a long time that GyunWoo think they are over.  So it's not too surprising for GyunWoo to go to a blind date.The condom and blind date joke is really funny though gross.This time the girl has a blind date.  She definitely is not the one who arrange it her controlling parents do.  She call GyunWoo for help GyunWoo is her 'friend'.  She has to call and give GyunWoo a chance here since this time her blind date is quite nice.Ah... the 10 rules are very moving.  GyunWoo must be very sad when he left the restaurant.  He gives up on her.  He is giving his final blessing to them.The girl finally realizes that she did not recognize how deep he loves her. He deserve much more than a replacement or 'friend'. Everything she did want GyunWoo do for her is simply the way she try to find her exbf in GyunWoo. GyunWoo is not necessary GyunWoo in her mind at those important moments. She thought she just enjoy reliving it.  But after the 10 rules she can no longer deny GyunWoo is the one who makes her happy not the ghosts of her exbf.Before they try kissing GyunWoo said they are on a crossroad since she had always regarded GyunWoo as painkiller.  But now she knows that she feel guilty for him and it's time for her to take action to accept GyunWoo as 'another' important person in her life.  GyunWoo has already done all he can at this stage.But for the Girl to look at GyunWoo is painful.  He reminds her of his exbf every time.  They look and seem to act alike.  She has to completely remove her exbf first love I believe's image before she can really love GyunWoo.  But she feels guilty to try removing her exbf from her mind at the same time.When GyunWoo is writing the letter saying he want to be serious with her. But even though he doesn't know exactly what she's thinking he is sensitive enough to think this letter is for their split up.At the mountain she express that her exbf is still very well within her. She hopes she is different she hope she have the will to overcome but no she is still helpless.  She cannot avoid thinking of her exbf when seeing GyunWoo.  She is sorry for that.They have to split GyunWoo's presence is too disturbing for her to forget. She gives herself 2 years.  She goes away for GyunWoo.  GyunWoo tries to grow up and his life in these 2 years just devoted to her he even tried and succeeds fulfilling her dream. No more blind dates he is committed.The way they pile up the stones and how GyunWoo remove it onebyone instead of bushing them away is quite a display sensitivenessOvertime  It's quite too late to explain clearly the drowning of her exbf now.  It makes lots of audience miss why her grievance is so deep.  And may not understand some finer points of the movie.Now we know why the girl ask about the handkerchief when GyunWoo is with the girl was crying at the 2nd restaurant.  A handkerchief has a very special meaning for her.  This was how her exbf meet her.She says 'While I was dating you I met his mother OFTEN she wanted to introduce a nice men to me BUT I couldn't' Simply means she is still love her exbf very much at that time.  Also it's quite funny that she thinks her exbf wants to introduce GyunWoo to her when GyunWoo is hanging out with her.She wants to put this letter into a time capsule because it is too cruel so tell GyunWoo all this right away.  And she does believe she will overcome her mental barrier in 2 year.  However she cannot. It takes her 3 years.What the old man says to her is important he makes her know that GyunWoo is still very much in love with her.  Time means nothing to him just for her NB. This is what the theme song aboutThe girl called GyunWoo's phone but the number has been changed.  She cried. Wondered if they ever met again when she is ready for him now after 3 years.  Not too sure if they'd ever meet by chance again.  Then she smiled.  But why she smiles?  Maybe she has just remembered how GyunWoo pretended the voice message long time ago?  Or have her just lost hope and grin bitterly?  The tiny touches let audience imagines and could as well be the ending at this point.Can they meet by chance?  Very often fate only give you 1 chance.  Once you lose it you lose it.  GyunWoo must be very upset when he misses her this time in the subway.Maybe due to coincidence they finally met each other at her exbf's mom's lunch.Then she said 'I think I met a man from the future from your GyunWoo's future.'  Do you recall all 1st and 3d script tells a story of girl coming from future helps GyunWoo or everyone else?  But this time she meant instead of the girl coming from future it is the boy coming from future that saves her.The best part of the movie is that it can be viewed from many angles.  Many subplots.. The Platform plot  After the 10 rules GyunWoo stands on the verge of subway platform as seen on the surveillance camera. Is he trying to feel her pain of the breakup that she experienced with her exbf when she stood there? Was she really trying to kill herself at that time?  He wants to understand this feeling. Or simply just want to remember how they first met.  Then He must be really happily running when he hear her voice form the broadcast.At the end of movie when she stands on the platform edge again we only saw her feet.  But what's really on her mind?  Is she expecting GyunWoo will pull her back again this time?  Now they have lost contact will coincidence let them meet again?  Or is she simply enjoying the thought of how they first meet?  Nevertheless the subway come she has to reluctantly drag her feet back behind the yellow line.The edge of the platform is a crossroad of their fate.  This is the place she is going to suicide where they met where they miss each other where travel together and getting to like each other etc.The Science Fiction Plot  At the girl's third script she mentioned explicitly the science fiction Plot of this movie UFO  time machine.  Then she prophesize GyunWoo will like to travel back in time the oldaged GyunWoo.  She said 'people from the future could be here now'Why don't they travel together?  Did the girl left GyunWoodied before the invention of time machine?  Well this is a story not being told. However it is hinted that it's quite likely that the girl go back and make fun of him with the toad in the time capsule.  How about the head hitting squash? Another naughty joke from future?In her letter in the time capsule she feels that GyunWoo 'live in the future' and she 'live in the past'From the look of the old man under the tree do you think he is expecting her to visit the tree?  Don't you think it's quite rude for him to stare at her?  Yet the old man's answer is honest enough because she is beautiful. The old man always says that because he is the old GyunWoo.  And of course he read the letters.What is his secret of the tree? GyunWoo cannot really replace a tree.  But with the help of the old GyunWoo he can. This is a secret because the old GyunWoo only wants to share this between him and her! No one else! He say 'Fate is building a bridge of chance for someone you love' because he is help building this bridge for themselves.When she lookup after reading GyunWoo's letter a UFO passes by even with sound effect.The old GyunWoo was there inside the train when they met.At the end she said 'I think I met a man from the future from your GyunWoo's future'.  This is literally what has happened.The Girl's second script  For the 2nd time I see this movie I cannot fully grasp this script.  But now I can. Actually the girl is committing suicide when they first met.  She know she get drunk easily it easier to do it that way.  She wants to die at the 1st year anniversary of her exbf's death.  This is why in her 2nd script the 'unlucky' boy should be buried alive which simply meant lovers should better die together.  Do you think that the girl looks more like a ghost than a drunken woman at the platform?  It's quite a drastic look for lead actress in movie that supposed to be a comedy at least at the beginning. The vomit after that is very good. It makes the audience forget her awful look or forget to wonder if she is commiting suicide.  But isn't that quite crazy for anyone to vomit onto someone.  We all know that she is drunk but is still quite aware of her action.  But naturally she doesn't really care since she planned to kill herself anyway!  The girl is not as sassy as most people perceived.  But she's pretty unruly anyway.When dating with GyunWoo she always has to struggle with her guilt to her exbf since her exbf have done nothing wrong to her.  He have no choice he have to leave her.  For her to accept a person that is in many ways resembles her exbf as another individual is a especially difficult task. Her life can be much easier if she choose that nice guy at her blind date or any other guy but she knows Gyun Woo is her right choice however difficult this choice is.The Theme of the story is Fate vs. Coincidence  Tons of coincidence happened here GyunWoo is a lookalike know the exbf's mother is that coincidence? How coincidence is that the one girl you pick randomly on the street is the Girl? The birthday of the Girl and the soldier is the same Blind date at the same night the handkerchief which is the first favor of both her exbf and GyunWoo give is greenish they both first met in subway they have meet all of the 5 twins without them recognizing....At the end of movie GyunWoo asked 'Is that coincidence?'  This is the question the director is asking the audience what is fate and what is pure coincidence.  Director's view of Fate is it happens only when one builddesire of it.  He demonstrate that by putting lots of coincidence in the movie while let both characters work hard forbuild up their good ending which many people will regard that as fate.Examples of building chances The old GyunWoo is help building his own fate under the tree by voicing the young GyunWoo's effort.  And during the 3 years separation they are building a bridge for each other on their own by making themselves available for each other.  If the girl still cannot get out of her exbf's entangle there is no point of meeting again.  And now GynWoo seems to find a direction of his life on writing script.Lastly have her exbf also bridge a bridge for the one he loved?  GyunWoo and the girl met on the 1st year of his death anivesary.  And the girl actually thinks her exbf want to introduce GyunWoo to her.  Maybe a supernatural plot is included here too!  Have her exbf arranged their final meeting by his mom etc?  Even GyunWoo does not considered himself look like his cousin but the girl her exbf his mom doesBy the director's definition it is their fate to be together eventually.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can say nothing short of a classic about this movie. My friend recommended this movie who said it was pretty cute. I never really saw a Korean movie but I was interested. I was hooked form the start with the unique style of story telling. I have to admit it that I hate the voices especially the girl. But after half an hour I just forgot it and just sank into this wonderful story.The first half is full of funny scenesespecially the abortion lie.I would just hate the girl for giving the poor sensitive hero a hard time. Throughout there are subtle hints about her complex character. Both the actors have done exceptionally well but the main attraction is the plot.The soldier in the park scene was a little unnecessaryalthough I think it helps unravel the girl's strange character. From the second half onwards I start to understand more about the girl and by the end I just loved her amazing spirit. The story unfolds the reasons for her bossy behaviour. At the same time the relationship between them matures. The train scene with the line on the floor was really funny. Towards the end the scenes moves towards pure melodrama  and its been done really nice. The hill top scene was heartbreaking and the ten rules was beautiful. I liked the train scene which was funny and moving at the same time. The overtime ties back any broken threads in the story and the sad story of her life is finally revealed.The ending in my opinion was one of the best ever which makes you go over the whole movie in your head at that instant. A few pointers of the style of Serendipity. The Hero is funny and nicely portrays the innocent and kind hearted GweonWoo. The beautiful Jihyun Jun as the bossy Iamsospecial girl is a nice choice.The main thing I like is that it is not an American romance type movie. I don't really like the American type romance which is focused around sex and complex issues.Though Titanic and You have got mail are my favourites. The background score was also top notch. Especially I believe. The only criticism that can be made is that some of the jokes were vulgar. Otherwise it would be a great family movie. I feel kind of embarrassed watching this in front of my family.A few things which was peculiar about this movie were 1. The girl's name is never mentioned 2. They never kiss On the whole I cannot rate it below 10 by any means. A mustsee for any one who loves Romantic movies and every one else TOO!!".

	schema:reviewBody "'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' a.k.a. 'My Sassy Girl' is one of the most unconventional love stories I have witnessed in recent cinema. The storytelling is of the most sincere. There's no pretension. The comedy drama and romance are very well balanced. There is no sex not even a kiss no one says 'I love you' and yet it turns out to be one of the most 'romantic' cinematic experience.'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' moves at a smooth pace. Jaeyoung Kwak's screenplay and direction are fantastic. The dialogues are smart and the characters are richly developed and unique. The female protagonist's character remains enigmatic right until the end. Her name isn't even mentioned during the entire film. We see everything from Gyunwoo's point of view and Jaeyoung Kwak gives detailed insight of the characters and their relationships. There are so many beautiful moments in the film but I won't give out any spoilers. In addition with the use of a lovely gentle soundtrack and cinematography he beautifully demonstrates the wonderful locations. Even though I loved the way the Korean culture was portrayed the story is pretty universal.Newcomer Taehyun Cha leads the entire film. His performance is completely natural that it doesn't even feel that he was acting let alone the fact that he was only new to films. His expressions spontaneity reactions and chemistry with costars are spot on. He is superb with the comedy and subtle in the dramatic scenes. Gianna Jun holds her own and does a fine job.Overall 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' is a very well crafted film. It's a heartwarming poetic romantic adventure from start to finish. I know this sounds a bit corny but I'll say that it's a film that's close to my heart.".

His expressions spontaneity reactions and chemistry with costars are spot on. He is superb with the comedy and subtle in the dramatic scenes. Gianna Jun holds her own and does a fine job.Overall 'Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo' is a very well crafted film. It's a heartwarming poetic romantic adventure from start to finish. I know this sounds a bit corny but I'll say that it's a film that's close to my heart.";

From the look of the DVD cover I knew this was something I would not enjoy the picture projected a film made of teen pop Hollywood garbage.I reluctantly agreed to watch it for a while but I became interested after about 15 minutes. The first half I thought was pretty good until I realized there was still a second half to this. The second half seemed to drag on and I was praying for it to end. The overtime made me frustrated because I thought this was becoming less of a movie and more of a TV series in terms of length. And than it was over and I realized what an amazing film this was.To keep this short I will tell you that I have directly forced about one hundred people to watch this film. The largest group I forced to watch My sassy girl occurred during two canceled lectures students were sitting there bored so I popped this in. The class was made up of different socialracialgenderwhatever cross sections. Everyone watched the first half and they showed up and stayed for the final half the following week some people even came up to tell me how much they liked it. Only 2 people have given bad responses one person because he did not finish watching it and the other because she doesn't like watching a film with subtitles.From the rating for this movie it is clear that there are people who hate this film but if you belong to the other 85 of the population than you will love it.Why did I like this movie? It was a mystery movie with clues throughout. They made an entire movie with basically two characters. There was no pointless tacked on sex not even a kiss.Watch the Directors Cut if you can. The movie was actually more enjoyable the second time around. 1010".

However the main character the Sassy Girl is so scared of falling in love again that she never lets any cheesy romantic moment between her and her boyfriendgood friend also for you.. so guys come on sit down and watch and enjoy it. A small reminder it is a Korean movie and I watched it with English subtitles.The story is about a guy in Korea who is forced to visit her aunt whom he does not like to visit much and ends up meeting a drunk girl in the subway whom he carries to a motel room because she is drunk as a skunk and vomits everywhere. well he tries to look the other way but feels sorry for her. however as it is often said no good deed goes unpunished and he finds himself even in jail because of her and quite often if i may add. but then again when she is not drunk she is a funny and thoughlooking girl with so much sorrow inside that he can not help bearing whatever she brings to his life.Towards the end of the movie the characters and their past and future are explored in more details without loosing anything from the funny style. Both lead actor and the actress are good but I think the guy is a little bit better. I loved his reactions especially during squash games. Not to mention the times he was beaten by his mom well eastern society rules I guess   What about the midnight visit to the fair ground part? Funny..Very nice very funny very emotional movie. I think this may be a great Valentine Day movie..Definitely makes you think about destiny if there is one. I like the definition of destiny in this movie too.".

So I finally decided to see it this morning and it won me instantly. I am not a keen fan for romantic comedies though I do enjoy films like Sleepless in Seattle You've Got Mail etc. This film should fall in the same category. The lead roles are brilliant. The girl of the film you might not like her at start but as the film goes along she just turns more and more beautiful as you get to know her and her past. The boy on the other hand is likeable from the word go not the handsome type but quite funny. The comedy is enjoyable and provides some good laughs but as the film develops into the second hour it just turns so romantic. Of course everybody knows the boy and girl will get together in the end but the process is really tormenting. This might not be a great film but it's truly romantic and great fun to watch. 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Witty Iluminating and Memorable !";
	schema:reviewBody "From out of the blue. Loosely based on a real life experience enclosed from a novel. An atypical restless teenager by the name of Kyunwoo finds himself in a quasi predicament. The other protagonist universally known as The Girl plays a crucial role into elevating the story character development and the emotional essence which nurtures the plot.My Sassy Girl centres the life of Kyunwoo who meets a sloshed girl where he decides to take custody of her own safety. This is not what you would call an everyday life situation. You're given the consequences when Kyunwoo has the opportunity to either dump or save the girl from a sentient disaster. Just where do you go from here? This is the exciting memento as the subtle comedy elements come into play. How far are you willing to go watch someone be victimized and henpecked through mud and mud? The juxtaposition of both characters personality is relentlessly aided by the natural occurrences in the movie.As a narrative the film is split into three periods indicated by funky animated texts. From parts 1 to 2 with overtime as the finishing climax. The first part introduces the film where we encounter the two as peculiar strangers who attempt to grow accustomed to the situation from their prima facie confrontment. The acting portrayed by the female lead is astounding in terms of bitchiness and refined appearance. It makes you wonder why does Kyunwoo bother to put up with such malice. Her role primarily serves as a foil to counteract Kyunwoos methodical dimwitted lazy behaviour. But that doesn't go to say that he's a hopeless pushover. He too has something to live up for despite his inferior control over the relationship.By the half way point we find ourselves experiencing more lovable fun and comedy for our taste buds. An example thats extraordinarily achieved is where Kyunwoo takes the girl out for a date where he compromises to exchange each others current shoe wear an ironic act to walking with the girls highheels. The provocative sparkling humour of mercifulness and innocence instantly brought tears to my eyes.The film's score also contains a brilliant load of harmony and pleasure. A few tracks are frequently recycled to induce that comedic feel of Kyunwoothe girl's life as a couple. In particular a piano piece thats excluded from the album renowned as Pachelbels Canon provides the most heartwarming notions to the film. As a token its not the idea of black and white where it's all about seeing an unlikely duo go on a blind date. The purpose is the sentimentalism of the film which shows how humans can understand one another by magnanimity and leniency. Thus building towards a bizarre yet mutual relationship.In a nutshell My Sassy Girl is highly recommendable and accessible to audiences who wish to seek a dramatic romcom with much to be desired. It's the unorthodox concept on the characters and plot that combine to create such a fine looking storyline that endorses two lovers to change from who they are at the start and to have high hopes for the future.You may without a doubt have insatiated cravings for love in moments to come in your lifetime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Kim KidukPieta is director Kim Kiduk's eighteenth movie. When this fact appeared on the screen a spontaneous applause erupted. Hugely underappreciated at home Kim Kiduk is wellknown beyond the borders of his country SouthKorea. He does not conform to any rules doesn't avoid sensitive subjects and shows the harshness of life without any scruples political humanistic and in a very physical confronting approach. It is true that his films are usually not an easy watch they certainly do not conform to idea that film equals entertainment. The free thinking soul will see that Kim Kiduk's movies are not made to shock the audience just for the sake of it but to show the thoughts of a brave artist who exhibits a rare vulnerability and a frightening honesty in his approach to his subjects.Actress Cho Minsoo who portrays the character Mison in the movie declares during the press conference His films are eyes to reality. Apparently she and Lee JungJin who brilliantly plays main character GangDo barely knew who Kim Kiduk was when they were asked to play the parts. They tell the press that during the process of making the movie they learned to act in a completely different way.Made with a budget that is just a fraction of Korean film budgets these days outsider Pieta entices the jury and the public and makes a far more lasting impression than other more obvious candidates like To the WonderAt any price and Fill the void. Even though malicious rumors say that the jury wanted to award The Master all the big prizes Kim's film is rightfully the recipient of the Golden Lion. Accepting the prize Kim thanked the actors staff film festival officials and Italian fans before bursting into a traditional Korean song.The story of the film is about lone wolf selfabsorbed masturbating crazy moralless man who lends money to desperate workers of the industrial slum of Cheonggyecheon. He charges ten times the borrowed sum in interest. If his clients don't pay up Gangdo cripples them taking the insurance payments on their injuries to make up for the difference. His character is a metaphor for extreme capitalism. Kim commented ...but not the money itself you can change the face of money. Money is the third character.Then a women shows up at his doorstep claiming to be the mother who abandoned him as a baby. He tests her in some gruesome ways before he acknowledges her presence and even begins to show signs of affection towards her. Mison also proves herself to him by being just as ruthless as him. They form a frightful but also strangely intriguing duo. The grim story finds some more breathing space for the audience towards the end but a bitter aftertaste remains.What makes Kim Kiduk an excellent storyteller is that most of the graphic cruelty is not shown but actually takes place in the viewer's imagination. He is able to show real life images that can represent abstract ideas. He can make an audience relate to his characters even though they are immoral and almost heartless human beings doing this with so much ease is remarkable. It is a rare quality to be able to find beauty in the most harsh places and to somehow convey this strange beauty to the screen. To make you believe in the story without realizing it is perhaps an absurd one. And maybe most important to make the viewer emotionally gripped while talking about universal human issues emotions and ideas even though there are cultural differences that separate audience and filmmaker. Kim Kiduk Pieta is an embrace to the whole of humanity. The movie is dedicated to humankind.".

In my opinion elaborate scenarios or experienced actorsactresses are not prerequisite for Kim's movies. His movies are like abstract paintings or poems. They are not supposed to be realistic and are essentially vague in meaning. Do not expect his movies to be kind to give enough explanations. You should find their meaning with your own imagination. At the expense of being confused and tortured with puzzling metaphors you could reach the land of poetic beauty and religious purification. This moment of transcendence is what I expect from art any kind including movie.".

But after the credits rolled I did not expect it to be better than 3Iron or Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring but Pieta has really a breathtaking very strong and solid storyline about how love money and revenge can affect people and push them to their extreme limits. Kang Do and the woman who is claiming to be his mother had a very close and also the worst and morally twisting situations while they were together. The main actors did a great job in showing the different layers of their characters and portrayed effectively how anger fear love can destroy and shatter their souls.Overall as a Kim Ki Duk follower Pieta is his best work to date and possibly the one that can pull more audiences just like Lars Von Trier to Melancholia. Pieta is a very provocative and moving film that will make its audience uneasy but will make them rethink about the value of relationship love or even money.".

The latest from South Korean arthouse provocateur Kim Ki Duk 3Iron The Isle this unnerving revenge drama wowed last year's Venice Film Festival jury so much that it went on to beat Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master to the coveted Golden Lion award. Is it a better film than that aptly titled PTA project? Absolutely not. Is Pieta a gritty harrowing and wholly engrossing exercise in cinematic tolerance? You're damn right it is.Li JungJin stars as KangDo the merciless henchman to a crooked Seoul loan shark. Living in a threadbare apartment with a diet consisting of halfcooked meat he scuttles across the city ruffling up people's feathers and making sure they pay up their debts or else suffer the brutal consequences. His lonesome pitiful existence is transformed by the arrival of MiSun Jo MinSoo an elderly woman claiming to be his estranged mother. Seeking repentance and the love of the inhumane monster she birthed and abandoned the disbelieving KangDo puts her through a slew of horrific tests that will prove their bloodline from eating dismembered body parts to unsolicited incest. Boundaries are crossed taboos busted open and a repugnant relationship ensues.Despite the industrial slum setting and the subtext of toothlimbless capitalism Pieta conforms to a typical Greek tragedy plot line. With each revelation more traumatic and sickening than the last Kim tells the story with brute emotional force and savagery without ever resorting to the ultraviolence made so common in South Korean cinema from the likes of Park ChanWook and The Vengeance Trilogy. While Jo YoungJik's curious handheld cinematography may look away from the most distressing of graphic acts the pain lingers on the screen through Li and Jo's fantastic expressionistic acting. The pair have a terse inflammatory chemistry which is so enthralling that the motherson relationship is all the more sickening.Perhaps the film's success in Europe isn't all that surprising. Tackling the cruel storyline through emotional heft  without the archetypal glossy production values of the region  Pieta could be mistaken for a Lars von Trier or Gaspar No project. With a sublime first act Kim gets lost in the knotty narrative he has laid out before him and ties everything up in a stirring denouement that brings some genuine heart to the otherwise pitiful portrait of dogeatdog Seoul cityliving.In that brilliant opening third MiSun turns to KangDo to denounce money as the 'beginning and the end of all things love honour violence fury hatred jealousy revenge death.' Unsavoury topics abound Kim KiDuk combats them all with severe conviction in Pieta. If you can stomach such callousness then this is diatribe is well worth a watch.Review originally posted at The Frame Loop. Visit www.theframeloop.com ".

It was too strong! in the beginning but as the story goes into climax it was much easier to watch. The movie shows that gangsters are human beings after all. Love can change anything and in this movie parental love changes a man forever. I just want to know whether the director's films are accepted in Korea. Do Korean's feel their society is like this one depicted? His movies are philosophical and this one is no exception.".

Love can change anything and in this movie parental love changes a man forever. I just want to know whether the director's films are accepted in Korea. Do Korean's feel their society is like this one depicted? His movies are philosophical and this one is no exception.";

So why the hell did he make this movie like this? Let's admit it's definitely a Kim Ki duk story no doubt but everything else seems like an amateur work. The DOP is extremely weak. All of he's films were like a perfect interaction of images and this one is bad in shots and in the edition of the shots  the so called perfection that he seeks in the other movies all the symbolism all the perfect actors  where is all this? For me the scene where the man want to cut his hand to give money to his son could me the ultimate beauty scene but then the actor seemed to take this things so light like it's only my hand and after that he asks for the second one. At that time it turned ridiculous instead of beautiful. And this was the first time that i saw a bad scene in one of Kim Ki duk's film. Don't get me wrong but Kim Ki duk could win in Venice with any movie but not this one.".

Unfortunately in my humble opinion he earned it with the wrong film. Piet is shallow weak the cinematography is awful and annoyed me a lot. This film tries hard being something new compared to the previous production of Kim Kiduk but misses unbelievably the spot. It's predictable prosaic and it owns Park Chanwook too much without being able to reach his poetic peaks the squalor the violence are faked and almost for their own sake. The major twist is clear from the beginning and the entire script could have been handled in a better way. Jeongjin Lee Gangdo had one facial expression all film long he looked like someone injected him with botox few minutes before the shoot. Minso Jo struggled to make some efforts but unfortunately the Italian dubbing killed her performance for good by the way dubbing is going to kill me too. This film is overrated plagiarized and also boring. Don't waste your time  choose to watch and prepare yourself to love instead one of the great works of Master Kim such as 3IRON The Bow or the Samaritan.".

Even if his poor debtors really have no money to pay back he gets the money back by any ruthless means necessary. These unfortunate debtors usually work at the metal shops located on the narrow alleys of Seoul so they are forced to get their hands or feet injured by their machines for paying him back through the insurance money they will acquire. During one comic but cringeinducing moment one debtor nervously asks him to cut both of his hands instead of only one hand because he needs more money to pay his debts and support his baby to be born.Kangdo's life is as barren as his debtors'. While his home looks a little more comfortable he has lived alone in his apartment. He cooks for himself and he usually brings live animals to his home for his dinner. To represent his beastly nature he prefers to buy a live chicken and then butcher it instead of just purchasing a dead one. On one day his life is disrupted by the sudden appearance of one mysterious womanCho Minsoo who claims to be his mother and apologizes to him for abandoning him not so long after he was born. Resentful toward his mother he does not remember he does not believe any of her words and brusquely rejects her but she keeps coming to him. She slowly insinuates herself into his daily life while behaving like a mother who tries to compensate for her unforgivable fault in the past. Though he harshly treats her she sticks to him while doing what mothers usually do for their dear sons. She cooks for him and she says genially to this detestable man who has probably never experienced love or kindness for a long time.There is quite a disturbing scene where Kangdo cruelly attempts to violate her with his own twisted logic and you may wonder how much she can tolerate him if she is indeed who she seems to be. Induced by her love without condition Kangdo slowly reveals a vulnerable child with lots of hurts inside him he eventually finds himself depending on her care and they momentarily have a nice time together as a mother and her son.The tension in the drama largely depends on the simple but fearless performance by Cho Minsoo who deftly maintains the elusive side of her character even at the most emotionally anguished moment. Their characters may look silly when they behave like a mother and her little son but we come to accept the emotional bond forming between them.And later scenes become very intense and heart touching. Overall I do not think it is one of his best films because of its several flaws but I must say it is nice to see that this talented director is still capable of making a movie with conviction power and several interesting things to talk about.".

The glacial Lee Jeongjin gives an icy turn as a truly horrible creation but inevitably he thaws a little once you get to know him and once the plot kicks in. This is a revenge story but one done in a way that's both subtle and convoluted it's a film that rewards close attention else you won't have a clue what's going on.Jo Minsoo bags the film's most interesting role of the longlost mother who turns up seeking reconciliation. It's a difficult unsympathetic part to play and there are one or two sexual situations which go way beyond the realms of bad taste into some of the most disgusting things I've ever seen. As ever though PIETA isn't really an explicit film despite the sheer quantity of violent incidents that happen during the running time and as a story it gets more and more engrossing as it goes on. The end is particularly profound and the lush cinematography on a tiny budget makes this a beautiful film to watch despite the depravity.".

The characters of Pieta are no exception we do not know a lot about them but what happens between them is a darkly compelling drama. There is quite a disturbing scene where Kangdo cruelly attempts to violate her with his own twisted logic and you may wonder how much she can tolerate him if she is indeed who she seems to be. Induced by her love without condition Kangdo slowly reveals a vulnerable child with lots of hurts inside him he eventually finds himself depending on her care and they momentarily have a nice time together as a mother and her son.Is she really his mother? I don't dare to tell anything about that matter for not spoiling your entertainment but let's say that I did not lose my interest while the movie changed its direction in the middle of the story for the reason you may easily guess in advance. Its second half is less engaging and less focused because of that but the directorwriter Kim Kiduk provides a very realistic background for his relatively unrealistic story and the gray destitute underbelly of Seoul is vividly conveyed to us through its shabby metal shops and dirty alleys. His films have been wellknown for their unflinching attitude to brutal violence but Pieta thankfully takes a restrained approach to its equally savage violence while retaining its emotional impact intact. When I watched gleefully overthetop violence in The Expendables2012 right before watching this movie I could have some chuckles but I discovered that there was nothing laughable about the frighteningly realistic violence in Pieta even when it does not present it on the screen.The tension in the drama largely depends on the simple but fearless performance by Cho Minsoo who deftly maintains the elusive side of her character even at the most emotionally anguished moment. You can feel the genuine emotions from her face but you can never be sure about where they come from. Although Lee Jeongjin feels strained and miscast compared to his coactress at least he supports her well during several tough scenes between them. Their characters may look silly when they behave like a mother and her little son but we come to accept the emotional bond forming between them.Although he recently went through a rough time Kim Kiduk remains as one of the most interesting South Korean directors along with Park Chan wook Bong Joonho and Hong Sangsoo. I have watched most of his works and I admired many of them while recognizing their disturbing side. The unforgettable scene involved with fish hooks in The Isle2000 still makes me flinch whenever I recall it and Bad Guy2002 was another disturbing relationship between a violent man and a woman who is suffered and degraded by him while stuck with him. After his best work Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring2003 his subsequent films became a little more gentle but they are still the movies tough to watch. I did not like his previous work Arirang2011 a self portrayal documentary which can be called his version of I'm Still Here2010 because I found it both painful and embarrassing to watch him on his supposedly bad days but I hoped everything would be soon all right for him.".

When I watched gleefully overthetop violence in The Expendables2012 right before watching this movie I could have some chuckles but I discovered that there was nothing laughable about the frighteningly realistic violence in Pieta even when it does not present it on the screen.The tension in the drama largely depends on the simple but fearless performance by Cho Minsoo who deftly maintains the elusive side of her character even at the most emotionally anguished moment. You can feel the genuine emotions from her face but you can never be sure about where they come from. Although Lee Jeongjin feels strained and miscast compared to his coactress at least he supports her well during several tough scenes between them. Their characters may look silly when they behave like a mother and her little son but we come to accept the emotional bond forming between them.Although he recently went through a rough time Kim Kiduk remains as one of the most interesting South Korean directors along with Park Chan wook Bong Joonho and Hong Sangsoo. I have watched most of his works and I admired many of them while recognizing their disturbing side. The unforgettable scene involved with fish hooks in The Isle2000 still makes me flinch whenever I recall it and Bad Guy2002 was another disturbing relationship between a violent man and a woman who is suffered and degraded by him while stuck with him. After his best work Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring2003 his subsequent films became a little more gentle but they are still the movies tough to watch. I did not like his previous work Arirang2011 a self portrayal documentary which can be called his version of I'm Still Here2010 because I found it both painful and embarrassing to watch him on his supposedly bad days but I hoped everything would be soon all right for him.";

	schema:reviewBody "A Kim Kiduk film is one that will always bring with it a bit of controversy upon its release if indeed it gets released at all. His films often border between the shocking the strange and the sublime taking the viewer through a range of emotions often leaving them not knowing how to feel about them upon their conclusion. The appropriately named 'Pieta' is a film that follows along these lines switching between moments of extreme violence and revenge to tender moments between mother and son. Gangdo is a nononsense debt collector for a loan shark often taking extreme force to scare his debtors into workbased 'accidents' thus triggering the insurance claims that are used as a guarantee of repayment. No payment no more hands but no more debt. Unconcerned by his victims or the impact his actions have on their families the cold hearted cripplemaker's life is turned upside down when a woman arrives at his door claiming to be the mother that abandoned him when he was born. Eventually accepting her story Gangdo gradually begins to see the error of his ways finally experiencing the love of a mother and taking pity on those to which he is to inflict pain. But with his guard now down the now vulnerable Gangdo leaves himself open to revenge having the tables turned on his own life and happiness. The film starts with an stream of torture inflicted on desperate men unable to pay the alwaysinevitableinfilms high rate of inflation placed on loan repayments. All of those taking out these 'happy loans' work in small independent workshops complete with enough heavy machinery to cause rather a nasty 'accident' that any insurance company would believe. Though the violence is never fully shown on screen building the anticipation and leaving it up to the imagination it is enough to leave the viewer feeling a little uneasy. The film then moves into more easy roads as the transformation of Gang do begins becoming a vulnerable son dependent on his mother and by the film's final twist he is a pitiful character. As he seeks redemption the film has become a vehicle for tender moments a far cry from the violence of the start. While there are inevitable plot holes along the way the characterisation in the two leads is strong in two strong performances from the leads Jeongjin Lee and particularly the relative unknown Minsoo Jo in the role of mother. As with his previous works it's difficult to know how to feel at the end of 'Pieta' as Minsoo Jo's character battles with her own confusion as to how she should feel towards Gangdo. Controversial love him or hate him pick faults at the lack of professionalism in the filmmaking or marvel at the way he can conjure up emotion Kim Kiduk is a director that will probably always divide opinion but will always provoke thought. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk".

	schema:reviewBody "Kim Ki Duk's 18th film Pieta describes the extent to which a loan shark would debase himself in order to recover money from penniless outcasts. This debt collector's methods are perversely mean as well as extremely violent. It is in such a hostile climate of mistrust that the arrival of a woman brings about some unforeseen changes which would completely transform their respective lives. However there are no pleasant surprises for anybody as the woman turns out to be as beastly as her illnatured son whom she left many years ago. By abetting her son in several vile actions she proves that blood is thicker than water. The film's sole trump is its realistic portrayal of the underbelly of South Korean society with its unlucky outcasts who find it impossible to survive in a harsh capitalist world. It has been observed time and again that Kim Ki Duk's films are not appreciated by masses in his native land as viewers are highly skeptical of his pessimistic vision which portrays south Korean society as well as women in a negative light. This is one of the principal reasons why Kim Ki Duk's films end up being what can rightly be termed as Film Festival Fodder. This is also the case with Pieta as it was rewarded at various international film festivals despite having been dubbed as a 'domestic box office failure'. Pieta is a very painful cinematographic experience which only loyal Kim Ki Duk admirers would be able to digest. As far as viewers ignorant of Kim Ki Duk's misanthropic vision are concerned it is surmised that they would also leave the cinemas before the end of the film as it would not be in their interests to digest Kim Ki Duk's harsh cynicism.".

	schema:headline " The surreal ending is a letdown for the cold realism of this dark drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Pieta is a dark drama by famous director Kim Ki Duk that has been chosen to represent South Korea at the 2013 Academy Awards.The story is quickly told. A lonesome guy works for a brutal loan shark and destroys the existence of those who aren't able to pay their debts. One day an old woman enters his life and claims to be his mother. In the beginning he refuses to talk to that stranger but as the brutal man in his early thirties has been abandoned as a child he starts having some serious doubts about the identity of that mysterious woman that does everything to get closer to him. Soon they share their apartment together and develop a more profound relationship. The brutal gangster starts reconsidering his violent lifestyle and is doing his job with less conviction than before before he ultimately loses it. One day the old woman disappears and he goes on a journey through his bleak past by facing his demons to find that woman who has given a new sens to his life.The strongest point of the movie is without a doubt its negative atmosphere. The director creates many haunting images and still lifes that portray the desperate situation of the brutal main character. One can see animal carcasses as well as cold grey and industrial garages all around his apartment. Many scenes show how he tortures people masturbates or tries to rape a woman. These moments are very intense and show the desolate state of mind and soul that this lonesome guy lives with. That's why it's so interesting to see his slow change of mind and how he discovers emotions he has never had before after meeting that strange old woman that claims to be his mother. That's where this movie gets challenging profound and even philosophical. That being said the acting of the two main characters is rather credible and very good which keeps the attention high until the end of the movie.The biggest flaw of this film is though definitely its predictable story line and the lack of surprises in the movie. Another letdown is the last quarter of the film where the acting and script gets less credible and where the main actor starts acting more and more stupid. The last scenes of the movie feel therefor quite surreal and break with the cold realism that has dominated the first three quarters of the film. The final moments are really a letdown in my opinion. With a better ending this flick would have deserved one or even two points more even though the story is rather thin at some points but you should make up your own mind about this controversial and questionable ending.In the end fans of South Korean cinema and of challenging dark dramas shouldn't miss this movie and will surely enjoy it. For anybody else this movie might be entertaining thanks to a good acting but definitely not impressive at all. I'm glad I saw the film but I wouldn't recommend a purchase and I probably wouldn't watch it again anytime soon.".

Advanced country though it may be South Korea still has a rundown side. But more important is the original poster. It shows the woman in a flowing dress holding the young man in her arms like Mary holding Jesus after his crucifixion. This could be his redemption..or could it?The point is that this is a well done movie. The elaborate plot and the deep complex characters make this one not to be missed. I should say that it won't be for everyone. There are some ugly scenes in it. But I still recommend it. South Korea sure has turned out some intense movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Simple story here a cop chases down a psychotic serial killer. He is the only one who believes that this respected wealthy family man is the serial killer and so must bring about some underhanded methods whilst keeping the politicians off his back. What the film lacks in story it makes up for in complex relations and psychological warfare. A stroke of genius coming about once GyuHwan the killer kills a man not related to the murder of his parents just to tease ChulJung the cop. The film begins by letting us get to know the two characters ChulJung's partner shoots himself leaving ChulJung to be the focus of an internal investigation while he also tries to get rid of some heroin. GyuHwan is introduced ferociously masturbating in the shower before exiting the bathroom and greeting his son. The film like a few Korean police thrillers 'Memories of Murder' 'Nowhere to Hide' has a fantastic sense of humour to counteract the shocking scenes of violence. One scene has ChulJung on a stakeout running round the streets in the rain trying to find a place to take a dump. The film can be looked at as a commentary on social status as the cop has a bad reputation and is tainted as he tries to do the right thing. The psychopathic serial killer is highly respected possibly because of his wealth. The murder scenes are at times chilling while the fight scenes are brutal and never unbelievable apart from a hilarious encounter in a shop between ChulJung and a large number of gangsters. An interesting array of supporting characters fill in any holes that this film leaves through lack of originality the chief of homicide and a knife expert being among my favourites. The film seems needlessly long in places and since we as the audience know who the killer is the investigation can get frustrating although this may be used to reflect the anger of ChulJung and nobody believing him. Speaking of ChulJung it is very very hard to get to like him as he is a bit of a lowlife and this is a shame as it becomes hard to be brought into his world. By the end however he sort of redeems himself. The performances are wonderful from the two leads and rather than trying to upstage each other like good actors they play off each other and seem to be enjoying it when their character has the upper hand. It's a film that is comfortable being what it is never wanting to push the boundaries but offering a brilliant tense and funny cat and mouse thriller.".

The real target of director Kang's venomous social criticism is quite obviously the soulless corporate culture he seems convinced has poisoned Korean society and subverted traditional family values far more than corrupt law enforcement ever could and which he views as a wellspring of selfobsessed Armaniclad sociopaths who would slit their own mothers' throats to score a big ROI only here the metaphor isn't actually a metaphor it's the central plot device! I'm guessing he read American Psycho or at least saw the movie certainly Lee's icy villain would make an ideal overseas penpal for Bret Easton Ellis' Patrick Bateman.

A connection is made between a brutally murdered elderly couple not far away from the previous incident and this rain coated man. The cop believes the couple's son might have involved in the murder and decides to investigate him.So you have here two characters in supposedly respectable occupations one a cop the other a fund manager who ain't angels. This is more obvious in the cop's physical appearance his drug dealing and his sharing a hot bath with Korean sort of yakuza even though the introduction of the manager character played by Lee Sungjae a familiar face now in the West starring in films such as Attack the Gas Station Barking Dogs Never Bite  Art Museum by the Zoo is quite revealing too. Masturbating and swearing in the shower in an interesting shot that completely isolates him then we see him sharing a breakfast and playing with his wife and son in the warmth of a comfortable house. I have to say that the first 20 minutes of the film are rather interesting because the character's ambiguity still play an important role. Then all falls apart simply because of the cop's sort of rediscovery of his duty after seeing the dead bodies of the elderly couple or is it he is only jealous at the manager's lifestyle. It all becomes a bit of a  farce that w e're supposed to take seriously as the film has to make serious compromises after such a bleak beginning. Nobody does something like that to somebody's parent without any motive he says for me they are public enemies. I hate to judge films by comparing them to others but Public Enemy has a too much of a Dirty Harry influence this really put me off a too clich supportive boss who is got to deal with the more bureacratic and politically correct higher hierarchies of the police department and a array of weird characters all criminals that helps the cop to catch his socalled Public Enemy.  The cop's trademark speech when confronting criminals really got on my nerves and not many in the audience found it funny anyway.".

	schema:headline " Too comic and loses focus on the possible rich thriller it could have been";
	schema:reviewBody "The trailer makes this movie seem like a slick visually rich thriller about a cop chasing down a cold killer unfortunately the film doesn't live up to that premise.Movie There's certainly some strong character moments but they are left under developed and under explored they're treated all too lightly and often too comically. The visually slick scenes are also too underused and separated by weak character follow through so one strong moment on screen isn't built upon with the characters.The film is very much a merging of two styles taught thriller and often slapstick comedy. For me this just doesn't work these two styles belong far apart.The story focuses on the rise of a killer pitched against the fall of a cop a cop who has given up on his career and any morale boundaries believing only in himself and obtaining cash any way he can.As the killer rises in his chosen path the cop stumbles upon him realises and then finds a purpose to his job. Yet this is not is salvation it comes as he reaches his lowest point and all there is left is the single all consuming cause of catching the killer.It's really interesting to read the plot like that as it does read as a good movie but intersperse the comedy and the unexplored avenues of the characters and story and it really does bring the movie down. It's not just a case of realising these lost opportunities after the fact as they pop up I actually caught myself audibly questioning why they'd just walked away from a scene. At times it was a frustrating movie.You'll see this in some of the decisions the cop makes and the investigations. They're all too convenient and almost too much of a leap not only to believe but also to understand. This and the weak unexplored characters don't bring any affinity to the audience.That's the failing part of the movie. As it could have been such a great film combining American Psycho and Heat but it just never gets that far and just gets distracted.Audio Presented Dolby Digital 2.0  5.1 DTS The audio is solid here with a good DTS soundtrack but nothing special that takes advantage of the speakers available. The music sometimes overpowered the story at key points and at others was quite effective but overall quite forgettable.Picture Presented 169 Anamorphic Good picture overall with some difficult scenes combining night and rain together they look dark and dreary yet retaining a bold contrast.Extras Presented Behind the Scenes Deleted Scenes Music Video Outtakes Asia Extreme Trailers The Behind the Scenes were interesting showing such things as the recreation of full upper body sculptures from the actors for the dead characters. There's also a lot more insight into the characters and how the actors played them.The Deleted Scenes and Outtakes were simply that although some proved quite amusing at repeating the slapstick moments. The music video is quite good as are the Extreme Trailers but an overall poorer offering in terms of extras.Overall A very interesting plot that just gets glossed over far too quickly and with the concentration seeming to be on the comedy rather than character and story progression it doesn't really attract too well. It's an interesting DVD to watch but an unfulfilling story.".

The story would be good but there were little things that prevented me to appreciate it.

	schema:headline " One tough cop... In a slightly disappointing movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Chuljoong is a cop on the edge under suspicion of corruption continually reprimanded for underhand and overzealous tactics and frankly very difficult to get on with he's also saddled with a young family to which he is the sole parent his wife died and his partner has just blown his brains out when I.A. move in to investigate some of their dodgy cases. Chuljoong is a wildcard a former boxer he likes to beat up slap and humiliate all those who are unlucky enough to cross him or just cross his path. AND he's just got a new superior who won't take any nonsense or dirtydealing from his troop and also likes to punch those who deviate from his view of policemen. Oh and he's having difficulty moving a cache of drugs he's pilfered but he badly needs to because his finances are screwed. His life's a bit of a mess...Just when you think things couldn't get any worse he has a nasty nighttime confrontation with a madman. When Chuljoong jumps out of a police van in the pouring rain desperately searching for a place to take a dump he bumps into dark assassin who slashes his face. Miffed Chuljoong resolves to catch the SOB and make him pay. But that's easier said than done. I don't think this is really a spoiler but if you want to approach the movie with much knowledge of the plot stop reading here. It's made clear very early on who the assailant was Cho Gyoohwan an ostensibly sensible affluent and domesticated businessman with a family and steady job  plus a big bankbalance and cushy life. And when Gyoohwan sliced Chuljoong he did so just after having murdered his parents in a rage after they threatened to withdraw some funding. Gyoohwan may look straight but in reality he's a shifty degenerate jerking off in the shower as he fantasises over kinky sex and revisiting the site of his monstrous parricide to gloat over his mum and dad's rotting corpses. Imagine Patrick Batemen from American Psycho but with a family.And thus Chuljoong and Gyoohwan two unstable violent men go ttette the former quickly convinced of the latter's guilt when the investigation gets going yet lacking any hard evidence.This Korean blockbuster was shipped abroad with great credo a big money haul some top stars an established director exciting gory material and a great inyouface trailer. All of which should fit it quite nicely in the Asia Extreme category. But for all the beating running fighting and shouty dialogue it's actually quite dull.There are some strong elements. For one it has several cohesive continuous themes such as a blacklycomic meditation on the class divide that pits slovenly cop against suitedbusinessman and a gruesomely compelling odour the film has stench. The filmmakers continually emphasise smell Chuljoong sweats a great deal there's a gag when a murder weapon is tainted with excrement the rotting bodies all thrown into the cauldron that is Seoul in summer. This is a policier with foul BO  an original idea. There's also a tough view on the Korean economy and thoughtprovoking contemplations on the role of police and the nature of the thin blue line when can you cross it ensure that justice is meted out? Throw in some knockabout comedy a great rogue's gallery of cops and robbers some frenetic brutal fights and much headbanging and you'd reckon you've got a great noirish entertainment. Sadly not quite so.Director Woosook Kang's film all suffer from excessive length and at 140 minutes Public Enemy just outstays its welcome there's too much yelling and debate that cuts up the main story arch. Thus the climactic duel when it comes is overdue and even though brutal and stupidly bloody not enough to compensate for the previous tracts of boredom. Equally disappointing is the lack of visual flair. The film has some great textured 'scope photography and a compelling use of ordinary locations that root the story in some kind of reality but one the whole its too restricted to rather boringly lit offices and homes.That said the lead performances have a manic integrity. Kyunggu Sol is the lead and standout piling on the pounds moustached and sweating like a pig he's virtually unrecognisable. It's his performance and the antagonism with his rich rival that is the real motor of the movie  it's just a shame there's so much material to distract and detract from that.It's still a sometimes amazing brutish ride and far more aggressive and dynamic than your regular Hollywood crime films. It's also worth seeing for the line No one should kill somebody for no reason. You said it!".

It's not terrifying and it will not make you hide behind your sofa or think too much but it is creepy and wellpaced. There are some jumpy moments but the real stress is on a slow build up. For some time the presence of anything sinister is only hinted at. We see characters interacting dark shadows in the corner and glimpses of the past mostly experienced by the main character a female conductor. It is her first trip as a conductor and the last trip for a train on that particular line on which a terrible accident has happened years earlier. There is an atmosphere of menace which slowly becomes more threatening as more of the characters' fears and backgrounds are revealed and the train gathers speed. There are clichd scenes such as someone innocently picking up a coat out of which falls an important newspaper clipping but they are not bad enough to render the film ridiculous. The effects are well done and sometimes scary and the slow pacing accompanied by the constant sound of the train and the subtle cinematography make for a great atmosphere.

Especially when held up against much of the recent wave of releases in the same genre from Korea and Asia in general.

	schema:reviewBody "A tragedy involving a train collision which killed 250 people is at the heart of Dongbin Kim's South Korean ghost story Red Eye. Shinyeong Jang is Misun the daughter of the train conductor killed during the aforementioned collision. Misun's father has gained a notoriety for the crash his inability to stop the disaster questioned by a bereaved public. She decides on her birthday no less to take the graveyard shift on a train on its maiden voyage as it will be put out to pasture after one final night of carrying passengers from one city to another on a 6hour schedule. What happens during this schedule makes up the bulk of the film only once does the train actually stop with a few passengers exiting including one young man who split from his girlfriend after a spat between the two as Misun sees dead people. Her train actually has cars belonging to the disaster salvaged from the wreckage. Perhaps these cars brought along the presence of those restless souls who have yet to find their peace from this world? An important plot point involves two children who survived the crash which killed their parents and especially how their parents were responsible for the crash and might be on the train 15 years after the disaster. Anyway bodies are possessed and Misun because she knows too much might be in danger. Dongkyu Lee is an employee on the train Jinkyu who befriends the nervous Misun new and inexperienced offering advice and support. Jimin Kwak is Sohee who claims to see ghosts feeling presences on their train. When the possessed decide to repeat the terrible tragedy from years back Misun will try to stop thembut can she? The result of this extremely slowmoving and basically uneventful story stays stuck in first gear and never really takes off. Red Eye recycles ghost girl clichs such as black hair coiling around the face of a victim and the contorting bodies of ghouls charging towards people. My favorite scene involves a specter appearing from a puddle of blood looking to possess Misun her plans thwarted by Jinkyu who was her lover he was also on the train but survived appealing to her. A lot of the cinematography is too dark but the train itself is a nice setting for a ghost story. If only Red Eye had more genuine chills it might have been more successful. The filmmakers hold back a bit too much and it simply takes too long to get to the horror which is unforgivable. Some decent characterizations help though. Wish I could say this was a pleasurable experience but I'd be lyingit was quite a chore to get through. The ending does tie loose ends and allows certain characters and spirits to find closure so if you enjoy the developing story you might find it rewarding.".

Anyway bodies are possessed and Misun because she knows too much might be in danger. Dongkyu Lee is an employee on the train Jinkyu who befriends the nervous Misun new and inexperienced offering advice and support. Jimin Kwak is Sohee who claims to see ghosts feeling presences on their train. When the possessed decide to repeat the terrible tragedy from years back Misun will try to stop thembut can she? The result of this extremely slowmoving and basically uneventful story stays stuck in first gear and never really takes off. Red Eye recycles ghost girl clichs such as black hair coiling around the face of a victim and the contorting bodies of ghouls charging towards people. My favorite scene involves a specter appearing from a puddle of blood looking to possess Misun her plans thwarted by Jinkyu who was her lover he was also on the train but survived appealing to her. A lot of the cinematography is too dark but the train itself is a nice setting for a ghost story. If only Red Eye had more genuine chills it might have been more successful. The filmmakers hold back a bit too much and it simply takes too long to get to the horror which is unforgivable. Some decent characterizations help though. Wish I could say this was a pleasurable experience but I'd be lyingit was quite a chore to get through. The ending does tie loose ends and allows certain characters and spirits to find closure so if you enjoy the developing story you might find it rewarding.";

Credit goes most especially to the actress Lee NaYoung who did a fine job of showing how her character journeyed to be able to reach the kind of person she becomes at the end of the film the male lead was quite good himself.Good acting well articulated plot music was good  overall recommended.".

The movie literally translates to Our Happy Time and the title really gives meaning to the movie. This movie is a total tearjerker and one of the biggest tearjerkers I have ever seen. The cast was awesome all around. The two main actors both portray their characters very nicely and did an awesome job. The director did an amazing job as well with the camera angles It made a huge impact. The soundtrack was perfect as well which I consider one of the most important aspects of a movie. This movie is the romantic relationship between two people who meet together in a rather odd way which leads to a very melodramatic storyline. This movie was not too melodramatic but just enough that it was just spot on. The buildup of the movie is great as well.Highly recommended.".
