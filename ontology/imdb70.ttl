And then all the people on the ship decide to prepare a party for the captain.That is basically an excuse for making fun of everything from Polish movies to brooding intellectuals. There is a very funny moment when one of the characters comments about how bad Polish movies are in which nothing happens and you can have a character just smoking and looking one side first then the other while all the while he is actually doing it just smoking looking at one side then the other and explaining what he is doing. It is all in the absurd parody side of humor all small vignettes. The acting or the direction as the plot are just an excuse to try to make people laugh.Nonetheless even if it is just a little bit over one hour it has some empty moments and some stretched ones where the viewer's attention may wander a little bit.".

What you see is a simple plot but the film manages to fit simple funny scenes with something deeper and more thought provoking. You may be laughing at a scenecharacter only to realize after that what was originally shallow humor turned into a trip of a drunk writer. Haha now the crew is laughing at you.And the drunk side is very present in the film. No it's not day of a drunk bum. It's rather the feeling of a drunk writer. You have characters that appear once not to be seen again were they forgot?. You have sudden digressions about ancient Greek aspects of physical exercises or Dutch painters by the Professor or comments about sport by the sportsman... who repeats his line twice because the actors were  amateurs who were told what was being shot was was just a trial not the final version. But don't worry the film is not a documentary about a village theatre group.This is not a typical comedy with a single star or a duo. The film makes fun of most of its characters. The Professor is almost boring yet his digressions add another dimension to the film the Engineer is full of his degree always introducing himself as 'engineer Mamon' his wife is pompous because her husband is an Engineer! the Worker pretends to understand more difficult words and the Art  Entertainment Officer is the last to know anything about art let alone management skills. The only one who seems normal is the Capitan. Yet they are all hilarious.This is probably one of a few Polish films which could be translated. It does rely on Polish reality and quite a lot on communist reality of 1970 but not as much as to view it as a 'relic' or 'political'. It's worth seeing but if you understand French and have access to the French version I'd suggest it. As with anything translated from Polish.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very funny film. It stars the great Stanislaw Tym  the only professional actor in an otherwise nonprofessional cast  as a chancer who cons his way on board a pleasureboat on a river cruise and he becomes the ship's entertainments officer. The cruise is used as a vehicle for a satire of communist Poland that manages to be cutting but warm at the same time. The absurdities of life in Poland at the time are wonderfully caught. But much of the humour is also more universal  trivial conversations where people have nothing to say but keep talking anyway pretentious discourses about poetry and cinema leading to complete misunderstanding the ridiculousness of spending one's time on holiday when the time spent supposedly enjoying oneself starts to resemble the boredom of working life and so on. NonPoles like me will miss out on the clever wordplay in the script unless you have a Polish speaker on hand to translate for you as I did  thank you MT!. But if you just watch it in translation without such help it's still very funny anyway. The nonprofessionals are used wonderfully well  imagine Ken Loach or Pasolini making a really silly but still pointed comedy. There are some nice visual homages to Fellini and Tati too  another part of the universal appeal is that I think the film is in places like a Polish Monsieur Hulot's holiday. It is a piece of work that is perfect in its own way and it's easy to see why it is so beloved in its country of origin. But it is also greatly appealing to foreigners not least because it shows you very nicely what the essence of Polish humour is.Although it is ostensibly a weird connection it would be worthwhile to watch this in conjunction with Richard Lester's Juggernaut which is apparently a disaster movie about bombs on board a British liner but is in fact a satire that uses the background of a cruise to make some pointed observations about contemporary society in this case Britain in the mid1970s. And Lester's film has some wonderful moments from Roy Kinnear as the ship's increasingly desperate entertainments officer the spiritual cousin of Tym's phony art and culture secretary. It makes one realise just how great a metaphor for the human condition a cruise is every one of us is trapped in a delimited space with a bunch of generally wellmeaning idiots. This for me is at the root of Rejs's appeal for anyone at all whether they are Polish or not.".

He eventually takes control of the boat pretending to be an entertainmentcoordinator and entices the the other passengers into weird activities.I understand this movie is based allaround antitotalitariancommunism beliefs and is supposed to reflect that throughout it but I barely got the message and in the end it was butchered by the horrendous English subtitles which sometimes make no sense whatsoever.This films drags for an hour and it's filled with dialogue which probably gets this film so much praise from mostly polish viewers. If I ever get the chance to watch this with a polish speaker like one other reviewer mentioned here I might change my mind about this movie but for now this remains the most uninteresting film i have seen to date.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that doesn't speak polish or has a polishspeaking friend that's willing to explain it to him.".

	schema:headline " Great Insight into Korean society";
	schema:reviewBody "I have lived in Korea for the last four years and have been fortunate enough to experience many excellent movies. Of course this is highly debatable and maybe bias on my behalf but South Korea is producing not only some of the best movies in the world at the moment but some of the most provocative and thought provoking movies of which Samaria is probably the prime example.In NaBeunNamJa BadGuy Kim Di Duk already dealt with prostitution however talking to Korean people I think that Samaria is a better account of the true nature of Korean society and the Korean sex industry as a whole. It is because of this that I would like to address some misconceptions that people have of the movie from previous posts and reviews. I promise that I will review the movie later if you bear with me.First of all Korean directors are making their movies for the domestic market which is the third biggest domestic market in the world after Hollywood and bollywood and therefore tailor their movies to the culture and beliefs that prevail in the domestic market.Teenage prostitution is an unfortunate but common aspect of Korean society. In this movie the Director Kim Di Duk is only portraying what is the norm in Korean society. It is not uncommon although I am unable to provide statistics that many high school and university students and even middle school students pay for or supplement their tuition fees through the sex industry although this is not always in the form of prostitution but sometimes just 'entertaining' men in 'salon' bars. It is a sad reflection of a society that the 'education fever' is so strong that young girls will resort too any means too pay for their education. In this respect Kim Di Duk has hit the nail on the head.A couple of reviewers mentioned the 'shower'  'sauna'  'bathhouse' scene between the two girls. For those that mentioned it there is nothing absolutely remotely sexual or as one reviewer mentioned 'Lesbian' in these scenes whatsoever! Visiting 'bath houses in Korean is an everyday part of Korean life even as a Westerner I often frequent these places. It is considered normal for women to wash other women and also the same for men. Relationships between the sexes here is different but refreshing it is not uncommon to see people of the same sex walking down the street together holding hands or with their arm around another. It takes a while to get used to but once you get used to the nature of the touchy feely nature of Korean people it don't half help you get over any latent homophobic feelings you have! Anyhow on to movie...I had heard a lot about this movie the only Kim Di Duk movie I had seen before this was BadGuy which I thought was OK but a bit clichd.This movie blew my mind. However the first part of the movie the relationship between the two girls although fairly accurate in terms of Korean society didn't grab me as much as the 'second act' of the movie.Previous reviews have given enough details on the plot of the movie which I am not going to rehash however there is one scene in this movie that in my own humble opinion has to be one of the most incredible pieces of film making and script writing that I have ever seen on celluloid.PLEASE DON'T CONTINUE TO READ THIS POST IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE. Because I think this scene should be seen in it's bleak and raw frankness that the director intended.For those that have seen this movie I am talking about the scene where the father goes to the apartment of the man who is having sex with his daughter and confronts the man in front of his family. What is most shocking about this scene is that the man's daughter is older than the father's daughter.Never in all the movies have I seen a scene so heart breaking thought provoking and shocking and so well filmed than this. For anyone still reading who hasn't seen this movie I will omit how this scene finishes... still sends shivers down my spine now writing about it! Well sorry to rant! Please watch this movie and take into mind what I said about Korean society. For those who don't know Korean cinema also please check out Chingoo Friend YupGiJeogInGeoNyaMy sassy girl Memories of Murder NaBeunNamJa BadGuyTaeGeukki ... etc. etc.".

Looking deeper than the visual settings I found that the movie hits more emotionally about relationships between friends and family. The movie is basically broken into two parts. Part one is about JaeYoung an amateur prostitute and her best friend YeoJin her manager. The second part is about YeoJin and her father. Each part has its tense moments and the director pretty much does a good job telling the story and showing the audience tragedy and closeness. There's not a lot of sex or violence like typical prostitution movies but then again it is not about prostitution it only uses it as a medium to get the point across. Happy viewing!".

The Isle  3Iron and he scores one minus The Isle despite stunning cinematography one very good Spring and two absolutely magnificent. Despite the fact that I liked 3Iron just a bit better because of the more straightforward story and consistent way of story telling Samaria comes very close.I'm not going to spoil things for you but I'd just point out that this is yet another highly symbolic film so much in fact that this second symbolic level is probably more easily understood than the basic story. Not that it's complicated it's just that story and meaning are not as closely interwoven as in 3Iron where the overlap between the two made possible an ambiguous reality that led to sublimation. Here it takes a while for the two levels to touch.The feeling following 3Iron was that of reaching an asymptote  only the infinite was beyond. In Samaria you feel like some serious stuff happened but what's done is done and the road lies open. We're at a starting point which is not quite zero but feels like it. Well now you can hardly call that a spoiler 'cause I hardly understand it myself. But you'll see what I mean after seeing it.The story which seems to start out as something different that what it turns out to be must be one of the most poignant symbolic depictions of the point at which a parent has to let hisher kid go and realise heshe's not needed anymore  or not like before. Also silence without being as overwhelming as in 3Iron plays an important role. In 3Iron good stuff happened because of silence here a lot of not so good things happen because of it but some good things can happen in spite of silence. The ending can be very sad or neutral or have the potential for hope if you choose my story interpretation. But who am I?What? Still reading this?  off you go to the video store.

	schema:reviewBody "Director KiDuk Kim gave us an emotive history divided in three parts. Probably a lot of viewers think on this movie as sad frustrating and even violent but in fact this film is nothing but an optimistic way to see life and to bring people with simplicity and second chances. We are humans and we have the right to make mistakes some times you won't have the chance to redeem your self but in other cases you have that opportunity.In the first history we can witness the deep friendship between two teenager girls YeoJin and JaeYeong. Both have different characters one is a happy and optimistic girl she always has a smile in her face the other girl on the contrary has a terrible attitude against everyone but her father and girlfriend. They are prostitutes at least one arranges everything and the other do the dirty job. So far the main history involves only the two young girls. They have a detailed black book with the names and telephones of their clients. Then the ending a fatal catastrophe. Police finds out that a minor is in a room with and adult. The girl jumps out of a window and hits her head against the floor. She dies the day after with a big smile. The other girl starts shouting Stop laughing! Stop laughing! The second history is about redemption The girl feels guilty about her friend so she decides to settle up appointments with all the customers to have sex with them and to return the payment made to the other girl. She changed her attitude radically and starts smiling just like her friend. She realizes that every time she returns the money she starts feeling better and better. One day she was with one client and her father was in the opposite building. He saw his daughter in a room with a man. He can't believe it and in this exactly point is where the third story begins.This subplot is the most violent and in the same time the most beautiful of the movie. Violent at the beginning because the police officer father of the girl wants revenge. In his quest he attacks the man who was with his little one at the motel he is responsible of a man's suicide and responsible of a murder violent murder. The list was complete and then the history becomes beautiful. The father looks with his daughter forgiveness and a new beginning. In the grave of the death mother they started a ritual. In the way back from the grave took place the most beautiful scene of the movie the car is stocked the father removes some rocks from the stocked tire but not enough. Returns to the car and close his eyes. The girl got out of the car and starts to remove the remaining rocks. An excellent sequence we can solve our problems together! We are here for that. They spend the night in an old cabin. He told his daughter a history about one's virgin appearance in the top of a hill. They did the same. He returned the virginity to his daughter. She realizes that he knows. In the middle of the night he cries. By the end of the movie the girl has a dream where the father is killing and buried her but when she woke up her father made something totally different taught her how to drive car.

	onyx:emotionText "Director KiDuk Kim gave us an emotive history divided in three parts. Probably a lot of viewers think on this movie as sad frustrating and even violent but in fact this film is nothing but an optimistic way to see life and to bring people with simplicity and second chances. We are humans and we have the right to make mistakes some times you won't have the chance to redeem your self but in other cases you have that opportunity.In the first history we can witness the deep friendship between two teenager girls YeoJin and JaeYeong. Both have different characters one is a happy and optimistic girl she always has a smile in her face the other girl on the contrary has a terrible attitude against everyone but her father and girlfriend. They are prostitutes at least one arranges everything and the other do the dirty job. So far the main history involves only the two young girls. They have a detailed black book with the names and telephones of their clients. Then the ending a fatal catastrophe. Police finds out that a minor is in a room with and adult. The girl jumps out of a window and hits her head against the floor. She dies the day after with a big smile. The other girl starts shouting Stop laughing! Stop laughing! The second history is about redemption The girl feels guilty about her friend so she decides to settle up appointments with all the customers to have sex with them and to return the payment made to the other girl. She changed her attitude radically and starts smiling just like her friend. She realizes that every time she returns the money she starts feeling better and better. One day she was with one client and her father was in the opposite building. He saw his daughter in a room with a man. He can't believe it and in this exactly point is where the third story begins.This subplot is the most violent and in the same time the most beautiful of the movie. Violent at the beginning because the police officer father of the girl wants revenge. In his quest he attacks the man who was with his little one at the motel he is responsible of a man's suicide and responsible of a murder violent murder. The list was complete and then the history becomes beautiful. The father looks with his daughter forgiveness and a new beginning. In the grave of the death mother they started a ritual. In the way back from the grave took place the most beautiful scene of the movie the car is stocked the father removes some rocks from the stocked tire but not enough. Returns to the car and close his eyes. The girl got out of the car and starts to remove the remaining rocks. An excellent sequence we can solve our problems together! We are here for that. They spend the night in an old cabin. He told his daughter a history about one's virgin appearance in the top of a hill. They did the same. He returned the virginity to his daughter. She realizes that he knows. In the middle of the night he cries. By the end of the movie the girl has a dream where the father is killing and buried her but when she woke up her father made something totally different taught her how to drive car. They started the lessons and the father said Now is the turn to drive by your own! A police car arrives and the father got in. The girl started to drive but she was unable to follow the police car. She is now by her own but with a new beginning.A very emotive film with excellent cinematography. Kim besides to be the director is responsible of writing editing producing and even set decoration.

Rather than narrative Samaritan girl's a poem with narrative elements with three narrative threads or stanzas that follow on each other only vaguely that overlap each other recklessly. Forget or only play with rationality. Look instead for juxtapositions dream logic miracles. If there's a saint here a Samaritan girl to justify Kim's harping on Teresa then I'm sure it's not the Vasumitraobsessed JaeYoung but the methodical seemingly allseeing YeoJin.

	schema:reviewBody "Sandwiched between his two in my opinion masterpieces Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring and 3Iron Samaria is an interesting pieces that provides a necessary link between them sharing the themes of the former and the style of the latter. The theme I'm talking about is the loss of innocence something that is presented in the harshest possible manner in this film.Two girls want to travel to Europe so one acts as a pimp and the other as a prostitute. This seems shocking and it is to the 'pimp' who becomes increasingly disturbed by their activities. To the 'prostitute' however it's all a bit of harmless fun that she gets paid for. Eventually something happens in fact it's no spoiler to say that the 'prostitute' dies. The scene that precipitates this is one of the most harrowing in the film and shows that Kiduk can create some subtly played shocks when he needs to. After this the 'pimp' essentially assumes the role of 'prostitute' for personal reasons and this is where the film begins to follow the same style as 3Iron in the sense of 're visiting' past experiences and places in a new form. This is augmented when the girl's father begins following the men she sleeps with confronting them in increasingly violent ways. One reviewer already spoke of the so called 'dinnertable confrontation scene'  it is perhaps one of the best scenes in Kiduk's extensive library and leaves a lasting impression.I must applaud Lee Eol who plays the father. His performance expresses emotions of confusion anger and violence with remarkable subtlety and skill. As the film progresses into its final act Kiduk covers us with an increasingly dark pall of blue. He then arguably offers us two endings to choose from although it is the latter that is the most affecting and so beautifully summarises the themes of the film. Most Ki duk films leave me stunned with feelings of amazement. Samaria is no different. The ending is haunting and true.Not as good as Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring or 3Iron Samaria is still an excellent film that continues to prove why Kim Ki duk is arguably Korea's greatest director.".

	schema:headline " polarised";
	schema:reviewBody "spoilers warning!!Reflecting on what my focus should be in talking about Samaritan Girl I came up with this is a story about polarisation. We see this polarisation on two separate fronts in the two halves of the movie.JaeYoung and YeoJin are two teenage schoolgirls who in yearning for a trip to Europe resort to prostitution to make the money for it. The two girls while loving each other deeply cannot be more polarised as clearly shown in their split of responsibility in this undertaking. JaeYoung all fun loving and carefree takes care of only one thing sleeping with the clients. She enjoys what she is doing and values the congenial relationship developed with some of the clients. YeoJin reserved and aloof takes care of everything else in playing the roles form pimp to banker. For her this is purely business and absolutely filthy business as such. While chiding JaeYoung for enjoying the proceedings she must also be feeling apologetical for leaving all the dirty work literally to the former.Things seem to work well except for occasional fits of jealousy on YeoJin's part. Then it goes seriously wrong when JaeYoung trying to escape a police raid jumps off the window and eventually dies in YeoJin's arms in the hospital. YeoJin's reaction can well be imagined but the unpredictable turn is that in seeking absolution she looks up each one of JaeYoung's clients sleeps with them and then returns the money that JaeYoung had received from them before. This starts the second story of polarisation. Up to this point YeoJin's father has appeared only briefly a loving man who recently lost his wife and is now both parents to his single most beloved daughter. Things take a dramatic turn when during the course of his work he is a detective he spots YeoJin in action. The irony is that while through the absolution process YeoJin finishes with her clients in a mutually congenial relationship they are in for a violent subsequent encounter with her father who lurks behind. This escalates one case after another until it results in a death. While this spoiler has revealed most of the plot I'll stop here. This movie touches on a number of things.

	onyx:emotionText "spoilers warning!!Reflecting on what my focus should be in talking about Samaritan Girl I came up with this is a story about polarisation. We see this polarisation on two separate fronts in the two halves of the movie.JaeYoung and YeoJin are two teenage schoolgirls who in yearning for a trip to Europe resort to prostitution to make the money for it. The two girls while loving each other deeply cannot be more polarised as clearly shown in their split of responsibility in this undertaking. JaeYoung all fun loving and carefree takes care of only one thing sleeping with the clients. She enjoys what she is doing and values the congenial relationship developed with some of the clients. YeoJin reserved and aloof takes care of everything else in playing the roles form pimp to banker. For her this is purely business and absolutely filthy business as such. While chiding JaeYoung for enjoying the proceedings she must also be feeling apologetical for leaving all the dirty work literally to the former.Things seem to work well except for occasional fits of jealousy on YeoJin's part. Then it goes seriously wrong when JaeYoung trying to escape a police raid jumps off the window and eventually dies in YeoJin's arms in the hospital. YeoJin's reaction can well be imagined but the unpredictable turn is that in seeking absolution she looks up each one of JaeYoung's clients sleeps with them and then returns the money that JaeYoung had received from them before. This starts the second story of polarisation. Up to this point YeoJin's father has appeared only briefly a loving man who recently lost his wife and is now both parents to his single most beloved daughter. Things take a dramatic turn when during the course of his work he is a detective he spots YeoJin in action. The irony is that while through the absolution process YeoJin finishes with her clients in a mutually congenial relationship they are in for a violent subsequent encounter with her father who lurks behind. This escalates one case after another until it results in a death. While this spoiler has revealed most of the plot I'll stop here. This movie touches on a number of things. However if there is one main theme it is a fatheranddaughter movie. There is neither graphic sex nor violence some may not agree but it all depends on what movies you compare it with. Feelings depicted here are subtle even enigmatic particularly on YeoJin's part.

	schema:reviewBody "Samaritan Girl is a really impressive film directed by KiDuk Kim. To end all the discrepancies about the title the film has been illegally bootlegged as 'Samaria'. The real official title of this film in English is Samaritan Girl. The film is coming out on official nonbootlegged DVD from Tartan's Asia Extreme...which I should add have been putting out some awesome Asian films on DVD not to mention they are the ones responsible for getting 'Oldboy' in the theater.Anyway Samaritan Girl is not like the rest of the Asia Extreme catalog. It's a sexy drama that is also a really interesting slice of life film. Most Korean films that have been picked up by American distributors tend to be horror or thrillers but maybe that's because bloodslasher movies sell really well. Samaritan Girl on the other hand is far from a slasher and while there is some violence some nudity and blood it's really more like a Korean interpretation of the American indie film.The story is about two girls who are trying to save up money to get away from their town. They don't really have strong relationships with their families who are sort of out of the picture. It's like the Larry Clark film KIDS in the way that the parents aren't really there or at least the parents think they know their kids but they don't. JaeYeong the prettier of the two girls decides to be a prostitute and makes her friend Yeo Jin her business associate who sets up the meetings.The film's opener is awesome with a really great credit sequence over the girls on Korea's instant messaging program picking up a guy.As the film progresses there is some interesting sexual tension between the girls. They bathe together in a public shower house which is really sad and illuminates their aloneness. Yeo Jin tells Jae Young not to divulge to much to her 'clients'. JaeYoung who is clearly very childish capricious and obviously depressed and lacking self esteem actually enjoys these encounters with men as the attention is probably what makes her feel good about herself.About halfway through the film JaeYoung has an accident I wont give anything away here but Yeo Jin decides to switch roles and become the prostitute instead of the secretary. Yeo Jin's father gets wind of the whole thing and starts to follow her on her sexual encounters. He eventually catches her in the act...and I wont give away the end.The film is really well done. And frankly the two girls are really adorable and the film is really sweet and sad at the same time. It's also disturbing a lot of the time.If you're not in the mood to see people getting chopped to bits but would rather watch an awesome Korean indie film With really cute actresses I should mention this film is a great one to check out.".

	schema:reviewBody "KINDLY NOTE SOME MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.Samaria is probably the first arthouse movie to emerge from South Korea.Upon viewing the cover of the Dvd many will get the wrong impression that this is some exploitation Movie. This is definitely not the case. Actually this has got to be one of the most honest movies to tackle such a delicate subject without ever once being explicit.The director could have easily spoilt the movie with graphic sex or nudity but instead this very brave director who actually won the award for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival  has managed to cross a message that is very important in our times without ever once embarrassing his audience. The movie is divided into 3 chapters it opens with two girls chatting on the Internet with a complete stranger to meet for a date. Next we see a title on the screen which reads Vasumitra.Vasumitra was a prostitute in India where legend has it that any man who slept with her turned into a devoted Buddhist! The director will further in the movie also mention other religious references. The name Vasumitra is the name that one of the girls will actually use as to disguise her identity. So begins the adventures of two teenage girls in the world of prostitution all for the sake to earn some easy money. An important shot at the very beginning of the movie after one of the girls has her first encounter with her client shows them eating a roasted pig's feet. Could this be a clear indication where these poor two girls are heading too since the pig is considered by many a filthy animal.To further prove my point both the girls enter a bathhouse to wash. Describing what one of them just did was filthy. Next the girls run around in a park where they sit next to a line of statues of a complete family consisting of the mother father and children which clearly shows they're longing to be part of a family.Meanwhile one the girls is taking notes in her diary of every man she encounters. She sleeps in her tiny room soon to be awakened by her father who is a detective!He takes his daughter to school and here again we hear another religious story this time about Jesus told by the father to his daughter.Tragedy soon strikes and while one of the girls is busy with a client the police raid the apartment. In a state of panic the girl has no idea what to do and jumps out of the apartment window and falls to the ground she is carried to the hospital by the detective's daughter but she is in a very serious condition and about to lose her life. Her friend persuades her to give her the diary and contact one of her clients to visit her one last time before she dies. This is actually were the story takes a dramatic turn!After her friend dies in hospital the detective's daughter starts visiting each client to return back the money her friend made from these men.It is important to note that her friend was just there to look after her and take care of the money and had never encountered any clients up until now! Meanwhile here father is investigating a murder case and this is where he sees his own daughter in an opposite apartment with a client! Thus begins a story of revenge on each client without the daughter ever knowing her father is actually one step behind her.Revealing more would spoil this unique movie experience. The direction is superb and the haunting score literally pulls you in the mood of the story. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this movie to serious moviegoers. I would like to applaud  Kiduk Kim for making such an honest movie about a very serious subject.Kiduk Kim has truly made an amazing arthouse Masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Muddled Mess of Teenage Sex";
	schema:reviewBody "Samaria tries to be a tightly woven drama about truth and consequences of youth dabbling in the business of behaving as adults but instead the film comes off as little more than a jarring mess of mixed messages.Trying to save money for a trip to Europe two young lesbians Jaeyeong and Yeojin concoct a grand scheme Jaeyeong begins the world's oldest profession sleeping with much older men for cash while Yeojin stands guard outside watching for police. However when Jaeyoung jumps from a hotel window to avoid being caught by the police she dies from her wounds and Yeojin feeling responsible decides to take over the bedroom duties and give these men their money back. The situation quickly goes from bad to worse when her father  a police detective  uncovers what she's doing and then starts extracting his own revenge on the men.The film is uneven and it never gives a clear motivation for Yeojin's desire to put things right in her little corner of the world.

	onyx:emotionText "Samaria tries to be a tightly woven drama about truth and consequences of youth dabbling in the business of behaving as adults but instead the film comes off as little more than a jarring mess of mixed messages.Trying to save money for a trip to Europe two young lesbians Jaeyeong and Yeojin concoct a grand scheme Jaeyeong begins the world's oldest profession sleeping with much older men for cash while Yeojin stands guard outside watching for police. However when Jaeyoung jumps from a hotel window to avoid being caught by the police she dies from her wounds and Yeojin feeling responsible decides to take over the bedroom duties and give these men their money back. The situation quickly goes from bad to worse when her father  a police detective  uncovers what she's doing and then starts extracting his own revenge on the men.The film is uneven and it never gives a clear motivation for Yeojin's desire to put things right in her little corner of the world.

Her growing up is prostituting herself to her dead girlfriend's exclients as a way of dealing with the grief. The film is broken up into three distinct chapters and is as tonally different as each third. The center section is the most kinetic and bloody while the concluding section is the most protracted. The opening section focuses on the friendship between the two girls and is the most cohesive of the three. Unfortunately kiDuk is in danger of becoming irrelevant because his films are becoming very conventional in one sense but very inaccessible in another sense.

Still the times are tense because of the impending European conflict that will cause great turmoil in most of Europe. Pereira a widower obsessed with death reads an article about the subject something that moves him by its content and wants to meet its author. Monteiro Rossi the man in question turns out to be a young Italian man trying to make sense of what is happening in Spain. It is clear Rossi and his girlfriend Marta are on the side fighting against Franco and the fascist regime in his native Italy.Pereira engages the young man to update the obituary section of his publication as there are many people whose biographies will soon appear in the newspaper. Pereira loves his lemonade breaks at the Cafe Orquidea a drink he usually add a lot of sugar. Not being in good health he decides to explore one of the cures fashionable at the time at a seaside resort conducted by Dr. Cardozo. On the way to the spa he meets a German woman in the train. She is a Jewish refugee awaiting the American visa that will take her to safer ground. He is clearly impressed by the woman's appeal for him to speak up about the madness that is sweeping Europe.His experience with Dr. Cardozo helps Pereira shed some of the extra weight he has been carried. On his return to Lisbon Pereira finds the atmosphere has changed. The super's wife he realizes is spying on him. His phone is being tapped. When Monteiro Rossi arrives at his apartment it is clear the young man has been through a lot. Now being persecuted he asks Pereira to hide him but unfortunately it is too late. The Gestapolike secret police comes to Pereira's home and Rossi falls victim of the rough treatment. Pereira can only do something in memory of his young friend. The essay he was handed by Rossi makes the front page of his newspaper. The only solution for Pereira is to go into exile before the police catches up with him.Roberto Faenza the director of this extraordinary film adapted Antonio Tabucci's original Italian novel with the assistance of Sergio Vecchio. The result is an interesting political drama that captures the essence of the period before WWII while the Spanish Civil War was raging in neighboring Spain. Pereira the man at the center of the story has always taken an easy posture of noninvolvement but faced with the madness of fascism in his own land proves to be the catalyst for him to spring into action.That Mr. Faenza was able to get the wonderful Marcello Mastroianni to portrait Pereira was a lucky break no doubt. The actor almost at the end of his life shows an intensity and passion for the man he is playing that it is an experience not to be missed. We watched this film at Anthology of Films Archives in New York when it first was shown in America. Watching it again on an Argentine cable channel recently brought back fond memories for the film Mr. Faenza and Mr. Mastroianni. Others seen in the film include the great Daniel Auteuil Joaquim De Almeida Stefano Dionisi Nicoletta Braschi and Marthe Keller in a moving cameo role.Blasco Giurato caught the essence of the Lisbon of those years in somber images of faded colors as to enhance a story that took place long ago. Ennio Morricone does his usual magic with a musical score that also adds to our enjoyment. The film is recommended to the fans of Mr. Mastroianni in one of the best appearances before he left us thanks to the inspired direction of Roberto Faenza.".

	schema:headline " A not brilliant key of interpretation for a great novel";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a bit disappointed by this movie adaptation of Antonio Tabucchi's Sostiene Pereira Pereira declares an Italian modern classic novel about an old Portuguese journalist who decides to not stand watching but to intervene in his own little way in a difficult historic moment the story is set in 1938 on the eve of WWII compromising himself. It's a great story of heroism and courage. What I didn't like about the movie is the key adopted to tell the story I find it too comic and slight compared to the importance of the matter dealt in the book the novel's tone is serious Mr Pereira is a dramatic character whereas the Pereira played by Mastroianni is excessively tragicomic to my way of thinking there's a few hilarious moments in the book but they never appear as forced as they do in the movie. In general the story's register is gloomy however this gloominess was lost in the movie.Nicoletta Braschi is another reason why I didn't like this movie she's absolutely terrible in it she drones on all her cues she seems to be reading a shopping list all the time!The score composed by Ennio Morricone suffers from the same misunderstanding that affects the movie in general the interpretation key is wrong for me this kind of musical approach would have been more fit for a comedy than for a drama it's a sort of funny piped music with no substance it's absolutely unable to play the dramatic sequences up. Nevertheless what's in the book you find in the movie the message is safe but where's the spirit? where's the atmosphere? All that remains of the book is its didactic value but I think there's much more in it.The only sequence where I found the book spirit is that one set on the train where Mrs Delgado Marthe Keller asks Pereira to not stand watching but to act in any way he can.".

Shootfighter followed on the same path but with a lower budget and less flare.Shootfighter tells the story of two friends Ruben William Zabka and Nick Michael Bernardo who are tricked to fight in a noholdsbarred tournament to the death by a blood hungry shootfighter named Mr. Lee Martin Kove. Their master Shingo Bolo Yeung has to save them from Lee and his cronies.This movie was memorable because it had Zabka and Kove both antagonists on Karate Kid 1984 and Yeung the main antagonist in Blood Sport. Now the acting was average photography was average the plot was average but the martial art choreography was top notch. That's one thing no matter how cheap movies were back in the 80s and 90s they had some awesome fighting.If you love old martial arts films get a pizza a case of beer and watch this retro junk on a late Saturday night.

This low budget martial arts movie which is as most of them very simple when it comes to the story characters directing and other stuff. There is simply no real complex stuff no real dilemma between characters and no development. It's a typical good VS evil story with the haunting past element. A fighter Nick Michael Bernardo returns to his good friend Ruben William Zabka and upon their reunion they decide to sign in on the underground fighting tournament held by Mr. Lee Martin Kove. Nick founds out that the fights are brutal and sometimes to the death. But Ruben is persistent and wants to fight. So Nick asks for help from Ruben's teacher Shingo Bolo Yeung to save Ruben's life. So the movie is actually nothing special. Pretty bad when it comes to some stuff For example actors can't act. Well most of them are martial artists. The real actors are maybe Edward Albert Richard Eden and Maryam D'Abo and I still don't understand how did she get here?. Edward Albert and Richard Eden are not bad actors but they really appeared in much of the low budget films. Martin Kove is also not a bad actor but his villain Mr. Lee is just evil and that's it. He is evil and he looks kind of deadly. Nothing more. Though Kove posses some kind of charisma. Michael Bernardo didn't do much with his character he just under played it. William Zabka was not that bad I think he was decent. Though his character is somewhat irritating. Just wouldn't listen and he is too prideful. And not in an interesting complex way he is just a jerk. Zabka did not move from these kind of films he remained well known for being martial artist on the film or rather a bully just like in Karate Kid. And for the last I saved Bolo Yeung. What can I say? This man cannot act and he doesn't have to. This man has such a powerful appearance on the film such a powerful charisma and character that he simply doesn't need to act. He played himself basically but this time he was the good guy. Go Bolo go! He is the main man.The other things in the movie are nothing special OK the most important  fighting scenes. They were good plausible. Well done filmed. Though there are some that were ridiculous. And I think that music score is pretty interesting especially in training montage. I recommend this film to all martial arts movie fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "WHAT'S YOU NUMBER? is a flimsy bit of fluff based on the novel '20 Times A Lady' by Karen Bosnak and transformed for the screen by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden. It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today's datingquasirelationship scene but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back put feet up and giggle along with it genre.Ally Darling ! Anna Faris has a history of having many exboy connections who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters Ally has exceeded the norm she freaks and believes that she can't find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her exencounters searching for Mr Right she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea Chris Evans a wouldbe musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them to act as her detective. The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent and fingernailsonthe blackboard voice and she looks terrific.

	onyx:emotionText "WHAT'S YOU NUMBER? is a flimsy bit of fluff based on the novel '20 Times A Lady' by Karen Bosnak and transformed for the screen by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden. It is a very light comedy that has some observations about today's datingquasirelationship scene but those impressions are a bit too true to be funny so it is best to just concentrate on the film as a diversion of the kick back put feet up and giggle along with it genre.Ally Darling ! Anna Faris has a history of having many exboy connections who turned out to be losers. Reading an article that offers number amounts for judging sexual encounters Ally has exceeded the norm she freaks and believes that she can't find THE good guy. Deciding to reevaluate her exencounters searching for Mr Right she decides to look up all of her exs to see if any of them have changed for the better. Finding this task daunting she turns to her apartment neighbor Colin Shea Chris Evans a wouldbe musician who sleeps with women every night and sneaks out the morning after to avoid relating to them to act as her detective. The rest is a contrived series of ups and downs of the manhunt that has few qualified candidates. And the end is predictable.For once Anna Faris has snagged a role that shows her talent and fingernailsonthe blackboard voice and she looks terrific. But the biggest treat in the film is Chris Evans appearing in the buff often enough to keep the movie on not only does he enjoy his Adonis body but he seems happy allowing it to buff up an otherwise routine comedy part.

Walking into the theater with the worst possible predisposition I have to admit I left smiling. Men will immediately sympathize with the Chris Evans character Slackermusicianwomanizer. Not the classic perfect catch man of these type of movies which is breath of fresh air. I am not particularly fond of Farris but she was another pleasant surprise. She makes her character very likable and though pursuing a completely ridiculous task she is absolutely relatable. Excellent character development by both we see them grow and change and their on screen chemistry is just right. The reason I think the movie is perfect for all is that it has the right amount of romantic elements mixed with a fair amount of raunchy and naked butts to keep everyone laughing. Not once during this movie did I feel it was falling into a sappy whole and trust me I am the first one to stick two fingers down his throat when that happens sorry for the image. This movie definitely brakes the mold of Romantic Comedy hopefully this is the direction they will take in the future. Let's make one thing clear If you go see What's your number? be ready to laugh be entertained and have a fun time. Don't expect The Godfather cause it ain't. I'm not much of a review writer but there's something bugging me and I want to get it out. As a person who works in the film industry I am particularly offended by the comment left below. You can like or dislike a movie for many reasons obviously nobody has the definite truth. However these folks create develop and put their names out there just to entertain you. You chose to stay behind your computer screen and criticize their work poorly I might add. Guess who's the coward?".

Anna Faris is extremely likable as ever and Chris Evans is very funny and probably a perfect specimen of man in the eyes of many an audience member.Watch the trailer and you'll know how it ends but the journey provides the kind of rude laughs and romantic moments in iconic locations that are becoming ever more familiar in the modern romcom.Like the recent Friends With Benefits not bad and the hilarious Bridesmaids What's Your Number? is ruder and funnier than many older romcoms with handjob jokes pottymouthed dialogue and a female character who is liberated crude and played by a star who is definitely not too shy or vain to embarrass herself.As Faris' character searches for the perfect man among her twenty exlovers cameos from Martin Freeman and Andy Samberg maintain interest but it's Faris and Evans that provide the real laughs and chemistry.Nothing new if you're not a romcom fan but ticks all the boxes for the target audience and keeps the genre headed in a dirtier direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you make an inconsequential movie and make no mistake What's Your Number is the epitome of an inconsequential movie it succeeds or fails on the shoulders of the lead or leads.This one succeeds because of Anna Faris in my opinion a modern comedic actress genius. I have become a big fan of hers and she can even play more serious roles as she did in 'Brokeback Mountain' and 'Lost in Translation. Here she is Ally Darling whose younger sister is getting married but Ally is just getting fired from her job. On the subway home she reads an article that for women that have had more than 20 sexual partners they have a 96 chance of NEVER finding a relationship that will last.So right away the somewhat ditzy Ally starts to make a list of her former partners she needs to see how many she actually had. When she is finally done and counts them up she has had 19. Then after a night of drunken partying she wakes up with her former boss the one who likes to stick his fingers in his pants then smell them. She is disgusted but now she is at 20 and about to panic.The other character that works out well and makes the movie interesting is Chris Evans of Capt America as Colin Shea  the acrossthehall neighbor who always seems to have a different girl over for the night and the next morning he decides to hide out with Ally until the girl is gone.We the audience recognize right away that Ally and Colin are probably soul mates but it takes Ally a much longer time to figure that out. While she hasn't yet she decided that maybe some of her old partners might have changed for the better over the years and one of them might be ideal and she has Colin help her locate them. That idea doesn't work very well.As Ally and Colin spend more time together like shooting baskets in a game of strip horse at Boston Garden or on the spur of the moment getting naked and jumping into the bay they gradually form a bond. Ally's mother wants her to marry the perfect guy who has the looks and wealth and wants to take her to Paris. But the moral of this story if there is one follow your heart and be with someone that you can be yourself with that is the route to happiness.Fun movie and Anna Faris is just great!".

At least in the comedies i've seen her.Then again i really wanted to see Chris Evans in a light romance comedy. Especially in this postCaptain America preThe Avengers period. I think he's another talented actor of this new revolutionary film movement we're witnessing these last 8 to 10 years and i believe he can pull off perfectly some comedy roles.The story is simple in What's Your Number? It has been seen before in movies and TV series. It's about a woman who looks back in her past relationships to find out the mister right she probably missed to notice.The dialogues were funny and awkward the music was pretty fresh and the cast was great and Faris was surprisingly good in this one. Anything more i could say would be a spoiler. It's a generic comedy for some light viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film turned out to be much more than I thought it would be. The story line is really something that any modernday woman can relate to. After the sexual revolution of the 60s it seems like women are still characterized as whores if they have more than a handful of partners while men can screw hundreds of women and never be chastised. As a result progressive women are left with either hiding their conquests or risk being branded a whore  for life. Hard to believe that in this day and age there is still such a double standard.Once Ally Darling played brilliantly by Anna Faris finds out that she has doubled the average number of partners that a woman has had  she is desperate to ensure that her next sexual partner turns out to be her husband. That desire in and of itself is sad. She shouldn't have to think this way and is responding to a status quo ... yet people can relate to the fact that she longs for real love. It's just that she shouldn't be under that kind of pressure. Yet this is what happens when women compare themselves to other women in our society  they often take drastic measures in an effort to conform. What do men do? Their noncomformity is celebrated so they needn't be bothered to even attempt to change it. Got no job? No problem! There's a woman out there who will look right past that happy to carry all of the weight. Sleep around and cheat? Again usually not a problem  as long as you don't get caught. And even if you do there is a strong chance that your woman will take you back. In fact there are entire websites built to help you continue your wicked ways. This is not to say that women are not equally as guilty of being lazy stupid or cheating. Just that women seem to be held more accountable for being those things. To make matters worse for Ally she gets sacked from a marketing job that she hates. So really that's a good thing. She just doesn't know it yet. This is actually one of the best things about this film  if nothing else realize that when one door closes the right door may open  if you give it a chance. This movie is full of that kinda stuff which made it even more endearing.Immediately after vowing to connect meaningfully with her next partner she gets drunk and winds up screwing her old boss. The morning after scene is hilarious... and Joel McHale plays a great douchebag.Her neighbor whom she seems to be the female version of saves her by the bell as he tries to get away from his own coyote ugly episode. Ally realizes she needs to change her life around and comes up with the seemingly brilliant idea of checking on all the guys she's slept with from her past because  gee! They may have been the one! Except that as most of us know  that is not the case. Some people just need to stay in your past as she will soon learn.Hilarity ensues as we see what has been happening with all of these guys. Of course her lofty neighbor has been helping her track the guys down. That is until he realizes he likes her for himself. But her friends caution her that he is just another douchebag and not good enough for her. Certainly not boyfriend material. Of course the truth is quite different  as we will see as the story plays out. I disagree that this film does not compare to other raunchy romcoms  in fact I think it is better than many of them. There are really great messages buried beneath the surface of this movie that are really worth watching. The chemistry between the actors as really great too. As with other films of this type there are some over the top hard to suspend disbelief moments but that is to be expected. Truth is they're still funny even if hard to fathom.Some of the lines in this film had me howling  for the sheer truth behind them. The writing was absolutely superb when it came to that. The main thing about this film is remember that it is in fact a romcom. It is not a Merchant Ivory film. Realizing that  for what it is  it's a great film and I'm really glad I took the time to watch it because I was totally entertained  all the way through. Also  the messages that love means being yourself  not feeling bad about who you are and chasing your dreams  weren't lost on me and if people can get those too then it's really worthwhile to see this movie. Especially at a time when society is still hung up on certain old school values that modern and evolved people could never live up to.".

	schema:headline " Romantic comedy with a pinch of extra topping...";
	schema:reviewBody "For a typical romantic comedy What's Your Number sort of surprised me as it was just a tad more than your average movie of this sort.What initially made me watch it was Anna Faris playing Ally because she usually makes funny comedies and I have always found her acting to be enjoyable and her selection of characters is usually great as well. Her performance in What's Your Number however wasn't her best performance in her career in my opinion. It wasn't bad either it was just that she are better off in straight comedies in my opinion not these romantic comedies. But hey we all have different likes and dislikes.Working with Farris was Chris Evans playing Collin whom I can't claim to be a big fan of. I think I have only seen him in the previous couple of superhero movies that he did. And I think he was better cut out for action movies of that sort compared to the romantic comedies. I will say that Farris and Evans did have a certain good amount of onscreen chemistry that worked out well enough.As for the story in What's Your Number well it is basically your average standard runofthemill plot line here. An unlikely couple starting out as strangers then eventually becoming closer and closer until they realize that the right one was right there in front of them all along. So nothing new to be seen here in that department. The plot did thicken with the layer added when the story was given the part with how many sexual partners does a woman have in her lifetime. That aspect was kind of fun and did add some pretty awkward situations here and there.For a comedy there wasn't all that many laughs throughout this movie. The best scene and the best laugh for me was the very last phone call that Ally got while they were in the apartment. That cracked me up.What's Your Number isn't a boring movie and it does have some more substance compared to other romantic comedies. However I think you have to be a woman to fully appreciate this movie. As a guy I can now say that I have seen it and it is doubtful that I will be putting the movie on a second time unless wifey wants to watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be honest. This was the least challenging movie showing at the  cinema that didn't involve 3D sharks hence its appeal. In a nutshell  Anna Faris vows not to sleep with anyone else unless he's 'The One'  after learning via the ever reliable medium of the woman's mag that  96 of women with more than 20 expartners are unable to find husbands   I don't deny that it's cinematic candy floss.   Unfortunately even with expectations thus lowered What's Your Number?  still isn't premier league viewing. It's a shame really  Anna Faris  and Chris Evans are a likable and immensely buff central couple  which makes them easy to root fordrool over. However the film itself  is merely a sequence of plot devices some of which work more of which  don't. It's a terrible waste  few actresses have as much comic  potential and willingness to make an ass of themselves as Faris. Even  the open comedy goal of Faris revisiting her exes is wasted  despite  some promisingly perverse material numerous cameos including Martin  Freeman and a finger sniffing Joel McHale are fluffed or wasted. The  only positive is that the unmemorable male characters leave Blythe  Danner clutching the best supporting actor role as Faris' demonically  elegant mother by default.  As for Evans while he is effectively rehashing previous roles most  notably The Human Torch as a cocky but lovable man ho' he and his  magnificent abs are still worth the price of entry. Plus the  basketball scene is probably the sexiest thing involving one ball that  you'll see in a cineplex this year.  Unfortunately despite a plausible premise rare is the woman that  hasn't questioned everything about her existence after reading an  article in a lifestyle magazine the film sags. I wasn't expecting an  exhaustive treatise on feminism but What's Your Number? doesn't even  acknowledge the irony of a woman 'taking control' of her life on the  basis of a single spurious statistic in a Marie Claire article or the  flagrant double standard at play as Faris' character freaks out about  her number  a number easily surpassed by her male neighbour. Such  omissions push the film beyond light and fluffy and into outright  vacuous territory instead. Sub plots come and go without arousing much  interest the insurmountable obstacle and various declarations of love  are extremely contrived yes even for a rom com and then there's the  perennial question of how two penniless people can afford such  magnificent apartments I rent a hovel at vast expense so naturally it  bothers me.  In short there were better rom coms released in 2011 and unless you've  already seen them you should probably save this one for a rainy Sunday  evening.".

I came in about halfway so I can't fully speak for the entire movie but I actually enjoyed it. It was a good chick flick to watch by myself while doing chores and it held my attention. I didn't fully agree with some of the things that were said about men and that they don't want to datemarry a woman who has slept with over 20 men...because men get to sleep with lots of women and are basically praised for it so who are they to judge what a woman has experienced? That just doesn't seem very real life to me. Basically from what I saw it was about a woman whose younger sister is getting married and she starts to worry that she won't find a guy in time and doesn't want to make the number of men she's slept with go higher than 20 to find him so she asks a guy to help her track down the past 19 boyfriends and see if they are worth having another shot with. This is not meant to be a comedy gold mine or a sappy love story. It was a tiny bit of both and just the right amount for a movie you're not really taking seriously. It's a great movie to just watch on some down time and I really enjoyed it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ally Darling Anna Faris is having the proverbial bad day. First even though she got up early to make a vegan breakfast for her current beau he breaks up with her. It could be because she asked him to attend her sister's wedding with her and he didn't want things to be that serious. Second her boss calls her into the office to tell her that their marketing company is downsizing and she is being let go. However no other staff member gets a pink slip. As Ally takes the bus home she spies a magazine article about relationships. It seems that women who have had more than 20 lovers remain single throughout their lives most cases. Ally gasps. Her most recent boyfriend was number 19. Therefore she must make certain that number 20 is the one. Suddenly another idea appears. Perhaps one of her past affairs would now work out giving her a better chance for happiness. Although her sister tries to tell her its nonsense as do her other friends Ally begins a search to find her former beaux. As luck would have it an exinvestigator lives right across the hall. His name is Colin Chris Evans and Ally has only smiled at him occasionally mostly because he has an endless stream of ladies coming and going. But after truly talking one day when Colin begs Ally to let him hide out in her space for a couple of hours the hunt begins. Colin will try to track down information on the marketing gal's past flames and Ally will let him dodge women from time to time at her pad. Is this the beginning of a beautiful friendship? We'll see. In the meantime Ally discovers one of the men on her list is a senator who wants her as a trophy wife to hide his samesex orientation! What else will Ally uncover in her journey? And could it be that relationship happiness is right in front of her? This is a really cute and fun romcom albeit a bit racy. If you prefer a film that has the Doris Day touch you should probably skip this one. Faris and Evans make a good combination being very attractive and comic performers and the cast supporting them is nice too. In addition sets costumes script and zesty direction are quite fine making the total package a small winner. If you number yourself in the romcom fan base you should head out to find this one soon.".

There's the anticipation as the main character Ally sees each guy hoping that she won't reconnect with them and the aww moment every time we see Collin and Ally have a moment of love. This movie isn't about fairytale love and finding Mr. Perfect but about finding who you are and someone who accepts you as you are and THAT is perfect. The comedy comes in from many different directions the controlling mother onenightstands drunken toasts flashbacks to how Ally met her old lovers or her having sex with them and overall allaround awkwardness. Despite the sex occasional nudity and swearing this is my new favorite movie. And I would recommend it to anyone who can handle the swearing and sex topic. Very inspiring  Very comical.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking it looked kinda cute. So I wasn't hesitant to see it and thank goodness I wasn't because I haven't laughed this hard in months. What's Your Number was very nearly a perfect comedy. Yes it was lewd and crude like comedies so often are nowadays in the Judd Apatow world of comedy but it didn't go overboard especially given the entire premise is based on sex. The main character seemed to be absolutely tailor made for Anna Faris' brand of slapstick comedy. There were so many scenes where I thought...that is so incredibly Anna Faris. The chemistry between the lead cast was excellent and the script was simply fun and laugh out loud funny. The dialogue was clever and witty and while this film will never be a critics favourite...its outstandingly fun hilarious just a really good time and that is just as important as making an artistic film sometimes.Anna Faris has had some hits and misses. I think she hit her stride when she break away from the awful Scary Movie series and started relying on her cute and clever slapstick comedy that she is excellent at. Yes she often plays the rather stupid naive girl with a heart of gold but I thought her character in this was a little smarter a little more down to earth just your average girl but still with enough silliness to make her role hilarious. Chris Evans is no stranger to the type of character he plays in this. He's the cocky fast talking ladies man that he was in everything from Fantastic 4 to The Losers...however the character works in this film and he's great at it. He does progress in the film to becoming her perfect match and their chemistry is fantastic! The supporting cast is fantastic especially the numerous cameos from Faris' exlovers including Chris Pratt Zachary Quinto Joel McHale and Andy Samberg. Her friends and family are all great in their small but fun roles.Coming mostly from Television Mark Mylod does a terrific job and clearly has a quirky fun sense of humour because everyone seems to be having a great time and just letting their characters show off how great they are. Faris really is the shining part in this film. She is a brilliant comedienne and I think she channels some of the all time great slapstick comedians with this role. Its really too bad that it didn't do better at the box office and please don't let that deter you because this is truly one of the funniest movies I have seen in such a long time. A hilarious fun raunchy comedy. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "In What's Your Number? casual and cool Chris Evans walks with distraught yet upbeat Anna Faris on the Boston street. His Colin says Ally what guy really cares about the number of guys you slept with? Great scene. Surprisingly What's Your Number? is actually pretty good. Director Mark Mylod's movie is the latest of the raunchy in your face romantic comedies in the mold of Bridesmaids but not as well crafted. Based on the novel by Karyn Bosnak 20 Times a Lady the screenplay by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden is initially blunt and crass and void of whimsy. This also explains the affinity for Lionel Richie songs. What's Your Number? wants to be The Hangover but lacks the cleverness. Part of the deal is that many of the characters are uninteresting caricatures. Fortunately Faris and Evans breathe life into Colin and Ally and we can authentically pull for them. Blythe Danner as Ally's controlling and disapproving Mom Ava also generates a hilarious edge.Ally Faris is having a bad time. She is laid off by her Boss Roger funny and weird Joel McHale at her advertising job in the City. Her current clueless vegan boyfriend Rick funny Zachary Quinto refuses to go with Ally to her perfect younger sister Daisy's quirky Ari Graynor wedding. Daisy is marrying the love of her life awesome Eddie charming and handsome Oliver JacksonCohen. Ally is also the reluctant mediator for Daisy and their Mom Danner. Daisy wants to invite their estranged Dad wacky Ed Begley Jr. more drama. Ally has an odd epiphany. She reads an article related to the Bosnak novel's conceit that a woman has a near zero probability of finding the one after 20 lovers. Ally does a sex inventory. According to her calculations she is at the tipping point 19. This is revealed in a hysterical bar game with Ally's girlfriends with copious penis and vagina jokes. Most of the jokes are funny.Enter struggling musician and handsome player Colin Evans. Colin is Ally's apartment neighbor she is in 6C duh. Every morning Colin retrieves his newspaper covering his shredded body with a kitchen towel. Evans's breezy charm and fun out shines his absno small feat. Ally strikes a deal with Colin. She will allow him to hide at her place after his onenight stands in exchange Colin will help her track down the 20 dudes she slept with. Yes 20you have to see the movie. If Ally can get with one of the 20 then she will escape her fate. Colin has a gift for this coming from a family of police officers. Evans is sunny and playful yet gives Colin a quiet personal passion for his music. He and Faris have an easy chemistry that works. Ally's true passion is crafting clay miniatures. In context the whimsical chemistry and partnership of Colin and Ally is predictable. Oh wait this is after all a romantic comedy. I think screenwriters Crittenden and Allan rediscover their narrative path as they veer back to standard romantic comedy instead of shock and awe comedy. For one thing it is more satisfying.Conflict arises albeit manufactured. Colin actually locates Ally's high school sweetheart the mysterious and enigmatic Jake Adams brilliantly stiff and vibrant Dave Annable. Jake is from a rich family and is now an international benefactor. Colin hides this from Ally but she uncovers the conspiracy. From Colin's point of view how can he compete? Mom Ava would be elated.Faris and Evans make What's Your Number? work despite its shortfalls. They have a hysterical strip basketball game of HORSE in Boston Garden. And when they fall for each other it is authentic. Too bad the material is not witty or evolved enough. Faris is perky and spirited in spite of it all as Ally. She brilliantly never overplays it. Faris fleshes out well a seemingly sketchy character. Evans is fun and surprisingly vulnerable. He is great as the aloof charmer who really has a big heart. Evans's strong suit may be action hero. I think he is a gifted romantic comedy lead. What's Your Number? is predictable and could have been written better. But I like romantic comedies because as general rule they end well. Faris and Evans make it worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wonder if any girl out there really do sneak off from the bed to the bathroom to freshen up before their partner wakes up to see them in a state sans hair all over the place morning breath and probably a drool hanging off somewhere. At least it's something that's worth putting on film in both Bridesmaid and What's Your Number where the protagonist does just that to impress I suppose. Maybe everyone does it and it's life's greatest secret that I'm oblivious to.While Bridesmaid was a sleeper hit with a cast of relative unknowns on the big screen What's Your Number is that typical romantic comedy where you can safely bet your entire fortune on the nice little outcome of an ending and just about how girl meets boy and they fall in love inevitably in the shortest time span possible where the stars align for everything magical to happen. What's probably unique here is that the lead characters are both promiscuous with Anna Faris' Ally sleeping with at least 19 men in her life so far and finding that her lack of a love life and with random lovers every now and then going way over the national average of 10.5 the magic figure an average American woman dates before finally settling down. Fearful of being labelled a slut after a straw poll conducted with her soontobemarried sister Daisy Ari Graynor and friends she's taking a vow of celibacy and is determined to make the next person she sleeps with her husband.Chris Evans' Colin is her next door neighbour whom she enlists her from in tracking down her exes since there could be someone from her past who would have made it good and better yet doing so doesn't increase her number of men she slept with which provides plenty of comical flashbacks providing Anna Faris an opportunity to ham it up together with a select group of supporting characters some of whom are completely different from the time she once knew them while others will make you wonder just what she saw in them ranging from support acts by the likes of Martin Freeman Andy Samberg Anthony Mackie and even Zachary Quinto amongst others. Ally strikes a winwin deal with Colin centered around being able to hideout at her apartment so that he doesn't have to deal in the aftermath of his one night stands making a clean exit and sending a signal to his flings it's all over. Talk about a mutually beneficial relationship that you know will head somewhere between the two.And if the film works which it does it boils down to two words. Anna Faris. She's building a career based upon ditzy characters and frankly she's finding a knack at hitting on all the right places and delivering punchlines without missing a beat and having what it takes to take on physical slapstick comedy without looking too dorky nor embarrassed with the need to dabble in toilet humour. It's watching a quintessential comedian going through her repertoire of tricks that on one hand you've seen most before yet still eagerly anticipating more from the performer to deliver her routine once more. Evans was wonderful as her co star and the stripbasketball date was something that could raise temperatures allowing the actor to continuously show off in this film his Captain America buffed up physique that will either make you drool at or look on with envy.For all the glossy fashion rags teaching women how to lead their lives perhaps this movie says it best with the aged old message of happiness being able to be oneself instead of living up to expectations set by others be it friends or family and to find someone who will accept you for who you are and not what you have to try to be. Which is very frequent in Ally's life as the various manhunt episodes reveal where she has to learn to cook speak with an accent and so on. And it's true how miserable one will be in the long run despite short termed bliss if one can call it as that.I was half expecting a wicked twist to happen at the final act since there's an elusive Jake Adams Dave Annable that Ally is desperately looking for which Colin constantly runs into zilch in his findings and what played out was pretty straightforward and careful as well since it took some pains to explicitly address a plot loophole that you'll forgive it for since that will spell some anticlimatic finale. But as I said what held the movie together is Anna Faris as the one woman tour de force playing to her strengths in a typical stereotyped role and the very easy on screen chemistry shared with Chris Evans. Definitely a datemovie any couple can consider.".

Loved Faris's accents Borat and the Swedish chef had me under my chair. It was really funny and I recommend it to boys and girls because this is not the kind of a movie that makes a boyfriend throw up. Oh and the part when she was trying to get to the wedding when she said Why am I doing this why don't I just wait him at the apartment? was hilarious because I always wonder why the HELL they do that?? And a BIG plus was that the movie took place in Boston I sick of a the happilyeverafter people living in NY or LA. Anyway a goodwatch gonna buy the DVD. D".

	schema:reviewBody "You will ask Why have you rated this so high? It's a nonthinker right? Well yes mostly but it has a bit more depth than you'd expect. And it has Anna Faris who I had never heard of  except I loved her animated character in 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs'. Never saw any of the Scary Movie series nor Brokeback Mountain. Nor did I watch Friends.Betsy and I went to see this movie Thursday after 'The Ides Of March' to cleanse our palate as Betsy put it. We wanted a light romantic comedy that fit into the right time slot for us and this movie was one we hadn't seen but had seen the previews for. In a way it covers some of the same material as Bridesmaids' ptooey and yet in a lighter funnier nondisgusting manner. Anna plays Ally Darling a woman who wakes to find she's been sleeping with another jerk one of many. She then goes to work only to be fired. On the way home she reads an article that say's the average woman has only had sex with 10.5 menand those who have had sex with more than that are not likely to marry. Ally counts and finds she has 20 to her credit. OK in the old days it would have been to her shame but hey it's 2011. But her younger sister Daisy played by Ari Graynor is getting married to a guy she Daisy had once dated rejected but now loves. Ally begins to think maybe she should search among her discards to see if she can find the right guy. Meanwhile she has to cope with her acrossthehall neighbor Colin played by Chris Evans.Colin is an unstinting womanizer who has no desire to commit. He also likes to pick up his daily paper naked. OK so all this is a s predictable as can be. And there is a cast of okay to good supporting actors including Blythe Danner as mama Darling divorced from papa Darling played by Ed Begley Jr. So why do I give it 4 stars instead of just 3? Anna's cute little posterior. Her naked or nearly naked butt is nearly everywhere in this movie. And she makes the most of her assets moving and dancing about with great abandon whether dancing playing strip horse or whatever else comes along. I have since learned she has several movies in which she bares it all. Now for you ladies who think I'm being sexist here I must add you get to see a few men's tushes too. Captain America oops I mean Colin has a few bare buns to show and while I'm not so inclined I guess they are OK at least by Betsy's standards. There also seems to be a fun chemistry between Faris and Evans. Both Betsy and I agree the movie was funnier and sweeter than 'Bridesmaids'. It's a good date movie for a date with someone you've been out with before. But it does have an 'R' rating for sexual content language and nudity. So if you're a 13 year old boy I give the same advice as I did 'The Creature'.".

It was smart hilarious and very well crafted and thought out my biggest problem with most of those big budget messes  they think we are stupid!. Anna Faris is so adorable and likable  and the exboyfriends were terrific! I found myself waiting to see who would be doing a cameo next  they were so well cast! Chris Evans was also so cute  I am a new fan!!I am so sick of movies that claim to be set in a certain city  when you know they are shot in LA or Canada in other words  on a set. This was obviously not the case with WYN. It really felt like Boston was another character in the movie  sort of like New York was in Sex and the City.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the promos for this pic when I saw Crazy Stupid Love and Our Idiot Brother. It seemed kind of funny so I took a chance on it tonight.I'm not a big fan of the bubbly blonde genre nor do I frown upon it but the film seemed to have lots of sexual references almost too many for a character like Anna Faris's Ally Darling. In this regard the film is a bit of a disappointment as it dove immediately to uninhibited descriptors of sex as opposed to building up to those moments where Anna's character has to blurt out the obvious. But hey it's a chick flick romcom so you can't really fault it too much because it does mean well.I can't say I laughed too much at this film but laugh I did and I truly wanted to laugh more but the humor bounced from raunch to intellectual with some shades of gray inbetween. So it was that I found myself hard pressed to absorb and laugh at all of the sexually oriented humor but nor was I a prude in that department as I could very much appreciate some of the finer points of sexgags.Some of the alleged romantic moments seemed way over the top. So much that one wonders why they were put in there to begin with. And casting Colin Shea as the hunky yet uninteresting neighbor who might be a sleaze seemed a bit of a stretch. Particularly when Ally's past suitors physiques pail in comparison to her sleuthneighbor. The other stretch is the notion that perky cute blonde living on her own in Boston would have a hard time finding mister right. But it's a movie so we take the premise for what it is and either go with it or shrug and begrudgingly accept what is put forth.Technical marks all hit their cues. There're some interesting shots here and there and one wonders how they got some of those. Otherwise this film isn't about great cinematography nor sound just about a quirky little girl in a highly explicit verbalsex film. Now having said that I think the delivery and editing of some of the lines not to mention some of the lines themselves could have been better executed for the film does feel a bit flat in act I and doesn't really pick up until a third of the way into act II.Still it is what it is. Not a film I'd go see again something I might rent in the future just to see what went into making this film.Give it a chance.".

Hollywood certainly loves to tell the tale over and over again. In fact this is director John Sturges's second telling.The Gunfight at the OK Corral done in 1956 by this director had as the climax the famous gunfight. Here in Hour of the Gun Sturges starts his story with the gunfight and the results afterward.Ike Clanton played by Robert Ryan in his usual grim fashion is not about to let Wyatt Earp triumph after killing some of his gang and his kin. He sets in motion a series of events that bring tragedy on the Earp family and a sinister turn in the character of Wyatt Earp.The usual lackadaisical and quizzical James Garner is also pretty grim in this picture. He's throwing away the law he's sworn to uphold and the set of moral rules he lives by. And it's tearing away his character which is something Doc Holiday is deeply concerned with.James Garner ranks right up there with all the fine actors like Henry Fonda Burt Lancaster Randolph Scott Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell who have played Earp. James Garner never turned a bad performance in on the screen and he even got to play Wyatt Earp again in Sunset for Blake Edwards.And Jason Robards Jr. goes every step of the way with Garner as Doc Holiday. Holiday is the usual cynical alcoholic who's a jaded idealist and recognizes Earp as the real deal hero. His concern for Earp's character disintegration registers well in his performance.Watch for a young Jon Voight preMidnight Cowboy as Curly Bill Brocius a Clanton gang member.This is a real western classic. And except for Hugh O'Brian's television series the most accurate portrayal of the OK Corral events.".

It stars James Garner Jason Robards and Robert Ryan. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography is by Lucien Ballard. Story begins with the shootout at the O.K. Corral and tells of the aftermath involving the major players.Although John Sturges' Gunfight at the O.K. Corall ten years previously proved to be popular the director was never happy with the finished project due in no small part to the fact that Hal B. Wallis controlled the script. Here Sturges takes control and crafts what in essence is a sequel to the 57 movie. Leaning more towards a character study with a dark edge Hour of the Gun is refreshing in giving the Wyatt EarpDoc Holliday characters a different story than the one we normally see on the screen one that actually attempts historical accuracy where possible.Viewing it now it's easy to see why the film was received coldly back on release. The Western movie was just about creaking along as a viable cinematic genre as it was but with Sturges and Anhalt portraying one of America's folklore heroes in moral decline it's unsurprising that it found itself out of sync with the times. However time has been very kind to it where over decades the reevaluation of many a psychological Western has seen it viewed as one of the more bolder and cynical tinted oaters from the 60s.With a fine script from Anhalt to work from who also features as a player in the film as Holliday's whiskey smuggling carer the cast work well. Ryan files in for villain duties as Ike Clanton and Garner as Earp and Robards as Holliday make for a suitably sombre pairing. There's also some quality in the support ranks where Albert Salmi John Voight Jorge Russeck and Karl Swenson leave good impressions. With Goldsmith tonally aware for the scoring and master photographer Ballard utilising the Panavision on offer for the Durango locations it's an all round well put together production. Some fat could have done with being trimmed off it to get it 10 minutes shorter for the story starts to feel over long entering the last quarter. But Hour of the Gun is not only a better than your average 60s Western it's also one of the better Wyatt Earp movies available to those interested in the subject. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I am surprised that there are so few comments posted on this gem of a western. The movie has a slightly documentary style and some reviewers have accused it of having cold and unsympathetic characterisation. I think that the Wild Bunch apart this is the finest western of the sixties. Garner acting against type is a superb Wyatt Earp. Jason Robards depiction of the doomed consumptive dentist Doc Holliday loyal witty infinitely deadly is a triumph. This movie is purely about revenge one man's determination to kill his brothers assassins.

The movie has a slightly documentary style and some reviewers have accused it of having cold and unsympathetic characterisation. I think that the Wild Bunch apart this is the finest western of the sixties. Garner acting against type is a superb Wyatt Earp. Jason Robards depiction of the doomed consumptive dentist Doc Holliday loyal witty infinitely deadly is a triumph. This movie is purely about revenge one man's determination to kill his brothers assassins.

	schema:reviewBody "Although often criticized for its considerable historical inaccuracies director John Sturges' 1957 film GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL has gone down in history as one of the western film genre's finest efforts. But stung by those criticisms Sturges chose to revisit the story and go beyond the gunfight itself ten years later in 1967's HOUR OF THE GUN.Whereas GUNFIGHT made the gunfight the climax of the film and the later 1993 film TOBSTONE placed it in the center HOUR OF THE GUN actually begins with Wyatt Earp James Garner and his brothers and the TBridden Doc Holliday Jason Robards confronting the Clantons and McLowerys at the corral. It also goes into the trial that got the Earps and Holliday off of murder charges. And it also goes into how the thirst for revenge that salivates in Ike Clanton Robert Ryan turned Garner's Wyatt Earp from a stoic lawman to almost a mirror image of Clanton just with a badge. Robards' Holliday can't stand to see his friend disintegrate but he doesn't want to leave his side despite his penchant for booze which is exacerbating his tuberculosis.As has often been pointed out in films based on historical events including Wyatt Earp's Arizona period HOUR OF THE GUN does not totally stick with the facts. Ike Clanton's role in the Cowboys gang has been embellished in this film in truth Ike wasn't all that swift upstairs also Wyatt and Doc didn't track Clanton down to Mexico and kill him Ike would be killed in a robbery some years later and not at Wyatt's hand. It must also be said too that instead of having filmed HOUR in the same southern Arizona locations as GUNFIGHT Sturges filmed it on locations in northern Mexico and even the most discerning filmgoer who has been to either place will spot the differences.Still despite these flaws and the fact that Robards was already too old to be playing the 36 yearold Holliday HOUR OF THE GUN is a fairly substantial western more hardedged and cynical than its illustrious predecessor. Garner perhaps serving as the bridge between Burt Lancaster's portrayal in GUNFIGHT and Kurt Russell's in TOMBSTONE is at his very best as the increasingly disillusioned Wyatt and Robards does a good enough turn as the good Doctor. Ryan's portrayal of Ike Clanton is one of very lowkey businesslike villainy perfectly suited to this constantly underrated actor's talents. Jon Voight is also on hand in his debut film portraying Curly Bill Brocious.Helped out by Lucien Ballard's firstrate cinematography and a flavorful Jerry Goldsmith score HOUR OF THE GUN is an underrated sagebrush saga that deserves to be seen especially as it came in the years between the wideeyed optimism of the John Ford films and the more cynical westerns that were to follow in the wake of Leone and Peckinpah.".

It may not have been realistic but it worked. James Garner is good as Earp. Stoic but not unfeeling. Good casting with Jason Robards as Doc Holliday. Even better that he was not scripted to cough himself to death in every scene. Whatever happened to big nose Kate? In fact what happened to the women? Not one cast or credited.

	schema:reviewBody "The gunfight at the O.K. Corral is just over. Bodies lie in the dust. Now the killing really begins. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed but first a civics lesson. Ike Clanton Robert Ryan is determined to buy or shoot his way into power in Arizona. The territory sooner or later will be a state. Clanton knows all those Easterners are moving in with their own ideas of law order and who should be in control. Standing in his way is Wyatt Earp James Garner. Earp is a nononsense lawman who'll take down anyone who breaks the law. He's fast enough with a gun and ready enough to use it that he keeps getting in Clanton's way. If that doesn't frustrate Clanton enough Earp has his two brothers to back him up along with his good friend Doc Holliday Jason Robards. Clanton makes his play to eliminate the Earps with the shootout at the corral. By now the movie is only ten minutes over. The gunfight itself takes 30 seconds just as it did in real life. Hour of the Gun tells us what happened next. Clanton brings charges of murder against Earp and Holliday. They are narrowly acquitted. Clanton follows up with back shootings of Earp's brothers leaving Virgil crippled and Morgan dead. Earp is not going to back down and now the grudge is personal. Holliday will stick with Earp. Clanton is going to use the law as well as his gang to run Earp out of the Territory or see him dead. Earp is going to legally go after the men he suspects attacked his brothers. Legally he has warrants for their arrest. Legally Doc Holliday points out to Earp Those aren't warrants you have there...those are hunting licenses. That's exactly how Earp sees things. There may be a legal posse set up by Clanton to run down Earp but Earp is on a hunt of his own aided by Holliday and a small group of deputies. Hour of the Gun is just as linear as that. It's also one of the grimmest and best directed Westerns most people have never seen. Too bad because James Garner may have given the best performances of his career. He plays a man of deadly commitment to the law and doesn't hesitate to use the law to justify his own brand of capital punishment before trial. Robards almost seems to recognize the weight of the role and what Garner is doing with it. There's no competition from Robards just masterly support. As far as Robert Ryan goes we don't see much of him but when he's on he gives a lot of authority to Ike Clanton. Ryan provides the believable ruthlessness that leads to what turns out to be Earp's Vendetta Ride the hunting down and killing of those who attacked his brothers. Yet toward the end of the movie when Earp is determined to bring retribution directly to Clanton one way or another Hour of the Gun slips down a notch on the old gun belt. Earp has given up any pretense of enforcing the law. With Clanton in Mexico Earp is just going to kill him. It depends on Doc Holliday of all people to provide a bit of lawabiding morality. The whole thing's hypocrisy Doc tells Earp. The rules they tack on say unless you're wearing that badge or a soldier's uniform you can't kill. But they're the only rules there are. They're more important to you than you think. Play it that way Wyatt or you'll destroy yourself. I know you. You can't live like me. Wyatt Earp shows that he can. This is a good movie that just happens to be a western. John Sturges directed it ten years after he turned out the LancasterDouglas big hit Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. As a lean mean piece of movie making Hour of the Gun puts the earlier film in the shade. Even so Hour of the Gun was a flop. It is unrelentingly grim. There is no romance and almost no females just lots of tension a number of quick gunfights several great line deliveries from Robards and Garner's performance. I think it's a better movie.".

Westerns were soon replaced with parodies of westerns such as Support Your Local Sheriff Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid etc. Fun movies to be sure but the cynicism which had begun to take hold in America in 1967 and made them hits was a death knell for serious films about the old west. For me Hour of the Gun has stood the test of time. It's as absorbing now as when I first saw it. If it were rereleased today would it succeed at the box office? Probably not. Although the cynicism of 1967 is gone it has been replaced by malebashing. This film is strictly for guys. There's no female lead character or even a minor one. No wonder Hour of the Gun is still consigned to the rotten tomatoes bin. Although it's a darn good movie its hour may never come at least not in our lifetime.".

The Panavision widescreen gives it a more epic scope than O.K. and in the ten years between the two films Sturges has also much improved his miseenscene. Whereas O.K. was often unassuming at best and plain dull at worst in its framing additionally hindered by some obvious studio shots presenting the outdoors Sturges gets the most out of his shots here. The sequence in which Virgil Earp is gunned down in a dark street is one example. Thankfully enough the dreadful singing cowboy songs of O.K. are nowhere to be heard instead we have one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores...and that says something. Acting is also a touch better than in the predecessor. While the LancasterDouglas team of O.K. was indeed that  o.k.  it was bogged down by the repetitious dialogue they were given. Garner and Robards both somewhat underestimated actors give fine performances here. And while Robert Ryan as the villainous Ike Clanton is not given much to work with he makes a reasonable impact as the scheming cattle baron and thief. Finally and most importantly the timing of the film is much better than O.K. which was simply a chore to go through and a bore when one got there. Hour of the Gun alternates politics both sides of the conflict getting the law on their sides in itself a truthful and interesting account of law and order in the Wild West and action scenes with Wyatt and comrades pursuing the attackers of his brothers. The depiction of Earp's vigilantism is relatively realistic though the claim of the film to tell it as it happened is of course somewhat overexaggerated especially concerning the fate of Ike Clanton.As far as westerns from the end of the golden age of that genre go Hour of the Gun does not rank among the very best but is a minor treasure nonetheless a very worthwhile film that tells the events after the famous showdown at the O.K.

	schema:reviewBody "Hour of the Gun director John Sturges' sequel to his 1957 Gunfight at the O.K.

Was he as the posters and ads for this picture asked a 'hero with a badge or coldblooded killer?'  In the hands of a director like Sam Peckinpah this idea probably would have been more interestingly handled but Sturges was a largely workmanlike director and so this film starts well but soon seems tiresome.  Still there's much to admire here.  James Garner is very good as Earp and Jason Robards has fun as Doc Holliday though he's hardly consumptive and too old for the part.  The Panavision widescreen photography is beautiful to look at making a letterboxed presentation of this film a video necessity but this film's real saving grace is a magnificent masterful score by Jerry Goldsmith.  Fans of film music have remembered it better than the movie it so well supports.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the shoot out at the OK Corral Ike Clanton brides officials to start legal proceedings against Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday for the murder of his brother. The judge weighs up the evidence and spots some contradictions in key parts of the prosecution case and thus acquits Earp and Holliday and rules the shoot out was part of them fulfilling their duties as lawmen. Unsatisfied with this ruling Clanton gets a couple of his men to kill Wyatt's brothers setting the law man on a quest to bring Clanton in  but is he seeking justice or revenge? I had never heard of this film until recently but I decided to give it a try when I read it was a sequel to OK Corral. In essence it is a rather oldfashioned western but it has a nice mean air to it that I found complimented the material. The plot is simple though and it never gets to grips with the darker side of the legends of Wyatt and Doc perhaps because it was Sturges that directed but I would lie to see the film as it would have been made when The Wild Bunch turned the western genre on its head. Because here the focus is the story where really it needed to be on Wyatt the man as he loses touch with the lawman and starts to resemble much more of a driven revenge figure. It is a shame that the film doesn't go deeper into this but as it is it is still an enjoyable western that does what it does well enough for genre fans.The cast are good despite not having anyone carried over from the first film. Garner does make for a mean Wyatt and even if the material doesn't go deep Garner's eyes show that he understands what he is doing. Robards is enjoyable as Holliday and has one of the film's best dialogue scenes when he confronts the man he once looked up to. Ryan isn't as key as I had hoped and the narrative keeps him to the side for the majority of the film. The support cast are mainly good enough for the genre but it is Garner and Robards who dominate the whole thing.Overall this is a solid and enjoyable period western. The dark revenge and hatred within Wyatt is hinted at but it is only really Garner who seems to want to really bring it out of his character as the film only toys with it while staying in firmly oldfashioned territory. Could have been a lot more interesting then but still manages to be an enjoyable western for fans of the genre as it was before changing in the late sixties.".

He makes a fine if overage Doc Holliday in a different key from Tombstone's Val Kilmer or Wyatt Earp's Dennis Quaid. The irony of this movie is the portrayal of Ike Clanton as the powerful selfcontained jefe of the outlaws a sort of cross between Old Man Clanton a genuine leader and Curly Bill or John Ringo. The strategic omission of Ike's begging scene in the gunfight only underlines the writer's intention of raising the status of Ike Clanton so that the climactic gunfight has more weight than would have been possible had Ike been more accurately written. It is satisfying to see Wyatt kill Ike too bad it never happened. The usual errors in holsters and hats may be overlooked although it makes one value Tombstone more but the journey from recognizable historical references to a trip to Mexico undocumented by any historian with whom I am acquainted and the offer of Chief Marshall of Arizona to Wyatt Earp is ludicrous. However this is not a documentary it is Sturges' second half of Gunfight at the OK Corral and as such it stands as a Western  how is that put now?  inspired by real events. All the women are omitted Doc is from Baltimore? Brocius is killed strangely compared to what really happened names are oddly changed new characters introduced for no apparent reason etc. The acting is better than the script.

	schema:reviewBody "Sturges originally attempted to cast Hour Of The Gun  a loose sequel to his Gunfight at the OK Corral  with some of the same actors with whom he worked back in 1957 ensuring a natural degree of continuity. Sergio Leone planned the same creative economy two years later by initially casting the famous station opening of Once Upon A Time In The West with a reunited Lee Van Cleef Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood. Various factors made Sturges' scheme impossible but leading parts were still secured by some fine actors James Garner as Wyatt Earp Jason Robards Doc Holliday and Robert Ryan Ike Clanton as well as way down the cast list a young Jon Voight. Music was commissioned from Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography was from Lucien Ballard who contributed so much to several Sam Peckinpah films.In the event the reception afforded the results was lukewarm. Hour Of The Gun was seen as too cynical and with a bitter tone that though reflecting changing times was less welcome in a conservative genre still a couple of years away from the controversies of The Wild Bunch. Audiences who had enjoyed the less complex moralities of such Sturges movies as Bad Day At Black Rock The Magnificent Seven or The Law And Jake Wade and so on were perturbed by the portrait of a lawman who in the event as his best friend says could either be seen as a hero with a badge  or a cold blooded killer. Garner's usually genial screen persona was subsumed in a portrayal of Earp as someone who eventually loses sight of his own guiding principals in an obsessive pursuit of personal vengeance. Adding to the uncertainties was the sight of a Doc Holiday whose own moral trajectory went unexpectedly the other way to such an extent it brings the two pals to blows.This picture is based on fact. This is the way it happened announces Sturges' movie at its start a complete antithesis to John Ford's often quoted dictum from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance 1962 to 'print the legend'. Scriptwriter Edward Anhalt who has an apt cameo in the picture as Holiday's resigned doctor in the sanatorium reduced the level of historical inaccuracy noticed in Gunfight At The O.K. Corral even if as events moved further along from the OK fight and its effects matters still tended to drift the elder Clanton for instance did not end up shot in Mexico. And ironically most weaknesses in Hour Of The Gun can be put down to its avowed intentions to stick closer to the twists and turns of history. Whereas Gunfight At The O.K. Corral has a largely simple arching structure leading to an inevitable climax its successor is more episodic. A good deal of running time is devoted to the various faceoffs of its survivors  in courtrooms in the townships or on the range as animosities were carried further. In Sturges' original crack at the legend Earp defends society and the law and can be more objective in the process even though it also concerns family in the new film in the light of the aftermath he takes it far more personally. Legalities become ever more precarious until the changed if still honourable lawman confesses I don't care about the rules anymore. I'm not that much of a hypocrite. The classicism perceived in the earlier film the moral clarity characteristic of cinema of the times and demanded by the producer is replaced by a more baroque narrative which paints a much darker psychology.Hour Of The Gun begins with one of the finest of all western openings. The combination of a fine Goldsmith score its main theme a combination of a reluctant growl and worldweary call to arms the director's characteristically assured staging of action within the widescreen frame as well as the tension brought by imminent events are striking. The long largely wordless moments as the Earps walk shoulder to shoulder resolutely facing destiny derive their power almost entirely from Sturges' powerful miseenscne  a sequence which incidentally may have inspired Peckinpah when staging the climax of The Wild Bunch. After such a start any narrative would be hard pushed to sustain such tension and the episodic nature of what follows as mentioned above does not always work to the director's advantage. But Garner Robards and Ryan who also appeared in Peckinpah's film are excellent enough to keep matters on track whilst the turning of various events gives Sturges plenty of chances to stage smaller gunplay between individuals. There is no distracting love interest and the sentimentality brought by the Frankie Laine ballad which echoes through Gunfight At The O.K. Corral  a hangover perhaps of the singing cowboy tradition  has been discarded.Today the particular mood of Hour Of The Gun seems better attuned to our cynical times than Gunfight At The O.K. Corral which glows with a nostalgia not thought of when it was made the lasting comfort of clean heroes and clean lines of plot. Garner's Earp is not afraid to get his hands dirty in matters of personal revenge even if it means ultimately he feels unable to accept promotion to adjutant general chief lawman of the territory. By setting his later film in the times after a notorious gunfight Sturges preempted such later directors as Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner who have also been concerned with the consequences of violence in such films as Unforgiven and Open Range. To the extent that Hour Of The Gun is all about the lasting turmoil and personal costs brought by the fatal encounter by a dusty horse lot on 25th October 1881 it has much to say that is relevant today.".

	schema:headline " Sturges's Outstanding Revisionist Sequel to Gunfight at the O.K. Corral";
	schema:reviewBody "Bad Day at Black Rock director John Sturges revisited the Wyatt EarpIke Clanton feud in Hour of the Gun with James Garner and Jason Robards that he began in 1957 with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in the Hal B. Wallis production of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Although Sturges' Hour of the Gun boasts greater visual and historic realism than Gunfight at the O.K. Corral this sequel of sorts veers off course toward the end and twotime Oscarwinning scenarist Edward Anhalt of Becket contrives scenes that are not historically accurate principally for the sake of dramatic license to provide audiences with closure. Unlike the Paramount release that featured Rhonda Fleming as Wyatt Earp's love interest Sturges dispenses with women altogether in this United Artists release and focuses on the feud. The predominantly allmale cast features lean rugged Robert Ryan as Earp's chief reallife nemesis Ike Clanton and in his second motion picture lanky Jon Voight of Midnight Cowboy fame. Indeed as much as possible Anhalt and Sturges have tried to stick with history. For example the dialogue in the courtroom sequences came verbatim from the actual transcripts. Moreover unlike previous Wyatt Earps James Garner is allowed to play the legendary lawman without a halo. This Earp wants to kill out of brotherly vengeance than take the villains in to stand trial. After all the tagline for the film reads Wyatt Earp  hero with a badge or coldblooded killer? Known for the affable screen characters that he played over the years Garner makes a great change of pace as a vengeful Earp in a taut grimfaced performance unlike anything that he had done before and not again until he starred in Vic Morrow's spaghetti western A Man Called Sledge. The action opens on the main street of Tombstone as our blackclad in business suited heroes Wyatt Earp a mustached James Garner Doc Holiday twotime Oscarwinner Jason Robards of Once Upon a Time in the West Morgan Earp Sam Melville of Big Wednesday and Virgil Earp Frank Converse of the TV show Movin' On march down to the O.K. Corral after Ike Clanton's gunmen have assembled for the fateful showdown. The shootout is over in a mere matter of minutes. During the shooting Ike Clanton ducks into a photography shop and sits out the gun battle. Morgan takes a slug in the shoulder while Virgil receives bullet in the leg. After the gunfight County Sheriff Jimmy Ryan Bill Fletcher of 5Card Stud and his deputy Frank Stilwell Robert Phillips of The Dirty Dozen confront the Earps and Holiday. Ryan tries to arrest them. Not today tomorrow or ever growls Wyatt. You don't have jurisdiction in the city of Tombstone. If you did you couldn't make it stick if you did. Clanton parades the bodies of his dead through Tombstone and charges that the Earps murdered them. In court however Judge Herman Spicer William Schallert of Will Penny concludes otherwise based on factual evidence and the Earps and Holiday are exonerated. Clanton's gunmen principally Curly Bill Brocius Jon Voight Andy Warshaw Steve Inhat of Madigan and Stilwell ambush Virgil Earp at night while he is checking doors. Virgil is crippled for life and cannot run for city marshal so Morgan replaces him. Morgan wins the election but before he can serve the same three Clanton gunmen blast him in the back with a shotgun while he is playing billiards. Wyatt accuses Clanton's men of homicide but he cannot furnish a witness and the killers go free. Meantime the honest citizens of Tombstone get Wyatt an appointment as Deputy U.S. Marshal and warrants to serve on those Clanton men alleged to have participated in the shootings of Wyatt's brothers. Wyatt hires Tucson lawman Sherman McMasters Monte Markham of Guns of the Magnificent Seven to help him out while Doc decides to observe the letter of the law and join Earp's posse. Doc recruits a couple of gunmen Turkey Creek Johnson Lonny Chapman of Baby Doll and Texas Jack Vermillion William Windom of Cattle King and they pursue Clanton's killers.The joy of watching any John Sturges western lies in the choreography. Sturges is one of the few directors who can make the simple act of men crossing a dusty frontier street look ultracool. Mind you he knows how to block a scene so everybody is shown moving around for a purpose. Sturges' movies bristle with these brilliant cinematic maneuvers. Sturges stages all of the shootouts with his customary aplomb. Gunfight at the O.K. Corral differs drastically from Hour of the Gun. Gunfight qualified as a more bombastic western than the spartan Hour of the Gun. Sturges has eliminated any love interest for Earp in Hour of the Gun so this biographical horse opera is all about business. The photography the settings and the atmospheric help make this western outstanding. Sturges generates suspense with Wyatt Earp's moral decline his willingness to let his personal feelings overwhelm his judgment. Jerry Goldsmith's evocative music seems inseparable from the gritty action. Jason Robards is both brilliant but ironic as the morally unscrupulous gambler who provides commentary on his friend's moral lapses.".

Meantime the honest citizens of Tombstone get Wyatt an appointment as Deputy U.S. Marshal and warrants to serve on those Clanton men alleged to have participated in the shootings of Wyatt's brothers. Wyatt hires Tucson lawman Sherman McMasters Monte Markham of Guns of the Magnificent Seven to help him out while Doc decides to observe the letter of the law and join Earp's posse. Doc recruits a couple of gunmen Turkey Creek Johnson Lonny Chapman of Baby Doll and Texas Jack Vermillion William Windom of Cattle King and they pursue Clanton's killers.The joy of watching any John Sturges western lies in the choreography. Sturges is one of the few directors who can make the simple act of men crossing a dusty frontier street look ultracool. Mind you he knows how to block a scene so everybody is shown moving around for a purpose. Sturges' movies bristle with these brilliant cinematic maneuvers. Sturges stages all of the shootouts with his customary aplomb. Gunfight at the O.K. Corral differs drastically from Hour of the Gun. Gunfight qualified as a more bombastic western than the spartan Hour of the Gun. Sturges has eliminated any love interest for Earp in Hour of the Gun so this biographical horse opera is all about business. The photography the settings and the atmospheric help make this western outstanding. Sturges generates suspense with Wyatt Earp's moral decline his willingness to let his personal feelings overwhelm his judgment. Jerry Goldsmith's evocative music seems inseparable from the gritty action. Jason Robards is both brilliant but ironic as the morally unscrupulous gambler who provides commentary on his friend's moral lapses.";

Members from Clanton gang result dead and as revenge Ike orders kill to Earp's brother . A furious Wyatt Earp swears vengeance and with help his friend Doc will do pay one for one the killers his brother.This traditional western deals what happens later the gunplay at Tombstone . It's a sequel from superior version and more famous actors Douglas and Lancaster by the same director Gunfight at the OK Corral1957 . Prior to production  United Artists had made it quite clear to director John Sturges that none of the primary roles were to be filled by the actors who played the same characters in Sturges' previous Wyatt Earp film . Wanting to distinguish this film from the previous one  they demanded different actors be cast in the roles . The main character is a historical figure  in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most known duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in the classic My Darling Clementine in 1946 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and Victor Mature  the famous Gunfight at O.K.

This thrilling film contains a spectacular and atmospheric musical score by the great Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was professionally directed by John Sturges.The picture was based correctly on real events  thus  In 1879 Wyatt and his brothers and Doc Holliday arrived in Tombstone . Virgil became the town marshal . Trouble brewed up among the Earp gang and ClantonMcLaury faction which resulted the explosive showdown that lasted thirty seconds and Virgil and Morgan were badly wounded . Less than a year after the incident  Morgan was killed in an ambush . In response Wyatt and Holliday tracked down and shot the two man they considered to be Morgan's killers and were forced to elude a pursuing posse in Colorado . Far from fitting the popular description of a standoff among good guys and bad guys some historians consider the incident OK corral to be nothing but cold blooded murder of the Clanton and McLaurys some of whom were unarmedby the Earps and Doc . The Earps always maintained the show down was fought in selfdefense . Wyatt Earp lived on until 1929 but will always be remembered as the hero of OK Corral  however Doc  an alcoholic dentist turned gambler and gunman will die soonest .".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh we do love our westerns do we not? So many fine articulate reviews posted for this installment of the Wyatt Earp legend. As it happens I am currently accumulating a collection of two great almost mythological stories that are told again and again on celluloid the saga of Wyatt Earp and Alice in Wonderland.Although Wyatt and Alice may seem to occupy disparate niches in the archives of story telling I propose that they are similar in that each tale acts as something of a template or even an archetype from which various interpretations of the core story can be rendered. It seems somehow OK that liberties have been taken with the exact way the events either in reality or in the mind of the author originally occurred in either story. The concepts of good evil morality the impetus to do the right thing The Wyatt Earp story as well as the need to make sense of our dreams where the logic and proportion so often fall away are foundational to the human experience. To tell the story of Wyatt Earp or Alice in Wonderland with the characters and events reimagined by the current story teller allows us to examine these same core concepts through the fresh perspective of an individual's own interpretation.In Hour of the Gun it seems that director John Sturges is asking us to compare the morality of the two key players Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton. Such a comparison is of course done with regularity but in this case we have the events as they are laid out by Sturges to judge. For example in this telling of the story Earp kills Clanton. We know it did not actually go down this way but let's take this version at face value and see where it leads us.It occurs to me that we are being asked whether Wyatt and Ike are in essence the same man. Ike Clanton is described not as a mindless killer but rather a man with a goal rule the world he is creating on his own terms free of the interference of the Easterners. Clanton would prefer to work within the law if this were back east I could make law the way they do but in the end Clanton is willing to use death and violence to reach his goal.It is the same with Wyatt Earp is it not? Wyatt generally works within the law. He's even willing to 'make law' such as prohibiting the carrying of firearms within city limits. But once the blood of his kin is in play Wyatt forms up a goal that becomes more important than the moral code he has been living by. Still he attempts to work within the framework of the law. He stretches his morality to the very brink when he goads his adversaries into drawing down on him. Yet even near the end when he and Doc track down Ike Clanton in Mexico Wyatt at first tries to work with the local authorities to apprehend Clanton. Only when the witnesses are killed and there's no chance of a trial to see justice done does Earp for the first time really step completely outside the law.So is Mr. Sturges telling us that when push came to shove Wyatt and Ike were exactly alike? And perhaps by inference that all humans under the right circumstances will sacrifice their core beliefs a juxtaposition of the old adage Every man has his price?No. I don't think so. Hour of the Gun leaves intact a key difference between Ike Clanton's actions and the actions of Wyatt Earp. Ike was willing to sacrifice the lives of innocent people to reach his goal. He appears to care nothing of either the loss of his own brother or the deaths he sponsored of the innocents who would testify against him.Sturges's Wyatt does not go that far. Even when Earp tricks his adversaries into gunplay over arrest the argument can be made he did so because there was no hope of a fair trial. To support that idea we have Doc Holliday's line You couldn't get a conviction in a Federal court or a local one. And Wyatt never killed an innocent man to get to the men guilty of assaulting his brothers. For Wyatt Earp blood was thicker than law but even then he did not place himself above the law out of pure selfinterest. Vengeance carried out in the name of another rises a few clicks above that. And when Wyatt 'made law' it was for the common good.Therein lies the difference and I would insert that when asked how this tale of the Old West applies in modern life I would suggest that sometimes men standing in judgment of one another don't always take this further step of looking beyond a person's actions to their core motivations.Of course at then end of the day every film that tells the Wyatt Earp saga from Frontier Marshall in 1934 to Wyatt Earp's Revenge in 2012 begs the question What would be the right thing to do in such circumstances? What would YOU do?".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a real shame this film isn't more readily available on DVD or better yet Bluray. It's a different kind of western but definitely a classic  as you might expect from director Sturges and leading men Garner and Robards.Much of the time Hour of the Gun feels almost like a docudrama condensing sweeping events into a line or two of dialog. For example when Ike Clanton is finally driven out of Arizona a major turning point in the film it happens offscreen. There's little attempt at character development. Garner is no Brett Maverick here he's a stiff taciturn gent probably quite close to the personality of the actual Earp. Robards has more scope with the alcoholic Doc Holiday. In a way it's his personality that provides the only emotional anchor for the film.But what makes the film worthwhile is its solid construction. The photography is spectacular with dramatic groups of figures composed against cloudless southwestern skies. Do NOT see this film pannedandscanned! Dialog is terse and efficient. And the storyline it's not really a 'plot' is compelling STARTING with the famous shootout at the OK Corral and tracing the feud between the Earps and Clantons to its bitter end.This is definitely not a slambang action film. Every climax is underplayed. Characters are grim and aloof. And inevitably it's not quite faithful to the known history. But it does present a different view of the character of Wyatt Earp and presages later treatments such as Tombstone and Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp.If you like westerns at all and can find a decent print of this film don't pass it up.".

A lot of recent movies indicate that Virgil and Morgan were shot the same night when actually Virgil was December 1881 and Morgan killed three months later in March. In this movie with James Garner I noticed there was no mention of Sheriff Johnny Behan a large character in the true story. Also Wyatt did not kill Ike Clanton and it showed at the end of the movie. From my info Ike was killed rustling cattle years later after Wyatt had left Tombstone for good. The character Doc and Wyatt were alway played by older men actually Wyatt was 33 at the time and Doc was about 35. The best one was Bruce Boxleitner I married Whatt Earp. Also there was no mention of any women Mattie Earp Josephine Marcus Earp Allie Earp Virgil's wife or Big Nose Kate Elder. A lot was left out.".

	schema:headline " Solid Western with James Garner and Jason Robarbs but I expected better";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1967 Hour of the Gun is John Sturges' sequel to his 1957 film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Although he used the same production team he had to use different actors due to the length of time between the movies. Unlike other films covering the EarpClanton conflict Hour starts with the famous gunfight and details the aftermath focusing on Wyatt's avenging the Clanton's cowardly attacks on Virgil and Morgan. Hour has so much going for it that I expected a better film. For one thing how can you go wrong with James Garner as Wyatt? Unfortunately his performance is decidedly onenote stoical but it's not James' fault as he was just following the script I suggest catching him in a Western from a year earlier the excellent Duel at Diablo. The opening is great with the notable score by Jerry Goldsmith and the welldone gunfight at the OK Corral which true to history lasts only 30 seconds unlike the elongated version of the previous film. But the story immediately bogs down with the complexities of the EarpClanton feud. As such the rest of the film is essentially talk talk someone gets shot talk talk someone gets shot more talk someone else gets shot all combined with a lot of traveling across the Arizona countryside in one way or another horse train carriage. I don't mind talk if it's interesting in one way or another but this talk all centers around the complex conflict at hand.Jason Robards is quite good as Holliday but he's too old for the part in real life Holliday was 30 yearsold at the time of the gunfight and died six years later. The Mexican locations are magnificent but the story is rather convoluted and is only engaging if you're up on the two factions and the characters thereof. Another problem is that there are NO WOMEN except for a brief flash of the Earp's wives. Nevertheless Hour of the Gun is certainly worth catching if you're interested in the Tombstone story and favor the quality cast. Speaking of which Garner is laconically stalwart while Robert Ryan almost steals the show as the main heavy Ike Clanton. But the film bombed at the box office and understandably so since the previous film with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas was a long fading memory people were naturally lost concerning the complicated EarpClanton conflict. So I suggest viewing Gunfight at the OK Corral or better yet Tombstone 1993 or Wyatt Earp 1994 before viewing this one. That's what I just did and it helped me savor this version more than on my previous viewing. On a side note look closely and you'll spot Jon Voight as Curly Bill in one of his first feature films.The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE B".

Harvey Keitel as the lead investigator into the case gives an amazing performance supplying the audience with the right level of doubt about Cynthia's story to keep the suspense flying until the end  and all while sitting in the same chair for most of the film! Glenne Headly shows just how good she is as Joyce goes from kooky and fun to paranoid and potentially dangerous.

Indeed the whole presentation of the film is very different from the funky CHOOSE ME one of my favorite films. The music the pacing the INTENT of the filmmaking are markedly different from this director's other works.MORTAL THOUGHTS is not a wholly satisfying film but I am humbled to say that I was amazed by Demi Moore's performance. I have never sought out a film starring this husky voiced pinup and have found her offscreen persona to be arrogant and grating. In the big films of hers that I'd seen I considered her adequate...striking to look at but slightly mechanical and hollow. Here playing a working class beautician from New Jersey her emotions are very real and she has a human warmth and vulnerability. Plus with the tricky lighting and creamy lenses of big budget cinematography taken away one can see what a natural diminutive beauty she really is.Moore's interaction with the rest of the cast is never false. This is understandable with Bruce Willis as he was her husband at the time but she plays equally well with respected serious actors Glenne Headley and Harvey Keitel. In fact in one midpoint interrogation scene in which he's slow coming in on a few cues Keitel actually seems to be holding Moore BACK! Who would have thought?Maybe the surprise of seeing Moore be so convincing makes the performance seem stronger than it actually is but I truly was deeply impressed with her work here. Perhaps playing a woman close to her own roots Moore was raised in a series of trailer parks unleashed something in the actress and let her relate to the role on a more personal level. Maybe having Rudolph who is famous for drawing tender intimate performances from his actors see AFTERGLOW! at the helm is the explanation. Whatever the reason Moore is a knockout here and the film gave me new respect for her. She is very affecting and unforgettable.".

Be that as it may this is a superior thriller mainly because the story is compelling and the acting is first rate. Demi Moore who plays Cynthia is just outstanding. She commands the screen with her beautiful and expressive features and her great natural skill. If you don't like her I guarantee you will not like this movie because she dominates the film. She is as vivid and unforgettable as an Al Pacino or a Betty Davis.As an aside on the career of Demi Moore I want to say that it's a shame for her that her offscreen personality is not well liked which in large part accounts for the fact that she is one of the most underrated although one of the most often seen and hardestworking stars of the last fifteen years or so. This movie is an example of how she is ignored. The plain fact is her performance here is better than many who have won Oscars and she wasn't even nominated. Another problem for her is that this movie and others she has made are not the sort of films that the Academy pays much attention to. Mortal Thoughts which she coproduced by the way is too lowbudget too common one might say for any part in it to be taken seriously in an artistic sense. Too bad.Glenne Headly Joyce is also outstanding while Bruce Willis is excellent as Joyce's drugaddled boozing wifebeating loser of a husband. The dialogue is right on realistically depicting the lives of New Jersey beauty shop people while the plot told in ersatz flashbacks unfolds nicely with a fine tension.The story is that of two friends Joyce and Cynthia who find they have to cover up a killing NOT a murder but at worst a manslaughter or better yet a case of selfdefense but fall apart as the investigation closes in on them. In a sense they are both like Lady Macbeth with blood on their hands and no effective way to wash it off. They are both appropriately naive as young workingclass women and both act foolishly as many of us might in their predicament.Here's a nice bit of ironic dialogue. Joyce is questioning her ability to convince people about what happened. She tells Cynthia that she isn't a very good liar. But Cynthia reassures her Joyce you're a terrific liar. You just lost confidence in yourself. This is all to the good as far as filmmaking goes. It is the ending that is the problem.One might ask what happened to the ending? Maybe I need to watch this again to be sure I didn't miss anything. But better yet YOU watch it and you be the judge. What I think happened is director Alan Rudolph truncated it. Either that or he decided to try something artistic which I don't recommend in a commercial thriller flick. Maybe they just ran out of money and had to wrap it up. At any rate we are left wondering what is going to happen and who actually did what to whom. Presumably the last flashback from Cynthia tells us how Bruce Willis's character met his end but that doesn't solve the problem of how or why somebody else was shot full of holes. Maybe the producers thought they would wrap it all up in a sequel. Actually there's enough there for one easily.I would also like to complain about a movie that acts out a false story told by one of the characters as though the story were true. That can be done but it must be done in such a way that there is some kind of hint or coloring of the story that allows the viewer to suspect that something is amiss. True Det. John Woods Harvey Keitel makes some compelling arguments along the way to suggest that Cynthia is not telling the truth but we are mislead by the actions that our eyes see and the sounds that our ears hear. In movies since anything can be contrived it is the usual rule to have the camera show the truth while letting the characters do the lying.What might have saved this and what I was expecting all the way through is Joyce's side of the story acted out on screen so that we could compare the stories and make our choice about who was telling the truth.Bottom line better than one might expect with a realistic edge clearly a notch or two above the usual thriller fare.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

But 'The Usual Suspects' nonetheless worked as a film for three reasons. Firstly the lie was extraordinarily entertaining in itself. Secondly it's essentially falsity was brilliantly revealed. And thirdly this revelation forced the viewer to reconsider everything they had seen in the film. If all movies were like this cinema would die but as an isolated film it definitely made the grade.Alan Rudolph's curiously named 'Mortal Thoughts' surely morbid thoughts are actually what feature in this film is a kind of precursor to 'The Usual Susepcts' but less acclaimed and with good reason. The basic tale is less interesting than in the later film there's no cleverness in the revelation and the actual truth does not anyway fundamentally change one's opinion of the characters. The film doesn't even try and fool the audience Harvey Keitel's policeman tells the witness throughout that he doesn't believe what she is saying and once you accept that the woman may be lying then the possibilities are limitless something Singer dealt with deftly by only uncovering the lie at the very end before it truly sinks into the audience that if the story was a pack of lies then the truth could be anything. The result is a film that is reasonably watchable but hardly distinguished. Yet in the true story revealed at the end there's actually a tale of human drama that might have driven a pretty strong film. The secondary tale of someone merely lying about such a story however is comparatively dull.".

Although the film contains some disturbing scenes it is exciting and tense throughout with an impressive and unexpected twist at the end. Set in New Jersey the directing is also good with flashing images and slow motion effects. A creepy but enjoyable film from beginning to end and well worth the watch!".

Bruce plays a character that I haven't seen him tackle before. He does it in an outstanding manner. Glenne Headley as Demi's close friend and coworker drops the accent and does new Jersey as it should be done. I really didn't like this story I was very uncomfortable but I realize looking back that it was right on the money. The subject needs to be dissected. Moreover it needs to be taken seriously and not swept under the carpet as it has in many cases. Stats' read out to be 13 women are being abused or have been in an abusive relationship. Demi shows her mettle she also shows what it's like to come to the end of a violent union. Glenne her friend was supportive and a little shaky at times. I can't figure who wouldn't be but she was also strength for her friend. This was a dark and intense brief look into what some are living through. I am glad that this was made it shows the grit that it takes to just make it through the day with someone of that lifestyle. Demi is the type that is really believable in this there aren't a lot of other actresses that have the ability to reach the emotionally burnedout look and feel that Moore does in this. Willis was and I can't say enough about his performance as he was just a 'natural' in 'MORTAL'.When you can be close and taste it even just a little it is hard to try and blame someone for using the extreme method to exit a relationship just that way. Although they have to take responsibility in it when it's them that started the life together in the first place. There are 'signs' that any person should be aware of before abandoning them self to a relationship commitment. Seek counseling first or talk with close friends around you and don't ever simply base your longing on an emotional state of being...for sure you'll be sorry in the end. And you will in deed be looking for the fifty ways to leave your lover. Recommended...learn from this one too.".

Bruce Willis does what he does best that is to say he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife. Glenne Headly was amazing and Harvey Keitel one of my favorites was once again the consummate cop.But the best part of this movie for me was the realism. The New Jersey accents sounded natural and unaffected especially Harvey Keitel's pronunciation of Joyce's name as Jerce. The homes looked like regular folks lived there not like designerinspired movie sets. The clothes were real the hairdos were real and the way the characters behaved was real.I've seen this film a couple of times and I haven't found any glaring plot holes everything follows a believable and sensible course. If Demi Moore's character is lying she's doing a damn good job of it.The only problem I have with the story  and it is a problem I have with many stories  is that at some point the characters completely abandon their daytoday lives. After Jimmy's funeral it seems that Joyce never returns to the beauty shop that she owns and Cynthia and Cookie never work another day in their lives even though all three women depend on the income from their jobs. I would have preferred to see how Joyce's alleged descent into madness affected her business how her customers reacted to her and how she and the other stylists interacted during working hours.Overall I give this film an 8 out of 10. Great performances by the main characters solid storyline and nothing fake to distract from the story.".

As well as that the title did not seem very inspiring. I mean just how many films are there with the word mortal' in them? I will tell you just over 200 including video films etc. according to IMDb's incredible search facility.As luck would have it firstly there was not anything else on to while away a couple of relaxing hours and secondly a few wellwritten commentaries from other IMDb users I do not take any notice of badlywritten commentaries though of course I do take into account those little mistakes that creep in to commentaries written by people whose mothertongue is not English suggested that I was about to see a perfectly acceptable film.How right they were I am glad to say. If on the one hand Bruce Willis' participation is somewhat limited and what he did was really quite decent on the other a very younglooking Demi Moore 29 when she made the film played a stirring rle which helped to put this thriller drama a head above most of similar ilk.Alan Rudolph's directing of a wellwritten script produced a more than acceptable result aided by those timely flashbacks between the interrogation and previous events. The formula was intelligently employed such that at no time did you feel you were getting lost anywhere along the line  as so often happens in other films trying to use the flashbackflashforward method. Cynthia Demi Moore is helping police enquiries' which means interrogated into the death of her best friend's husband Bruce Willis and as she recounts events the film flashes back at times even synchronising with the dialogues in the interrogation. A handy device which lent much to the coherence and continuity. Good work here by Demi Moore and Glenne Headly as her best friend and it was real good to see Harvey Keitel as the detective see him in Shadrach' 1998 qv Ridley Scott's classic Thelma and Louise' 1991 and in The Piano' 1993 to name a few of his best rles. As in all films of this genre there is that plot twist in the denouement but in this case perhaps it misfires a little it left me with a slight taste of incoherence after all that had happened. It left too many incognitos floating about. Perhaps the idea was not too well thought out or perhaps I was left with the two of clubs and nowhere to put it...... Maybe I am being a little unjust or pedantic as the film is worth your while with some interesting interpretations from all concerned.Just about 6 out of ten on my scale or a couple of decimals higher.".

Since then he's made a good number of movies of his own that from what I've seen tend to be rather uncommercial slow serious painstakingly realistic sometimes maybe a little dull but often very interesting films. This is certainly a high point very interesting indeed and very far from dull. It's a really first rate crime story comprising a long conversation between a detective played by Harvey Keitel and the central character Cynthia played by Demi Moore in one of her best performances. The story she has to tell is relayed to us in flashback and deals with her best friend Joyce Glenne Headly another excellent performance and her truly horrible brutal bully of a husband James Bruce Willis also excellent  hateful and frightening but very believable how Joyce always liked to fantasize about killing James off how one day he does indeed end up dead how they agree to lose the body and say nothing to anyone how their relationship then bends and breaks under the strain and what happens next.The film however does have one major flaw. After slowly revealing its cards with tense interrogation scenes the ending is a complete cop out. Without giving anything away I will say that after working so hard on revealing the facts in the detective's questioning the truth is unveiled by us seeing the thoughts of one of the major characters. This is not only cheating but it also leaves a second major crime unresolved. Despite this I highly recommend you see this film.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Flashback Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I was pleasantly surprised by this film for its guts to take a story and almost present it all through Demi Moore talking to two police detectivesHarvey Keitel and Bille Neal in a room  everything we see is via her character's thoughts and perceptions and ideas of truth and untruth and is entirely in flashback form. The story centers around Moore and her friend Headly recently married to a brute of a guy played by Bruce Willis  and goes from there to murder mystery and the eventual uncovering of what is the truth behind everything. Director Alan Rudolph does a good job creating a story convincingly told throughout by flashback and from the first person whilst coming back to present time repeatedly. This is not as easy as it sounds and has been messed up in other films but it does work here because of Rudolph's sure directorial talents and the acting of Moore Willis Headly and Keitel. Demi Moore gives perhaps one her best performanceslooking lovely I might add as well as a New York woman torn between several things. Headly is as strong as is Willis. All of the actors give serviceable performances and the whole movie looks and sounds like a spin off from The Sopranos or something the way all of the actors walk talk and act. You will have no doubts where the film takes place to be sure. The story is inventive and delivers at the end. I didn't see it coming but others could believably so  but even if that is the case the film works on other levels as well. There are some nice psychological examinations made in the film as well as challenges made to perceptions. I must agree the title is really quite horrible and has virtually nothing to do with this film but all in all this is quite a good thriller that needs another look.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was pleasantly surprised by this film for its guts to take a story and almost present it all through Demi Moore talking to two police detectivesHarvey Keitel and Bille Neal in a room  everything we see is via her character's thoughts and perceptions and ideas of truth and untruth and is entirely in flashback form. The story centers around Moore and her friend Headly recently married to a brute of a guy played by Bruce Willis  and goes from there to murder mystery and the eventual uncovering of what is the truth behind everything. Director Alan Rudolph does a good job creating a story convincingly told throughout by flashback and from the first person whilst coming back to present time repeatedly. This is not as easy as it sounds and has been messed up in other films but it does work here because of Rudolph's sure directorial talents and the acting of Moore Willis Headly and Keitel. Demi Moore gives perhaps one her best performanceslooking lovely I might add as well as a New York woman torn between several things. Headly is as strong as is Willis. All of the actors give serviceable performances and the whole movie looks and sounds like a spin off from The Sopranos or something the way all of the actors walk talk and act. You will have no doubts where the film takes place to be sure. The story is inventive and delivers at the end. I didn't see it coming but others could believably so  but even if that is the case the film works on other levels as well. There are some nice psychological examinations made in the film as well as challenges made to perceptions. I must agree the title is really quite horrible and has virtually nothing to do with this film but all in all this is quite a good thriller that needs another look.";

Both are married and where as Cynthia has a workaholic as a husband Joyce has to fill her hours with a swine superb played by Bruce Willis who is swearing fighting sniffing and talking about sex during the whole movie. But the fun doesn't last long as he got killed.... But the question is  who did it? Demi Moore or Glenne Headly? And the question to that is what the film is all about done in interogationstyle by cop Harvey Keitel. Demi Moore tells her story with flashbacks and bit by bit we know more about the history...and believe us the plot is totally different from what is supposed to be in the beginning. Great art? Perhaps not in fact it surely isn't but all the characters are played with tons of style you will always remember the presence of Bruce Willis here. Sole thing which makes us wonder is who the hell was responsible for the clothes....it's made in 1991 but all we see are Duran Duran Cyndi Lauperhaircuts...and Demi Moore looks awful in her stonewashjeans! But brilliant picture that is....".

Thus The Brood is full of rage vengeance and death wish It is a truly frightening story and in its own way a candid vision of one's personal tragedy. It seems to be a tale from the Grimm brothers and at the same time a reflection on the powerful link between body and spirit. The script is surprisingly complex and rich even if in the end there is definitely something childish in the movie but in a positive way the childish belief that thoughts can kill only tempered by the final sequence when we understand that this little girl so cruelly abused will eventually reproduce what her mother developed. The image of this mother Samantha Eggar at her best revealing her tortured body that evokes a Roman goddess is one of the most terrifying one in world cinema. The Brood is a key to understand one of the Cronenberg's major themes the uncanny How what is closest to us family mother grandparents might suddenly become the ultimate horror.

The Brood is an examination of emotions rage in particular and how one psychiatrist allows his patients to release this rage.  Once released the emotion manifests itself in the form of warts blisters and boils on their bodies.  But Dr. Raglan's star patient Nola has taken this therapy to the next level.  Her emotions bring forth children of rage' which do her unconscious bidding.  This is not good news for her husband Frank and first child Candy.  Nor is it good news for anyone who has ever wronged her.  This movie scared the hell out of me.  One scene in particular outshines every gruesome act ever filmed.  Nola has just revealed that the Brood are indeed born from her rage and her body.  She bites open a womblike sac pulls out her newest bloodsoaked child and licks the little beast clean.  It's like a bad car wreck.  You don't want to be seeing it yet you can't turn away.  My eyes were the largest they've been in quite some time.  Cronenberg also got some great performances out of his cast. Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar really shine here in their doctorpatient roles of Raglan and Nola.  I also identified very much with our hero played by Art Hindle.  He's doing whatever he can to stay sane when his entire world is crumbling around him.  He just wants to protect his daughterwhich brings up my next point.  The Brood is also a metaphor for divorce.  The mother and father when you shed all the horror are having a custody battle for Candy.  It is these two themes divorce and rage that are the heart of the flick and puts it three steps above the usual genre fair.  The film hints that Nola was beaten by her mother at a young age and in return Nola may have beaten her own child.  The cycle of violence has continued here. And there may not be an end in sight because Cronenberg closes the film with a shot of Candy's arm covered in the same warts.  I am beyond impressed with this film.  Cronenberg pre1988 is one of the top filmmakers of the genre.".

The Brood quite often is a genuinely terrifying horrorhighlight with grueling special effects as well as truly disturbing social themes. Cronenberg's own and intelligently written script once again focuses on humans' defining innerevil it's his hobbyhorse and blends reallife issues like child abuse and psychiatric patients with adorable lowbudget horror topics such as mad scientists and eerie mutant killers. Nola Carveth is one of sinister Dr. Hal Raglan's Psychoplasmics patients that unleash their hatred through physical manifestations like rashes or tumors. But Nola is an extreme case so her outbursts are also far more extreme than the other patients and she produces malicious dwarfs that kill everyone who comes near her husband and 5yearold daughter Candy. The premise of The Brood sounds absurd and incredibly farfetched but believe me it's alarmingly convincing and scary. Roger Ebert was wrong again when he claimed this is a boring waste of time. The guy simply doesn't know horror! The last 15 minutes are effectively nauseating perhaps a little too controversial for some people and the evil children are petrifying. What is it with little people that makes them so uncanny? The Brood is less gore than Cronenberg's previous two films the aforementioned Shivers and Rabid but the killings are nevertheless nasty and that one sequence inside the kindergarten classroom is more than enough to skyrocket the shockvalue of this film. Horrorexploitation veteran Oliver Reed is sublime as the overly ambitious Dr. Raglan. Excellent stuff David Cronenberg was and still is a genius filmmaker!".

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg's The Brood is both frightening and shocking. A tale of psychological horror guaranteed to make even the most jaded horror fan recoil in disbelief. The plot in a nutshell  In the care of an eccentric therapist Oliver Reed a woman Samantha Eggar undergoes an experimental form of anger management while parallel to her treatment are a serious of bizarre and questionable murders. At the heart of the story is her husband Art Hindle who is in desperate search of the truth behind the strange goings on. The film is especially visually appealing with perfectly framed scenes cold  stark cinematography and classy looking 70's costume design. The special effects though minimal throughout the film are both amazing and disturbing. Cronenberg masterfully stages the murders in a thrillingly suspenseful and brutally violent manner effectively balancing the terror between what is seen and not seen. It is questionable if filmmakers in today's world would be bold enough to make this film. The eerie musical score by now veteran Howard Shore creates an extra degree of tension to the unfolding events. The performances are all convincing and definitely above par for a horror movie. With a shocking final twist this movie is not to be missed a highly recommended 910!".

	schema:headline " another of Cronenberg's true psychoshock vehicles and one of the most depressing horror films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "The Brood juxtaposes divorce anxiety with parentchild relationships with a story that is basically crazy vengeance that turns to ugly territory sooner than later. Like Scanners it's only gruesome in short spurts some pun intended and while it's noticeable Cronenberg doesn't have too much of a budget to work with he pushes the seamless straightforward style to a high pitch you know something bad will happen just as long as it has something to do with little Cindy Candice Carveth. The body and spirit and duality per usual for Cronenberg figure in yet there's something that makes the Brood much more affecting as soon as it ends we're dealing with the deconstruction of family one also could see this in more sexually frustrated and emotionally demented context in Dead Ringers and as it turns out by the end things won't ever really be happy despite things being all wrapped up in a grisly and bloody manner. Cronenberg may had been going through some of his own personal demons during this period i.e. divorcing his wife and this could be almost like it's own 'brood' a shot of cinematic horror right from the subconscious in the guise of a conscious look at how probing the mind can only work so much and that certain problems can never be solved.Basics first Oliver Reed plays a psychiatrist who is more like a hypnotist as he performs an unusual procedure in a trance state with his patients to rid them of their past trauma with family members or other by getting it to break out in rashes or hives or even if it's malicious enough as with one man cancer. With Nola Samantha Eggar definitely in the highlight of her career she breaks out much differently and with full knowledge of what she can do from Raglan. Little creepy children in parkas who lack navels start killing off members of those Nola was close to including her parents a woman her exhusband Frank Art Hindle is interested in. Frank is at a loss what to do but he does know her daughter is in grave danger even before this happens as she has scratches and bruises on her back. How can the murder spree cease? At first one might wonder if this also has to do with the little girl's detached performance with moments of despair wrapped in a corner. This is actually more of a concrete vision of what the divorce had done even though it looks even creepier and more disturbing that it can't be explained why she doesn't cry or freak out when she finds her grandmother beaten by hammers. There's a disconnect that Cronenberg seems to be exploring and even when there seems to be a flimsy way of showing what the hell it is that Ragel really does or how he hasn't been kicked out of business yet his scenes are perfectly ambiguous we can't totally be sure how he does it but he does it and it's almost his own worst creation with the case of Nola. But what's scarier far more scarier than any typical serial killer or masked being or undead is that there can never really be change to Nola to the monster that she carries out of her womb one of Cronenberg's most notorious images and it's a frightening implication on how uncompromising love and hate go together.If the lingering sensation that this might be far too much of a psychoanalysis type of horror movie don't fret the little mutant kids or whomever are some of the most terrifying beings you'll ever see. Ever. They make Chuckie look like a Cabbage Patch doll with their makeup distorted and gray their expressions always that of something mechanical and in a presence that calls to mind what they might have tried to do in cheap 50s scifi movies only here done more expertly in not showing much at first and then showing just enough to get the idea later on. It adds a whole savage element to the picture where it wouldn't be if it was other beings like adults that were manifested probably even just as unsettling as the ending is with the scene where they kill Frank's wouldbe girlfriend at her job which is teaching kindergarten. Overall the film isn't quite as structured or paced from the start like one of Cronenberg's best it's not until the first big killing scene and then Nola's father's drunkenness that the film really kicks into second gear but there's enough to qualify it as a mustsee from a director who challenges himself just as much as the genre that there can be some exploration of the soul and the actual sickness of the mind behind the usual bloody slayings and conventional characters that populate these movies. Think of it as Jung at the drivein.".

	schema:reviewBody "Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg who brought us scifi hits such as Scanners and the remake of The Fly also created some of the strangest and most frightening psychological horror films of the 70's and 80's. The Brood is one of his best. Although this is one of his first films and got by on an extremely low budget its twisted storyline style and mood offer a considerable treat for fans of this genre. Cronenberg's style is bizarre to the extreme combining a lot of sexual symbolism with graphic violence in order to closely examine the darkest side of human nature. Cronenberg casts Oliver Reed as Dr. Hal Raglan an acclaimed psychologist using a new technique called psychoplasmics to identify deepseeded feelings of anger in patients and manifest them physically. Samantha Eggar plays his most tormented patient who develops an external womb that gives birth to a breed of deformed children that violently act out her vengeance on those she vents her anger on during her therapy sessions. Art Hindle is her exhusband desperately trying to protect their daughter from her crazed mother meanwhile the little monsters attack and kill everyone who has ever ticked her off. The characters are sympathetic especially Hindle and Eggar is disturbing as the mad mommy. The cold winter mood of the film is quite effective and it all adds up to a final showdown at the clinic between the doctor  daddy and the evil kids. The ending is as grotesque and bizarre as anything you will ever see in a movie as Eggar is shown giving birth to the slimy infants. Cronenberg's direction is average and some of the material is a bit unexplained such as the motives of the doctor. One cannot tell whether he is trying to help or hurt people. Nonetheless this is brilliant and demented stuff from the Canadian master of horror and is a must see for fans of psychological horror. Cronenberg also directed Shivers aka They Came From Within Rabid and Dead Ringers. They are all noteworthy.".

A genre that's in a class all by itself. The Brood is another one of his cinematic works that delivers the goods. He creates a thinking man's scare film. Like most of his other works Cronenberg uses psychosis and the medical community to base a terror that only man can create.Art Hindle stars as a man who's wife Samantha Egger is having a multitude of emotional problems. Whilst under the care of a mad genius psychiatrist Brilliantly portrayed by Oliver Reed who shows a lot of restraint using a radical form of therapy for his patients. Like all mad geniuses not everything goes according to plan or does it. The doctor creates something in his star patient that he ultimately regrets. It has to be seen to be believed!One weird film. I enjoyed this one very much. What I like about Cronenberg is that he rarely creates truly good or bad characters well the films that he has completely control over. Everyone has a motive no matter if it's right or wrong. That's what I like about him he makes you think!The film was restored a couple of years ago on D.V.D. It's the original uncut version and it is even creepier than the U.S. theatrical release. Check it out!good stuff...Highly recommended but not for everyone.".

I enjoyed this one very much. What I like about Cronenberg is that he rarely creates truly good or bad characters well the films that he has completely control over. Everyone has a motive no matter if it's right or wrong. That's what I like about him he makes you think!The film was restored a couple of years ago on D.V.D. It's the original uncut version and it is even creepier than the U.S. theatrical release. Check it out!good stuff...Highly recommended but not for everyone.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Brood is not another horror or scifi film about telepathic powers or telekinesis and it is also not just another film about deformed people or animals presented as vicious killers. That's what makes it particularly intriguing. It's about inwardly compressed emotion vented outward in physiological ways. That right there is a brilliant concept. It opens as a man breaks out in welts all over his body during a session with Oliver Reed's breakthrough psychologist as a way of expressing deepseated anger towards his emotionally abusive father. It's by this token that weird hideous creatures are birthed and as the plot unfolds we come to understand their emotive causes for their attacks.It's an early work by David Cronenberg a filmmaker who does not simply make science fiction and horror movies. He uses the most downreaching internal abstract emotions to flow through a story of dark often supernatural horror. There is always an indescribability to his films including each and every one of them when it comes to their pace their elusive effect and the direction of their stories. I was disappointed however as someone who knows Cronenberg's later films very well to find The Brood to not have that mysterious emotional effect through any of those indescribable qualities that are usually present in his work. In fact for a film which is all about emotion and its guises it's quite cold. Each of the central characters is completely wooden and so is the filmmaking itself.At the same time as his characters' bodies are forever augmenting decomposing or both Cronenberg's art has its own inventive mutative fluctuation and here the lowbudget exploitation crust casts off for a chilly detached arrangement not unlike Bergman's Face to Face a few years earlier. The plot would outshine The Bob Newhart Show as the recognized '70s psychojargon sendup if not for Cronenberg's fascinating intricacy and resolute implementation an growth and finetuning of his texture for psychosomatic horror.The Brood isn't a great film by any means due not only to its lacking of feeling that is shocking considering its credentials but also to typical cheesy sequences of suspense and violence. However I will always look at it as a particularly interesting piece of scifihorror camp that stands out against the rest.".

When he digs deeper into trying to uncover a swindle or scandal behind Dr. Raglan's theories of 'psychoplasmatics' people around him are beginning to be murdered by fiendish dwarfish creatures... Cronenberg's Horror films often include some kind of supernatural connection between psychological skills and actual events Shivers Rabid Scanners The Dead Zone and this is also the case here  in a highly bizarre highly original and highly uncanny manner. I do not want to spoil anything by going into detail but I can assure that The Brood has an incredibly creepy plot and some genuinely terrifying and deeply disturbing moments. The performances are very good. Art Hindle makes a good protagonist but the two main attractions in the cast are Samantha Eggar and Oliver Reed. Reed who was brilliant in any role he played is perfect for the role of the sinister Psychiatrist. Eggar is brilliantly psychotic in her role. It is said that Cronenberg went through a divorce and custodybattle at the time he wrote the script and that the role of Nola is modeled after his exwife. If that is true it must have been a nasty divorce. Cindy Hinds who plays the daughter delivers some very good sometimes eerie childacting. The visual style of the film is impressively dark cold and bleak as in most Cronenberg films and filmed in nice Canadian locations. As most Cronenberg films The Brood isn't for the squeamish as it features some disturbing as well as disgusting gore moments.Overall I do not wish to go too deep into detail about why this film is so great but be assured that it is. The Brood is a creepy dark atmospheric intelligent and original gem that is not to be missed by a Horror fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though best known now for HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Cronenberg has made more than his fair share of good material for the horror circle for the past 30 years.I bought THE BROOD on VHS tape years ago but never made it more than a few minutes into it because it begins deadeningly dull... however after finally buying the DVD for 4.00 at Walmart and hearing it was the full uncut version and in nice quality... I took a stab at it again on a rainy afternoon and was surprised to see that it's really worth slogging through the slow spots.Original subject matter eerie violin music by Howard Shore and good acting by a mostly unknown cast. Eggar and Reed get top billing though their characters are tertiary to the father and daughter caught up in different stages of a battle with murderous midgets who are borne of psychological malevolence. There's only a few graphic murders but they are suitably violent and brutal and aren't gratuitous... really what effective horror movies should be all about.Watch for the excellent scene where two of the mutant freaks attack a kindergarten teacher in front of her traumatized students! If only the whole movie could have attained that level of shock it would probably would be better remembered today and not in the bargain bin at Walmart for 4.00.".

	onyx:emotionText "Though best known now for HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Cronenberg has made more than his fair share of good material for the horror circle for the past 30 years.I bought THE BROOD on VHS tape years ago but never made it more than a few minutes into it because it begins deadeningly dull... however after finally buying the DVD for 4.00 at Walmart and hearing it was the full uncut version and in nice quality... I took a stab at it again on a rainy afternoon and was surprised to see that it's really worth slogging through the slow spots.Original subject matter eerie violin music by Howard Shore and good acting by a mostly unknown cast. Eggar and Reed get top billing though their characters are tertiary to the father and daughter caught up in different stages of a battle with murderous midgets who are borne of psychological malevolence. There's only a few graphic murders but they are suitably violent and brutal and aren't gratuitous... really what effective horror movies should be all about.Watch for the excellent scene where two of the mutant freaks attack a kindergarten teacher in front of her traumatized students! If only the whole movie could have attained that level of shock it would probably would be better remembered today and not in the bargain bin at Walmart for 4.00.";

Frank Carveth Art Hindle brings his daughter Candice Cindy Hinds home after spending the weekend visiting his exwife Nola Carveth Samantha Eggar that is interned in Dr. Raglan's Somafree Institute. He finds bruises on Candice's body and he tells Dr. Raglan that he will not bring Candice to visit Nola anymore. Meanwhile Dr. Raglan learns that Nola was abused by her mother and not protected by her father when she was young.Frank leaves Candice with his motherinlaw Juliana Kelly Nuala Fitzgerald to work but she is attacked by a dwarflike creature and brutally murdered. Her exhusband Barton Kelly Henry Beckman comes to town for the funeral but he is murdered by the same creature. However Frank kills the creature and the autopsy shows that it is not a human offspring. Then Candice's teacher Ruth Mayer Susan Hogan has an argument by phone with Nola and she is murdered in front of her class by two creatures that abduct Candice. Frank heads to Somafree and discovers the secret of the deformed children. The Brood is among the best horror movies by David Cronenberg. The plot is very well constructed and the gruesome conclusion is disturbing. The idea of Nola licking the fetus was conceived by Samantha Eggar and censored by censors in Canada United States and United Kingdom. However the Brazilian DVD presents the uncensored version at least of this scene. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Os Filhos do Medo The Sons of the Fear".

This is perhaps his creepiest story of them all and a rather personal one as the director was going through a divorce and custody battle at the time. He makes his own comment on the therapy trends of the time while at the same time telling an upsetting tale of the ways that the sins of the previous generations can visit themselves on future generations.Art Hindle Black Christmas '74 Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 costars as Frank whose unstable wife Nola Samantha Eggar is in the care of a pop psychologist Hal Raglan Oliver Reed who's pioneered something dubbed Psychoplasmics. Nola's his star pupil and eventually we find out why she's giving life to diminutive bipedal creatures that are basically the products of her rage. Whenever she's angry with someone either consciously or subconsciously then WATCH OUT.It's easy to understand how Cronenbergs' early work wouldn't be for everybody as this does get unpleasant and graphic but the material is undeniably compelling for those who have the stomach for it. The actors just draw you right into this odd world where psychiatric techniques can have physical after effects on human bodies that are akin to getting cancer. Hindle is solid and believable Eggar compulsively watchable and Reed whose voice rarely rises above a whisper is under stated and riveting. Other vivid contributions are made by Henry Beckman and Nuala Fitzgerald as Nolas' parents Susan Hogan as kindly schoolteacher Ruth Mayer and Cronenberg regular Robert A.

Redford is debonair and sophisticated and a devout bachelor who is not looking for love but it finds him. The beautiful Lena hires Redford to perform a task and he becomes deeply enamored of her. I think Lena Olin is one of the most underrated actresses in existence and also one of the most sensually beautiful. As the smitten Redford works the tables his thoughts continue to dwell on his desire beautiful Lena he is enthralled with her memory and must seek her to gain satisfaction. Revolutiuon is afoot and Cuba is both the best and worst of times. The Cuban scenery is beautiful. The movie will take you to a time that is past and no longer exists except in memory. A very beautiful movie with surprises and twists and turns in plot. A Sydney Pollack masterpiece. A treat awaits those who watch.".

Revolutiuon is afoot and Cuba is both the best and worst of times. The Cuban scenery is beautiful. The movie will take you to a time that is past and no longer exists except in memory. A very beautiful movie with surprises and twists and turns in plot. A Sydney Pollack masterpiece. A treat awaits those who watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "In this extremely underrated 1990 film the worn glamour of gambler Jack Weill played with expert subtlety by Robert Redford is a perfect echo of the attractive corruption of Havana on the brink of the 1959 Cuban revolution. Locked in the pursuit of his big game with guys who don't even think how much they're playing for Redford's character is unapologetically selfcentred. How many guys do you know who are really crude? he asks with a charming leer. But Jack is drawn into a different climate of feeling when he encounters the earnest committed revolutionary social consciences of Roberta and Alberto Duran played flawlessly by Lena Olin and the uncredited Raoul Julia. Jack falls in love with Roberta and begins to commit himself to a world larger than the circumference of his poker table. The betrayals and cruelties of the Batista regime are echoed in miniature around that table and we can see Jack's growing understanding that however he avoided it in the past his world is indeed political filled with kinds of suffering and commitment that he can't avoid any longer. When he makes his choices and lives with the consequences we watch the brave sadness of a man who knows that if he'd faced then what he understands now he might have won. The excellent performances by Alan Arkin a perfect illustration of the world to which Jack once aspired and Tony Plana as the Cuban reporter who yearns to be brave enough to act on his knowledge expand the textured subtlety of this picture.Why was the film spurned in the US when it first appeared? I have to think that American audiences found it difficult to accept a film presenting both a sympathetic presentation of Castro's revolution and a clear condemnation of covert CIA support for Batista's government. Jack Weill's story is a parable of the pain and glory of growing up. That's a process that American audiences seem unwilling to face.".

As for Jack falling in love with Bobby so fast that's entirely believable and  the look they exchanged at the party where Jack meets her husband for the first time was our signal that this love affair was happening and was one of those insane passions that overtake people not infrequently and in this case again against the apocalyptic backdrop of this incipient revolution which made all involved feel very much at loose ends ready for or dreading the vast changes about to happen to them.

The two films share a similar exotic locale the same shady intrigue and an all too familiar bittersweet romance. All that's missing are Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet but what's surprising about Pollack's film is how well it stands up under the comparison. Robert Redford portrays a tough and charismatic if slightly disreputable gambler who drifts into the decadent Cuban capital during the last desperate days of the Battista regime and it's a pleasure to watch him playing for once a character without a builtin halo. The foreign intrigue played against a background of political unrest is perfectly suited to the swinging tropical setting but the romance between Redford and beautiful revolutionary Lena Olin isn't as convincing. Don't blame the talented cast the script lets them down too often during the last half of the film undermining an otherwise attractive and entertaining bit of highgrade escapist fluff.".

	schema:headline " it seems like they remade Richard Lester's Cuba but the movie still comes out well done";
	schema:reviewBody "It often seems like some critics chastise Sydney Pollack for inserting too much political commentary into his movies. Havana would be a prime example. It features frequent Pollack star Robert Redford as a gambler who goes to Cuba's capital during the last few days of 1958 when the revolution is about to triumph. On the way there he meets Lena Olin the wife of revolutionary fighter Raul Julia. Over the course of the movie Redford and Olin not only develop a relationship but he comes to understand why the revolution is happening.Maybe the movie does go just a little overboard on politicking. But I would like to pose a question are we supposed to focus on these sorts of things and totally ignore politics? Would the world be a better place if everyone just blindly accepted every piece of government propaganda? Because it seems to me that part of democracy is that people are supposed to challenge the government if they think that the latter is lying. Therefore I have to commend Sydney Pollack for doing that in Havana.Another thing is that it seems like this movie was a semiremake of Richard Lester's Cuba starring Sean Connery as a British agent sent there on the verge of the revolution's triumph and discovering the status quo. Even if it is I still recommend it.Also starring Alan Arkin his character is very likely to make your skin crawl and Richard Farnsworth.Interestingly they haven't collaborated since this movie.".

If you don't dig the story you will not deny the songs  I was a youngster in 74 but I still liked it then not even knowing what it meant to be in that state. Now I know what its all about and will preach it to anyone that listens hahaha...don't hate on love  that is all I have to say about that ala Forest Gump  And why do I need 10 lines to be approved for commenting I was done after 5 lines the last few lines are plain gibberish!".

On the surface the film has a very straightforward storyline of a priest played brilliantly and movingly by Depardieu struggling with his own demons that materialise internally and externally.From this basic premise the film can be explored from several key standpoints to obtain real insights into subjects such as the powersource of faith the relationship between thoughtbelief and one's relationship to the world we inhabit.Moreover the questioning employed by Pialat and Depardieu means that the path of thought through these issues is profound intense and disturbing. The film provokes the intellect constantly and I could understand that if there was nothing more to the film one might say that is that it?What takes this film much further is the emotional undercurrent  both understated and abyssal the stunning cinematography and restrained direction. These factors combine to create a complete cinematic experience.One scene stands out in this respect we watch the priest wander the countryside in a daze and he pauses on the side of a hill lush with spring grass. Depardieu looks up eyes searching for insight an answer a response. In a brilliant stroke of luck passing clouds obscure the sun and Depardieu instinctively internalises this shifting light with a simultaneous passing of emotion portrayed through his face and posture. We watch both the internal shifting cloud of emotion and the changing light create a charge and intensity that is rarely seen in cinema. There is an element of the unknowable' in this scene that still moves me even after many viewings.I also enjoy making comparison between this film and Dreyer's Das Wort The Word my favourite of Dreyer's works which has some common theme's explored from different perspectives.A truly great film worthy of the Palme D'or it won.".

On the background of early 1900's rural France the movie revolves around the spiritual dilemma of a young priest  what's the real meaning of service? under the guidance of a dean who soon starts to suspect his pupil might be sort of saint...a fool...or both. Pialat explores the thin line behind folly and sainthood. It's all a gray area where shades of gray detract from the meaning of both light  darkness. Overall not a viewer's movie...little to see. Dialogues are difficult and at times intricate there are no conventional emotions no plot spins. The plot is not really such one...there are subplots such as a young girl with many lovers  gets pregnant by one has sex with another while dreaming of reaching Paris to become the mistress of a MP etc ...there is another subplot about a dying child and peasants' devotion bordering superstition... i wanted to watch this because i wanted to watch another movie by Pialat...his style may not entertain everybody the same way though.Someone makes a point about Bonnaire being no attractive lass and here i have to agree  she's not ugly yet not attractive as well. The point however is that see the other Pialat's movie  nos amours where Bonnaire stars again  that proves the director's dedication to portraying real people within reasonable circumstances without Hollywood gimmicks and porn stars wannabe's eager to show some skin  i always think skin is OK but then got for true porn.I can also guess translations  adaptations may have resulted in a mess.".

As a result I am sure that for some people the narrative barely makes any sense for others it will be unjustifiably dense and even lyric. I am sure some people must love the slow pace and the religious subject matter to the point of exaltation. As it happens with the immensely frustrating film Therese Alain Cavalier 90m 1986 this one never really delivers on its premisespromises. I do not want to give away its really simplistic plot so won't get into the details of its many faux pas dealing with the simple life of a country faux naif. That said I just want to add how the film manages to elevate its pretentiousness to the level of art! The viewer is left to feel below the film's main theme and message mainly on account that it deals with mystical matters not to be understood by the viewing massesespecially by those who watch the film. The point is lost in the main character's constant selfflagellationphysical and spiritual. The in short viewer can never identify with Donissan or with Mouchetteor with anyone else in the film. Even Buuel's The Milky Way 1968 is easier and more fun and this is a stretch. To be sure we know what is going on at all times but it is hard to imagine why is there so much ado about matters that are best left untouched. For a more vivid portray of the struggles of religious significance see Agnes of God 1985 The Last Temptation of Jesus Christ 1988 or El crimen del padre Amaro 2002. Should you insist in seeing this uneven production which is only available in a very poor VHS format go on at your own peril. At leastif it is any consolationit isn't that long!".

	schema:headline " Dreary Catholic angst";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is based upon the novel SOUS LE SOLEIL DE Satan UNDER THE SUN OF Satan by Georges Bernanos 18881948. It was filmed previously for French television in 1971 but that film does not appear to have survived. Bernanos was one of France's leading Catholic authors of the 20th century the other two main ones being his contemporaries Jacques Maritain and Paul Claudel. Bernanos was obsessed with his faith and especially with the role of Catholic priests in relation to their parishioners. His most famous novel is DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST which was filmed by Robert Bresson in 1951. I had to read that novel when I was young and dragged my way through to the very end though it took months to recover from the trauma of so much boredom and tedium. Really all that Catholic angst is enough to turn one's stomach. In this very bad film Gerard Depardieu plays a young priest of overwhelmingly masochistic tendencies. We see him savagely whipping himself with a flail made of steel chain we see him peeling off part of a hair shirt with his blood seeping from his chest. He is clearly a very very sick man who belongs in an asylum. But in his case that asylum is alas his church. To Bernanos all this matters but to those of us who are not in the clutches of Rome it could not be of less interest. The film is badly directed by Maurice Pialat who also adapted the novel into a screenplay with his wife and in addition acted in the film. The screenplay is static and wholly uncinematic. The film largely consists of set pieces which go on far too long where large amounts of Bernanos's anguished prose pours from the mouths of the artificially posed actors. Depardieu is doomed to collide with the appalling character played by Sandrine Bonnaire a 16 yearold narcissistic and amoral psychopath who has killed her lover with a shotgun. Bonnaire aged 20 was a touch too old for the part but she portrays the girl very well despite the long and languid speeches she is required to declaim in tedious talky scenes which never end. Sandrine Bonnaire is an inspired actress and she will always be remembered for what may be her finest role as the lead actress in Agnes Varda's brilliant film VAGABOND 1985 a harrowing and searing portrayal of loneliness and hopelessness. She is also spectacular in Jacques Rivette's masterpiece SECRET DEFENCE 1998 see my review. But all of her efforts in this film are ultimately of no avail because the film stinks.".

No the idea of wishesgoneawry isn't particularly original but there are still some interesting elements done with it  a guard says he'd like to see the Djinn go through him and...it does heh.  Tammy Lauren is adequate as the spunky heroine and Andrew Divoff mostly consigned to minor Bvillain roles  check him out in the Highlander TV series makes a chilling threat.  Jenny O'Hara makes the most of her role as resident supernatural expert.  Yes the gore is excessive but I'm not sure if that's a concession to the 90's audience or a directorial conceit  I'm willing to assume its the former.  For a supernatural thrillerhorror as opposed to a Screamtype slasherthriller Wishmaster strikes me as one of the better efforts to come along since the last Nightmare and the first Candyman.".

	onyx:emotionText "Geez after reading all the thumbsdown reviews I feel almost embarrassed.  I liked Wishmaster.  No the idea of wishesgoneawry isn't particularly original but there are still some interesting elements done with it  a guard says he'd like to see the Djinn go through him and...it does heh.  Tammy Lauren is adequate as the spunky heroine and Andrew Divoff mostly consigned to minor Bvillain roles  check him out in the Highlander TV series makes a chilling threat.  Jenny O'Hara makes the most of her role as resident supernatural expert.  Yes the gore is excessive but I'm not sure if that's a concession to the 90's audience or a directorial conceit  I'm willing to assume its the former.  For a supernatural thrillerhorror as opposed to a Screamtype slasherthriller Wishmaster strikes me as one of the better efforts to come along since the last Nightmare and the first Candyman.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Wishmaster at a midnight screening at the London Trocadero in summer 1998. I had been awake for nearly 24 hours but needed to kill some time. I was only 17 not old enough to get into the 18rated movie and it scared the hell out of me.As we get older fewer and fewer movies have the ability to scare us as we all get more savvy and jaded to the formulaic nature of most horror films. I don't know what it was about Wishmaster that spooked me so bad but I've been a fan of the film ever since.On a technical level Wishmaster suffers from shoddy production design and direction that is barely above that of a cheap daytime soap opera. The acting is mostly appalling with the exception of Andrew Divoff who ravages the role of the DjinnDemerest and some of the dialogue is clunky. But as a whole the movie excels on pure energy alone. I mean not only do you have more injokes than you can possibly count but even Jack the Ripper himself turns up before Lemmy sings hard rock over the closing credits.There's so much potential imagination and overthetop carnage that the film just whizzes by. A lot of the potential isn't taken full advantage of the 90 minute runtime keeps things to the bare minimum but it sets up enough mythology to justify three sequels the first sequel being the only decent one however.The plot focuses on the Djinn that's Wishmaster to you and his efforts to take over the world. As you can see...it's pure hokum but it's the gory bits in between and the Djinn's wisecracking that make this movie worth the money. The Djinn will never be as infamous or as iconic as Freddy Jason Michael Myers etc but that's not to say that he's not an utterly brilliant character. Divoff is absolutely perfect in the role. Even if all he did was real aloud from phone book he'd be mesmerizing.If you like gore ghoulish makeup effects and don't mind horror humor that feels like it was conjured up by a bunch of drunken frat boys then you'll find plenty to like about Wishmaster.".

	schema:headline " Original take on a horror project";
	schema:reviewBody "'Wishmaster' puts a new spin on most people's perception of genies. Most people think of a genie that fulfills your greatest wishes. But asking the Djinn to do so could have horrible consequences as he twists your wishes in order to steal your soul.It begins in the 12th century when a Persian king is locked into a pact with the Djinn who unleashes unholy suffering on the King's people. A man is frozen into a wall a woman turns into a tree another man's skeleton bursts through his skin and walks around and another man turns into a crocodile. It is only through a magician's work that this suffering ends as the Djinn is imprisoned in a fire opal that is then buried inside a statue.Fastforward to the present day when the statue is being unloaded at a Los Angeles dock for a collector Robert Beaumont Englund. An accident however kills Beaumont's assistant and breaks the statue open revealing the opal. One of the dock workers steals it and turns it over to a gemologist Alexandra Amberson Lauren for appraisal. During her examination she unwittingly wakes the Djinn inside and soon he is on the loose. First he starts collecting souls by granting a single wish to certain people. One of the first is a homeless man who sees a nasty pharmacist Reggie Bannister of 'Phantasm' die a violent death from cancer after wishing for it. The Djinn then takes on a human appearance sneaking into an anatomy lab and peeling the face of a cadaver off then plastering it onto his own face. Now he is Nathaniel Demarest Divoff who also plays the Djinn a classy manabouttown. As Demarest he continues his mission of misery by collecting souls  including that of a young sales girl by turning her into a mannequin. Eventually he tracks down Alexandra to her place of work and after taunting  killing the guard 'Friday the 13th's Kane Hodder after the guard challenges Demarest to go through him he confronts Alex's boss. He eventually obtains Alex's home address after granting her boss's wishes and shows up menacingly in her apartment. Alex meanwhile has found out through a friend of Beaumont's that the Djinn are truly evil creatures who are devious  not to be trusted. When Demarest reveals his true identity Alex is horrified when the Djinn starts asking her to make her wishes. When she wishes him to destroy himself the Djinn fires a pistol into his head  which instantly regenerates! He taunts Alexandra by warning 'That which is eternal cannot die. But if it's any consolation at all sweet Alex  THAT HURT LIKE HELL!!' Alex is then taken by the Djinn into his hideous red world where she learns about his origins. When she returns to her apartment she heads immediately for Beaumont's party where her sister is. Demarest arrives just behind Alex where he is confronted by Johnny Valentine Tony Todd star of 'Candyman'  'Night of the Living Dead' 1990. Valentine warns Demarest to leave but Demarest tricks him  'would you like to escape?'. When Valentine says yes he finds himself chained in a steelandglass box filled with water! 'Houdini did it in 2.5 minutes' Demarest says as he walks in.The party soon becomes a horror show starting when one woman turns into a glass statue and then explodes. Demarest reveals his real identity to Beaumont who backs up against a wall then flees. As Alex makes her way through the halls of the museum she is attacked by statues of historical warriors including a Roman Centurion  Genghis Khan. The Djinn then tries to extort Alex's third wish from her  after which he will be able to rule the world. To give Alex some incentive he shows her sister trapped in a fire the flames licking at her back. Through some creative thinking Alex words her wish to suck the Djinn back into the fire opal  the same way he had 8 centuries earlier. While the Djinn had some particularly bizarre ways of dispatching his victims he also showed a demented sense of humor in doing so. Wishmaster also brought together several prominent horror film actors Angus Scrimm  Reggie Bannister of 'Phantasm' Robert Englund of 'Nightmare on Elm Street' Tony Todd of 'Candyman' and 'Night of the Living Dead' and Kane Hodder of 'Friday the 13th' together. This is an original take on horror since most of us don't consider genies to be evil. It offers more than the standard slasher fare the dominated 1980's horror. 810".

It doesn't bother to waste any time gets right to the good stuff within the first few minutes of the film. The gore which is quite plentiful reminded me of a mix of Hellraiser and In the Mouth of Madness which is certainly a good thing. I had a lot of fun playing spot the horror star throughout the film in case you didn't already know this is loaded with cameos! It also has it's share of references to The Exorcist...the homeless man's line about being an old alter boy the Pazuzu statues etc. I thought that was a nice touch to be honest. Divoff created a classic horror villain his voice and mannerisms were spoton. Creepy and beyond cool he fits right in among Freddy Jason Myers or Pinhead. My one problem with the film was the psychic girl. Why oh why did they need to cheapen this film by making her psychic? Oh well it didn't detract too much I guess. Overall this is a great film if you like a nice gory somewhat original slasher flick.8.510".

Then there are the ones that set out to be cheesy from the start... this is one of those movies. From the very beginning you can tell that this movie was merely made to entertain horror movie fans who like their shocks with a side of humor. There's more gore and deaths in this in just the first five and last twenty minutesand quite a few inbetween as well than several other huge gorefests of horror movies put together. Even better you get to see no less than three major horror icons in the film. I'm honestly not a huge fan of this kind of movie but I have to say I found it highly entertaining... if you're in the right mood for it it may work for youit definitely never strives to be something more or different than what it reveals that it is from the very beginning. The plot is pretty tame but it allows for plenty of gore and deathand includes one wellknown possible consequence of wishing for stuff from a genie. The acting is decidedly poor either over or underdone. The dialog ranges but mostly it's very bad. That works to the film's advantage so it's no big deal. The pacing really doesn't leave much room for complaining the film doesn't really let up for a secondit is of course quite uneven... Kurtzman is clearly not a director. The film has a short running time and I found it to possess surprisingly high entertainment value as well. The special effects are great. No way around it. The deaths and gore effects are original and interesting not to mention amazingly pulled off. Fairly low budget but it was spent right... mostly on effects I'd wager. I recommend this to any fan of horror particularly cheesy horror. If you're into it you'll love this. Trust me. And be careful what you wish for. 610".

Who ever makes a wish the Djinn takes their soul. The movie has cameos from many Famous Horror legends. Some include Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger Kane Hodder of Jason series Tony Todd of Candyman etc. Andrew Divoff gives a Great performance as the Wishmaster. If you have seen all 4 Wishmasters you will know in part 3 and 4 There is a different actor playing the Djinn. Andrew proves he is quite talented. Part One is the Best of the Lot. Part Two was pretty good. The others were a complete nonsense. One weakness with the film is the final wish I'm sure they could think of a better and clever ending then that. The lead actress should of just wished for him to go to Planet Neptune and never return to Earth. She could of tried saying I wish for you not to grant me this wish. I wish for more wishes. Anyway enough with that i can go on for ages. The movie was entertaining and worth the watch.".

There's no makeup involved he just has that natural evil smirk we know and love. It just seems carved right into his face it's even more prominent in the sequel but it gets tiresome there.

	schema:reviewBody "It's quite sad when you come to think of it but Wishmaster actually is one of the better American horror films of the nineties... It's absolutely no masterpiece of plotting it's short on tension and atmosphere and the premise is very ridicule yet it's amusing and reasonable wellmade junk that spoils the gorehounds among us. Wishmaster brings forward a new type of bogeyman the evil genie in the lamp only he's stuck in a piece of jewelry here who makes every wish come true in an atrocious and ambiguous way. Supposedly he only requires to fulfill three wishes for the person who woke him and then the ugly Djinn can unleash his evil troops upon the world and wipe out humanity. Tammy Lauren who mainly just did TVwork before is the heroine who stupidly has to trick the malevolent Djinn back into his emerald for good ...or at least until the next sequel. What this movie really lacks is a director! Robert Kurtzman is credited as such but he's a special effects and makeup guy to the backbone and he obviously spent more time supervising the gory eyecandy than putting any coherence in his film. Result everything is well as long as the story only handles about exploding body parts but when two or more characters are having a conversation it hurts your ears. The Djinn is a fairly ingenious horror icon only he talks too much and he shouldn't try to be funny remember that's what made Freddie Krueger a lot less scary as well. If Wishmaster would have been made 20 years earlier I'm sure that Robert Englund's part was played by Peter Cushing! Englund is the rich and eccentric collector who cares more about a rare artwork than human lives and his vanity indirectly is the origin of all the horror. Englund plays a rather big role while other famous genre actors appear in smaller insignificant roles. We have Tony Todd Candyman Kane Hodder Jason Vorhees Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm both Phantasm all making cameoappearances which makes this film slightly more interesting for hardcorehorror fans. This movie will definitely impress younger and enthusiast gorefanatics whose only experiences with horror so far were flicks like Scream or Urban Legends.... I can imagine Wishmaster really looks cooler than cool for them!".

Tammy Lauren who mainly just did TVwork before is the heroine who stupidly has to trick the malevolent Djinn back into his emerald for good ...or at least until the next sequel. What this movie really lacks is a director! Robert Kurtzman is credited as such but he's a special effects and makeup guy to the backbone and he obviously spent more time supervising the gory eyecandy than putting any coherence in his film. Result everything is well as long as the story only handles about exploding body parts but when two or more characters are having a conversation it hurts your ears. The Djinn is a fairly ingenious horror icon only he talks too much and he shouldn't try to be funny remember that's what made Freddie Krueger a lot less scary as well. If Wishmaster would have been made 20 years earlier I'm sure that Robert Englund's part was played by Peter Cushing! Englund is the rich and eccentric collector who cares more about a rare artwork than human lives and his vanity indirectly is the origin of all the horror. Englund plays a rather big role while other famous genre actors appear in smaller insignificant roles. We have Tony Todd Candyman Kane Hodder Jason Vorhees Reggie Bannister and Angus Scrimm both Phantasm all making cameoappearances which makes this film slightly more interesting for hardcorehorror fans. This movie will definitely impress younger and enthusiast gorefanatics whose only experiences with horror so far were flicks like Scream or Urban Legends.... I can imagine Wishmaster really looks cooler than cool for them!";

Anyway minor gripes out of the way 'Wishmaster' is actually pretty good fun  if you're into this sort of film.While bringing an ancient statue to America it accidentally breaks releasing a big blue cartoon genie voiced by Robin Williams who happily makes various pop culture references and grants our plucky young hero the wishes he needs to win the princess' heart. No not really. This is one genie you wouldn't find in a Walt Disney movie  he delights in making all the wishes he grants impact on the person who made them in the most negativelybad way possible. Plus he's not half as sweet as Robin William's classic genie  this one has fangs red eyes and all sorts of weird slippery appendages sprouting out of him. Now it's up to our leading lady Alexandra Amberson played by a Linda Hamiltonesque Tammy Lauren to get this genie back in his bottle  so to speak.I know a lot of hardcore fans objected to the 'change' in the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' films when Freddy started becoming less scary and more comedic taking pleasure in his kills with a snappy oneliner here and there. Well if you like me! didn't mind this then you should also enjoy 'Wishmaster.' The titular evil character is certainly a villain of the latter Freddy films taking his time to mess with his victims rather than kill them outright. I felt this possibly works better here in 'Wishmaster' than the 'Elm Street' franchise because the Wishmaster himself  technically  can't kill anyone outright. He has to mess with them enough to get them to inadvertently kill themselves. Yes that sounds a bit weird and you'll have to watch the film to see how.The film has a real 'nineties' feel it's not just the clothes scenery and hairstyles but it was part of the latter half of the decade where horror films really started to make a comeback largely due to 'Scream' I seem to recall and they were really having fun with the budget they were given. Yes there are hardly any Alist actors involved and the script is a little clunky as times but there are plenty of excellent practical effects creepy sets and a genuine desire to try and do something a little different.Wishmaster' isn't 'dark and brooding' like today's horror films but if you're in a forgiving mood and don't expect too much this one is certainly entertaining enough to keep you occupied for an hour and a half. Plus is spawned numerous sequels although not as many as Freddy or Jason but that's hardly a benchmark with which to judge a horror film is it?".

The whole thing is meant to be a wink to the audience but as a universe with a set of rules it doesn't make sense and the whole enterprise feels curiously like there's no way the Djinn haven't already taken over the world.The central plot is that whomever awakens the Djinni gets 3 wishes and after those are cast all the Djinn take over the earth. Of course the awakener Alexandra never has to say I wish or anything like that and the Djinni can apparently appear as different people and try to trick her into asking for things. Again the classic wish rules are applied sloppily and as a result it's hard to care about anything that's going on with the plot.Andrew Divoff is the Wishmaster here and he has a unique presence and an indelible voice. He's well cast. There's some awful CGI that hasn't aged well at all and a lot of the wishes lack topnotch creativity. There are however two scenes of pure orgiastic destruction that make the watch worth it  statues come to life people are torn to shreds one person has his skeleton literally come to life inside his body it's amazing chaos and panic ensues. These scenes are meant to show off the prowess of special effects maestro Robert Kurtzman who's also the director here and they work. But as a storyteller he's not at the same level.".

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of Rene Clement's Purple Noon I came to Minghella's version of Patricia Highsmith's story with suspicion and an irrational predisposition to dismiss it. Well I was wrong. The talented Mr. Minghella perpetrated a magic trick. The film stands on its own as an entertaining creepy thoughtful beautiful to look at piece of filmmaking. Jude Law throw us for six we're not suppose to feel attracted to the selfish Dickie Greenleaf but we do. His scrumptious performance is alluring seductive. He is a scene stealer of major proportions. In the original Maurice Ronnet's oily Dickie Greenleaf was a perfect lamb to the slaughter. We don't mourn his death and want the murderous Ripley as played by Alain Delon to get away with it. Here when Jude Law is on the screen that's what we're looking at. We're prepared to forgive him anything and everything. I did believed in Gwyneth Paltrow's qualm totally. In the original Marie Laforet played it as a tenuous unclear little excuse. Gwyneth Paltrow gives us a multi dimensional character and we go through her torment every step of the way. That presumably is merit in great part of Minghella's superb screenplay. Other joys are Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. On the minus side Matt Damon couldn't make me forget Alain Delon. His Ripley is a better written character than Delon's and his performance is top notch but Delon was breathtaking on the screen. I think than Anthony Minghella was more interested in the inner workings of Ripley's mind that in the pyrotechnics of a implausible plot. Good. The semi confession of Matt Damon about a basement full of secret truths tells us about his pain about his fear. Delon's Ripley is amoral to the hilt. The murder of Dickie in the original is terrifying. It takes forever. As well as the getting rid of Freddy's body. Minghella never show us how Ripley managed to bring a dead body down the stairs. Clement spends a great deal of time with it. Making it enormously suspenseful. But as I mentioned before we did care about Delon and maybe Minghella new that whether Damon got caught or not wasn't that important. All in all I liked the film very much and the biggest lesson from a film fanatic's point of view is you don't kill your Jude Law half way through a film unless you leave us in the hands of someone who will make us forget him. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins remember that?".

A sensational script adaptation stunning Italian locations and an extraordinary supporting cast. Tom Ripley saw the light before most memorably with the face of Alain Delon in another beautiful outing by the underrated Rene Clement. This time the winning feature is the superbly tailored script that gets inside the heads of the characters giving us a full panoramic view of their privileges as well as their desolation. Tom Ripley the amoral becomes the tortured immoral here. Anthony Minghella gives him a conscience a selfawareness giving the tale an extra chilling touch. Matt Damon's natural dullness works wonders here. This may be his best performance to date. But it is the supporting cast that makes The Talented Mr. Ripley fly so high. Jude Law as the spoiled vain and ultimately cruel Dickie Greenlef is truly remarkable. His worthlessness crystal clear for everyone to see becomes irrelevant due to the astonishing charisma and oodles of sexiness that Jude Law exudes. That in itself makes Gwynneth Paltrow's character totally believable. She's an intelligent woman who must know Dickie for what he is but she puts that aside and we don't question it. Philip Seymour Hoffman's Freddie is a fully fleshed out character who's on the screen for a few minutes but leaves and indelible impression. Great fun to witness his two faces. Creepy and wonderful. But it is Cate Blanchett in a creation worthy of W Somerset Maughan that becomes the icing on this scrumptious cake. I would love to see a film where her Meredith is the central character. This Talented Mr. Ripley cemented my film relationship with Anthony Minghella. I wait for his films with childish anticipation.".

I write this review for the chance that if someone liked one of my opinions they'd come and see what I thought of this masterpiece.I can't remember that last time I felt my heart jerked like this in some time. Well that is a lie I do remember. The last time would have had to of been when I saw Match Point. So let's get the 'if you likedhated' bust out of the way and say if you liked Woody Allen's Match Point I can't see why you wouldn't ultimately like this. Not that they're AT ALL the same nor do I have some sort of expertise on the matter. I just know the rare feeling Match Point gave me is the same this movie gave me. It sets so many moods and it does it with such finesse you find yourself begging for more and more in a devilish fashion you'll catch yourself many times wondering why you're rooting for Mr. Ripley.The movie is only 2 hours and 20 minutes or there abouts. But it feels like a lifetime. Not the sort of lifetime when you're waiting in the DMV. The sort of life time where you experience learn and think about through your life. Not to say this film is a learning experience. But it IS an experience and it will fill a hole in your filmgoing life for that thickplot character ran and dark trenching void you may have. I can't think of a film that quite compares in sequence of events twists character development character inclusion quite like this.Every character is important every event is important and everything you think is pretty null and void. Or possibly that is just me.It should be heavily noted that this film STARTS SLOW as many have said and probably judged it that way. I'd say it picks up speed around the 1520 minute mark and it roller coasters from there. And let me tell you when it accelerates it seriously doesn't know how to stop and personally I never wanted it to stop. This is the sort of film where not even the most annoying person can scream at the film because you're too tight lipped about everything going on and you'll most likely find yourself wanting Ripley to keep going. And when I say Ripley I really mean the movie.And the movie doesn't stop it keeps going. Even after it's over you will be doing a mental tango of all the information you have received and trying to sort out all the pieces. And trust me there are pieces. If you go to watch this film to just watch a 90's flick you're doing it wrong. You will probably find the movie a flop of just dark moments led by lies and deceit. Which it really is. But to those who went to watch this film because we wanted to know why there was so much mixed hype about this 1999 film we should have all noticed there were the smallest bits of puzzle pieces and the biggest amounts of twists that really made this film what it is.I don't even like Matt Damon I personally have a biased grudged towards the guy and his movies. But I'd have to say it's tough to choose between his performances here and Good Will Hunting. He along with the entire cast will tug at heart strings you never thought you had. There are the strings for romance thrillers and horror. These strings are the one's collecting dust and sometimes never see the light of day for a life time. It's rare to come across a film that seems to have everything and goes about it like it's nothing like it doesn't even seem to care if you're watching or not because it all is going to happen with or without you. It's truly it's own living breathing and dark entity.Watch this film if you want a film that will bake in your brain for the days weeks maybe months to come. It's not to late to bring this movie back up into lunchtime conversation in the new century.".

	schema:reviewBody "Patricia Highsmith's original novel is about a charming amoral man who already has all the elements in place before he does his terrible deeds and while Rene Clement's adaptation PURPLE NOON1960 doesn't show us Ripley before he came to Europe Alain Delon certainly was all amoral charm.  In his adaptation Anthony Minghella takes on a different tack showing us Tom Ripley before he became the Talented Mr. Ripleyjust as last year's ELIZABETH showed Elizabeth before she became The Virgin Queen by coincidence both films star Cate Blanchett.  When a filmmaker tries to add psychological depth to what is generally pulp entertainment it doesn't always work but Minghella has pulled it off while keeping it entertaining.There have been some people who think Matt Damon is too colorless here.  In Clement's adaptation that might have been true but the point here is Ripley is SUPPOSED to be a nonentity a blank page waiting to be filledthus lines like I always figured it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody or when Dickie GreenleafJude Law tells Ripley that with his glasses on he looks like Clark Kent by someone like Dickie.  Ripley may have been pretending from day onewhich is how he gets to meet Dickie in the first place but there was nothing sinister about it just a bunch of little white lies.  It's not till he gets entranced by the life in Italy and Dickie's life in particular and then finds himself shut from it that things happen.  And Damon is excellent at going through the transformationand it's not just the glasses as one comment suggested it's the hair the clothes and the whole attitude.Anthony Lane of The New Yorker probably my favorite critic today liked the film but he thought it would have been better if Damon and Law had switched roles.  Again if Minghella was remaking Clement's version sure but not this way.  If you want someone to be an object of desire you better make sure they're desirable and Law is quite good there along with showing the layers underneath.  Gwyneth Paltrow has the tougher role because she has to be both smart and able to be fooled but she pulls it off especially in the scene when she tells Tom she really knows what he is.  Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman are also good in small roles James Rebhorn is dependable and Philip Baker Hall makes a memorable cameo.One more thing there have also been complaints that the first half is too long and the ending is weak.  The first half not only sets up Ripley's slowly falling in love with Dickie's lifeand even Dickie but also sets up some plot points which pay off later so it's necessary.  And when Ripley finally becomes The Talented Mr. Ripley it's unsettling and still delivers a perverse kick.  As for the ending without giving anything away it's the only way it could end he goes on but at what cost?  This is terrific moviemaking.".

It is a theme that sparks the central conflict of the picture that influences each of the main character's decisions and actions.  Each character in the film is either pretending to be something else or playing directly to a superficial identity.  The film unravels each of the character's motivations for doing so and in so doing strips away the layers of reality we construct for ourselves.  Characters either uncover the explicit duality of their lives Cate Blanchette's willingness to admit that she travels under another name or have it uncovered for them Tom Ripley. When each character is laid bare when each character is most fully themselves when each character stops acting and pretending they are undone.The film presents a main character who does his best to pursue another life  but he cannot ultimately follow through with it.  We are trapped by who we are aren't we?  Gwyneth tries to become Dickie's ideal woman to avoid asking him to settle down but she cannot  she wants the home and the family.  This is her undoing  she weeps in the film I must have pressured him.  Dickie can't escape the fact that he loves the nightlife  that he strays that his attention only lasts as long as the diversion. He says he will marry Gwyneth but we know that his eye can never stop roaming. This is his undoing.  Dickie's pal  superficially polite while snide and arrogant at the same time  is much smarter than he appears which leads to his undoing as well.  When each of the characters lets their guard down and becomes who they are it destroys them.  Each of the characters has a tragic flaw that they try to ignore or play to a flaw which undoes the perfect lives they all pursue.The ironic twist is that Tom Ripley is the catalyst for all of this  yet his tragic flaw is that he has no flaw.  While each of the main characters has an identity they are running from Ripley HAS no identity to speak of. He starts out pretending and he pretends through the entire film.  Who IS Tom Ripley?  Even Tom himself wants to know.  One would think that this would enable him to become the perfect actor  when you paint on a blank canvas one would think you can paint anything.  But even Tom blank as he is distills down to someone  even if it is a blank canvas a real nobody.  And it is not only himself he is unsure of  it is the entire world around him.  Among his first lines in the film is a line uttered while listening to a jazz record  he mumbles to himself Can't tell if it's a woman or a man.  It is this uncertainty that informs the world he sees and how he relates to it.  Is Tom gay or straight?  Is he evil or good?  Even Tom doesn't know.The film points out that we cannot run from our own darker half.  We are all tempted to become someone else  anyone who has been made fun of in school who has longed for the life of the rich and famous can identify with this The enemy is not without it is within.  It is this same duality which haunted and tormented so many of Hitchock's characters most notably but not exclusively Norman Bates in Psycho.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is a worthy heir to that film classic in its ability to get the audience to sympathize and empathize with Tom.  We feel his love for Dickie Greenleaf  we feel his frustration at being shut out of his life  we feel the awkwardness of being trapped in a situation that was never intended.  As we watched Marion Crane's car pause in the swamp and waited breathlessly perversely hoping it would sink and allow Norman's mother to get away with murder so too we watch Tom Ripley descend into darkness and when the cops arrive at his hotel we wait breathlessly with Tom hoping he will get away.Duality is present within us all... and while we are taught to thine own self be true in this film it is only when we are true to ourselves that true pain comes.".

While I have been told that the movie is different than the book I applaud Mingella for his tight script and seamless direction.  Yet again we are given a prime example that when violence grows out of a strong plot we as an audience accept it.

Paltrow is good though she is not given a whole lot to do. Blanchett is perfect in a small but pivotal role that only adds to her already impressive filmography. This is a nearmasterpiece. Minghella's talent for visual opulence is second to none and his work here should earn him a directing Oscar nod. The same goes for many others associated with this brilliant achievement. The ending is as unsuspected as it is inevitable that is sad and unsettling. In fact the whole film underscores these emotions. Whereas Highsmith's original novel was cold and sometimes inert the film makes Ripley much more of a living breathing character and as such a great symbol of tragedy. It may be some time before I forget this intense experience. Certainly one that deserves multiple viewings. One of the best films of 1999. I think this may be one of the best pictures I have ever seen. Bravo everyone. A moving rich knockout!".

There was something about him that I felt sympathetic towards on one hand and gave me the creeps on the other. Sympathetic because in more than one ways he is like you and me. He wants to be rich he wants approval and he is may be just an opportunist. Creepy because he latches on like a leech he can't take rejection and though he doesn't plan but once he assumes the identity of someone else he can go to any extent to keep that. Actually one can identify with the character so much that it's almost scary to look inside your dark corners.Matt Damon played this threedimensional character so well that I almost became a huge fan of his. Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf whose identity Tom Ripley steals was very good as well. The movie is shot in Italy moves at a leisurely speed and is very atmospheric. One of my all time favorite thrillers.".

	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to naming the best films of the 1990's The Talented Mr. Ripley hardly ever gets a mention. This is one of cinema's greatest mysteries how can a film as well made constantly intriguing and brilliantly conceived as this one constantly get passed over? And in favour of many under deserving films as well? Really strange. Almost as big a mystery as the one I've just mentioned is the web of intrigue created here. Through deep complex characters and situations rich with double meaning Anthony Minghella has turned Patricia Highsmith's original novel into a cinematic masterpiece. The talented Matt Damon stars as the talented man of the title that is offered 1000 to travel to Italy to try and return Dickie the rich and spoilt son of a millionaire. What follows is a complex disturbing and fascinating expose of a man ingratiating himself into the lives of Dickie his girlfriend Marge and high society on the whole...The main reason why The Talented Mr. Ripley works so well is that it's central characters are deep labyrinths that beg to explored and analysed. Every scene is rich with double meaning and character interactions that exist under the surface of the drama we are seeing on screen. The character of Tom Ripley is a true masterpiece of characterisation indeed. This sociopath that would rather be a pretend somebody than a real nobody is a myriad of contradictions and muddled personalities. His actions are always amoral and through his lies and deception it is obvious that he doesn't care at all for anyone around him. However despite this we are still able to feel for him through his tribulations. The story is told in such a way that it is difficult to feel for any of the other characters and all of our sympathies lie with the talented Tom Ripley. This puts the audience in a strange situation as we're used to hating the antagonist and feeling for the protagonist but this film turns that on it's head and to great effect.The film is helped implicitly by the fact that it's one of the most professionally made films ever to make it onto the screen. Every scene every action every line uttered is done with the greatest assurance and nothing at all in the film appears to be there by accident or out of place. The way that the characters interact with each other and their surroundings is always believable and we never question anything that is shown on screen. Anthony Minghella's direction is more than solid and this is helped by the stunning photography courtesy of 1950's Italy. Many a film has benefited from Italy's landscape and this is one of them. This is all great but it's the performances that put the final finishing touch on this amazing masterclass of filmmaking. As mentioned the talented Mr Damon takes the lead role and completely makes it his own. He often gets coupled with his friend Ben Afleck when it comes to acting but this is very unfair as Damon is one of today's brightest stars. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow make up the other two leads. I'm not the biggest fan of either of these two stars but both like Damon give performances here that will always be associated with their personalities. Cate Blanchett has a small role but the real plaudits for the smaller performances go to the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman who steals every scene he's in.The Talented Mr. Ripley is one stunning piece of film. Ignore the people that don't consider this one of the 1990's greatest achievements they are wrong. The film is a masterpiece of tense situations great characterisation and professional filmmaking. And I refuse to hear otherwise.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit that I rented The Talented Mr. Ripley without the slightest clue about what the story entailed. However this caused no problem as I soon became involved in the twisted and rather bizarre plot I was immediately interested in the movie as it was unique and unusual right from the start.Matt Damon portrays the mysterious Mr. Ripley who more or less remains a mystery throughout the film. I was intrigued at how when you first see him on screen you are given the impression that he is nothing more than a shy innocent and intellectual young man who pretty much keeps to himself. However this image is only visable for the first five minutes or so and is virtually shattered once he accepts the offer to go to Italy in search of Mr. Greenleaf's son Dickie. I was fascinated at how rapidly his personality altered and suddenly I understood that he was rather odd as he deceived Mr. Greenleaf in the first place by wearing a Princeton jacket and pretending that he knew Dickie. Now I haven't explained this entirely as those of you who have seen this film know as I am not writing this to create a summary of the plot but rather to give my comments. Basically Mr. Greenleaf saw Ripley playing the piano at a wedding wearing a Princeton jacket and since his son also went to Princeton he asks Ripley if by any chance he knew Dickie. Of course since Ripley never went to Princeton in the first place he couldn't possibly have known Dickie. Despite this fact however Ripley says that he did know him and that they were friends. As soon as he says this he manages to get himself in a deep hole of trouble as Mr. Greenleaf asks him to go to Italy to try and retrieve his son as he couldn't do it himself due to that fact that Dickie wouldn't listen to his father following a serries of arguments.I thought that the acting was brilliant especially that of Jude Law Dickie and Matt Damon. I was on the edge of my seat throughout most of the film and I felt that all the characters were believable in their own ways. I believe this to be a splendidly clever story which is well written and directed. I thought that the music playing during most of the film was excellent as it matched the strange eerie atmosphere of the story beautifully.I would like to conclude this review by saying that this is a very good movie with an unusually unpredictable ending it's nice to see a movie that doesn't finish perfectly for a change.".

I think the beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow did a good job too but her character was massively underplayed. It was great to see Matt Damon playing a part like this which is different from the part he usually plays. The scenery was also very impressive.The ending left a lot to be desired. At first I hated it. Right now I don't mind it but I think it could have been a little better.The whole movie was shown through the viewpoint of Mr. Ripley. Even though he was the bad guy of the film you feel bad for him because you follow him through the movie. I think it would have been better if the movie was shown by the of Paltrow's character a little more.This movie did have flaws. The characters themselves were a bit 2dimensional aside from two or three of them. Although the actual ways that Ripley killed him victims and fooled everyone else was enjoyable I think the movie would have been a little more realistic if the police were no so gullible and didn't ignore obvious clues to what Mr. Ripley did. One of the biggest things wrong with this movie was that it was too long. What bothered me the most was the homosexuality scattered through the film but I was able to deal with it.Despite these problems I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend for anyone especially Matt Damon fans to go see it.".

The film is set in late 1950's it centers around Tom Ripley a man who gets hired by Jude Law's father to go to Italy and persuade him to come back to America. When he does and gets to know him and his fianc Gwenyth Paltrow things take a different turn.... The plot to this movie is very layered and that is one of the many things that makes it great. One thing is for sure if you like crime thrillers then you are sure to love this one. The acting is another great part about this movie. Almost all the actors were coming off of big hits when this movie came out and every cast members great acting abilities are showcased. Matt Damon is absolutely fabulous here it's probably the best performance I've seen him give in his career. And Paltrow's performance is very good here too... I loved her dramatic scenes I really thought she nailed it. Jude Law and Cate Blanchett are good in their roles as well I honesty think that Damon deserved an academy award nomination more than Law did. The writing in the movie elevates everything and really pulls it all together. Overall I 100 recommend this film this film to everyone! 1010.".

The writing in the movie elevates everything and really pulls it all together. Overall I 100 recommend this film this film to everyone! 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are a lot of reasons to see THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. It is not your typical run of the mill Hollywood thriller.  In fact it is refreshingly chilling and Matt Damon turns in what is by far his best acting job to date. He is able to shed the Will Hunting image here with a juicy role.  It is a personality twisting story unlike say SINGLE WHITE FEMALE  which was highly conventional and more of a slasher picture.  I would equate it more with Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA.  The audience is never totally clear as to why Tom Ripley wants to consume another personality which is all the more mysterious.Anthony Minghella director of ENGLISH PATIENT sets the stage in late 1950's Italy an exotic locale which adds to the suspense.  As the film progresses and it becomes more apparent there is something deeply wrong with Damon you almost begin to root for him to get away with his malicious acts. He is so effective as the quietly psychotic Ripley because his actions do not seem planned.  He just kind of takes what is not his without reason. The beauty of Rome Venice and Gwyneth Paltrow tends to hide the inner turmoil going on with Damon's character and Jude Law is oblivious to it most of the time.  The madness builds slowly and Law as the target of Damon's consuming desire realizes it too late.  Law has the looks and mannerisms of a 50's matinee idol which fits perfectly within the context of the film. Some people have said THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is like a Hitchcock film for the 90's.  I would have to agree. Damon's ability to portray a fully realized human leach is amazing at times and the fact that I actually had some sympathy for him proves it.  There are scenes of utter shock and dismay but it is the drowning build to the inevitable murder and mayhem that grabs you.  RATING 12".

The story is basically the same but Minghella changed the most important details and to its detriment. In the book Ripley is a con man and sociopath whose jealousy of Dickie Greenleaf's life leads him to murder him and take on his identity. In the movie Ripley is a poor boy who lusts after Dickie accidentally causes his death and happens to take on his identity. To change the motivation for the murder and to change the murder from premeditative to accidental is to completely change the nature of the title character and in the process sever the movie's most basic and essential connection to the book upon which it is based. If Minghella disliked the book so much he shouldn't have taken on the project in the first place. At the very least he should have changed the title and character names as was the case with Simon Birch which was very loosely adapted from the novel A Prayer For Owen Meany. Visually the film is beautiful. Many of the performances are good to great. Jude Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman for example are perfectly cast. Matt Damon is not. He tries but ultimately fails. Damon is a decent enough actor with some potential but he is way out of his depth here. The character is more complex than he is capable of playing. This wouldn't be such a problem if he weren't playing the title character. So if you like the book avoid this faux adaptation and see Purple Noon instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Anthony Minghella's adaptation of 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' possesses more depth and poses more questions than first viewings would indicate. At first viewing I was baffled by what motivated these people aside from simple selfishness on the part of the rich kids and class envy on the part of Tom Ripley. Since that first time I have thought about the various clues scattered along the way that Minghella throws out to help us along.The most important scene in this film I think is when Tom Matt Damon and Meredith Cate Blanchett attend the opera in Rome. On stage is the duel scene from Tchaikovsky's 'Eugene Onegin'. Lenski Onegin's closest friend has offended Onegin who has challenged him to a duel. Lenski the simple musician sings the last bit of his aria and then the two men do their paces and Onegin shoots Lenski dead. The key to Tom Ripley's enigmatic character and motivations in relation to the opera is in the 19th century literature in this case Pushkin Onegin represented a type of man that was becoming extinct for various reasons mostly cultural as a result of political disasters the usual story. Onegin is what the Russians called a lishny chelovek or superfluous man. A man with sensitivity and intelligence but doomed to have these qualities corrupted for want of a proper outlet in the society of his time. That is Tom Ripley.The interesting thing is Tom Ripley is also Lenski the simple musician the lover the sentimentalist. So the operatic scene in this film symbolizes the selfimmolation of Tom Ripley in the form of Eugene Onegin the superfluous man killing Lenski the simple and gifted musician. This suicide explains a lot in the context of what ultimately happens in this film. It explains why Ripley does what he does on a fundamental level.Ripley has been left with no place to stand by the society of the plutocracy whose children represented by Dickie Greenleaf Jude Law Marge his fianc Gwyneth Paltrow and Meredith the society girl from New York Blanchett. All action stems from this fundamental twist in Ripley's psyche. The first time I saw this movie I was flummoxed but now if I am right about the scene at the opera house I think I understand what makes these characters tick which makes the film all that more interesting.There is some wonderful acting here too. Jude Law got all of the attention at the time of the release and he is very good but it is Matt Damon's astonishing performance as the geeky pathetic Ripley that boggles the mind. Cate Blanchett turns what could have been a nothing stereotyped part into a tourdeforce of subtle comedy and pathos reminding me more than once of Little Edie Beale Grey Gardens the poor little rich girl with a heart of gold who can't find love because of the limitations placed upon her by the society in which she grew up. An intelligent young woman raised to be an emptyheaded breeder. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderfully repulsive as Dickie's old chum from Princeton with his beadyeyed nastiness towards the leech Ripley. Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as the author who loves Dickie and is the only one who cottons on to what has happened to him but no one believes her.There is also sly satire at work here as well. Jude Law's character Dickie is a great fan of Charlie Bird.... Dickie Bird a Gilbert and Sullivan reference betokening the emptyheaded fool dancing towards his doom to the tootling of some vapid jingle Poor little Dickie Bird....titwillow titwillow etc. Dickie is out of his depth when he encounters the deeply twisted Tom Ripley who has set out to destroy his own identity annihilate his personality and will not hesitate to eliminate all who would stand in his way. In the end he takes his revenge before meeting his own doom by killing love.This is a tragic film beautifully done on all counts and though it seems to drag at times in the first half and has a deux ex machina ending to solve the complicated dilemma of closing the trap around Ripley it is a first rate suspenser. Minghella does not have the Hitchcock touch but he's brought his own brand of haunting creepiness into this very fine film.Technical aspects are outstanding The music by Gabriel Yared is beautiful and the script one of the better ones I've encountered in a long time.".

However to be fair his murder of friend Dickie Greenleaf Jude Law is almost made to look like selfdefense. It's an odd scene in this odd movie. As the story unfolds however Ripley is shown to be a sick killer hardly some innocent man caught in some selfdefense predicament.The second half of the film deals with Damon's character trying to get away with his scheme while other people slowly start to question who he is and what he's doing. Some people trust him some don't. A few twists make the story even more interesting. The only facet that didn't appeal to me were the overt homosexual overtones in this film which were prevalent throughout Damon's relationships with a couple of men although nothing sexually was ever done and even though these guys also had girlfriends. Speaking of the latter Gwyneth Paltrow is good in here as Marge Sherwood someone who is ahead of the pack when it comes to uncovering the truth. Cate Blanchett is good too as usual but her role was much smaller and one I'm not sure was all about.Overall this is intriguing dramacrime story with a lot of suspense and done so without a lot of violence. All the characters in this movie grab your attention.

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Ripley is a bit of a nonentity but also a bit of a chameleon who can make people think he belongs. After the wealthy Herbert Greenleaf mistakenly thinks Tom was a friend of his son Dickie he is given a job to go to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to New York. He quickly meets Dickie and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood and befriends them. He is honest about why he is there but makes Dickie believe that they share similar interests. Soon he is staying with Dickie and Marge while still being paid by Dickie's father. Eventually Herbert Greenleaf writes to thank Tom for his work but also to let him know it is clear that he has failed in his task and will no longer be paid. At the same time Dickie starts to get tired of Tom's presence. Tom doesn't take this well and strikes Dickie a struggle ensues and Dickie is killed.

Inevitably the deception is hard to maintain Marge wants to know what happened to Dickie and when a friend of Dickie pays a visit Tom must kill again to protect his secret a killing the police believe Dickie may have committed.This was a really enjoyably film plenty of time is spent introducing the characters and by the time of Dickie's death Tom is the more sympathetic character so it is easy for the viewer to see it as selfdefence and hope he gets away with it. Even when he kills again it isn't hard to still hope he gets away with it as this victim was a frightful snob who had always looked down on Tom and people like him it is only when Marge starts to be emotionally harmed by Tom's actions that sympathy for him starts to wane. The cast does a fine job Matt Damen is particularly good as Tom Ripley a character who isn't naturally dynamic but can play the part when needed. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also impress as Dickie and Marge. The story isn't rushed but nor does it drag and once Dickie has died the tension gradually rises there is always the possibility that Tom will be exposed either by the police or somebody who knows Dickie and each to it looks like he could be exposed there is the feeling that people around him are in danger. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good drama set in some beautiful Italian locations.".

	schema:headline " A movie must see";
	schema:reviewBody "The Talented Mr. Ripley is ominous and foreboding suspenseful and exciting slow and emotional. The movie has as many facets as Mr. Ripley has talents and it takes the viewer through an interesting and worthwhile experience. The movie is set in the late 1950s and begins just as Tom Ripleyif that is his real namebegins his grand act of deception. The movie is based on a series of novels written by Patricia Highsmith that are centered on Mr. Ripley. Tom Ripley who is played by Matt Damon deceives a man into believing that he knows his son well. That man decides to send Tom to Italy to retrieve his son Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie who is played by Jude Law is privileged and arrogant but he is also adored by those who know him. His father believes he has been sailing and schmoozing in Italy for far too long. Dickie's father promises to pay Tom's travel expenses and award him 1000 to return with Dickie. Tom readily accepts the offer. The first scene that intrigued me was when Tom lands in Italy. He meets a pretty American girl named Meredith played by Cate Blanchett and he introduces himself as Dickie Greenleaf. I almost did not catch the lie at first and I nearly forgot about it when Tom says goodbye to Meredith returns to being Tom Ripley and goes to meet up with Dickie. Tom pretends to meet Dickie by chance and tells him they knew each other in college. Dickie is with his girlfriend Marge played by Gwyneth Paltrow and of course he does not recognize Tom. Tom builds his talents for deception while making his way into Dickie's life but he uses the truth of his mission to gain Dickie's trust. They quickly become friends. Everything seems to be going well for Tom and it is at this point that I began to empathize with him because of his eagerness to participate socially and his obvious fear of loneliness.As he and Dickie become closer Tom's attraction for Dickie becomes palpable. At the same time Dickie takes note of Tom's infatuation and tries to brush him away by spending time with other friends. In a scene that left me shocked and confused Tom's jealousy and passion overwhelm him while he and Dickie are sailing. They are arguing because Dickie tries to tell Tom he doesn't think that they should be friends anymore and that Tom should return to America. Tom strikes Dickie with an oar and after a scuffle Tom beats Dickie to death. Tom cries as he hugs the bloodied corpse once again leaving me unsure of Tom's planif he even has a plan. Tom's journey truly begins as he starts to cover his tracks and decides that his only option is to attempt to steal Dickie's life. Tom tells Marge that Dickie is just taking time away. He tells those who know him as Tom that Dickie is away and he tells others that he is Dickie. He cashes Dickies checks and lives in his home. The other characters become pieces in Tom's game and he manipulates them to support his web of lies. Tom murders again when Dickie's friend who has met Tom as Tom is on the verge of discovering Tom's ruse. Once again the murder does not seem predetermined and Tom does it out of necessity because he cannot stand to lose his new lifestyle. Tom's lies and murders begin to spiral out of control as the police become involved. I found myself wondering if Tom would have to kill everyone in Italy that knew Dickie. I also began to empathize with Tom's delusional scheme because he seems to only want attention and affection from others. Dickie's friends become increasingly worried about his absence and Dickie's father travels to Italy and hires a private investigator. Just as Tom's evil plan is about to break apart Tom gets away clean. Tom forges a suicide letter from Dickie and the police and private investigator come to conclusions that leave Tom innocent. Marge is the only person who suspects Tom but she has become emotionally distressed and no one believes her. Dickie's father even leaves Tom some of Dickie's trust fund. Tom murders one last time as the movie ends. A man who had become his lover poses one last threat to his discovery because he still knows him as Tom and others that know him as Dickie are aboard the same ship. Tom smothers him while crying to himself. I found this movie to be thrilling and honestly confusing. I could watch it again and again and probably absorb some new interesting aspect each time. Matt Damon gives a great performance that shows range that I have not seen in his later performances. I wish that I had seen this fantastic work of art earlier and I am eager to read the books it is based on.".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly intense and enthralling thriller RIPLEY is satisfying!";
	schema:reviewBody "I sincerely hesitated before renting THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY this past weekend. I had heard rumors from others who were dissatisfied with this film unhappy with their reaction to Anthony Minghella's followup to his majorly successful The English Patient. Just the fact that Minghella directed it made me quiver. English Patient has to be one of my most hated films for which much praise was received. However something compelled me to pick it up. Maybe Minghella deserved another chance in my books. This time he was using marquee actors of a more popular nature rather than artsytype thespians like Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche. The moment I popped the DVD in and viewed this picture I was hooked and enthralled. The Talented Mr. Riply uses just the right amount of artistry and goes thick on plot and method acting to create a thriller which the great Hitchcock would have been proud of.I must admit the previews made me take interest in this film before I considered looking at it. The plot seemd so fascinating and it surely is. I'll only mention the minute details of it so as not to spoil anything for those who have not seen it and also so I don't screw up some of the descriptions. Tom Ripley Matt Damon is a bland ordinary individual who longs to become someone else other than the nobody who is himself. He gets that opportunity when a man named Greenleaf James Rebhorn offers him 1000 to retrieve his son from Europe whom he suspects is frittering his money and his life away. Ripley takes on the assignment and surprisingly as soon as he meets up with Dickie Greenleaf Jude Law he immediately tells him his intentions and quickly becomes his best buddy. His girlfriend Marge Gwyneth Paltrow is also very impressed with their new acquaintance. Little do they know that Tom Ripley's main talent is impersonating people around him taking on their identities and making them his own. Dickie's will be his first one to capture.I mentioned that Sir Alfred would have been pleased to see this film if he were alive today and while I was watching Ripley I couldn't help but be amazed by the technical and narrative similarities to Hitch's archetypes which today are endlessly duplicated. I found it riveting how the plot and the director focus in on the scheming of Ripley allowing the audience to be swept up in his improvisation and daring manner of always running under the knife. I don't know if the DVD technology is a considerable enhancement here but Minghella's direction also takes on a life of its own. The purposeful shading and camera angles take on almost a voyeuristic quality as if we the viewer are objectively but holistically involved in Ripley's feats of derringdo. The cinematography is fancy but not overly distracting. Its viewpoint is always set on the characters and how they relate with each other.The performances are carefully choreographed but consistently drawn to look natural and ofthemoment. Such aspects are especially important in the case of Matt Damon who takes the character of Tom Ripley and subtly makes him look pathetic but endlessly interesting to watch. Jude Law plays such a threedimensional character here that his might be the most difficult one to play among the key players. Dickie Greenleaf the real one must be outgoing and friendly but also cold and disheartening. We may be repelled by him but his fate never seems warranted even during his most tragic hour. Gwyneth is beautiful as always but also finds the right note for a woman who is unrightfully left behind and deceived by both these leading men. Cate Blanchett also has a small and thankless role as an innocent European traveller who happens upon this happy throng totally unaware of the deception and indecency that is going on. She was probably my favorite character of them all a symbol that Hitchcock created many years before.When critics and film fans remarked that the end of 1999 saw some of the best films in a blue moon hit theaters I am inclined to believe them. Along with other favorites of mine like The Green Mile and American Beauty I would vote for The Talented Mr. Ripley as one of the best films of the year. It is smart visually and narratively creative and on a whole a truly satisfying entertainment. For thinking viewers it is a special treat. For casual moviegoers I believe there is still much to behold in this film even if you are not one who is used to letting movies soak into your system. Minghella takes his time unwinding this ingenious tale but the unfolding of the plot and the eventual payoff is a chilling and fulfilling movie experience. Rating Four stars".

WriterDirector Antony Minghella uses the oldest trick in the book to distract viewers from the hollowness of the plot. Just as a skillful conjuror diverts the gaze of the audience from where the trick is really happening so Minghella disengages our critical faculties with picturesque backdrops of Rome Venice and even Jude Law's posterior.The cast do well enough apart from Matt Damon who wouldn't have got a look in at a 'Queer as Folk' audition. None of the characters they play invite empathy so the viewer scarcely cares who might live or die and whether Ripley will get away with his literally incredible double life. Surely the hardboiled American private detective hired by Greenleaf Senior will unravel the tissue of lies and coincidences? Nope. Fade to unreadable titles and who cares? The stars of this film are the locations and the art direction. Without them it would be the disaster the absurd and wholly unbelievable plot deserves.".

	schema:headline " A cosmic letdown";
	schema:reviewBody "As a comics reader who knows the source material FF2 left me with a great deal of reservations. The ending in particular disappointed me. The new superhero movies always let us down when it comes to the cosmic part of the original stories.Let me be clear I am not a purist. I don't demand that the movies should be slavishly faithful to the comics. It's fine by me that they change the story as long as what they put in there instead is just as good. And this of course is the problem. In the XMen movies we never see the alien Shi'ar even though that's where the XMen got their superscience. In SpiderMan 3 we never saw the planet from the Secret Wars storyline where the alien symbiont Venom came from. And now in FF2 we don't get the huge backstory of Galactus. We don't even get Galactus as a defined character. In the movie he's just some sissyass cloud monster who ridiculously can be destroyed by his own servant the infinitely less powerful Silver Surfer. No way. Does not compute.Galactus in the comics is a force of nature. He can be stopped and sometimes even reasoned with but he can't be destroyed. His fate is tied in with the fate of the universe. If you like the science fiction part of superhero comics the ridiculously diluted Galactus of this movie is a massive massive letdown.And unfortunately there were a great deal of other problems with the climax of FF2 especially thisThe power swapping. That kind of thing does not happen in the comics without a whole lot of proper explanation. Here none. AND after seeing that whoever the Torch touches will swap powers with him how does it follow that he can just absorb all the powers of the other three who are then powerless? It doesn't. But they just casually know that that's what will happen and casually go ahead with it making the fight and climax equally casual.The Surfer's allegiance. When exactly does he switch? Surely not before he sees Susan die another stupid element  the comics Surfer does not go around resurrecting the dead. And yet Reed and the others plan for him to stop Galactus even before Susan dies. Doesn't make sense.And that was just the climax. We also have other problems Why is Doom even in the movie? They tried to conflate several of the greatest FF stories of all time but stuffing these plots into this storyline just makes it halfassed. There's none of the original impact here.Another thing I wasn't too fond of was the comedy. It's okay to have a few funny scenes but in this movie they just went on and on playing the powers for laughs. It detracts from the seriousness of the story ESPECIALLY a Galactus story for cripes' sakes! So I have to say this movie was a big disappointment to me. I really liked the first one. I rated it an 8. This one only rates a 3. Considering my great expectations this comes as nothing less than a cosmic letdown.And to all those who claim that this sequel is better than the first one Shyeah. What do you know.".

Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.In Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic Ioan Gruffudd is about to wed Susan Storm aka Invisible Woman Jessica Alba. However an unknown cosmic entity is causing a screwup in earth's natural phenomena prompting the couple to postpone the wedding and work with Johnny Storm aka Human Torch Chris Evans and Ben Grimm aka The thing Michael Chiklis to find out the cause of the mysterious occurrence. They soon come face to face with the Silver Surfer Doug Jones voiced by Laurence Fishburne and realize that the world's survival is hanging on the balance. In addition to this Victor Von Doom aka Dr. Doom Julian McMahon returns and is intent on destroying the Fantastic Four.Granted Rise of the Silver Surfer has a greater scale than its predecessor. But for all this it's still very... middling. The title and the trailers suggest something of a grand battle between the eponymous characters but aside from the chase sequence involving the Human Torch and the Silver Surfer which by the way has been shown numerous times in the teaser trailer nothing much exciting still happens. Not even the team's rescue attempt in London. The quality of the special effects are inconsistent and all the visual polish expectedly goes to the Silver Surfer. And while I personally don't think it's an issue I imagine how some fans of the comic book might sneer at how the characters of Silver Surfer and Galactus were handled. Instead director Tim Story and screenwriters Don Payne and Mark Frost opt to flesh out the characters more but the end result feels less natural and more repetitive. Gruffudd does an okay job with Mr. Fantastic but there's really no feeling of chemistry between him and Alba who manages to adequately portray a tough yet vulnerable character. In contrast Evans and Chiklis continue to generate an easy rapport between them and the two get majority of the film's most amusing moments.Rise of the Silver Surfer barely does what it sets out to do. It fares a little better than its predecessor with a more serviceable story and a little more enjoyable action sequences. But taken on its own terms the film doesn't present anything to its characters that has been done much better with other characters of their ilk. The movie is entertaining to some extent but in the end it doesn't really rise to something special.".

	schema:headline " The Silver Surfer's First Film Appearance Deserved Better Treatment";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me watching it every few months. It almost as if I need to watch it on occasion to remind myself how mediocre it is. It was hard to believe that a Marvel film utilizing one of the most interesting characters from the comic universe Galactus could be so bland. I suppose one of the reasons I keep returning to this film is that I want so badly to see the Fantastic Four franchise survive. I know it has potential I love the characters it has an interesting collection of villains to select from and the comic series provides some great stories as starting material. It just isn't happening thanks to poor writing and a little too much creative license at the hands of director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost.The second installment in the F4 franchise suffers from the some of the same problems as the first film while adding some new issues on top. The story potential is high Reed Richards and Susan Storm's wedding is postponed again when the Earth receives a visit from the Silver Surfer herald of Galactus. Further complications arise when Victor von Doom returns with plans of his own. Just writing that synopsis made me want to watch the film again it sounds like the foundation for a great F4 film. My issues began with the fact that we wasted the first 30 minutes of the film preparing for Reed and Sue's wedding instead of getting to the meat of the Silver Surfer plot. Then once the plot kicks into gear we're rushed through the next hour to a deus ex machina ending that fails to satisfy and may even aggravate some of the comic series' fans. When the film was over I felt as if the Surfer was never given the opportunity to reach his full onscreen potential and I've been left hoping he's given another shot.Just as in the first film this movie is plagued with some cringeworthy oneliners once again Doom is given some of the worst. I know the F4 was a bit goofier than some of the other Marvel properties but the filmmakers need to tone it down a bit. Though I can deal with corny dialogue what I can't abide is blatant slapintheface product placement. I loved that the filmmakers were able to work the Fantasticar into the script especially since I'd considered it a bit too cartoonish to work in a film but the shoutout for Dodge when Johnny first sees it and excitedly exclaims A hemi! went a bit too far.All of the original cast from the first film return which is both good and bad. Just as before Ioan Gruffudd Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are perfect choices for their characters and do a no pun intended fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Also just as in the first film I was unimpressed with the performances of Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon. Alba is a beautiful woman and fits the image of Susan Storm but I've never felt her to be too talented an actress and she remains the weak point of the series. McMahon again does not feel right in the role of Dr. Doom he has a hard time doing insidiously evil without coming across as a hammed performance and I just can't take him seriously. These are not traits I want in the man given the role as one of the best Marvel villains.For what time we're given with him the Surfer is the most impressive aspect of this film. The visual effects team did a great job with creating the iconic character and Laurence Fishburne was an inspired casting choice for his voice. Galactus unfortunately does not receive the same treatment and we are never given a real glimpse at the demigod through his surrounding cloud. In my opinion it was a waste but the director Tim Story clarified in the film's supplemental material that he chose to keep Galactus vague so that future filmmakers could do him justice. After two average films now we need to hope someone is even given the chance.Honestly this film will only appeal to fans of the series and even then don't expect to be wow'd. The second F4 film isn't a bad movie but it never rises above mediocre. The impressive special effects and production design fall victim to plot holes poor writing and underuse of the film's assets. It's a quick mildly entertaining means of spending 90 minutes but if you're anything like me you'll walk away from this film wondering what could have been if the epic introduction of the Silver Surfer and Galactus had been put in better hands.".

	schema:reviewBody "As difficult as it was I decided to view 'Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer' as a film not as a chance for redeeming a franchise. I thought this method might take away any fan boy predilections I had in anticipation of this second installment to 'The Fantastic Four' universe. So for a moment let's forget that the first film was without artistic merit. Let's forget that the story about a family of superheroes is arguably the most adored of all comic book properties.'Rise of the Silver Surfer' opens with a planet lightyears away being obliterated. After the opening credits we are on Earth getting ready for Sue Storm and Reed Richards to tie the knot. During the preparation the scientist instead of concentrating on the details of his impending nuptials is busy studying a cosmic anomaly. We soon find out that this cosmic energy is in fact an alien on a surfboard zooming down to Earth to prepare it for destruction. These two story lines are the principle actions guiding the story. There are two other subplots. One is in regards to Dr. Doom being 'resurrected' while the other involves Johnny Storm's selfish nature endangering his family.Four plots that should make an epic film span a terribly short running time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. Did it work? Did they abandon the goofy nature of the first film and reinvigorate the franchise with an epic story about the fate of the entire planet. No on both counts. The humor is entirely aimed at children which goes along with its PG rating. 'Thing' is played for laughs without any degree of intensity. Johnny Storm's crisis of conscience robs all of the charisma established in the first even if it wasn't much. Sue Storm is more of a nag than an asset to the team. In addition there is nothing to signify Reed Richards as the leader to a powerful team of superheroes. He comes off as a selfesteem deprived blow hard jackass. There isn't one iota of chemistry between any of the characters. The wretched family dynamics are trumped only by Dr. Doom who can only be described as the worst villain to ever grace the screen. Julian McMahon's portrayal of Victor Von Doom seems barely suited for a SciFi cable channel movie let alone a megabudget studio film not that they always choose the best talent but come on!.For a story such as this the amount of claustrophobia throughout borders on pure agony. It lacks anything even resembling 'scope of vision.' The only audience 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is suited for is children between the ages of 5  10. Anyone over that age looking for an entertaining piece of escapism will run into a wall of condescension.Now let's look at it with comicbook eyes. As most may know The Silver Surfer works for a planetdevouring villain Galactus. The Surfer scouts out planets using his board as a cosmic beacon for Galactus to follow. There is no definition no rules they just make them up as they go along. There is no Watcher so we are told about Galactus through an unbearably cheesy hearttoheart with Sue and The Surfer. There isn't a shred of genuine impending doom because they never establish what Galactus really is in the press kit under character description it should just readbig damn tornado.The director Tim Story and his band of screenwriters have once again broken the hearts of FF fans all over. They have no respect. They have no understanding on what makes the 'Fantastic Four' story work or any story for that matter. I gave Tim Story a break the first time around but not this time. He should'V looked back at the first one compared it to the comic book films that work and just said Damn! I gotta sit this one out before I do it all over again! However he didn't do that. He looked at the numbers from the first one and assumed that money always equals success. Now as for the screenwriters give them a Cartoon Network show and let them have at it. If they have any talent it could be realized there.However FF2 wasn't a total failure. The Surfer is phenomenal with the exception being Lawrence Fishburne's distracting voice. His entire body seemed to be in constant motion. I was mesmerized for every moment he was on screen. The special effects team did an outstanding job. However what is perplexing about the look of the Surfer is what it did to the other special effects. Reed's ability to stretch looked even more unnatural than in the first. Sue's shield Johnny's fire everything else was sidelined. It was as if the team only concentrated on The Surfer.I have been teetering on the edge of spoiling the end. I won't but damn I want to. Any selfrespecting Silver Surfer fan would scream! It is horrible. It makes no sense and it will enrage fans even more than Alba being cast as Sue Storm. I will only say thisHollywood Cop Out.No doubt this movie will make money. I was shocked by the public's positive reaction to the first film. Audiences will be so dazzled by the effects that they will forget that they are watching a terrible movie.I knew in my heart it would happen but I had hoped our optimistic nature would pay off. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again no matter what the 'Fantastic Four' future may hold.'Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a disrespectful sleight of hand circus show devoid of any elements that make a movie a movie.".

There isn't a shred of genuine impending doom because they never establish what Galactus really is in the press kit under character description it should just readbig damn tornado.The director Tim Story and his band of screenwriters have once again broken the hearts of FF fans all over. They have no respect. They have no understanding on what makes the 'Fantastic Four' story work or any story for that matter. I gave Tim Story a break the first time around but not this time. He should'V looked back at the first one compared it to the comic book films that work and just said Damn! I gotta sit this one out before I do it all over again! However he didn't do that. He looked at the numbers from the first one and assumed that money always equals success. Now as for the screenwriters give them a Cartoon Network show and let them have at it. If they have any talent it could be realized there.However FF2 wasn't a total failure. The Surfer is phenomenal with the exception being Lawrence Fishburne's distracting voice. His entire body seemed to be in constant motion. I was mesmerized for every moment he was on screen. The special effects team did an outstanding job. However what is perplexing about the look of the Surfer is what it did to the other special effects. Reed's ability to stretch looked even more unnatural than in the first. Sue's shield Johnny's fire everything else was sidelined. It was as if the team only concentrated on The Surfer.I have been teetering on the edge of spoiling the end. I won't but damn I want to. Any selfrespecting Silver Surfer fan would scream! It is horrible. It makes no sense and it will enrage fans even more than Alba being cast as Sue Storm. I will only say thisHollywood Cop Out.No doubt this movie will make money. I was shocked by the public's positive reaction to the first film. Audiences will be so dazzled by the effects that they will forget that they are watching a terrible movie.I knew in my heart it would happen but I had hoped our optimistic nature would pay off. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again no matter what the 'Fantastic Four' future may hold.'Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a disrespectful sleight of hand circus show devoid of any elements that make a movie a movie.";

Yet I could not feel it taking me in I remained a spectator while the short dialogs even though containing the essence of the story were still dry and well short. No wonder the movie was a mere 92 minutes. Conclusion a good PG movie a bit better than the first one but which still failed big time to impress just like the rest of this summer blockbusters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Where to begin. Let's start with the positives The Surfer looked excellent. He really did. I was impressed and excited when he first appeared.Now the negatives Apparently Tim Story decided Stan Lee's work which has lasted for years because it was a great story that stood the test of time wasn't good enough for his motion picture. Apparently the Hollywood big wigs sat in a big executive board room around a large table and decided that they could come up with a better storyline along with changing the powersabilities of various characters and basically murdering a storyline that was near perfect.SPOILERS Let's get a few things straight people. I'm not one to hate on a movie because of a few nitpicky things. There were MAJOR plot flaws in this movie that were completely different from the original adaption. To begin with and I want to be sure everyone understands this The Silver Surfer DOES NOT get his powers from his board. There is no other way to say this other than um no that's incorrect. About halfway through the flick Dr. Doom discovers that the Surfer gets his powers from his board and you can obviously infer that at some point he is going to try and take it for himself.In the comics the Surfer is able to fly and use his powers all on his own he only uses the board so that he doesn't expend the extra energy that flight requires and very rapid flight at that  faster than the speed of light.It's kind of like doing a Superman movie and saying that he gets his powers from his cape  Everyone would stare with a confused face and say Wha? Once deboarded The Surfer takes on an almost humanlike existence e.g. breathing heavily fatigued etc. Again this is  what's the word? Oh yes  RIDICULOUS. I'm not trying to sound like some fanboy but it's just simply incorrect. Doing a Batman movie and making him a chimpanzee would irritate many who read the comics. The Surfer does not breath eat drink etc. If you want an indepth look at his abilities use a search engine on the web and use a nice wik site to explore.Aside from these obvious blunders at the end the Surfer apparently kills or at least deters Galactus from doing his work. This is kind of like saying that an ant got the best of Rambo in field combat. I can't stress this enough  it was storyline murder.What made the Surfer stories so great is that they weren't just wham bam thank you ma'am comics. They were very philosophical and contained a heavy amount of dialogue. In today's silver screen most of the actors complain that they can't act enough in superhero movies. The unfortunate thing is the creators of this movie had a great chance to appease both the fans and the actors by just simply FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL STORYLINE.I'm not going to bore you any further complaining about this catasrophe. If you are still reading to this point you obviously get what I'm trying to explain here. I'll sum it up like this This movie although visually appealing while the Surfer is fully powered is a complete nightmare.If you want to read a very entertaining thoughtful and insightful story about a man who gave up his life in order to save others and his incredible journeys after this event go to an online search engine and type up the word parable after the words silver surfer. And a few last mathematics for you according to the comics 1. Galactus created the Surfer 2. The Surfer in the comics was far too powerful for the Fantastic Four The Surfer alone is capable of destroying planets and stars and has done so before board or no board. The only reason he decided to help the Four was because he was touched by humanity and the goodness of the people on Earth specifically the Fantastic Four. 3. In the Comics when the Surfer tried to stop Galactus he attacked him with enough force to destroy the solar system and Galactus didn't even budge.Now hopefully you go and read the Parable story so I won't ruin what happens for you. But using those guidelines as for the movie...How in the heck is the Surfer supposed to if you are using the least possible scenario DETER GALACTUS?!?!?! Give me a break. I know Stan Lee was a part of this movie but it's widely known that the Surfer is perhaps his most favorite creation along with most comic book fans loving this specific character. So why would he go and let Tim Story literally murder this character on the big screen? Well I have the answer folks.When you start getting old and senile and someone hands you a big wad of cash you pretty much stop caring about what's going on and what someone is doing with your most famous storyline.Congratulations Avi Arad and Tim Story. Thank you for nothing.".

Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor and one of the better sequels of recent memory.Things appear to be going great for the Fantastic Four. Reed Ioan Gruffudd and Susan Jessica Alba are in love and ready to be married Johnny Chris Evans is still on fire with the ladies and Ben Michael Chiklis has finally found happiness with Alicia Masters Kerry Washington. However their happiness will be tested when strange occurrences around the globe point to one culprit a mysterious being known only as The Silver Surfer Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne.One of the biggest improvements 'Rise' has over the first film is the fact that the Fantastic work more as a team in this film. Yes in the first movie they fought together but it seemed as if they each were fighting different battles within one big one. Here they take a different route and take on even the smaller events together. Also the writing is much better making Reed aka Mr. Fantastic out to be the leader of the Four much unlike the first movie which bothered me. Ioan Gruffudd really seems like a leader in this movie which was a definite strength. Chris Evans also flexes some acting muscle as The Human Torch is also well written this time around giving him a wake up call and turning him into a more believable human character this time around. Alba and Chiklis are both good as The Invisible Woman and The Thing respectively. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne portray the Surfer brilliantly as body and voice respectively. Fishburne has this incredible ability to say the deadliest of lines All that you know is at an end with unbelievable ease and charismatic calm. He is the perfect choice as the voice of one of the most powerful comic book characters. I liked how they wrote the Surfer as well. He does become vulnerable in the film but at the same time you'll have no doubt that he is the most powerful character by the time the ending rolls around. Doug Jones always impresses me with how he captures and creates a character while doing so little and after successful turns in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy Jones gives the Surfer life just as he did Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Kerry Washington and Julian McMahon are also good reprising their roles as Alicia Masters and Dr. Doom McMahon especially. He's even better as the evil and manipulative Dr. Doom this time around.Tim Story really did a good job with the atmosphere of 'Rise'. He really explores every corner of the planet with action scenes in Germany New York China outer space and the heroes' kitchen. All the action scenes are well done and the special effects are used smoothly and effectively even though it looks as though most of the increased budget was spent on The Silver Surfer and Galactus who look amazing. They forgot to make Mr. Fantastic look as realistic as possible because most of the time you can see the visual effects. All in all Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer PG is a fun movie experience that anyone over age 11 or 12 should enjoy. There is some mild sexual innuendo but it's not too bad.spy 810".

	schema:headline " If you're looking for mindless bigbudget fun this is the place for you and your bucket of popcorn";
	schema:reviewBody "Like many other people I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan Israel. To make a long story short FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film particularly at the beginning  but more on that later. Problem was once I stepped out of the theater I couldn't actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer that is. It was just so mediocre in terms of plot direction and acting somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p that I didn't even care enough to remember it. Furthermore while the original film required some suspension of disbelief let's just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far IMO. As I've already mentioned FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner.

However don't expect to find the heart of SpiderMan 3 or epic feel of Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End. Don't even look for credible acting or intelligent plot.

	onyx:emotionText "Like many other people I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan Israel. To make a long story short FF2 is not a bad film. I was actually quite entertained throughout wide parts of the film particularly at the beginning  but more on that later. Problem was once I stepped out of the theater I couldn't actually recall anything specific or special about what I have just seen other than that cool CGI Silver Surfer that is. It was just so mediocre in terms of plot direction and acting somebody really ought to give Jessica Alba some acting lessons a.s.a.p that I didn't even care enough to remember it. Furthermore while the original film required some suspension of disbelief let's just say the plot in its sequel stretches this boundary one step too far IMO. As I've already mentioned FF2 actually starts up in quite a promising manner.

It was definitely very comic book like but even comic book motive can be identifiable outside the movie realm. The dialog was par but had some cheesy moments as well.

It's like they are their own genrefilm and they are going to have a pattern with each film. Back to the movie dialog all right special effects amazing. Character development was much better the viewer gets to see some change within each character. I am a tad disappointed that Galactus was just an enormous cloud planet eating spectrum. Oh well it was an effort. Over all this movie is just flat out fun and entertaining. Don't have high expectations like Spider Man 3 then you will just think the movie sucks in general. Although I have to say this film surpasses spider man 3...shockingly enough. If you go to this movie have no expectations and just sit back and enjoy the flick.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've written almost two years ago that I adored the movie adaptation of Fantastic Four despite many out there who hated it to the core. Back then what I found was right about it was its spot on characterization and its capture of the spirit which was FF the bickering amongst its members as well as its theme on unity and family. I'm surprised that I actually predicted the coming of Galactus though some would be disappointed with his big screen appearance.Don't kid yourself if you say that you didn't see Galactus coming. As its herald no Silver Surfer story is complete without the arrival of the master wanting to devour planets to keep itself alive kinda reminds me of the other Transformer animated movie with Unicron. However purists would go up in arms at the depiction of possibly one of the largest being in the Marvel Universe which I thought was a better alternative in the movie without making it look too stupid with its ridiculous purple tin helmet.And what is a Silver Surfer story without Victor Von Doom showing interest in its immense power? While you might think that the movie might have too many villains with Galactus Doom and the Surfer well for the most parts and with 4 heroes in the fray Rise of the Silver Surfer managed to maintain a breezy pace without getting too deep into its themes nor suffer from having to introduce in detail its characters. We've already established most of that in the first movie and the details of the Surfer and its master was just enough to enlighten new fans while keeping older fans happy enough with its accuracy.So it's much like the comic book again with our family of four having to deal with first of all the rock star like atmosphere of the marriage between Mr Fantastic and Invisible Girl before the Silver Surfer's rude arrival causing major climate changes in cities around the world and of course trusting the USoA army to wanna play world police again. This movie is not without obvious flaws though in continuity and logic in its narrative. For one while its big action scenes take place in busy parts of the world the crowd usually gets dispersed in record time. I believe some parts of the action were chopped off to prevent it from being overly draggy but therein some logic and crowd magically disappear. Some parts too will make you wonder why doesn't the Invisible Girl just knock everyone out with her invisible projectiles or groan that the make up artist managed to make Jessica Alba look like a fashion disaster with her unnaturally dyedblonde hair. She looks hot when it's all tied up but when it's let down I tell you it's time for some shampoo ad to do some major corporate sponsorship.But I still got a kick out of its humorous moments not that it was so funny but they had charm and I can't get enough of the banter between the Thing and the Human Torch. One thing's for certain while the acting might not be first class the cast of Ioan Gruffudd Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis with the help of the suit sure looked their parts. And that in itself is movie magic bringing comic book panels to life. Look out too for Stan Lee whom I think for the first time in the recent slew of Marvel movie adaptations actually play himself!Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer brings back the best elements in the first movie and provides an avenue for more of such adventures with the familiar quartet. It's a popcorn movie and one which entertains throughout its relatively short 90 minutes duration. And I'll stick my neck out and say it again this is probably one of the better movie franchises that Marvel has put out so far. Given the way things are set up if this movie still proves to be a box office success may I now say that we can expect to see the Mole Man next?".

	schema:reviewBody "After the critics and comicbook aficionados gave the first Fantastic Four film a bitchslap of bad reviews it became a surprise hit nonetheless. But some of you already knew there was going to be a sequel on the way. And since there were a lot of mistakes made there must've been some lessons learnt from everyone involvednot that they could care less about negative reception since the movie has made 330 million worldwide. 2 years later the promise that the sequel will be darker so they say and more serious so they say have been hype to death though this is the same hype that has damaged both SpiderMan 3 and X3. Then there's the publicity stills of the Silver Surfer as the next FF baddie helping me leave my lowered expectations behind. I decided to give this one another shot and that's because the Silver Surferwho is one of the coolest Marvel creations ever. Rise of the Silver Surfer is an improvement over the first film And that's saying a lot for those of you who have ever seen the first film since its source material is a reasonable one. The Fantastic Four must save Earth after the Silver Surfer who is the herald of the planet eating being Galactus signals it's destructionwhile Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman prepare for their upcoming nuptials. Seems fair doesn't it? This could've worked but the problem is that a brief 96 minutes runningtime isn't enough to pull it all off. How are you going to pull off an Independence Day under 96 minutes? Not only is the runningtime a huge problem but the film is just too lackluster for me to fancy. And because of everything being so brief arbitrary and perfunctory there's wasn't enough action fighting or confrontational battles between the heroes  their foes. This is a film about an extraterrestrial being coming to destroy Earth but you don't see too many things being blown up devastation of landscapes or set pieces with an atmosphere filled with intensity peril or panic all of the things that can give this film a dramatic affect. Like the first FF film FF2's suffers from a limited imagination and I honestly think that Tim Story lacks the vision that it takes to handle such material that's supposed to be filled with thrills excitement darkness drama and for the faithfulness to the FF camplighthearted fun. The overhyped nuptials of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman turned out to be a disappointing subplot due to the fact that it's just a setup for the Surfer to have his first encounter with the heroes by intruding on the ceremony. Though I was hoping they could get it over withsince it has taken up most of the film's time they have been yapping about it throughout the entire film. But thank god Stan Lee came to make his usual cameo appearance. Was it lighthearted? Yes. Seeing as how there's a goofy dance number with Reed Richards and the typical slapstick momentswhich one scene includes Sue's body helplessly rendered in flames because of Johnny's molecules being unstable after his encounter with the Surfer causing him to switch powers with anyone he touches. Was it funny? Nope. Chris Evans Human TorchJohnny Storm is typically comedic relief with all the dullwitted jokes he can carry but tries to make it work with decent delivery. Michael Chiklis Ben GrimmThe Thing isn't given much to do here but stand behind and be the goofball. The attempt at tenderness between Sue StormInvisible and Reed RichardsMr. Fantastic is unrealistic with both the film's hackneyed script and the lack of chemistry between Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. Whenever these folks are supposed to kiss and show affection it seems rather forced then natural. Alba now looking like Lil' Kim with her blondehooker wig and scarylooking blue contact lenses is just cold and uninteresting for me to stomach. It seems that she is always in this emotionless state. It's like she's this walking mannequin she does nothing but stand around look hot and wear tightfitting outfitswhile wearing eyeglasses to give off the effect that she has some sort of intellectwithout the intellectual babble doh!. The script does nothing to help her express her words but she doesn't have the altitude to express emotion either. Gruffudd seems to always be in this state of lost. It's quite difficult to understand why such an amazingly gifted actor can be so boring in this film. Were any of the heroes fantastic this time? Not a chance. The Fantastic Four are treated are bland superdummies while their nemesis the Silver Surfer upstages all them in terms of awesomeness and coolness. Too bad this isn't his movie. The Silver Surfer rocked no doubt about it and brought to life by amazing special effects he's even more fantastic then the four who carry the moniker. Do we really need Julian McMahon returning as Dr. Doom? People have truly underestimated him in the first film but here he doesn't provide much for the story while the idea of the big badass Galactus turning into a dust storm doesn't work. My advice for the next installment 1. Let see these guy do more fighting 2. Let these characters show their full potential when they perform their superpowers. 3. Never let the next FF baddie cramp the heroes' style 4. Enough with Doom 5. And please upgrade on the special effects they still look cheapeven for a bigbudget film.Of course this is supposed to be a lighthearted family film and like a Diet Coke it's Half the calories PG folkswhile the hardcore comicbook fans with avoid it like the plaque. They deserve better. And by the title being Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer it's really more about the Silver Surfer. In the good words of wisdom from Flava Flav Don't believe the hype.".

Rise of the Silver Surfer is an improvement over the first film And that's saying a lot for those of you who have ever seen the first film since its source material is a reasonable one. The Fantastic Four must save Earth after the Silver Surfer who is the herald of the planet eating being Galactus signals it's destructionwhile Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman prepare for their upcoming nuptials. Seems fair doesn't it? This could've worked but the problem is that a brief 96 minutes runningtime isn't enough to pull it all off. How are you going to pull off an Independence Day under 96 minutes? Not only is the runningtime a huge problem but the film is just too lackluster for me to fancy. And because of everything being so brief arbitrary and perfunctory there's wasn't enough action fighting or confrontational battles between the heroes  their foes. This is a film about an extraterrestrial being coming to destroy Earth but you don't see too many things being blown up devastation of landscapes or set pieces with an atmosphere filled with intensity peril or panic all of the things that can give this film a dramatic affect. Like the first FF film FF2's suffers from a limited imagination and I honestly think that Tim Story lacks the vision that it takes to handle such material that's supposed to be filled with thrills excitement darkness drama and for the faithfulness to the FF camplighthearted fun. The overhyped nuptials of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman turned out to be a disappointing subplot due to the fact that it's just a setup for the Surfer to have his first encounter with the heroes by intruding on the ceremony. Though I was hoping they could get it over withsince it has taken up most of the film's time they have been yapping about it throughout the entire film. But thank god Stan Lee came to make his usual cameo appearance. Was it lighthearted? Yes. Seeing as how there's a goofy dance number with Reed Richards and the typical slapstick momentswhich one scene includes Sue's body helplessly rendered in flames because of Johnny's molecules being unstable after his encounter with the Surfer causing him to switch powers with anyone he touches. Was it funny? Nope. Chris Evans Human TorchJohnny Storm is typically comedic relief with all the dullwitted jokes he can carry but tries to make it work with decent delivery. Michael Chiklis Ben GrimmThe Thing isn't given much to do here but stand behind and be the goofball. The attempt at tenderness between Sue StormInvisible and Reed RichardsMr. Fantastic is unrealistic with both the film's hackneyed script and the lack of chemistry between Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. Whenever these folks are supposed to kiss and show affection it seems rather forced then natural. Alba now looking like Lil' Kim with her blondehooker wig and scarylooking blue contact lenses is just cold and uninteresting for me to stomach. It seems that she is always in this emotionless state. It's like she's this walking mannequin she does nothing but stand around look hot and wear tightfitting outfitswhile wearing eyeglasses to give off the effect that she has some sort of intellectwithout the intellectual babble doh!. The script does nothing to help her express her words but she doesn't have the altitude to express emotion either. Gruffudd seems to always be in this state of lost. It's quite difficult to understand why such an amazingly gifted actor can be so boring in this film. Were any of the heroes fantastic this time? Not a chance. The Fantastic Four are treated are bland superdummies while their nemesis the Silver Surfer upstages all them in terms of awesomeness and coolness. Too bad this isn't his movie. The Silver Surfer rocked no doubt about it and brought to life by amazing special effects he's even more fantastic then the four who carry the moniker. Do we really need Julian McMahon returning as Dr. Doom? People have truly underestimated him in the first film but here he doesn't provide much for the story while the idea of the big badass Galactus turning into a dust storm doesn't work. My advice for the next installment 1. Let see these guy do more fighting 2. Let these characters show their full potential when they perform their superpowers. 3. Never let the next FF baddie cramp the heroes' style 4. Enough with Doom 5. And please upgrade on the special effects they still look cheapeven for a bigbudget film.Of course this is supposed to be a lighthearted family film and like a Diet Coke it's Half the calories PG folkswhile the hardcore comicbook fans with avoid it like the plaque. They deserve better. And by the title being Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer it's really more about the Silver Surfer. In the good words of wisdom from Flava Flav Don't believe the hype.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure the critics and naysayers of this film will take exception to my review but I loved this! As a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four comic I went into the first movie with fairly low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised to the contrary. Not a great superhero movie but a really fun one a trait that far too many films based on comic books seem to be lacking. Having enjoyed the FF the first time around I went into this second one with much higher expectations  and it exceeded them on almost every level! The same feeling of fun was there along with some real blowyououtofyourseat action sequences and what I thought was a pretty good storyline. Perhaps I'm too undemanding or simpleminded but I had a Fantastic! time in the theater watching this movie. In many ways it blew me away like no movie has in a good many years and made me feel like a kid again! Of course it helped that along with the FF the Silver Surfer has always been one of my favorite comic characters. If I have one complaint it's that it ended too soon. I hated for it to be over after only 92 minutes. Hopefully when the DVD is released they'll include a longer extended version as well or as in the case with the first movie they'll wait two years until the third one comes out and make us buy the second movie on DVD all over again. I really hate that sort of marketing ploy but in the case of FF2 it will gladly shell out my money twice. Mostly because I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I think I'll start working on my new home theater system tomorrow!".

This time around Mr. FantasticReed Richards Ioan Gruffudd Sue Storm Jessica Alba Johnny Storm Chris Evans and Ben Grimm Michael Childis tangle with a villain that dwarfs even the maniacally evil Victor Von Doom Julian McMahon and find themselves struggling to save the Earth from an apocalypse like nothing that they faced in the original. The computergenerated special effects are firstrate unlike those in SpiderMan 3 but the CGI as well as the apocalyptic plot never overshadow the characters and the tensions that their comic camaraderie conjures up. Invisible Girl Sue Storm still scolds rubbery Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards about his nerdy obsession for all things scientific while incendiary Johnny Storm cannot rib the granitehard Ben Grimm enough about his stony countenance. Director Tim Story who helmed the breezy lightweight original knows one thing that other summer movie directors could learn. Namely too much of a good thing is not always a good thing. Clocking in at a short and snappy 89 minutes the new Fantastic Four adventure allows you barely enough time to drain a barrelsized soft drink before you have to drain something else.The Fantastic Four The Rise of the Silver Surfer opens ominously enough as an unknown power plows its way inexorably through the galaxy and destroys one planet after another to assuage its awesome appetite for energy. While this mystifying might is wending its way toward Earth everybody on the planet is counting down the hours to the most anticipated marriage in history between Reed Richards and Sue Storm. Eventually the strange force from another galaxy enters Earth's atmosphere. This inexplicable anomaly shocks Japanese sailors in Suruga Bay Japan when it solidifies the waters that they fish in and then surprises tourists in Giza Egypt when it sprinkles snow flakes on the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx. Flashing like a whitehot meteor over Los Angeles it plunges the City of Angels into a startling blackout. The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon interpret this meteorological mayhem as a military threat and they dispatch blunt General Hager Andre Braugher of TV's Homicide to solicit the help of Reed Richards. The Pentagon wants to know where this force will strike next. Reed agrees on the sly to create a sensor that will detect it while he prepares for his upcoming marriage to Sue.Sue and Reed are poised in front of the preacher when the bizarre comet strikes New York City turns their lavish Manhattan wedding into chaos and melts down Reed's sensor apparatus without warning. Reluctantly Johnny Storm incinerates his wedding tuxedo to pursue the object. No sooner has Johnny launched himself into flight like a fireball than the intruder assumes the form of a chromeplated Ken doll riding a metallic surf board. This extraterrestrial literally takes Johnny by surprise and seizes him by the throat in a death grip and then escorts him into outer space. The Human Torch cries uncle and his opponent allows him to plunge back to Earth. This encounter affects Johnny adversely because he can no longer confine his power to himself. He touches The Thing at one point and The Thing turns into The Human Torch. Viceversa Johnny transforms hilariously into the Thing. Later Johnny touches Sue and she bursts into flames while he vanishes. Unbeknownst to our heroes the Silver Surfer took a shortcut earlier over Latveria where Victor Von Doom had been exiled for the duration at the end of the first film and thawed out the evildoer. Initially nothing that the Fantastic Four does thwarts the Silver Surfer so General Hager invites Victor much to the chagrin of our heroes to help out. Victor reveals that the source of the enigmatic Surfer's power lies in his surfboard. Reed concocts a pulse gadget that our heroes to hope to separate the Surfer a CGI effect with the husky voice of Matrix star Laurence Fishburne from his surf board. Meanwhile despite his willingness to help his former foes Victor has something else up his sleeve that augurs ill for everybody.Indeed the formulaic Don Payne  Mark Frost screenplay is pure Fantastic Four with the usual time out allotted for our ensemble's amusing antics with each other as well as some new gadgets. Reed Richards' elastic gyration on the dance floor with a couple of babes on either arm during his stag party generates a sidesplitting sight gag. Only one character of importance perishes in this sequel but his demise is rather grisly considering the PGrating. Nevertheless director Tim Story never lets the action take a breather and keeps things bangslamming ahead to an explosive finale. Reportedly the two Fantastic Four movies have remained largely faithful to its Stan Lee and Jack Kirby origins more than any other series and durable Stan makes another cameo as himself. Predictably this enjoyable entry winds up with a happy ending that leaves things open for another sequel.".

It turns out not so. The Surfer works very well on screen and was captivating enough with enough 'presence' to make me forget about the Terminator movie and just enjoy him as a character in his own right.  Very minor spoiler  I really liked the fact that we got to see the Surfer in his normal superpowered form and his tarnished grayish less shiny depowered form. I thought this was a cute touch and worked very well. Anyone expecting anything other than mindless fun comicbook action and eye candyaplenty is mad. That's all it aims to be and all it could aim to be. And on that basis I'd say the makers have delivered. 8 out of 10 if in a generous mood.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was not a great fan of the first Fantastic Four movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it for the pure fact that I could escape from reality for a couple of hours but it didn't quite grab me like the first X Men or the first Spiderman movies  mainly due to too much character building. That did not put me off seeing FF2 ROTSS though as I knew that it would be SO much better than the first one  and boy was I right! Not only did this move have great special effects some excellent humour and some real WOW moments all I will say is that the new spaceship is pretty awesome but it also had one of the most curious and interesting characters in a comic book movie which came in the form of The Silver Surfer. Doug Jones did a great job and Larry Fishburne as the voice of The Silver Surfer is nowhere near as bad as some people make out. Along with The Silver Surfer came Galactus who is perhaps the most imposing and threatening bad guy ever created in a comic book movie.All in all this was an amazing movie and I could quite happily go back to the cinema and watch it all over again  10 out of 10  best movie of 2007.....until Transformers!".

This latest monstrosity seems to indicate that Marvel lucked out in landing Sam Raimi and Bryan Singer to helm their Spiderman and XMen franchises but otherwise are as clueless as any of the suits in Hollywood as to how to adapt their characters to the big screen.Mistake one was hiring Tim Story. Although he did succeed in finally bringing the Fantastic Four to the screen after years of false starts he also interpreted the material as a situation comedy featuring a bickering family who just happen to be superheroes instead of a group of superheroes who eventually become a family.Thus he wastes screen time on the endless bickering between Sue Storm and Reed Richards over their umteenth postponed wedding. Sorry but Jessica Alba and Iowan Gruffyd are not exactly Hepburn and Tracy. He also wastes his special effects budget on a corny subplot in which Johnny's encounter with the Surfer results in their switching powers which of course means that Jessica Alba gets naked but too bad this movie is rated PG.By making time for all this sitcom material Story shortchanges the main story regarding the Silver Surfer and his mission on Earth. The Surfer just seems to fly around wreaking havoc but basically doing nothing to prepare the way for the coming of Galactus Then when he's interrogated he reveals that his board is a homing device that will draw Galactus and he really doesn't need to do anything else. Duh.The reportedly increased budget the movie is said to have cost 130 million doesn't show on the screen. The Thing in particular looks awful and unbelievable. He also gets little to do apart from grumble in the background and dab his teary li'l eyes at yet another SueReed wedding attempt. The bulk of the FX budget seems to have gone to realizing the Silver Surfer which admittedly looks impressive.The film also wants to harp on a we are familytype theme but then what happens during the big climax? Instead of fighting as a team Johnny absorbs the powers of the rest of his teammates and fights Dr. Doom alone. Double duh.Still Michael Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as the Human Torch do succeed in engendering some good will as they successfully embody their characters. But the film is a failure on virtually every other level and another blackeye for Marvel.".

All the actors fit their characters perfectly and really bring a lot of energy and zest to their roles. This time its a lot funnier and Reed richards is geekier than ever in his science geek  cum  superhero role.The movie never drags although sometimes the humor that involves The Thing is pretty lame and dumbs down the movie a lot while most of the scientific stuff is mentioned to the viewer in a you wont get it anyway summary type explanation that isn't always convincing.However the look of this movie is so grea that you have to see it and especially the day after tomorrow type disasters that SILVER SURFER brings along with him including draining the river Thames in London.Againi the cast looks great with Jessica alba beautiful as usual and Lee evans looking really buff and toned.My advice  go watch it and enjoy yourself instead getting scared straight or bored straight watching all the other big summer sequels.".

I even liked some of his movies most people didn't like Mercenary For Justice Shadown Man and Attack Force... lol OK jk about the last one.But this movie........ there just was nothing good about it. It started off VERY boring showing these people walking through a hospital and the one guy who played the Stonner I thought did a terrible job of acting. It would show a little piece of Seagal and his crew just to remind you that they are still in the movie... The final I would say... 20 minutes was decent with some good fighting. However the movie was SOOOO dark you couldn't see a thing which was very annoying.I could get into every single detail but you catch my drift. This movie as lots have mentioned Is NOT a Seagal movie. I actually heard from a few people that he took the script just for fun and support this movie.Skip this piece of crap and wait for Ruslan to come out as that actually looks like it could be in comparison to Urban Justice and Pistol Whipped.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have noticed that some people are glad to see Steven Seagal move his career in a slightly new direction by leaving behind his traditional style of roles in favor of something of a vampire hunter in his new film Against the Dark or Last Night depending on whether you're looking at the cover box or watching the cast and crew interviews in which he is the leader of a small group of people who stalk through the night dispatching the vampires that the entirety of the human race have transformed into as a result of a viral epidemic.Really? Someone was glad about this? Seagal has been one of my guilty pleasures for almost 20 years now and while the vast majority of his movies are undeniably awful there is always an element of fun in them that manages to come through even the stupidest story lines but not this time. There isn't even any of Seagal's traditional style of asskicking prowess to be had here he just walks through dark hallways occasionally hacking vampires to death.Oh and don't get me started on the vampires. The movie was written by a Mathew Klickstein whose work displays a massive lack of even the slightest bit of writing talent. The movie begins with the explanation that a virus wiped out nearly all of mankind and that there were no vaccines and no immunity. Minutes later a voiceover explains that some of the wounded were immune others just changed. Nice. I like the narrative consistency. Later after meeting several examples of what the human race have transformed into one character explains Everyone thinks they're vampires but they're not. They're mutants. Is this for real? Vampires. Does anyone think these things are vampires? These are typical badly performed zombies straight out of any cheap zombie movie. To suggest that they are vampires is to display a spectacular lack of understanding of one of the most basic tenets of horror movie lore. Vampires among other things drink blood. They don't tear out entrails in mindless feeding frenzies.In one scene one of the vampires tells one of the uninfected characters something like this We have evolved. We think we talk we planYeah but we know all about our evolutionary history but we don't understand that we're zombies not vampires. Consider for example Brad Pitt's and Tom Cruise's brilliant vampire performances in Interview with the Vampire an immeasurably better movie. They are educated they're philosophical they radiate class and style. To say that the things in Against the Dark have evolved from them is quite a statement indeed. So let's just refer to the creatures by what they really are shall we?Steven Seagal's first line in the movie by the way comes after he and his team rush on screen and cut up a bunch of zombies that are closing in on a young boy. After killing all of them Seagal says We're not here to decide what's right or wrong we're here to decide who lives and dies.What does that even mean? It doesn't matter the entire script is stupendously dumb and the movie reduces the destruction of all of mankind to a handful of people wandering around a darkened hospital trying to avoid getting eaten while they wait for Seagal and his crew to come save them. The United States Military headed by Keith David the movie's one completely wasted talent waits outside for Seagal to do all the hard stuff. If you were to make the sad mistake of watching this thing I would actually recommend watching the extra feature on the DVD that talks about the making of the movie. Sometimes these makingof featurettes can be helpful in slightly changing your opinion of a bad movie but in this case it is more interesting than the movie itself just to watch how completely deluded everyone seems to have been in making it. I can't understand how anyone at any moment of production could have tricked themselves into thinking that they weren't making a spectacularly bad movie but they did it man. They really believed they were onto something with this mess. Miss it!".

If you were to make the sad mistake of watching this thing I would actually recommend watching the extra feature on the DVD that talks about the making of the movie. Sometimes these makingof featurettes can be helpful in slightly changing your opinion of a bad movie but in this case it is more interesting than the movie itself just to watch how completely deluded everyone seems to have been in making it. I can't understand how anyone at any moment of production could have tricked themselves into thinking that they weren't making a spectacularly bad movie but they did it man. They really believed they were onto something with this mess. Miss it!";

	schema:reviewBody "I was intrigued by this film and it's premise. You have Steven Seagal fighting vampires I mean that alone should interest any martial arts movie fan since he hasn't really done anything like that before. The film also stars Linden Ashby who can hold his own in action movies such as Mortal Kombat. But within the first five minutes of this film I came crashing back down to the reality that this is 2009 and Seagal has been relegated to the directtoDVD market. This movie is so low budget that almost the entire movie takes place in a hospital that is crawling with vampires although we are told at one point that they are more like mutants. Actually they are more like a hundred extras running around with pointy teeth and fake blood around their mouths. This movie is so low budget that it makes JeanClaude Van Damme's directtoDVD movies look like summer blockbusters. Linden Ashby and veteran character actor Keith David spend all of their scenes yelling at each other in a military tent. Ashby's character wants to give Seagal and his vampire hunters time to clear the building and get the survivors out while David's character wants to blast it ASAP. If these scenes took more than one day to film I would be surprised. Seriously though if I had Linden Ashby and Steven Seagal in the same movie I would at least have them in a scene together not to mention a fight scene. Ahh the fight scenes. Seagal walks around holding a sword for most of the movie. When he uses it it's mostly closeups of him swinging it at the camera. He uses a couple of guns too but it's nothing special. He throws a few mutants around towards the end of the movie as well but again it's nothing special. One member of his hunting crew who is on the show American Gladiators actually steals the show as far as action goes. His action scenes are actually pretty good and the only reason to watch this poor man's Blade. However it's not enough to recommend this movie.".

Seagal and a party of mostly lethargic companions prefer to make use of swords and knives to slice and dice their mutant antagonists which makes little sense since if the mutants were contagious with a dangerous communicable disease drenching themselves in their blood would seem to be unwise. However the courageous multichinned Seagal braves the endemic risks to rescue a pitifully helpless band of plague survivors one has to wonder how in the world they managed to survive at all given their utter helpless condition.As usual Seagal's marshal arts skills are showcased and he demonstrates that even the likes of Orson Wells or Raymond Burr could have been marshal artists despite their physical handicaps.

Question why the couple did not leave the place during the previous daylight? How they have never stumbled with any infected creature while living in the hospital if the place is crowded of them? They meet Tao and his hunters that are in the building killing creatures. Question If the place will be bombed why risk their lives killing the creatures with sword knives or whatever weapon? Further the place is locked up by a gate and the vampire zombies would never leave the building. Amelia speaks and tells that the creatures are an evolution of the human race however they are not able to press the red button to open the gate.

Definitely a low budget film and many actors names that I do not recognize but everyone has to start somewhere to be seen or found. I don't feel that the purchase of the DVD movie was worth the money. I'm not into this type of movie. I purchased it solely because it was a Steven Seagal but ended up disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "Well I wouldn't consider this a spoiler but some may I found that Steven Seagal was barley in this I mean he had a decent amount of screen time but he didn't have nearly as much as he usually does. This movie I found to be really fun to watch and I consider it to be one of the best ever direct to video horror movie I have seen in a long while. The storyline the movie follows is really good it is regular zombie movie storyline but this one I found to be a bit better. The special effects I found to be top notch and very realistic maybe a few that you tell are fake but not many the zombies in this look a lot different than zombies in other movies do but they sort of explain why in the movie the blood and guts in the movie I have to say look awesome I mean they are no theater movie quality but for direct to video they are. The action and fight sequences are pretty good some are a bit shorter than they should be but other wise good. The acting for the most part is really good maybe a few bad actors here and there. So I going leave this movie with a rating of seven out of ten I would have rated it higher but for Steven Seagal's lack of screen time it brought it down. Also it is good to see Steven Seagal do something different for a change I am big fan of Steven Seagal and this I found to be a good move for him. So Make sure that you rent or buy Against The Dark.Overall Rating  out of  12 out of  Oh just to point this out The old man at the beginning has to be one of the scariest things I have ever seen watch it and you will see what I mean.".

Against The Dark is different I could not even go back to watch the ending. There is nothing redeemable about it No beautiful women no humor no catchy phrases no suspense no character to care one iota about it did not even have a decent song for the credits Like Billy Jack  Valley Of The Dolls had. It is without question the worst film this side of Machete in Seagal's car I would sooner sit down and watch stupid reality TV like America's Next Top Model or Bridezilla's above this film At least some of the women are hot. The only thing that could possibly be worse to watch is Machete Walk On The Wild Side and gay porn Since I have never seen that Nor intend to I can only guess at that. As for Seagal there is not a single AList star in motion picture history whose career has fallen further from when he was on top. This includes Boris Karloff who went from Frankenstein  The Mummy to Isle Of The Snake People and the Ghost In The Invisible Bikini Van Damme or even Corey Feldman from The Burbs  The Lost Boys to The Two Corey's. Seagal's performances in films like Against The Dark and Attack Force make the worst Charles Bronson movies at Cannon Films Such as Kinjite and Messenger Of Death look like Death Wish or Once Upon A Time In The West. The last Seagal film that was any good Half Past Dead was made in 2002 which should tell him it is time to retire and never make anyone suffer through any of films again. I will never watch another Seagal film again".

The look of the movie cinematography music and FX were all competent It just needs tighter editing and maybe a few more 'subplots something i thought i'd never ask for given the overabundance of 'fillerplots' in more recent 'Seagal' movies For once a bit more plot wouldn't go amiss other than people wandering around corridors waiting to be attacked....then rescued....the end David Cronenberg pulled off a similar trick in SHIVERS by adding 'offbeat' dialogue and situations. The director of AGAINST THE DARK is no Cronenberg And i'm sure you know by now that although billed as a 'Seagal' flick his screen time amounts to about a third of the running time although the fragmented plot ensures that nearly most of the cast are only ever seen roughly the same length also Seagal is fine in the role of Tao master swordsman and vigilante and one can only sit back and wish that he had more screen time and more 'asskicking' to do but he does do a fair amount here The other actors around him are OK but nothing to right home about either.I was surprised at the 'gore' factor quite Romeroish in places but hardly anything to keep KNB awake at night. With a little bit of editing and more 'choice' dialogue this movie could have easily held it's head up amongst the likes of lower ranked 'zombiefare' like DIARY OF THE DEAD or 28 WEEKS LATER. As it is though it's sadly a horror movie whose 'sole' attraction is a 'star' who is hardly in it It's still a lot better than KILL SWITCH though! Big Lee gives AGAINST THE DARK a 7 out of 10 only for the presence of the 'Stout Sensei'".

But anyway the first two minutes are the most interesting part of the movie. After this the zombies come and eat people that's all what's happening. No progress no goal. We don't know anything about the characters we won't like or hate them. Some of them will be eaten by the zombies we know that from the beginning. This movie is terrible. There's no real script in it the music is terrible the pop rithyms don't fit to the zombies at all. And all the movie is taken place at dark corridors as the didn't have money for any good place to shoot at.I don't recommend this film for anyone. The worst moment was when Steven Seagal stabbed a zombie little boy. Can you imagine it? If you want to see a trash movie in the subject see Zombie Strippers it is not so serious and they have Jenna Jameson in it.".

Call me crazy but it looks as if a stunt man does his fights. Why? Remember Today you Die? and Kill Switch? Whats with the double? Nothing's cooler than to watch Steven Kick Ass!!! Enough 'bout that. Against the Dark is not a Seagal film at all. All he did was about a 10 minute cameo. It's a neat story and it had some nice action bits but that's it. Nice violence too but not enough to keep someone interested. Steven please go back to kicking ass and not all this nonsense!!!!!".

They're trying to find their way down to the basement to get to a parking garage.....before.....uh.....the generator dies and the security door won't let them out? They stumble around in this deserted building being hunted by packs of vampires who seem to have no trouble getting around. They come to door after door which they can't get through because they are locked. I'm sorry but did the world's supply of crow bars just vaporize when this plague hit? Which brings out one of the many flaws in this movie. If I was a survivor in a world overrun by vampires I'd be carrying every weapon I could get my hands on. Even if I couldn't find a gun anywhere I'd get a butcher knife a steel rod hell a big stick. But these people carry nothing. They make no attempt to actively defend themselves from the vampires. They simply wander around like sheep waiting to be eaten. But wait along comes our hero. He does come along right? I mean I do believe I remember seeing one of two quick flashes of him mumbling some stupid commands to his team. And I believe he did actually kill a vampire right? The fight scenes happened so fast and were filmed with constantly shifting camera angles so that you couldn't tell what happened. You see a flash of his face a flash of his sword and then blood is flying everywhere. Nothing he does in this movie even approximates acting. Like good wine some actors get better and better with age. Steven Seagal just goes sour. Like this movie.".

	schema:headline " Baseball Is Better Than Life Because It's Fair...";
	schema:reviewBody "It may be true that everyone during their lifetime has fifteen minutes of fame even if in most cases it only lasts about a minute and a half.  And if that minute and a half comes early in life how far into adulthood can you carry it with you and when does a healthy memory become an obsession that finally blurs the line between reality and fantasy?  The Fan' directed by Tony Scott and starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes is an intense and disturbing motion picture that examines that moment and the effects it can have on the lives of those either directly or indirectly involved.  Here the focus is on one Gil Renard De Niro a knife salesman in San Francisco and a diehard Giants fan who is pumped about the acquisition during the offseason of superstar centerfielder Bobby Rayburn Snipes whom he believes will bring a pennant to the team.  Once a player himself a pitcher Renard's life has since been on a downhill slide.  Divorced he has a young little league aged son Richie Andrew J. Ferchland with whom he has an unsettling relationship and at work his sales have been so poor his job is on the line.  An angry disturbed individual Renard has reached a pivotal point in his life for inspiration he continually returns to the philosophies of the catcher from his playing days Coop Charles Hallahan whom he considers one of the finest athletes he ever knew.  And as his life continues to deteriorate his obsessions begin to add further to the imbalance of his perceptions of reality which finally lead him past a point of no return.Scott's film of course has less to do with baseball than it does with how the game itself actually relates to life and the things that really matter. As Rayburn says at one point We're not curing cancer here.'  But to those to whom life has been reduced to that minute and a half to which they still cling the game can be everything.  And it is just that unhealthy obsession that Scott examines in this film that comparatively insignificant moment that in the obsessive mind becomes an episode of monumental importance that finally distorts any semblance of reality the individual may have left. What's truly frightening is that upon close scrutiny in Renard there is much with which many viewers will be able to relate in one way or another The anger the frustration and perhaps the inability to let go of that minute and a half even when it threatens to become more than just a pleasant memory but an unhealthy lifeline to another place and another time that in reality may never have existed in the first place.  It's like a search for selfesteem by the hasbeenwhoneverwas who can neither realize nor accept it's elusiveness.  As Renard says to Richie Baseball is better than life because it's fair.  You hit a sacrifice fly and it doesn't count against your average.'  An ideal that has forever eluded Renard in his life he's never been able to give himself up for the team' and get anything in return for it.As Renard De Niro gives an explosive performance that at first glance may seem to have a bit of Travis Bickle and Max Cady in it which in fact it does though upon closer inspection Renard is a unique character.  Those with a disturbed mind may have traits in common as these characters De Niro has portrayed certainly do but De Niro has successfully given each of them an individual personality and when viewed side by side the differences are readily apparent.  Bickle may be a sociopath Cady a cold blooded killer but Renard is a man who was just never able to get a handle on his life and has allowed his obsessions to dictate the choices he has made along the way. De Niro is simply a master of his craft with the ability to make his characters so real that a performance like this one is often overlooked this is Oscar worthy work for which he never received the acclaim he was due.  His Renard is so like someone you would run into in your everyday life that in retrospect it's scary.  But it's the kind of performance we've come to expect from De Niro and as usual he does not disappoint.Wesley Snipes as well gives a solid performance as Rayburn that is one of his best ever which is not surprising when you consider with whom he was working.  If you study De Niro's films you may discover a common thread running through them with regard to his costars.  De Niro has the ability to make those with whom he is working better and it's something that stays with them forever after.  Consider Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep before The Deer Hunter' or Ed Harris before Jacknife.'  Certainly they were exceptional talents before but they have arguably been better since. And Snipes is no exception.  Nor is Benicio Del Toro Recipient of the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for Traffic' who gives a memorable turn here as Rayburn's rival outfielder Juan Primo.  The supporting cast includes Patti D'Arbanville EllenEllen Barkin Jewel John Leguizamo Manny Chris Mulkey Tim Dan Butler Garrity and Brandon Hammond Sean.  A thought provoking thriller that gives some real insight into the cause and effect of the psyche of human nature The Fan' is like an open wound that may hit too close to home for some.  And to dismiss this as just a baseball' movie or another action' flick would be a mistake for there is much more here than meets the eye.  In the end those who pay attention will ultimately reap the rewards it proffers.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although The Fan has a baseball setting with the late Candlestick Park in San Francisco it's not a baseball story. It's the dual story of a fan obsessed with baseball and his favorite player and that same player and his performance anxiety living up to the huge amount of money the Giants are paying him.The title role is played by Robert DeNiro and a lot of his character is taken from what Michael Douglas had earlier did in Falling Down. DeNiro is the son of the founder of the company he works for but dad having passed away long ago the company is in different hands. DeNiro is not cutting it as a salesman of hunting knives no pun intended and he's having problems with his former wife Patty D'ArbanvilleQuinn over visitation with his son.At the same time multimillion dollar acquisition Wesley Snipes is having problems living up to the hype and he's looking like a big old bust. Especially next to new Giant sensation Benicio DelToro who is carrying the team with what looks like a Most Valuable Player season. Snipes is only doing well on one front his relationship with his young son.As his life falls apart DeNiro starts fixating on his favorite player and what he can do to help motivate him. After that this film gets truly bizarre. But DeNiro who probably has more disturbed characters under his creative belt than any other actor around today keeps it all real. He's matched by Wesley Snipes who plays a Barry Bonds like superstar who gets a good life lesson by the end of the film.In fact Snipes realizes it before the film ends. As he quite realistically says it's just a game it's not like we're out there discovering a cure for cancer. The problem is that there are too many out there fans like DeNiro in sports and in show business who get way too caught up in it.Look also for nice performances by Ellen Barkin who has a sports phonein show and John Leguizamo as Snipes's agent and the wisest guy he has around him.".

But I didn't enjoy this movie solely on the fact that I like De Niro I thought Snipes gave an equally choice performance. The thrills in this movie were small but they were satisfying. The ending is without a doubt the best part. There were other good thrills though like the freezer scene. I must say that I liked this movie a good deal. Its is not without its flaws but in order to enjoy this movie and a lot of other movies for that matter you must look past the flaws and just take it for what it is. Enjoy this movie for its handful of thrills decent acting and great music I am a big fan of the Rolling Stones also. This is a good nobrainer with a creepy overtone so just watch it for its pros not its cons. 810".

Baseball movies have no spine to them whatsoever they tend to all ways follow the same Pride of the Yankees formula where Baseball is a fraternal sport in which everything is okay. The Fan digs deeper.Robert DeNiro plays Gil Bernard an odd knife salesman who loses the visitation rights to be with his son. Bernard vents his rage by following his San Francisco Giants religiously. Gil becomes obsessed with Bobby Rayburn the Giants' new top paid center fielder. Rayburn believes in jinxes and wants his lucky jersey number back to end a slump. Gil gets it for him by killing his teammate. Gil confronts Rayburn who says his change of luck was due to his not caring anymore. Gil goes berserk and threatens to kill Rayburn's son if he doesn't due a Babe Ruth and hit a homer for him.DeNiro represents the Fan who turns to MLB as an escape from real life. His Gil is a tragic character who only lives for the game and focuses on what he could have been and what he wants to force his son to become. We don't necessarily agree with him but we can better see what makes this villain tick.Snipes Rayburn isn't a bad guy but he like the ARod's of day let's the fame get to his head. He undergoes a perspective change through the film as he questions what the game means to him.The Fan is a great dark satire of baseball. We see all the aspects that are there but are so often ignored. The greed of the players and their agents the sports writers eager to sink their teeth into the slumping hitter and the fathers who try to pressure their children to live their athletic dreams through them.My one complaint about the film is it's ending.

His own marriage has failed dismally he is involved in an acrimonious divorce and his son seems to have taken to the new man in his mother's life. Gil who is a sporting knives salesman has problems with his clients to the point that his boss has no other alternative than to get rid of him.What is Gil supposed to do? When his idol Bobby Rayburn is hired for the San Francisco Giants as an outfielder Gil feels his team will have a chance for the pennant. His obsession will get the best of him. He even tries to influence another player into switching uniform numbers with his new idol. When all that fails Gil decides to take a different path and ends up stalking Rayburn with terrible consequences.The Fan directed by Tony Scott starts on an upbeat note. The film based on a Peter Abrahams book we didn't read with a screenplay by Phoef Sutton plays well until it has Gil Renard going nuts when his whole world crumbles.Robert Deniro under Mr. Scott's direction does what he can to the script that has him playing the deranged Gil in ways that doesn't help the film. It's fun to watch Mr. Deniro impersonating Gil Renard whose passion for the American pastime ruins his life. We get a hint of how he got involved in the sport at the end of the movie. Wesley Snipes makes one of the best appearances of his career. In minor roles we see a wasted Ellen Barkin Benicio del Toro and John Leguizamo among others.This is a film for Mr. Deniro's fans.".

Also yet again baseball shows itself as the sport most able to provide striking visual metaphors for the ups and downs of life though as a Brit I've noted some of the specific criticisms aimed at the baseball sequences in this movie by IMDb commenters from the US.Where the movie via the genius of De Niro certainly succeeds is in convincingly demonstrating how easily and quickly obsessive devotion can turn to obsessive hatred when the object of that devotion fails to meet the assumptions of the extreme fan. Certainly there's some of Max Cady the Cape Fear psychotic in his portrayal but there's also a lot of Rupert Pupkin the confused kidnapper and wouldbe comic from King of Comedy  both films of course directed by Martin Scorsese.Where the film fails is in being too repetitive and consequently a bit too long one or two of the scenes where Gil is trying to sell his knives are superfluous and when Gil is at the game with his son why does the camera have to keep cutting to the woman in the crowd  once or twice would have been sufficient. Several of the scenes also seem derivative especially those involving Dan Butler as Garitty the sales manager which echo Glengarry Glen Ross. A major unconvincing aspect is that surely a 40m signing like Bobby Raybourn Wesley Snipes would be surrounded by a lot more razzmatazz than simply one nottooeffective agent John Leguizamo.But on the whole one to rent or watch on TV as I've just done if nothing more compelling is available.".

The scene where De Niro kidnaps Snipe's son Shawn is really quite disturbing and i loved the mind games from De Niro! plus The ending was great in my opinion. Snipes does a really cool Barry Bonds impression and i actually found Snipe's character really likable! plus the opening narration was pretty cool!. Another disturbing scene is when De Niro visits Del ToroJuan Primo in the steam room and i found the character development to be awesome! plus the story is gripping and engrossing all the way!. This is a tense and gripping character study that never lets go with a fantastic story and 2 amazing performances from De Niro and Snipes and i say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Tony Scott does a fantastic job here with outstanding and stylish camera work great anglesand lots of other cool shots plus he kept the film at an engrossing pace!. The Acting is wonderful!.

And in this movie you get great up close shots of Robert DeNiro as he says his lines unlike most of his other films. Supporting actors such as John Leguiziamo and Benicio Del Toro deliver very well each in his own unique roles. This movie was really good in every single way I can think of very well put together. Wesley Snipes does great in a different role as a father and baseball star other than him usually being the butt kicking hero of the movie.

I don't know how anyone can say this with a straight face if they have also seen Major League.It's true that the ending of this film is pretty bad but when a film can do so much right for the first two hours that certainly makes it worthwhile because the first two hours were truly entertaining.  De Niro stole the show he had to because this move was about The Fan but each character was played well.Most of the criticisms I've seen are a case of people being way too picky. Wrong uniforms wrong stadiums...I didn't even notice stuff like this and I am a baseball fan too.  The film got a lot of the much more important stuff right which is good performances from the actors and good no great character development and insight into these characters.The film took us into deep the mind of the obsessed fan De Niro and that obsession grows in a logical fashion as the movie progresses.  It was very easy to believe De Niro's obsession with Rayburn and the game of baseball and the rationale for it because of his unstable and violent nature which is often shown in his personal life.  When things in the baseball world weren't going as he wanted them it's not surprising to see him take action. His passion and intensity were on the front burner all movie long and made his character truly believeable and consistent.The film takes us into the baseball player culture in the lockeroom and into the workings of player and agent which is what I really found interesting as well as player and radio station personality.  This is where the film truly excelled the inner workings of the mind and the baseball player culture were believable and exceptionally well done. Nothing was made silly or outrageous like in the aforementioned dud Major League.  Well except for the ending perhaps which is where this film loses 2 points.810My first De Niro movie definitely not my last.".

Bobby the 40 million dollar man that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him who was in a king size slump all season now with Primo gone and his famed 11 back started hitting up to expectations.It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean Brandon Hammond from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool which is the least he could do for him Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks 40 million of them not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby who has no idea what Gil did for him that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth!SPOILERS The movie The Fan is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing being off the wall crazy that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent like some kind of Deity in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero his battery mate Coop Charles Hallahan when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was.The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance you'll never guess as who out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very naturalfor him performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in Cape Fear some six years earlier.".

Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very naturalfor him performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in Cape Fear some six years earlier.";

	schema:reviewBody "MANY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW This movie was horrible. I am a huge baseball fan so I thought I'd watch it and I was very disappointed. It started out okay.. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son I was hoping that he would become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyways at the beginning it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the protagonist. He was the only one that believed in Bobby and he had his adorable son that he was losing custody of which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo when out of absolutely nowhere he brutally stabs Primo to death... Not to mention that sketchy reoccurring song I WANT TO  YOU!!!! at random unfitting moments.Later when DeNiro saves Bobby's son from drowning I was hoping that the movie could redeem itself.. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depth of the movie because all he cares about is getting CREDIT for the murder and does so by stealing Bobby's son car and dog and holding them hostage Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is a true fan while displaying a picture of him biting a knife.Now we get to the completely unrealistic scene at the end... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe that the game hasn't been called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in an umpire suit and calls Bobby out at home proceeding to pull out his knife and start stabbing everyone that runs onto the field. There are seemingly no officers on the field but the police are on their way so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pitch a knife to Bobby when he gets shot to death. But don't worry this cheerful and pleasant movie has a happy ending because Bobby find his son.This is NOT a sports movie. It is NOT about a fan. As far as I know fans are not rabid psychopaths that threaten rob and throw knives at their admirees. This is likely to be the sickest movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow the soundtrack sucked the movie had no purpose whatsoever. I warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film.".

However not long into the season Rayburn's form goes downhill fast and he starts to fall out with his teammates especially the onform Juan Primo. Gil decides to try and help Rayburn any way he can even if it means taking things a bit too far but when he's not given the credit he thinks he deserves after Rayburn starts hitting again Gil takes matters into his own hands after a chance meeting with Rayburn.Whether you like psychological thrillers are a fan of De Niro or Snipes or all of the above The Fan is definitely a mustsee kind of movie. The story's not intricate nor deeply complex but it doesn't need to be when it's told  delivered as good as this.The film's cast is excellent...De Niro Snipes Leguizamo Del Toro all do a fantastic job but the master is definitely De Niro and he's at his psychotic best once again. The way he portrays Gil going on a steady downward spiral deeper into insanity is fantastic and scarily realistic. Snipes also does a good job of playing cocky Rayburn which isn't too far off how a lot of players see themselves.The Nine Inch Nails soundtrack of Closer is used to great effect and really adds to atmosphere of Gil's descent into madness. I've seen people moaning about the lack of realism regarding the game of baseball in this movie also. How many action movies have we seen where the hero gets shot at 1000s of times but doesn't get hit once? Or all those James Bond moments when he's in trouble? People still enjoy them though. Yes some of it's not realistic e.g. playing the game in a torrential downpour but if you want realism regarding baseball then go and watch a documentary about the game. This is a film for entertainment...not education so just enjoy it for what it is.".

In fact his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear which was actually pretty good but I can't stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie.  I believe it gets old and that is the case here.There's nothing surprising in this movie but then the story has been told a million times before.  Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player and his conceit shows through in his characterization.  De Niro plays the obsessed fan but his role in this film is less than entertaining.However because De Niro is IN this film that makes it a draw if you are a fan no pun intended who sees everything he does no matter how bad.  But to see De Niro at his best see Midnight Run Goodfellas or Cop Land or even go way back and check out Taxi Driver or Godfather II.  Don't waste your time with this drivel.My Rating  310".

Of course he's had plenty of practice in the past whether it's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver or Max Cady in Cape Fear De Niro has specialized in dangerously offthewall roles and Renard is up there with the best of them. He lifts what is otherwise a conventional thriller flashily directed by Tony Scott into something memorable and relegates everyone else on screen into third base in particular Ellen Barkin the only female of note in the cast and even then used perfunctorily. What De Niro does here may not in great acting in any strict definition of the term but by God it is still something to behold.".

Of course he's had plenty of practice in the past whether it's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver or Max Cady in Cape Fear De Niro has specialized in dangerously offthewall roles and Renard is up there with the best of them. He lifts what is otherwise a conventional thriller flashily directed by Tony Scott into something memorable and relegates everyone else on screen into third base in particular Ellen Barkin the only female of note in the cast and even then used perfunctorily. What De Niro does here may not in great acting in any strict definition of the term but by God it is still something to behold.";

The theme is plausible enough but the editing of the film makes jumps in logic that just can't be. We see De Niro as a driven hot headed knife salesman as a stalker as a baseball has been and a derelict dad. How much worse can he be? Wesley Snipes is a mythic baseball player loving father superstitious superstar and must endure the fan wrath of a new city. Guess what happens? Duh. And to top it all off it's boring. Even to a huge baseball fan like myself. Go to a bad restaurant instead and get food poisoning you'll feel better about the time you spent.".

Well I'm going to once again give you an honest review I saw this movie last Saturday and honestly enjoyed it. I know I'm going to receive a lot of bashing but I always look at movies as what they are supposed to be this was meant to be a children's movie it's meant for fun. Remember how we all had those cheesy animal movies when we were kids as well? Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no different it's just updated with today's world. I thought it was a good idea we see all these rich people nowadays with the way they just lavish their dogs with jewels that cost more than people's houses it takes a little joke at it. The story is recycled but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes.Chloe is a Beverly Hills Chihuahua who is just so pampered with clothes jewelery and a life style anyone would die to have. Her owner Vivian has to go away on a business trip and leaves her party girl niece Rachel to watch Chloe. When they go to Mexico Chloe is kidnapped and put into a dog fight... she is then saved by another dog Delgado who is going to help her get back to Beverly Hills. But when the man who runs the dog fights finds out that Chloe is worth something he sends his Doberman dog Diablo after her. Rachel the land scaper Sam and his dog Pepi who is also in love with Chloe are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound.Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a fun movie if you give it a decent chance I thought it was a nice chance from the constant CGI we always have with these animal stories. I was also impressed that the talking didn't look so fake with the dogs. I tell you though I'm convinced that the dog that played Delgado is the same dog from I Am Legend that dog just deserves an Oscar lol come on you gotta agree. Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a great family film as for seeing it on your own or with a friend I would say that it's worth the rental more so. It's a silly movie I admit but I had a fun time watching it and I wish IMDb users would give this movie the fair chance it deserves.610".

Chihuahua does not fall into that category by any means but that does not warrant dismissing it outright. It is true that the film's cast could have been put to better use but given the parameters set by the Disneystyle writing they did what they could and it was enough to let me enjoy their performances. I read a review on here that commented on the inaccuracy of geographical information. I agree that if Disney is going to make a film like this it is unfortunate that they do not take the time to educate their young audiences a little. We wouldn't be talking doctorate level research here just basic factchecking.The plot of this movie was not deep but not many Disney movies NEED to be in order to cater to their young audience and family demographic. I am a twentysomething and I am able to tolerate Disney's material because I accept it for what it is shallow vapid entertainment designed to convey squeakyclean ideals to impressionable youth. Sometimes they take that squeakycleanliness too far like making light of the dog fights but overall it is all rooted in the same objective to maintain their target demographic and intake revenue.To the people who reference the different caliber of Disney's entertainment ten or more years ago I concur with you. It would be good for Disney to trace its roots a bit and return to basics but it would take a lot of cutting through green to accomplish that.I enjoyed this movie. There was a comment on the discussion board mentioning that the trailer distorted people's initial impression. I am one of those people. Once I got into the movie though I applied my usual preconditions for judging Disney films and had a good time. It was cute and in Disney's typical fashion it contained halfbaked attempts to teach the kids a thing or two inaccurate or vague as they were.Go into it knowing it's Disney and will thus inherit the characteristics of all their work and you'll be fine.".

And it is for the first 10 minutes or so.But then it transitions into something completely different than where I thought it was going. I liked how it eventually talked about cultural identity and not forgetting where you're from which was a good direction for the movie. With that it was good how the human girl and the girl chihuahua both become less ignorant as the film progresses. And come on it was adorable how this was basically a chick flick with little doggies instead! It was pretty hilarious in some parts George Lopez as Papi! especially with some interesting song choices lol. My only quibbles were the slight sappiness with the whole Disney hastohaveamoral dialogue and that Drew Barrymore's voice was annoying after a while as the lead chihuahua with her whining... Still it was pretty great and it got the whole theater laughing at several points.It's nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself that seriously once in a while  So basically go see this before you condemn it to a rating worse than Gigli's!".

Before seeing the movie I read the comments here and went into it with little expectations. I was happily surprised enough so to take the time to register here at IMDb and state my opinion. 'Nough said!!";

Sure I was bothered by depictions of the excesses of the super rich of Beverly Hills the way they lavish excess not only upon themselves but their dogs. However this does exist. There are people who piously attend charity events for starving strangers and then go home to feed their dogs Kobe beef. That's the world and this movie did not make that world.I would prefer being upset about watching the reality of such excess than watching the superb and factually accurate Hotel Rwanda. I found that movie unwatchable due to the pain it evoked in me knowing that these events actually occurred during my lifetime.So given a choice  do I wish to feel pain at real or even a pretend horror depiction or contempt at the super rich's folly?

	schema:headline " A Tail Unlike Any Other";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. One reviewer from Mexico has pointed out that in the film they take a train to Tijuana which has no train station that they go the wrong way to Chihuahua that they get their Aztecs and Toltecs all mixed up and so forth. Yes that is all true and it is also true that Americans have never been any good at geography except that they know that California is west of New York somewhere and that Mexico is 'somewhere down there' like the bowels. But never mind. It is all in fun. Nothing about this film is meant to be in any way serious. It takes comedy to new canine heights. Nothing is more effective in comedy than to treat the ridiculous as sublime and here we have the utmost expression of that technique. I suppose for all I know that there really are silly women in Beverly Hills who carry their Chihuahuas around with them covered in diamond necklaces booties and jewelstudded caps. No human folly ever surprises me especially those of the spoilt rich and above all those of Tinsel Town. But nevertheless the excesses of Chihuahua fashion seen in this film which transcend anything ever dreamt of by Dior or Chanel must surely trespass upon the borders of fantasy? Or am I being nave and it is all even more extreme than that in real life? But accepting as normal the wildly extravagant as the film's opening premise we go on from there to the most hilarious and bizarre adventures of a spoilt Chihuahua ever recorded in canine annals. Not since the first pet was adopted by the first cave child have we ever seen anything like this. Words fail us. So do barks and woofs. There is just no way to describe it you have to see it. The voices used for the animals are uncanny. Andy Garcia's voice of a sad worldweary Alsatian German Shepherd is a triumphant achievement worthy of a Vocal Oscar if such things existed. Drew Barrymore as the spoilt heroine Chihuahua is oops so convincing that well what must her friends think now? The dogs all deserve Dog Oscars Golden Dog Bowl Awards etc. The amazing rat and iguana characters in the film carrying special effects into new realms are pure Disney genius. I have no idea how they made this film. The dogs' lips move and words come out just like George Bush. Was Dick Cheney a production ventriloquism adviser? The deleted scenes on the DVD are a 'must' for viewing and should not be missed. I would not call this film corny. I would not call it cute. I would call it a brilliant comedy achievement in every respect and a special effects and production triumph giving us 91 minutes of nonstop hilarity and reminding us that even when the world economy is collapsing we can still laugh until we cry.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. One reviewer from Mexico has pointed out that in the film they take a train to Tijuana which has no train station that they go the wrong way to Chihuahua that they get their Aztecs and Toltecs all mixed up and so forth. Yes that is all true and it is also true that Americans have never been any good at geography except that they know that California is west of New York somewhere and that Mexico is 'somewhere down there' like the bowels. But never mind. It is all in fun. Nothing about this film is meant to be in any way serious. It takes comedy to new canine heights. Nothing is more effective in comedy than to treat the ridiculous as sublime and here we have the utmost expression of that technique. I suppose for all I know that there really are silly women in Beverly Hills who carry their Chihuahuas around with them covered in diamond necklaces booties and jewelstudded caps. No human folly ever surprises me especially those of the spoilt rich and above all those of Tinsel Town. But nevertheless the excesses of Chihuahua fashion seen in this film which transcend anything ever dreamt of by Dior or Chanel must surely trespass upon the borders of fantasy?

But not by much.This new Disney production features talking dogs thieving rats a meek iguana and the overshadowed acting talents of Jamie Lee Curtis and Piper Perabo Cheaper By the Dozen.On a scale of 110 this effort does not rate very high. In fact the most interesting aspect of a movie like this will be trying to figure out some of the animal's voices.To help with this let me explain the very weak plot line Curtis is Vivian the super rich owner of a cosmetics company who lives in a sparkling opulent mansion and owns a spoiled white Chihuahua named Chloe voice of Drew Barrymore.Treating the pet better than any child would ever be Vivian is forced to go to Italy on business. She decides to leave Chloe in the care of her irresponsible slut of a Chloehating niece Rachel Perabo but the ditsy girl loses the pooch in Cabo San Lucas.For some reason the twoounce pup is nabbed by some of Michael Vick's dogfighting friends and taken to Mexico City and then put up  inexplicably  against a huge Doberman Pinscher Edward James Olmos who is owned by the evil Vasquez Jose Maria Yazpik.A disgraced police dog Delgado Andy Garcia however saves Chloe and the two escape to various Mexican locations before finally working their way back to Tijuana.Of course Rachel is now repentant and with her Latin gardener Pedro and his Chihuahua Papi George Lopez is in hot pursuit all over the Yucatan Penninsula.Aided by the Manuel the pack rat Cheech Marin and a pit bull named Chico Paul Rodriguez Chloe and Delgado make their way north only to be attacked by cougars. Some fun huh? But thanks to Placido Domingo as the voice of the Mighty Chihuahua Montezuma and thousands of such dogs the day is saved.One may read this and wonder why I'm spending so much time describing this silly film. Well it's currently No. 1 at the box office millions having already paid to see it so why not read an unbiased review.The theme of talking animals has been a staple of comedy films since Francis the Mule mouthed off to Donald O'Connor and Mr. Ed wisecracked with Alan Young. The difference here is that most of the beasts being Chihuahuas there's a Spanish appeal. Plus most of the picture is a travelogue showcasing the more beautiful parts of Mexico.The human acting is fairly abysmal while the dogs should keep little ones entertained for awhile. Like all movies of this ilk i.e. Shaggy Dog Dr. Dolittle the goingson are basically harmless and there are one or two somewhat humorous moments.Not enough to ever pay full price to see however.".

Fart and burp jokes bathroom humor and nothing more than another movie propaganda that lies to audiences on how great a certain breed of dog are that then get people to impulse buy it and dump it 6 months to a year later at the shelter ala 101 Dalmations. Apparently Disney finally listened to the 100s of letters and petitions asking them to stop making the same cookiecutter dog movie.First the trailers make you think Papi is the top dog in this movie. Its actually Chloe the female chihuahua that the movie focuses on. If not for the supporting cast the movie would have likely sucked. I was surprised at the heavy issues they dealt with in the movie and how well executed it was.For one...Chloe is lost and found by a man who brings her to a dog fighting ring. Yes dog fighting in a Disney movie. Though don't be getting memories of White Fang. This dog fighting ring is not shown so bloodthirsty. You KNOW its a bad place. There are all sorts of dogs there of several breeds. Pit bulls German Shepherd mastiffs and dobermans. One of the pit bull mixes is sadly praying in Spanish. One of the other dogs says he always prays before a fight. Chloe was brought there to be a bait dog. They never use the words bait dog. But they put her in the ring with El Dialbo a badass doberman. Delgado a German shepherd breaks out of his cage and releases the rest of the dogs then he saves Chloe and all the dogs run for the hills. The owner of the fighting ring notices last minute that Chloe is wearing a diamond collar and knows she's worth money and sends El Diablo to find her.Papi and his owner as well as the woman entrusted to care for Chloe go to Mexico to find her. They come upon two of the former fighters a mastiff mix and a pit bull mix and they join them. On their journey both dogs get adopted. We also find out Papi is adopted too. And at the end of the flick a message to the audience about researching a breed before you get it and adopting over buying.On stereotyping Mexicans as a Hispanic American I was not insulted in the least. You have the hero human who is Mexican working as a landscaper yes...stereotype but they used that stereotype deliberately to show you how wrong people are. The heroine human insults him by assuming he can only speak Spanish and talks down to him in her own form of Spanish. He goes along with it. But with Jaime Lee Curtis character you see he is not just the hired help but a member of her family as far as they are concerned. The millionaire seems to look at him as a son or nephew. And she treats his shelter dog Papi very well too. In Mexico itself you see people helping them out all the time. Yes some of the places they go are not the nicer sides of town but the people are good. I think the only people who have anything to complain about here are Dobermon owners. They kept from stereotyping all the other dangerous breeds but them.It was no award winner it was never meant to be. But it was a great family flick that doesn't talk down to youngsters and its side stories were fantastic. Hopefully this movie makes future adopters out of kids and parents.".

Now don't get me wrong there are some excellent kids movies but it seems like Disney was so worried about the demographic of children there that they dumbed it down for them. A lot of the voice overs almost sounded like they were talking down to the audience as if it was all supposed to be for kids. I thought it would be better because George Lopez was one of the voice overs and I really like him as a comedian. However it wasn't that great.With that being said I don't know if I'd say I totally hated it. There were some funny moments in it. There were two characters in particular that were actually funny and they were an iguana and a rat. I noticed that one of those characters was voiced by Cheech Marin who everyone will recognize. As I mentioned above George Lopez was in it and I must say he did have some funny lines also. I actually think the worst voice actor in this movie was Drew Barrymore I just think she should stay out of voice acting and stick with live action movies because she really didn't do it for me.I do realize that voice acting is kind of a weird thing to be judging and I usually never notice it but a lot of the voicesthe beginning in particularjust felt like they were talking down to me like I was a little kid. I felt like some allstar cast was trying to read a bedtime story to my little sister.So overall it had some funny moments but it was kind of forgettable. I probably won't see it again unless I can catch it on Disney Channel one day. I would say don't waste your money but if you just want to see a movie to watch with your kids and make them entertained for an hour and a half go ahead and see it.".

Set in a middle class suburban neighborhood April Showers focuses on the lives of a handful of teachers and students as they attempt to make sense of a world that has just been turned upside down by one of their own. With the community and an entire nation caught up in the 'story' the students of Jefferson High must turn to one another for answers. In the wake atrocity the rifts caused by misinformation and a frenzied media prove difficult to overcome. Lost and lonely under the international spotlight one young man navigates his way through his almost indiscernible home. From quaint suburban town to battlefield turned media circus Jefferson High provides the backdrop for Sean's struggle to cope with the loss of his friend April.";

This film if nothing else accentuates the following inescapable truth A shared episode of on campus mindless violence will divide the lives of all those present into Before and After.April Showers obviously is a labor of love. It was produced written and directed by survivors. This simple reality makes the film incomparably original in a number of ways but is simultaneously the source of April's one big flaw. Let's focus on the positive elements first. Unlike any other movie about school shootings almost all of the violence is offcamera. No endless loop slowmo's of exploding blood packets here! Also never before have I seen a portrayal of those left behind in the wake of a tragedy like this in such total shock as to be not only speechless but practically paralyzed days after the event. These excruciatingly awkward bouts of onscreen silence contribute to making April painful to watch at times. Sometimes very InYourFace aggressive about driving home a point but just when you're ready to throw in the towel and say Enough already! the Director manages to back off. You must be patient with this movie. About halfway through I was almost ready to give up on it. When all was said and done it was an extremely satisfying experience. Two hours after viewing I decided it was most definitely a good movie. It could have been a really great one! The big flaw I mentioned earlier April needed more character development before pulling the proverbial rug out from under the viewer's feet. The film provided a lot more development later on though. Perhaps the Director's intention was to add to our sense of bewilderment and confusion but it was almost a dealbreaker for me.

Instead the movie is really about a supposed tragic love story that is tragic because of a school shooting. It's almost like the shooting and the reactions of some of the traumatized kids are afterthoughts to this love lost story. Which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if you cared for the characters at all. But the 2 main characters April and her love interest whose name I am forgetting right now and who really needs a haircut in the worst way just aren't likable. You don't really CARE that April is killed in the movie. You don't really care that the greasy hippie is in pain. What I seemed to care more about was the kid whose life was being turned upside down because he happened to be friends with the killer...except that the director spent far too little time on this significantly more interesting aspect of the film and instead tried to fulfill the clich pretty people in suffering aspect that you come to expect from movies nowadays. I expected a lot from this movie and I gave it a 5 mainly because of a really great trailer that gets you very interested in the watching the film however the film itself is something I wouldn't really recommend watching unless you're an avid movie watcher who enjoys watching everything you can get your hands on.".

Yes I am sorry for their families and it's a shame it happened but I don't care because those people are so loosely connected to me.The acting was average and the score seemed to drone on with little variation. What we are left with is just the events as they happened on the day which even then were poorly told. There was no tension or fear when the shooting began and I didn't feel the kind of frenzy I imagine you would get in a situation like that when you don't know what is going on.Then once the shooting had taken place the film spent an hour and 10 minutes showing people crying.

	schema:headline " I Regret Calling This Film a Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my second review of this film and in my previous one I called the film a masterpiece. After reviewing the film a good many times here's a better conclusion I've come up with.First let me say this is not a bad film. It is very far from that  but it certainly has its flaws. A film based of the Columbine High School Massacre isn't exactly at the top of many people's lists of films to see and I think we can all understand that. Many of us remember that day much like we remember 911. Where we first heard the news who we were with etc. And with the recent Ft. Hood shootings we do remember these things. This is the main reason why this film has caused a bit of confusion as to why it would be made. Why would anyone want to capitalize off the deaths of teenagers? April Showers is not that.The story is of Sean Kelly Blatz a senior at Jefferson High School in the last weeks of school. Within the first few minutes we learn of romance troubles between him and April Ellen Woglom. This is the first part where the film goes wrong. Not that we have a romantic subplot but as we learn its a love triangle between Sean April and Vicki Janel Parrish. But wait who's Vicki? I had to go online just to find out who she was then to discover most of her parts were cut from the final film. Why? Now we have a love triangle that is only one sided. This causes confusion throughout the entire film now that Vicki isn't part of it what is April so ticked about? Why is Sean confused? We don't find out. The only mention of it is with a conversation Sean has with Mr. Blackwell Tom Arnold giving us a glimpse.Then we have our second mistake. Once we meet all our characters for a minutes the worst possible thing happens  a shooter goes on a rampage throughout the school killing many fellow students and others. During this shooting I struggled to remember most of the characters names. Why? Because we only saw them once and for some less than a minute. Alas the mistake. Lack of character development and this carries through the entire film. April Showers is a film where the characters a key so we need to connect with them. The reason we can't is the film jumps into the action much to soon. When a central character dies one who we've only seen not even a line from how do we feel sad? Sure the scene is sad but the impact isn't there. We don't feel like we've lost anyone its just like watching a sad news story. Since we didn't know who was killed we don't feel sad for them. This seems to be for most characters in the film. What happens to us then? We're taken through an awful experience of a film. Not because the film is awful but because the event is awful. We're taken through nearly two hours of confusion depressing events and people fighting with each other. But at least we don't... oh wait we have. We through a religious message into the film. There isn't an issue with this unless like this film your shoving the message down the throats of the audience. This doesn't exactly help us out any more.We don't even have anything comedic in the film. Yes I understand this is based off a tragedy but this is a movie. The audience needs a breather a little laugh would be fine if not you end up with what this film came out to be  just plain depressing and even at times boring.But here are some positive sides to this  the direction is solid here and I'm impressed how well Andrew Robinson did considering this is only his second film. The film has a very very impressive score to go with that one of the better I've heard from an Indie film certainly in my top 10 scores. The cinematography is what really puts this film together very impressive awardworthy work.As for our acting skills. Being an Indie shot in the middle of Nebraska its at times what you expect from certain actors. But our lead actors let me say are fantastic. If it wasn't for them how this film remains watchable would be lost. They should have a bright bright future here as most of these people should.It's a film with no real character development a confusing plots and no conclusion. That doesn't mean the film isn't watchable  I certainly recommend it as it will give you a first hand account of a school shooting and the credits showing the names of all who died was genius to the film where it really packs the emotional punch. Don't expect a masterpiece expect a well done Indie with flaws.".

	schema:headline " Not enough depth to have a true impact.";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on his real life experience of surviving the Columbine High School Massacre writer and director Andrew Robinson comes up with a retelling titled April Showers which promises to deliver something that will make us all think. I applaud Andrew for achieving something that must have been very hard to do. To relive these terrible events in an effort to outline how some of these survivors coped and how some didn't through such a troubling time  was a courageous thing to do. with solid Cinematography and passable acting the film really should have delivered what it was striving for but unfortunately due to some real problems it falls quite hard. To start with for a film of this nature to work we really have to connect with the characters. Unfortunately the film prevents us from getting acquainted with the people involved through lack of story development. The Massacre happens in the first five minutes of the film so we are thrust into the deep end before knowing anything. So instead of the emotional strain that the viewer should be feeling we can separate ourselves from them. I compare it to hearing something on the news which takes place over the other side of the world. Yes its shocking but there isn't as much impact for us as opposed to having a relative or friend in the actual tragedy. This film didn't allow us to really care what was going on which makes the second half of the film rather boring as we try our best to connect with those grieving but just can't. My other problem is that the main focus of the film the relationship between Sean and April takes the gloss away from the only really interesting character one that is going through post traumatic stress. There is just no allowance for any chemistry between the romance of the lead two and like the majority of the film it just feels like its eating away the run time as opposed to actually building a solid platform of emotion. If the film was done in way that we have development and then the tragedy I feel it could have worked. But as a result of impatience and maybe a lack of experience the director chose a different path that ultimately hurts it and prevents it from being a memorable experience. Ordinary at best but a courageous move from the director.".

	schema:reviewBody "Involves very minor spoilers.To start off I have to say that I waited for about a year and a half for this film to be released in Australia so when I came across it accidentally at the video store I work at I almost had a heart attack. I immediately hired it. I was not disappointed.The first 3045 minutes set during the actual shooting was completely engaging and tense it was brutal and totally heartwrenching. The students actions in the school are varied there are those who act heroically and some who don't just like what I imagine it would be like in the real situation.The film slows down a bit in the second half when we follow the survivors trying to deal with their own issues and tragedies especially those of Kelly Blatz's Sean Blatz puts forward an amazing performance dealing with the death of his friend April and Daryl Sabara's Jason who tries to deal with being labeled a hero. This part of the film doesn't have as much punch and emotional impact as the first part but it deals with the characters realistically and sensitively. I do have some small issues though. Firstly April isn't given enough back story I never really felt like I knew her well enough for her death to make a huge emotional impact. It all came from Sean's reactions. Her relationship with Sean isn't developed enough either there are only two or three short scenes with them together so we never really know who she is. I also felt that there were so many others characters that needed a voice. There are some students that have beautifully tragic stories but are pulled out of the film so quickly eg. The boy who stays behind to help his teacher Sean's friend who finds a girl he knows dead or close to in the developments. I won't go into the other issues I have with it you can figure out your own but these are the main problems I found.Overall it was a gorgeous moving film that could never have been made with such meticulous attention to character and detail without a director who had actually lived the experience. Robinson knows what he is writing and he never exploits his characters or uses too many clichs. I highly recommend 'April Showers' but only if you enjoy films that have you close to tears.".

So why did it seem so unrealistic? The acting for the most part was very afterschoolTVspecial. I can only imagine that most of the teen actors were chosen for their ability to cry on command. And Tom Arnold's superb performance is not only crammed into the beginning of the movie but never thought of again shame!. In fact of the at least fifteen people killed in the massacre look at the number of crosses put up! April seems to be the only one who matters  her funeral at the end is full of clichs she lived every day to the fullest  come on now and she's really the only victim mentioned by name at all. The first halfhour of the movie is chaos. People are running everywhere and there are some gunshots but where's the shooter? Does anyone care? The dialogue is usually either so inept or so muffled and quiet that I couldn't make out why hordes of kids were running through the woods. And I find it very very hard to believe that of all the survivors in the school not one of them could identify the shooter. It all seemed like an afterthought. From what I could gather of the police investigation the cops are seen arresting a kid named Ben and asking Sean our greasy hero a few questions about him. Well  surprise surprise!  Ben's not the shooter. In fact he was with Sean during the whole ordeal! This is the problem with changing such a key fact about the case Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold took their own lives after the massacre. What do you do with a stillliving shooter whom apparently nobody has seen? Well if you're the characters in this film you sit around and mope then spraypaint KILLER on the house of some kid rumoured to have something to do with it. Again come on now. The cinematography is worth mentioning  the whole movie is filmed very artistically. I probably would've liked it more if I'd simply watched it without audio! I couldn't identify with most of the characters. Why make brooding Sean the hero if all you want to do is film him shirtless staring out a window on a rainy day? Ooh he punches a mirror. Aah he can't form a meaningful connection with a girl. Who cares? April's not much better. Ooh look at how pretty and blonde she is! Aah she even writes in a diary! Too bad she has absolutely no character traits. No positive ones no negative ones. She's just... there. Jason was interesting save for his melodramatic freakout in the grocery store and I would've liked to see more of Ben. It broke my heart at the end of the movie to see Ben packing his stuff and leaving... how do you get over being falsely branded a killer? Too bad it's all glossed over in favour of more languorous scenes of Sean moping. Everything interesting in fact is glossed over like the great performances by Tom Arnold and Ileana Douglas. I can only handle a few minutes' worth of weepy B.S.  with April Showers I got an hour and fortyfour. For crime scholars and others interested in knowing more about Columbine and the psychology of school shooters skip this one and watch a documentary or something instead I'd recommend Zero Day a mockumentary that's chilling darkly funny and ultimately heartwrenching. For young people who think their parents just don't understand what they're going through and enjoy long prettilyshot takes of shirtless guys staring off into infinity I'd say pick this one up.".

I'm 23 years of my name date. for all that said like me  I wish they would show a school shooting movie or things like this in a more realistic deeper way.i said that many times. this movie does that. and i cry on small stuff. yet even my strong willed guy cried through the whole movie. definitely the ending. if u don't care about people hurting even mentally and just want to see death find another movie. this is something much deeper and breaks it down for u day by day. its based on a real life thing.WATCH IT. see. and get back to me.";

This movie is beautifully realistic and thats what makes the movie. the movie was meant to show the after math of what happened not spend the whole movie on the shooting itself. I am just so in awe of this movie and its one of the most intense films i have seen in a long time. It's scary at the end how many school shootings there have been. I also think that people need to take this movie for what it is. its not a million dollar movie and it is an independent film. its not meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster and i love that its not. Its an independent movie made by a columbine survivor. Some of the movie is disjointed but that is overshadowed by the message of the film. Very good job.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a similar experience as reviewer ANightToRemember where I first saw this in theaters and thought it was great but after repeated viewings the film had cringiness here and there.On the upside the writing and direction are better than in most school shooting films I've seen. However this film commits many of the similar crimes that 'Elephant' does in that it takes a way too artsy approach. I don't believe that school shootings make a good subject when doing an artsy independent film regardless of who's behind it. I would've preferred this had been a bigger budget studio production though many would disagree. Andrew Robinson does a good job with this even though he offers nothing new on the subject of Columbine that we didn't know already. Tons of survivor books have been released over the decade since Columbine and various film interpretations of school shootings in general have been done. This one bears the most similarities however to the real Columbine though not of the same decade.Another thing I'm not a fan of here are the characters. The only character in the entire film I enjoyed watching was Jason. But I had a hard time getting into Sean as the main lead. For a film directed by a Columbine survivor he definitely overexaggerated in various areas or bordered on the unrealistic. I personally thought villainous portrayal of the media was a bit of an overkill. I also never believe that a teacher would butt into a student's love life the way that drama teacher does.Anyway I don't mind that the film keep its POV on the survivors but it doesn't make it better as film. Different yes but this film is easily dismissible as another standard school shooting film for the bin.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this movie at a screening at the high school where it was filmed. To be honest I expected some kind of lowbudget Sundancestyle film or worse a surface level reenactment of the Columbine tragedy with pretty faces readymade for the next High School musical television special. Well except for the fact that most of the characters are in fact gorgeous especially the April character I can now assure you that I was quite wrong.First of all April Showers is not a simple fictionalization of the Columbine tragedy some of the most famous stories have been eliminated or altered and elements of other shootings including a video by the killer that is more reminiscent of the Virginia Tech killer's manifesto than the KlyboldHarris homemade movies creep in here and there. These changes are unnerving both in the way it shakes up your expectations nobody is shot for saying yes though religion is an important theme both for good and bad as well as the way it gives the proceedings a more universal feel it helps that Columbine is not mentioned in the obligatory basedonfacts header. That said it still gives an insider's look at the very specific aftermath of Columbine as the director showed in his open answers in the QA session that followed the screening. I can only hope for a commentary track will be included when the inevitable DVDBluRay comes out.Secondly like all good art it strives to do more than simply relay facts to the audience. At its core April Showers is a tragic love storythough I hate to compare it to a monster movie it kind of reminded me of Cloverfield for some reason. I suppose in some ways the two movies have the same themeyou don't know how long you have together so make the most of itexcept that this movie actually made me believe it.If I had any concerns about the movie it would be that while the filmmakers didn't go out of their way to portray the killer as a monsterit's too easy to hate these kinds of killers as it is and the restraint is refreshing they also failed to show him as a human beingliterally. He is only portrayed in the manifesto video and through security camera footage that is horrifyingly similar to the infamous Columbine footage. I have mixed feelings about this choice. I applaud the filmmakers for not trying to force answers to the country's single numblyasked question Why? That may well be the film's greatest strength that it doesn't cater to our need to make sense of senseless acts. If nothing else comes out of seeing April Showers I hope it will help me ask the right questions if 'bullying' substitute your own wordvideo games rap music etc. alone can cause people to kill then why doesn't it happen more often?. Still never seeing the KlyboldHarris surrogate on a normal day leaves the audience only with the collective media memory of the Columbine attack to fall back on in order to fill in the gaps. I suppose I was hoping for the chance to empathize or sympathize with the killer's emotional plight if only in the same way that I would for Humbert Humbert from Lolita or Jack Nicholson's character from The Shining or even Alex from A Clockwork Orange. Or maybe I've just seen too many Kubrick films. Still despite the lengths I've gone to in trying to explain my concern it is still a minor one. Interestingly two of the survivors almost fulfilled that element for me though that may have only been because of my mistaken assumptions. Before I saw the film I had assumed that Daryl Sabara's character was the killer and in his opening scene he is being bullied something that supposedly was one of the triggers for Klybold and Harris' rampage. Another character a very close friend of the killer is arrested and for a while it's unclear whyI half expected that he was another gunman but he wasn't.My only other complaint after only seeing the movie once was that Sabara's character's story arc seemed a little obvious andor heavyhanded compared to that of the main character.All in all it was a very well made film about survivors not killers. The cinematography includes some judicious shaky camera work that leads to a rather surreallooking jerky running scenealmost like the old silent films when the frames per second wasn't standardized yet and so runs faster on modern equipment. I know that sounds like a complaint but it's not.".

The first forty minutes of the movie deal directly with the shooting while the remainder of the movie follows a select number of students trying to deal with the tragedy.This is by no means a feelgood movie. If you're depressed you shouldn't see it. It's dark realistic drama. That shouldn't be surprising since writerdirector Andrew Robinson was a survivor of the Columbine tragedy. Before the end credits they list the victims of every school shooting in the United States through December 2008. That right there kind of sums up what the movie is about. To educate inform and make sure the lesson isn't forgotten.While I liked the movie my wife said she's rate it 6 stars and her sister didn't like it. But her complaint was that there were no big names. I don't think she sees very many independent films. It will be interesting to see what other reviews say. I highly recommend the movie. It is rated R and is not a movie for preteens. My 10 yearold wants to see it when it comes out in DVD because her sister is in it but emotionally she's too young to handle it.".

It is not and nor has it ever been. Yes tragedies happen with seriously mentally ill psychos. But this is a classic example of how moronic a gun free zone is.If even some of the teachers had been armed this sort of thing could have been stopped much faster and wfar less loss of life. Same as many other incidents of this nature. No one can predict such an incident.. but we all can certainly prepare to handle such infinitely better.All of that said.. I as most others feel for the victims of such incidents. Most everyone wishes such things never happen ever. But that is simply not reality.The most poignant part of this entire effort is the list of those lost to all of us at the end. To those I would say we all should salute them for their sacrifice andor bravery. But not a tear will I ever shed for those killed that perpetrate such crimes.".

But this is a classic example of how moronic a gun free zone is.If even some of the teachers had been armed this sort of thing could have been stopped much faster and wfar less loss of life. Same as many other incidents of this nature. No one can predict such an incident.. but we all can certainly prepare to handle such infinitely better.All of that said.. I as most others feel for the victims of such incidents. Most everyone wishes such things never happen ever. But that is simply not reality.The most poignant part of this entire effort is the list of those lost to all of us at the end. To those I would say we all should salute them for their sacrifice andor bravery. But not a tear will I ever shed for those killed that perpetrate such crimes.";

	schema:reviewBody "Please do not misunderstand me. The tragedies that befell Columbine High Santana High and Millard Southwhich is a local school in my areaare some of the most terrifying histories in my lifetime. The young people that suffer trauma from these events stretch beyond their schools and communities. These school shootings marked the end of an innocence where adolescence was once associated with discover exploration and the joy of it all.A retelling of the events of a school shooting has a challenge to tell the story with purpose. What hurts this film the most is that we are told the ending in the first few minutes. I won't give away what happened not that you need my help but we already know what is going to happen. This film mopped itself into a corner because there were no surprises. The viewer would need a darn good reason to keep watching through such a depressing story. I can only assume this film follows the Tarantinoinspired trend to tell the story out of sequence. That worked for Pulp Fiction because there was more than one plot and each story were distinct. In April Showers the characters were all going in the same direction so it made little sense to tell the story out of sequence.The actors are relatively unknown but work hard and play their roles well. Tom Arnold and Ileana Douglas as superb thespians as they are did not need to carry these kids. They acted as well as they could under the circumstances.What's unfortunate is that the film was so focused on the tragedy it failed to connect us to the characters. By the end of the film I still didn't learn anything about most of the principal cast. A story's tragedy is only effective when people we know and love suffer. Even the namesake of the film April was a wooden character that showed no charisma nor personality to warrant our affectionshe was just the pretty blond girl and that's why we're supposed to care? The screenplay did little if at all to make me care about the characters.The singlemost effective subplot involves Jason a socially inept misfit whom had become traumatized by the shooting. Throughout the film we witness his trauma worsen to levels of insanity. Portrayed by Daryl Sabara we constantly wonder what the deal is with Jason up until he bears his soul in the climaxthe pivotal heartbreaking moment of the film. His development was paced well and left us wondering what would happen next. Everything Jason reacts to is for a reason and a very shocking reason at that.Without giving us time to understand the characters we were pushed right into the incident. By then it was too late for us to sympathize with the flashbacks. We watched the horror of their lives in danger and we barely had a chance to know their names. As we continue watching the second act of the film we are watching the community agonize over the incident. With most dramatic stories we are hoping for a payoff. Not all payoffs have to be happily ever after but each character's ending were almost predictable and we watch the characters suffer with absolutely no hope in sight.The biggest complaint I have is the editing. Most scenes with music are mixed so high you cannot hear the dialogue. With a story so somber the characters are required to speak softly. It's hard to make out the conversation. Sometimes I wonder if music was even necessary for some scenes. A well performed story needs no gimmicks to polish it and rather than letting it's talent shine the score distracts from the story.By the end of April Showers you are still asking the same questions. Why on Earth would someone do this? What became of these kids? What can we do to prevent this? How did it happen in the first place? It doesn't answer any single one of those questions. Perhaps there are no answers. We are left to hope and pray that there are no more tragedies like this ever again.I am only able to give this 4 stars out of sympathy. This is a subject that remains sore with the creators they wanted us to know the grief they endured. But without any payoff or closure to the story we are only given this story to relive the pain. That would be fine for a documentary. Unfortunately for the viewer we have to consider the entertainment value of a film. Works of fiction need some sort of answer as to why we sympathize with the characters unless it is a horror film. This is not a horror film and it is not a documentary so it is hard to understand why we watched. If you choose to watch April Showers know that you will be brought to a sad depressing place where you will experience the fear the chaos the heartbreak and the trauma of these students. The one thing it will not provide is a sense of relief.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this movie a very interesting and meaningful. There were not more than 100 words went on in this movie but the picture itself gave the viewer many things to think about. What Tashi really did was reversing the Buddha path. Buddha was the one normal human being before he realize the need to discover what life is all about what he discovered was suffering in living one life. He tried to find the ways to settle with all the suffering not by avoiding but realize that there are suffering and and he faced it in the noble way.Tashi however live his life in the monastery believe in something he was told to believe not something that he discovered himself. Every human has the feeling of sexual awakening at one point of time what Tashi did was that he quit the monkhood partly because the guiltiness of having such feeling but at the same time desire to discovered the reality for himself. HE entered into the life and began to discover with all the truth in the world full with desire anger jealously deception etc. but at the same time he discover love caring warmth and happiness. The decision he chose for me he was running away from suffering by going back to peace and serenity of being monastery. What he did was not totally right or totally wrong but it does suggesting something. HE is avoiding all the desire that always backfire him throughout the movie. Pema came to him and enlighten him with her thought. Enlightenment does not mean that you have to quit all the normal life and being alone in the temple to cut all the desires. Maybe what make you enlightened is the fact that you stay in life and faced the suffering in the acceptable noble ways. Maybe it is satisfy most of the need but at the same time conquer your own self.".

A young Lama Tashi after a three years three months and three days meditation secluded in a cave is returned to this monastery and ordered as a higher level monk.  However he begins to feel some sexual awareness precipitated for a brief contact with a young woman and hesitates about the life he had chosen.  Considering that Buddha began his spiritual journey at 29 Tashi is in his early twenties he leaves the monastery and starts a normal agriculture life in the rural Himalayas. He of course will discover all  the temptations deceptions and frustrations of the world he never knew.  And he will be corrupted too.This is not a commercial occidental movie  so even if the story seems predictable nothing terribly dramatic or convulsed happens. The world we are seeing is a simple one. People could cheat on each others but the value of life is high as also is the value of love and the traditions. Tashi will try to change things but he will be the one changing. If changes are for good of evil is for the viewer to decide.This is not a self discovery trip either at least for Tashi. We are the one who discover that not world is absolutely better than the other but the human being is capable of destroying everything with his own selfishness particularly the ones who loves.There is not a moralizing tale here easy answers and  judgments are avoided but one. Tashi's wife final monologue questioning the women's part in history and in the religion is as valid to Buddhism as to any other religion I know.

	schema:headline " India is not Tibet";
	schema:reviewBody "I have read all the comments on this film here and I was surprised one more time to see how differently people react to one and the same film. What struck me also was that some of the viewers clearly mistake Tibet for India because apparently they don't know that there are Buddhists in India as well.Buddhism has its origins in Hinduism itself as it is believed that Buddha is a reincarnation of lord Vishnu The Preserver one of the three main Hindu gods. But through the centuries Buddhism slowly developed as an independent religion. The film was shot in Ladakh which is in the Indian Himalayas not in Tibet and two of the characters go to the town of Leh which is the capital of Ladakh and hence it is also in India. I thought that it is important to clarify these details as I don't think that one should mistake Tibet for India. India is not just Bollywood and as a country living under the phrase unity in diversity it surely has lots of different religious communities and lots of different cultures.As for the film itself  I loved it not only because it has been so beautifully shot by the Bulgarian D.P. Rali Ralchev and not only because it meets us with a part of the world we barely know but mostly because I could identify with the characters and their desires anguish pain joy dreams. Samsara the Hindu concept of reincarnation asks some philosophic questions in a very earthly manner I think. The ideas of Buddhism the detachment from earthly life in order to reach enlightenment the conquering of ourselves our ego our earthly desires to love to have family to enjoy the simple but earthly life of a farmer to possess objects and to command love from the others are ideas or rather dilemmas that many of us face from time to time. Buddha has said that the middle way is the right way to follow but how can this way be found? Is it through experiencing the earthly life then renouncing it and then devoting oneself to the life a monk choosing the spiritual life in search of the almighty truth and the great soul? This was the way Buddha has chosen  being a prince himself having a family and then renouncing it and devoting himself to the life of a recluse but of a recluse who has reached the enlightenment and a recluse willing to share the truth with the others.Everyone chooses one's own way. Tashi is a person who asks himself questions and he's a person who searches for his own right path. To say that he is only an egoist who leaves his wife when he gets fed up the life of a family man and a farmer is quite simplistic I think. I believe he has been very honest from the beginning to the end and that is why he left the monastery at first and came back to it in the end. The important idea that I have discovered was that no matter what kind of path one will choose there will always be an anguish along the way. Maybe it is because of the eternal question unanswered  what to choose  to satisfy all desires or to conquer the one and only? No matter what we choose we will always doubt from time to time that maybe we should have chosen the opposite.What I really liked about this film also is the fact that it presented us with the female point of view in the final monologue of Tashi's wife Pema. She was given no choice from him when he decided to go back to the monastery. She had to stay behind and take care of their son. She was shown to us as the keeper of the traditions not allowing her son to play with the modern toy his father bought him from Leh but at the same time she had that free spirit to make love to the unknown Lama and afterward to even marry him. I liked the sensitivity of the writer  director who cared not only to show us the pain of Pema when realizing she's losing his husband but also to make her an intelligent woman who thinks and who turns out be as wise and devoted as her Lama husband.".

I believe he has been very honest from the beginning to the end and that is why he left the monastery at first and came back to it in the end. The important idea that I have discovered was that no matter what kind of path one will choose there will always be an anguish along the way. Maybe it is because of the eternal question unanswered  what to choose  to satisfy all desires or to conquer the one and only? No matter what we choose we will always doubt from time to time that maybe we should have chosen the opposite.What I really liked about this film also is the fact that it presented us with the female point of view in the final monologue of Tashi's wife Pema. She was given no choice from him when he decided to go back to the monastery. She had to stay behind and take care of their son. She was shown to us as the keeper of the traditions not allowing her son to play with the modern toy his father bought him from Leh but at the same time she had that free spirit to make love to the unknown Lama and afterward to even marry him. I liked the sensitivity of the writer  director who cared not only to show us the pain of Pema when realizing she's losing his husband but also to make her an intelligent woman who thinks and who turns out be as wise and devoted as her Lama husband.";

This may be disconcerting for some viewers but to me this reflective mood seemed appropriate for the subjectmatter.'Samsara' could be said to build on the groundwork provided by popular movies such as 'Seven Years in Tibet' and 'Kundun' to provide a more authentic and detailed portrayal of the vicissitudes of life and culture in central Asia.

Monk Tashi is very well portrayed as so human and fallible as he leaves the monastery to pursue sex or worldly life.  He was raised in the monastery so as his sexuality awakened he had to find out for himself.  He rationalized that even Buddha was married before he was enlightened and so Tashi felt he should be able to know this too before he devoted himself to monkhood.  Little does he know what is in store for this desire he has to experience...The tale is more of the excursion of a Monk and his experience of marriage sex and emotions that arise than of his enlightenment.  He found out what he had to know and paid the price.  The film is lush with Tibetan style dress architecture and landscapes.  The love scenes are a treat for the eyes and the lead actors are very convincing yet more subtle than raw.Check out Kundun and Razor's EdgeBill Murrayand Master of Zen as well if you are interested in drama as well as spirituality.".

The scenery buildings culture and the people were so similar to Tibet that many viewers wondered if the film was really shot in India.I watched this film in the Hong Kong International Film Festival. The film director Mr Pan Nalin and the leading actress Miss Christy Chung were present to let the spectators to ask questions or to raise some comments about this film. I thought it was a very good idea and during the QA session there were so many people asking sensible and thought provoking questions that made the whole film watching experience almost a spiritual experience.The way that the story unfolded was very well planned too. In the beginning the film posed a question How to prevent a drop of water from ever drying up?. In the end the monk faced a dilemma of whether to go back to his monastery or to go back to his wife. Either way he would have to betray the other party. Therefore he seeked an answer from this riddle. The answer was Throw the drop of water into the ocean. For me I think that this means that the monk needs to go back to the religion and leave his wife and children behind. This is because to prevent himself from being lost and confused he should go back to where he belong. Obviously this is my interpretation of the film and it may not necessarily be right.The film was entirely in Tibetan. I think this is such an achievement to make a film in Tibetan! This made the film so authentic as if it is a documentary about a monk. In addition the scenery was so beautiful in the film. I have always loved the mountain landscape and this film provided many mountains for me to admire. Another point I like about this film is that it didn't have a lot of conversation but the story and the emotion can be clearly communicated to the spectators.This film is powerful and beautiful. It is also spiritual unlike a commercial film which aims to make money. It provokes people to think and to reflect upon their own life. However if you do not like Tibet or understand about Buddhism then this film may be boring.".

I really can't say enough about this film to do it justice so at least i'd like to say great job cast crew and director of this film I really loved it. I've been to Ladakh 3 times now and have been in the backcountry where there are no roads and only little hamlets and small towns and stayed with the people just like this it is one of my favorite places on earth. Another bonus is Christy Chung and Neelesha Bovara are both gorgeous and the love making scenes were original and extremely sensual. I put this on my all time favorite list in between The Godfather and Star Wars. Although films rankings on my list may change the favorites never go away. Anyway Thank you for creating such a wonderful masterpiece.".

Finally I got to see Samsara in Canada. Woooooo!Open your heart and mind and let Samsara flood you in with positive energy. It is filmmaking at its best. I am a big cinefil for me there is absolutely no great filmmaker to come out of India after Satyajit Ray Ghatak and Guru Dutt. That was some 45 years ago. Would Pan Nalin be this international figure ? Time will tell. Many might not agree but Nalin's film falls in the categories of master directors Scorsese Coppola Mann Scott Bertolucci Bergman or even Tarkovsky.Hollywood needs directors like Nalin Anyone is listening in LA?".

	schema:reviewBody "Samsara is one of those films that helps find answers to eternal questions one has been asking unconsciously for a long time. What makes our earthly existence worthwhile? How do we achieve selfperfection and purification? Are we capable of selfdirection and selffulfillment? The camera ushers us into the unknown to the Westerner world of Buddhist monks in the astonishingly contrastive and majestic landscape of Himalayas. A procession of lamas reaches for the mountain to bring back from long meditation Tashi  a young monk who is to become a lama. Tashi is brought back to the monestery but instead of continuing his quest for Nirvana he falls victim to his sexual awakening and realizes that there are other ways to achieve enlightment. He abandons the monestery and his spiritual teacher Apo to marry the beautiful Pema whom he met during a harvest blessing. Thus Tashi enters Samsara  the world of sensual desires and neverending cycle of life and death joy and sorrow. He is now faced with a much more complex environment he seems unprepared to cope with. His wife Pema becomes his new spiritual leader into this new world of countless desires. The film is a real cinematographic masterpiece. The setting of the Buddhist temple the change of seasons and colour in the Himalayas the costumes and customs of local people create a picturesque delight to the eye. The sensual love scences and Tantric paintings add to the wholeness of the picture. If you seek refuge from the mainstream Holywood production Samsara is a must to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "We are all little drops of water and our destiny is to merge with the ocean but meanwhile... we can do a lot of things we have a material life! That sounds great! Do a lot of sins uncountable mistakes every day big ones from time to time concerning friendship choices direction choices work choices love and sex choices food choices marriage choices...Some of us just look further they are in a higher place the Himalayas. They are able to look at the planet from its highest point. Sounds like a top accomplishment in physical life takes a lot of spirit but doesn't change our fate neither our nature. As this story tells us this special situation actually brings us closer to what we really are or are willing to be defiant life children in the universe playing with gods and God sewing provocations conflicts and challenges because as carnal life we become so unstable unhappy and unquiet.This misfortune of suffering in life  the material life  turns out to be a paradox because it's also our primary source of pleasure and happiness. It's kind of a disgrace pretty much describes human adventures around here... while we quietly start missing a perfect life the eternal life that only our spirit knows. We tend to live by the instincts of the ego. It's attractive! Ego thinks as if it were the center of the universe. Physical life is all we've got so let's go and get it before someone else does! But inside we're evaluating and searching for better answers.On our most primeval basis we live on the instincts of our ego and all we want is to seek the biggest or wildest forms of Earth pleasures then we get stuck in all conflicts this attitude produces. This circle of secular life we are imprisoned in is called Samsara by the Buddhist. This life in between while we are learning the ultimate truth of life evolving from a physical to a spiritually based life. We will always have a body in this planet or in this dimension but our mind can learn through the errors of our material desires and experiences. Conflicts cannot be overcome until we make some better choices out of the problems we have. And that'd be the way the direction of our spiritual life towards Nirvana.In this movie we can see all the rebuilding of a different culture where landscape rhythms preoccupations all of them are so different from our usual life but not the essential conflicts they are all there reproduced in the ascetic and very frugal eastern life of the Himalaias. A monk practically a young Lama Tashi barely comes back from 3 years 3 days 3 months and 3 weeks of complete and almost impossible meditation locked inside a cavern and comes back to life with a very weird behavior some kind of scandal in his community because he starts to miss the most basic thing of material life he starts to desire women and to dream of them and it gets worse when he meets Pema because then a love story begins.That's a big disappointment for his masters and he is sent back to secular life for a proof of his true wishes and calls. That brings together the whole chain of conflicts we the ordinary people have. Notice that in this particular prism there are no powerful rich our famous people everyone is ordinary because they live by their ambition and greed and expectations. We have to get used to this different rhythm and language of the East the way the story has to be told the whole scenery so we can think about a possible or not possible balance in our life. Everybody has its karma so it's a different answer to each one of us.In this story we can see also other problems like male and female basic attitudes and visions basic relation problems among people families couples and lovers. The market competition the love dispute the inner doubts the reactions and answers we usually give or not. A silent battle between ego and spirit that dominates our mind all the time the choices we must make and the understanding we should learn. But this challenge of existence is given to us also through a female view the perspective of Yoshadara the wife of Sidarda the prince who became the Buddah and that comes from Pema the female character.If we cannot find the balance of our life and find our answers we will be back to try again that's Samsara if we don't reach Nirvana a beautiful movie and an a very good idea for discussion. Are we ready to go straight to the ocean? Can we reach Nirvana without doing everything we have to do in Samsara? Would life have any meaning if we didn't have our mistakes to learn from them? Should we just embrace our carnal life and bring it to all extremes forgetting all about essence spirit and evolution of our souls and hearts?".

It's always very special seeing a film knowing that the brain behind it is in the very same room...Then the film began...a beautiful shot of a bird flying over mountains. He picked up a stone and dropped it on a goat. People are crying when they find the dead animal...it's almost a hysterical reaction...but this is a world we know almost nothing off. This is not the western world. Here every life is sacred...you could have been the goat. Then the story unfolds...a buddhist monk has been meditating for three years in a cave. When he is brought back to his hometown the still very young person feels that it was a waste of time. He leaves his place to live a conventional life. For the first time he deals with love hate and materialism. Is this the life he was looking for?There is very little of dialogue...we see it all happen in this amazingly filmed landscape. I have never been so overwhelmed by natures beauty before. Shot on cinemascope and on a location in India where no one has ever filmed before this really is a jawdropping film to watch. But it is so much more then just that. The story contains some wisdoms that left a big impressionon me. The finale is absolutely brilliant...you can't get it out of your head for days after you saw it.Thank you Mr. Talin for this beautiful rich film. I hope a lot of other people will love it as much as I do.".

It's not about emotions it's not about the scandals and certainly not the sex scenes either. It's all about life from a monk's view and this show pulls it off well. Some parts get a bit slow but if you enjoy majestic splendour in the vastness of the mountainous regions of the Himalayas this is one show you will enjoy. A little knowledge about the life of a Buddhist monk will help but it's not necessary. It may launch you to read all about it. Samsara is not just worth watching it's just worth buying and leaving it on your video collection shelf for it talks about our inner selves and attempts an answer at it. Leave your ego and personal philosophy about life outside your body when you hit that Play button on the videotape or DVD.".

What is the real civilization the tribal one or the one our progressive society has been carrying from the very day of urbanization? Although these are not the questions we often dwell ourselves into but that's what great film makers like Satyajit Ray stroke at in subtle films like this one.What happens if any stranger becomes a part of your regular life for whom you carry a suspension of disbelief? Some times we come to know that stranger in the most intimate moment of one's life. If one thinks too deeply this film also questions the very human notion of knowing or unknowing which always remains limited and relative in every individual case. In the name of civilization and sophisticated comfort sometimes we forget to be human in its true sense and this film by Ray is just showing the reflection image with mild and touchy story to nourish in your film watching experience.An unexpected and rather unwanted stranger visits the upper middle class Bengali family claiming to be the woman's long lost uncle back to Kolkota after 35 years of his roaming the world. The initial suspicion with which they greet the man slowly dissolves as he starts telling them the stories of his travels tales which are at odds to conventional middle class perspective of Bengali family. The suspicious husband arranged an intelligent trap to nab him. The story takes an interesting turn as it progress further.Utpal Dutt is perfect casting choice of Ray for playing 'To be or not to be uncle' who represents suave intelligent and rational free thinker. However Dutt looks too old compared to his early films he carried the lead role with his magnetic personality and well presence of character. The film also has some staunch Bengali art house actors like Dhritiman Chattejee Mamata Shankar and Deepankar De.Ray seems so relevant even today. Yes you were right sir we are still 'Kupmonduk' but we strive not to be one. Highly Recommended for all those who loves to watch meaningful cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Satyajit Ray died in 1992 at the age of 72. This movie is his last. The movies of his youth are simple and lyrical with melodies of leashed emotion. His latter work tends towards more complex themes murals in which he wants to express the complex workings of society or address the human condition in it's entirety. To what extent he succeeds may be questioned but they represent ambitious projects. He once remarked that unlike his western counterparts he matured early in his career.His stream of innovation and creativity never flattened out and he continued to evolve till the very end springing fresh surprises with every new film.Ray's identification and admiration is clearly more for his women characters. His women are brilliant beautiful intelligent compassionate and humane and the men dunderheads more often than not. The male characters often seem to be supporting roles. It is arguable that the credit for most ills of the world goes more to the male animal. They are certainly more violent and have been proved to be no cleverer.Anila the wife of an executive and mother of a growing boy receives a letter from a person purporting to be her maternal uncleone who had left the family thirty five years ago when she was two months old and was never heard of again. The uncle is in town and wants to spend a week with his niece if they are willing to entertain him. The question is is this person who he claims to be and even if he is what are his intentions in barging in out of nowhere? Anila is keen to have him over doubts notwithstanding but her husband is disinclined to entertain a probable fraud. Anila has her way and Uncle Manmohan or a person who claims to be him brilliantly portrayed by Utpal Dutt is in.There is a slow and delightful unpeeling of the persona of the Uncle who seems to have traveled to strange places all over the world and the quest to establish his identity and intentions takes us through many a comical and poignant twist and turn. In the process Ray treats us to a kind of Socratic symposium and addresses through dialog music and dance the nature of life art religion and society. What prompted Uncle to leave home he says was the painting a bison in the prehistoric caves of Altamira in Spain. Which art school can teach that? So he became an anthropologist. He has poured out his own heart and mind through the enigmatic uncle. Anila superbly played by Mamata Shankar acts as a shimmering mirror to Ray's emotion. Ray was old though not really sick when he made this movie. Perhaps he had premonitions of the end and the film has an air of a quick winding up of things.At a certain stage of life one's feelings take a backseat behind our analytic side. However even in this possibly the most intellectual of his films Ray's language is of the heart and his capacity for love and awed wonderment is very much in evidence. The tribal dance which concludes the film is a wrenching paean to life. I am inclined to take this sequence as his artistic adieu.".

We love to spin the spotlight onto their weak points and deny them their multiple strengths. S. Ray in The Stranger takes just the reverse stance. His Uncle Mitre can be said to belong to all the above identities and yet bears in the end none of the hostility and distrust directed at them. That he possesses independence unusual intelligence and talent commitment to his own ideas and drive is only one reason for this. More importantly he has S. Ray India's best director and one of world's most acclaimed directors on his side.

	onyx:emotionText "Ours is a culture that heaps scorn on the nonconformist. Atheists are cold and too intellectual leftists are humorless and sectarian Luddites are antiprogress and clueless the erudite philosopher is selfindulgent and all hot air ideas the social critic is superior and nasty the truthful is stuffy and strained and the feminist is moralistic and manhating. We love to spin the spotlight onto their weak points and deny them their multiple strengths. S. Ray in The Stranger takes just the reverse stance. His Uncle Mitre can be said to belong to all the above identities and yet bears in the end none of the hostility and distrust directed at them. That he possesses independence unusual intelligence and talent commitment to his own ideas and drive is only one reason for this. More importantly he has S. Ray India's best director and one of world's most acclaimed directors on his side.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Ray's best movies and has never been more relevant. In the opening scene Anila Bose opens a letter written in fine traditional Bengali from an uncle she hasn't seen since she was two. Her son is excited. Her husband is sceptical. The supposed uncle arrives and they spend two days trying to understand this mysterious stranger who claims to be their family.I found the movie deeply touching. Its great strength lies in the relationship between Anila perfectly played by Mamata Shankar and the enigmatic Manomohan played by the utterly convincing Utpal Datt. The action unfolds in the Bose's home. Guests come and go. Anila and her husband Sudhin speculate about the stranger in bed. Manomohan bewitches young Satyaki and his friends with tales of his travels in the distant parts of the world.The story is simple but it evokes deep feelings and provokes deep thoughts on issues that have never been more pressing faith identity ideals the sense of home. Ray's tact is immaculate as is his sense of rhythm. It is difficult for an amateur like me to describe his method which is unobtrusive. He takes us into the little home of the Boses unpeels their skin and lets us see the poor reasonable animal as naked as ever nature made him. It is a deeply human vision but it builds into a powerful allegory of the power of art and of hope to make our world into a home.And here's the spoiler. I couldn't help it sorry!This was Ray's last film and this knowledge makes its final scene heartbreaking. When Manomohan the allembracing intellect leaves the Boses young Satyaki asks will he ever return? Monomohan tells Satyaki it will be his turn to visit next otherwise what are promises?

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a cinephilia since 2003. I've watched so many movies of great many filmmakers but in spite of Ray's name coming up in many occasions i never really felt like watching his films must be due to my preconceived notions about how his films could be. On one fine day when i was reading about great filmmakers individually in wiki i came across Ray and thought to at least get familiar with his life and work. I must say i was pretty excited. So i've begun downloading his entire filmography one by one with so much difficulty. I once watched Woody Allen's films chronologically from his first film till Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Since i planned to watch all of Ray's films i thought let me try reverse this time so i watched Agantuk. I was lucky to obtain a bluray copy of this film bec it really created a lasting impression of not only about this movie but on a legendary filmmaker like Satyajit Ray itself. After 11yrs of serious film watching here i'm in 2014 discovering yet another great filmmakermy journey with Ray has begun.First of all i'm assuming that those who watched this movie or collected it to watch are serious movie watching audiences. From that point of view this is a delight for intellectual audiences. Intellectuality doesn't come from the plot of this movie on the contrary plot here is very plain and simple but the subject matter of the conversations bet characters are pretty serious. The uncle character is the one representing the wise person who traveled the world filled with experiences gained lots of wisdom. The couple represents the normal people. Even though the plot imitates 'Shadow Of A Doubt' like an uncle coming and the family not being sure whether he's the person and all that stuff.. i haven't watched shadow of a doubt though the theme and the content of the movie is an attempt to insight us.After watching Agantuk i was overwhelmed with this filmmaker's capacity to give shape form to content. His storytelling style was awesome. The first shot of the movie itself is a 'Right On' into the movie. Lead actors their performances their clothes the way they moved the house and its designing the sound of the bengali language little details here and there on people's behaviorattitudes etc. was a delight to watch. This is Ray's last movie if he's on this level in his last work i cannot imagine how his other works are especially early works like Apu Trilogy The Music Room and all.Agantuk is an awesome movie even individually and as well as collectively as Ray's filmography.P.S. By the time i'm writing this review i've already watched 20 films of Satyajit Ray and i'm still excited about this artist like i've been after watching Agantuk 1991.Don't miss this movie and if you got excited like me please spread the word so that many would get the opportunity to enjoy such rich content in a simply budgeted movie. I'm still in wonder that such a subject is even dealt in Indian cinema. Glories to Satyajit Ray.".

Having said that I must admit that this movie cannot be placed in the same league of Charulata or Aparajito.In spite of being witty the dialogues are verbose at times. The characterisation of the main protagonistManomohan Mitra looks forced in few occasions. In the character of Prithwish Sen Gupta one finds a very cliched villain which is quite uncharacteristic of Ray. I need not mention that the words uttered by Manomohan Mitra are nothing but Ray's own commentary of modern contemporary society. They are rich in value and devoid of hypocrisy.Probably it would have been lot nicer if the commentary would have unfolded in terms of the narration of the story rather being put in the dialogue directly which gives it a theatrical quality instead of adding cinematic value. However the conflict of the characterstheir apprehensions and predicaments are portrayed very beautifully.This movie is gifted with excellent performances from all the actors. Undoubtedly it will be a treat to Ray's ardent fans.".

The stranger of the title is a man who arrives at the home of a welltodo Calcutta family claiming to be the wife's longlost uncle. It's an intriguing premise but Ray who also wrote the film and composed the score doesn't really develop it. There is no real suspense in the picture which is mostly played for light satirical comedy though it isn't really that funny either. As the uncle Utpal Dutt coasts through the film it's an easy performance Ray has given him all the best lines but there's a lovely performance from Mamata Shankar as the young wife and niece and by far the best scene in the film is when she plays the tamboura and sings a song and there's a beautiful child Bikram Bhattacharya who seems genuinely enchanted to see the stranger. Shot in colour by Barun Raha it seems to be striving for a profundity that simply isn't there but it's also a hard film to dislike and there's a great dance near the very end.".

Once the main plot device became clear Who is this man? Is he real or fake? Why did he come here? I found my interest fell off very quickly. I just didn't care much about who he was and what his purposes were. So as the little vignettes piled up one on the other I became more and more restless finally giving up altogether. Too much seemed mundane like filler. Why for example did we have to sit through his explaining to kids using coins on a sheet of paper how near objects in the sky like the moon appear as large as or larger than distant objects like the sun all done in yawning detail? The kids seemed to know it anywaythey knew all about the causes of eclipses. Was this supposed to awaken a sense of wonder in the kids or in us? It didn't. Then the great man finishes with a ridiculous pseudoprofound statement that no one knows why distant objects appear smaller than near ones and that this is the greatest mystery of the universe. Sure guy whatever you say. This movie is a masterpiece? A work of genius? Down here on planet Earth we reserve terms like that for much better films than this one. Perhaps if you have enough patience to sit out the succession of little scenes you might find yourself rewarded in some way along the lines of what the other reviewers are saying hereI hope sobut take note that it will require your patiencemore than I have. No this is far from the work of a genius.".

Sure guy whatever you say. This movie is a masterpiece? A work of genius? Down here on planet Earth we reserve terms like that for much better films than this one. Perhaps if you have enough patience to sit out the succession of little scenes you might find yourself rewarded in some way along the lines of what the other reviewers are saying hereI hope sobut take note that it will require your patiencemore than I have. No this is far from the work of a genius.";

But these almost 100 minutes are not a propaganda film. On the contrary there are some elements in here that are pretty creative and ahead of its time. For example we find the core plot even out right at the beginning. A woman commits suicide and we find out together with her husband during the film why things turned out this way. Shocking events happen on the way also for the husband. Several of the actors here were really prolific and successful back in the day in the first half of the 20th century and this also includes Ferdinand Marian in one of his more harmless performances. Overall I think there is some decent ambition and promising material in here overall but I still must say that I could not care for the characters or the film itself during the entire runtime. There was definitely potential for more and for a better film in general. I am not impressed and must say the bad outweighs the good. Not recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "What's with the recent spate of British urban thriller movies set in and around abandoned inner city tower blocks? In 2012 we've had CITADEL TOWER BLOCK ATTACK THE BLOCK and now COMEDOWN.COMEDOWN is the least creatively accomplished or inventive of the trend so far. It relies on the slasher movie staple of wayward teens targeted by a serial killing maniac. They have to fight for their lives and you just know that for most of them it's a losing battle.Audience sympathy is not enhanced by the fact that the teens in question are portrayed as a barely literate group of alcoholswigging drug taking hooligans with low IQs criminal tendencies and repugnant personalities. Their nemesis is equally as unattractive subhuman and just as unsympathetic so there's really no one to root for. Rather than hoping for anyone to survive or prevail I found myself wishing for them to hurry up and get killed so that the film could move more quickly towards its foregone conclusion.If someone has a mind to make this sort of movie at least have the sense and common decency to attempt some level of character development and provide the audience with some individuals they have a chance of identifying with or emotionally investing in. I can't imagine even the most depraved braindead inner city delinquent hoodie scumbag finding anyone in this film in the least way appealing. What chance then have the rest of us got? It looks cheap  probably because it is  but the tower block itself is well rendered in all its decaying grotesqueness and some of the death scenes rise just slightly above the mundane whilst still remaining largely uninspired.Finally COMEDOWN is probably an apt title. The film feels just like one.".

They have to fight for their lives and you just know that for most of them it's a losing battle.Audience sympathy is not enhanced by the fact that the teens in question are portrayed as a barely literate group of alcoholswigging drug taking hooligans with low IQs criminal tendencies and repugnant personalities. Their nemesis is equally as unattractive subhuman and just as unsympathetic so there's really no one to root for. Rather than hoping for anyone to survive or prevail I found myself wishing for them to hurry up and get killed so that the film could move more quickly towards its foregone conclusion.If someone has a mind to make this sort of movie at least have the sense and common decency to attempt some level of character development and provide the audience with some individuals they have a chance of identifying with or emotionally investing in. I can't imagine even the most depraved braindead inner city delinquent hoodie scumbag finding anyone in this film in the least way appealing. What chance then have the rest of us got? It looks cheap  probably because it is  but the tower block itself is well rendered in all its decaying grotesqueness and some of the death scenes rise just slightly above the mundane whilst still remaining largely uninspired.Finally COMEDOWN is probably an apt title. The film feels just like one.";

When you're watching a horror film and the most likable character is the villain that must be seen as a fundamental failure".

The plot is realistic the characters are very believable even the slasher and the setting is absolutely appropriate.

ALMOST everything ties together seamlessly with only one or two loose threads making me slap my head and say Why? Even when the killing starts the characters make practical decisions like Everyone stays together and If we don't get someone out of the building to find help we're all screwed. I like to see these sorts of things in horror films because this is how people would react in real life.Unfortunately after about half the film things change somewhat. The originality wears off and is replaced by the usual timeless horror movie clichs. For instance one character runs away from the others for no good reason what happened to sticking together? the deaths occur in a predictable fashion purely by order of character importance. You can literally point to who dies next. The atmosphere throughout the film is dark and brooding even when the actors are having a party badly done computer effects when a few fake blood packets would have served better and would've been cheaper and lastly the ending is really just nothing new and has been done before in several other movies.Still it was well done overall.

Having Geoff Bell in the movie as the bad guy and keeping him hooded up for 90 percent of the movie barely speaking a line of dialogue is a sin on its own if you've seen Geoff Bell in 'The Business' than I'm sure you know what he's capable of unfortunately in this film it's asif he doesn't even exist.Man what more is there to say Imagine a scene where the elevator door opens and theres the bad guy standing at the end of the hall way drapped in darkness running towards the lift at full speed as the kids are desperately hammering at the buttons trying to get the doors to close that's horror there was nothing of the sort in this movie.Also where was the comedy too?

	schema:reviewBody "COMEDOWN is a low rent British horror film set entirely within the confines of a deserted tower block. The gritty realism and the setting made me hope for something along the lines of TOWER BLOCK or ATTACK THE BLOCK but unfortunately this is nothing like those two great movies. Instead it's a cheap slasher almost entirely devoid of imagination.Headlining the cast is Jacob Anderson best known to audiences for his role as Grey Worm in GAME OF THRONES.

The gritty realism and the setting made me hope for something along the lines of TOWER BLOCK or ATTACK THE BLOCK but unfortunately this is nothing like those two great movies. Instead it's a cheap slasher almost entirely devoid of imagination.Headlining the cast is Jacob Anderson best known to audiences for his role as Grey Worm in GAME OF THRONES.

The atmosphere created by the direction and cast is really powerful and keeps you engaged thinking what is going to happen next... I would recommend seeing this film with a group of friends when you are in the mood for some serious horror action.

However there's the obligatory psycho happens to already be living there. And unsurprisingly he doesn't take too kindly to their intrusion. What follows is the typical 'hunt 'em and kill 'em' scenario.Although the killer looks like he's already starred in I Know What You Did Last Summer he's played by Geoff Bell an actor who always puts in a good performance even if he does only just squeak in this case!. The rest of the cast are basically 'killerfodder.' You won't find yourself shedding too many tears when they start getting hacked to death. One girl is pregnant and her boyfriend is a reformed convict so I think we're supposed to root for them. Jessica Barden who plays a particularly 'chavvy' young lady actually puts in a pretty good performance.There's nothing new here and what little budget the film had seems to have been wasted on using computers to add extra blood in. Personally I'd rather they'd have simply squirted a couple of bottles of tomato ketchup here and there as the computer effects look a little bit too fake.Like I say nothing too new here but strangely watchable and quite good fun in its genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film's storyline in a nutshell is A serial killer hunts down released convicts who did time for pedophilia related charges. Two police officers Akrep Celal and Commissioner Abbas are out to get Istanbul's first serial killer whom all the visible traces suggest to be Ensar a young man who just returned from his army service and has lost a sibling to pedophilia! First of all lest just mention the ONLY positive thing about his film the CAST! Director and actor Ugur Yucel manages to use his persona and connections very well to bring together gorgeous Kenan Imirzalioglu and psychotic looking madacting Nejat Isler in the same movie! This is the equivalent of having Brad Pitt and Christian Bale in the same picture with Robert De Niro as the director and mentor. Good no? Well not really! Not when the rest of the cast is composed of FLESH and not actors. Berrak Tuzunatac a beautiful face placed on a big and curvy body and Ceyda Duvenci looks that loose meaning after staring for 5 seconds as well as all other coactors make this whatcouldhavebeen a well ensemble cast look like they were put together not to make a good movie but to make few bucks of the talent and name of some and the body and sexuality of others! I am afraid this is the case with Dragon Cage! Now to the constructive criticism as to the very nischnischs of this movie. If Ugur Yucel is to look back to the failure of this movie in a few weeks and fail this movie will at the box office and ask why he should be told It's the script you stupid! Ugur Yucel might be one of the best actors of Turkish cinema and definitely a GREAT director based on his first two movies. Looking at these facts one would assume he would know what a bad script is when he reads it. Seems not! The script for Ejder Kapani is not only a bad montage made from similar famous movies seven crimson rivers... but it lacks any local taste it could have inserted and gave a taste of originality with! The storyline is obvious and it gives itself away from minute 10 and the dialogs oh the dialogs! Could they have been more obvious?! As a good director based on his previous two films Mr Yucel does a less than OK job directing here. The films editing and pace never match mood building scenes of walking and chasing are the SAME all across the film the city is meant to be turned into a labyrinth through camera angles and dark choice of film footage however it lacks the again locality of Istanbul and all the 'fear' and 'expectations' are pushed on the audience by simply making the screen darker and the music heavier! And the music! Oh lord when will my people learn to not do what Hollywood stopped doing 30 years ago? Mood pushing music? Really! The worst part of Mr Yucel's directing though is closely associated with the film's greatest strenght the cast! Main characters over act too much! Which brilliant mind thought that casting Kenan Imirzalioglu as an angry police officer and Nejat Isler as a psychotic looking type is a good idea hasn't both been done many a times before?! Why do they allow to be typecasted is another question and worry I have!The movie fell very short of what I was expecting and it was the one movie I have been looking forward to the most in Turkey this year! Avoid it!".

	schema:headline " The sum of what to avoid in making a serialkiller movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Well first of all the premise of Ejder Kapani which indicated a vigilantetype serial killer being loose on the streets of Istanbul seemed interesting enough taking into consideration the lack of the same genre movies being made in Turkish cinema. And although the direction music and performances from the cast are decent enough it is the story itself that moves on the fringes of utter stupidity. Sexual offenders who have been pardoned by the government are being killed one by one and it takes like more than 10 corpses for our detectives to realize what the hell is going on. OK I get the notion that Turkish lawenforcement may not be as familiar as their US counterparts with the concept of a serial killer but still we never even get a guess from any of the officers that they may be facing a different kind of criminal. Ugur Yucel is the best thing about the movie his portrayal of a tired experienced detective who reluctantly pursues his last case before retirement is very strong. His performance alone not the dynamics of the story prevents his character to be a stereotype. Kenan Imirzalioglu is also good in his role as well as is Sirri Sureyya Onder who makes out the most of his limited screen time but the rest of the cast are given little to do. And this is indeed the main problem of the story itself there are very few characters. This is a big nono especially in such a who did it movie. You understand who the killer is after 10 min or something in the movie mainly because there is no alternative presented by the plot. No red herrings of any kind. And because of that the director does what he has to do refrain from giving any hints throughout the entire story just to reveal the identity of the killer rather conveniently at the end. In my opinion this is nothing but lazy writing. The cinematography is not bad with some interesting lightning however the backdrops of the city of Istanbul is presented pretty awkwardly. We see the Galata Bridge like 6 times during the movie which gives the impression that all roads in Istanbul somehow leads to the Galata Bridge. Even the final scene takes place there but the question remains Why? And dot get me even started on what is the biggest let down of Ejder Kapani A total disregard for the not so small details. Only one example will suffice We see the serial killer a lot of times during the movie. He always wears a mask however there are several scenes where his height is obvious to the eye by comparison with the characters he interacts. like the scene where he is pursued by Ugur Yucel He seems short let alone middlesized. But the final revelation makes you think that the killer was a real master of disguise shrinking his height like 30cm when he is on his killing spree. An unacceptable error on the part of the filmmakers which treats the viewer as plain stupid.Another problem was with the sound especially with the volume of dialogues. I had so much difficulty in understanding most of the dialogues after some point I had to turn on the subtitles. To sum up Ejder Kapani is a decent effort although it lacks a coherent storyline and suffers from a lowtempo. The direction is not groundbreaking although it cant be critized much either. Only the performances of Ugur Yucel  Kenan Imirzalioglu  Onder save the movie from being a total Hollywood knockoff. All three of them succeed in staying Turkish while playing characters who we have seen for so many times in American movies. I believe that deserves nothing but praise.".

There are several other characters all of them pulling in different directions. Each of the  characters would deserve his or her movie.This film has a number of serious flaws. Firstly the duration  two hours  is too long for following the main thread of the inconclusive comedy plot. Secondly It is miscast. Massironi Ines the psychologist  a great interpretation is a wonderful comedienne with multifaceted charisma who would have given extra depth to the protagonist Agata. Instead this is played with insufficient conviction by Maglietta whom I see far better cast as Ines definitely too plain overage and overweight for the character who still walks around flimsily dressed carelessly displaying her flabbiness. Is this really sexy?. Battiston Romeo travelling salesman in the rag trade puts in an even more brilliant performance than in Bread and Tulips he is unfortunately  and literally  sacrificed by a sloppy and shallow script. Solfrizzi Gustavo Agata's brother is at best expressionless and his lines clich. Santamaria who plays the young lover Nico is almost laughable with his stereotyped overacting.

Where's the spark? Two very pleasant discoveries are Volodi playing Maria Libera Agata's colleague a very promising character actress reminiscent of Milena Vukotic at her best and Lappo Daria Romeo's handicapped wife funny and sweet who may be following into the late Giulietta Masina's steps.I somehow miss the Silvio Soldini of Bread and Tulips and hope to see him back in full colours in the future.

This revelation cause him to make a big turn in his life get to know his new relatives while dealing with the relatives he thought were his. This all leads to one big family that is far from normal so to speak. Agata is his sister a single woman who runs a book store and has a much younger guy who says he's in love with her.

	schema:headline " This feelgood film made me really mad";
	schema:reviewBody "If this were the work of some unknown director it would have deserved my five or even six stars  meaning this is not a really good film underwritten and overly long it contains even some elements of kitsch but also has some good views some decent acting and has its funny and even heartwarming moments. Not worth a purchase or rent but well visible once if you can catch it on TV. But this was made by Silvio Soldini and he had access the a decent budget a good photographer and the talents of L. Maglietta G. Battiston and some similarly gifted actors for the smaller roles. It is really sad almost revolting to see how he did not make good use of all this!I recommend that you read the review by opossumd from Italy here as he very well summarized the weaknesses of the casting as well as the fewer pleasant surprises Daria and Maria Libera. It is really embarrassing to see all the unbelievable staggering of Gustavo as the actor is not good enough to compensate for the sloppy writing. Unlike Battiston who does that successfully most of the time. Gustavo is rather quick to give up the memory of the foster father who helped him to become a successful architect and embrace his worthless biological father but we never get to know why. I kid you not this motif is more chiseled in Kung Fu Panda 2! And his love affair is so unfounded and without chemistry I could not believe that for a moment although I tried hard as I'm a real sucker for love at first sight. This makes Major Kierkegaard one of the most superfluous and kitschy characters  the other being the old Chinese naturopath. It is rather clichd to have one in a movie but certainly it can be used well think of Woody Allen's Alice. But this one is introduced gives some pieces of ineffective advice then he's simply forgotten at some point.And there is one point after Agatha's confession to the wrong man and her consequent destruction of the electrical systems of both the car and the highway lighting two rather good scenes when it seems the dog ate the remaining parts of the script and the director also abandoned the project telling the actors to carry on what they did before. From that on Agatha only shows very outofplace signs of happiness even at a funeral and the whole film falls apart.Soldini is usually well aware of the fact that money doesn't grow on trees and even welltodo people have financial problems sometimes. This is not important but can be felt in Bread and Tulips a very important motif in both Come Undone and Days and Clouds. But in this one Gustavo abandons his architect practice Agatha the bookshop and Romeo's fashion business has always been a oneman show. But in the end the trout farm is still being built and the family still can afford to spend an awful lot on medical treatment. Good for them but frankly I prefer to be taken seriously as a viewer.I do not agree fully with opossumd on one important point he thinks Licia Maglietta was erroneously cast too plain overage and overweight for the character. I'm convinced she could have done it very well just not with this script and partner. Imagine Nico being not older than 17 certainly not married with an unloving mother reading a lot and shy with girls of his age and suddenly a lot of things would be in place his attraction to a motherly figure his strange style of courtship and also Agatha's unnaturally strong reactions to a temptation that would be much more scandalous than simple adultery! Needless to say making THAT film would have required a lot of courage. . .".

	onyx:emotionText "If this were the work of some unknown director it would have deserved my five or even six stars  meaning this is not a really good film underwritten and overly long it contains even some elements of kitsch but also has some good views some decent acting and has its funny and even heartwarming moments. Not worth a purchase or rent but well visible once if you can catch it on TV. But this was made by Silvio Soldini and he had access the a decent budget a good photographer and the talents of L. Maglietta G. Battiston and some similarly gifted actors for the smaller roles. It is really sad almost revolting to see how he did not make good use of all this!I recommend that you read the review by opossumd from Italy here as he very well summarized the weaknesses of the casting as well as the fewer pleasant surprises Daria and Maria Libera. It is really embarrassing to see all the unbelievable staggering of Gustavo as the actor is not good enough to compensate for the sloppy writing. Unlike Battiston who does that successfully most of the time. Gustavo is rather quick to give up the memory of the foster father who helped him to become a successful architect and embrace his worthless biological father but we never get to know why. I kid you not this motif is more chiseled in Kung Fu Panda 2! And his love affair is so unfounded and without chemistry I could not believe that for a moment although I tried hard as I'm a real sucker for love at first sight. This makes Major Kierkegaard one of the most superfluous and kitschy characters  the other being the old Chinese naturopath. It is rather clichd to have one in a movie but certainly it can be used well think of Woody Allen's Alice. But this one is introduced gives some pieces of ineffective advice then he's simply forgotten at some point.And there is one point after Agatha's confession to the wrong man and her consequent destruction of the electrical systems of both the car and the highway lighting two rather good scenes when it seems the dog ate the remaining parts of the script and the director also abandoned the project telling the actors to carry on what they did before. From that on Agatha only shows very outofplace signs of happiness even at a funeral and the whole film falls apart.Soldini is usually well aware of the fact that money doesn't grow on trees and even welltodo people have financial problems sometimes. This is not important but can be felt in Bread and Tulips a very important motif in both Come Undone and Days and Clouds. But in this one Gustavo abandons his architect practice Agatha the bookshop and Romeo's fashion business has always been a oneman show. But in the end the trout farm is still being built and the family still can afford to spend an awful lot on medical treatment.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011 in the same week that I saw 5050 Levine 2011 with a similar theme. Both portrayed how relatives and friends try to cope with the announcement of an immanent death after a tumor diagnosis. It is particularly interesting to see how some evade the issue and others rise to the challenge. For most people it is already difficult enough to properly behave after someone has died even knowing we have established rituals for that. Being diagnosed with cancer is different in many ways and we have no recipes ready.Both films succeed very well in showing how friends and relatives initially react and how good or bad they find their way later on in dealing with the issues at hand. In many other respects the two films are very different. The chances for survival for example are 5050 within the film of that name contrary to the brain tumor diagnosed in Stopped On Track being not curable in any way. The latter is the prime reason that humor is as good as absent in that film while it is a prominent feature of 5050 regardless of the fact that the spine tumor in 5050 may prove just as fatal.The brain tumor is impossible to operate and chemo nor radiation therapy seem to offer any relief. Telling everyone around what is going on cannot be postponed very long. It will become apparent in a few months time anyway. But is it wise to tell the whole ugly truth to the daughter 12 years old and son 8 years?? And how will the grandparents deal with the bad news??From very close nearby we observe all subsequent phases leading to the inevitable death sudden headaches memory loss problems with daily tasks and more such side effects of deterioration. The constant daily burden works out very differently on the family members. The wife admits aloud that there are moments that she cannot take it anymore and that she is happy when she can escape to her work. The daughter creates distance and is often away. We see similar differences in approach with others. That the good moments decrease and the bad moments increase obviously causes all sorts of cracks in mutual relationships.We see the months pass by. Visiting friends and relatives try to communicate with him mostly with unexpected results when ancient memories hijack the dialog. We see him become weaker and weaker mostly because of steadily rising doses of morphine he gets. A benefit of the sedation is that the home situation becomes gradually more quiet. In the meantime all get used to the idea that the end is near.The finale of this film is predictable given what the doctor said at the beginning this cannot be construed as a spoiler. The important message lies in what happened in between how everyone was able or not to deal with the situation. It lets us ponder how we would behave ourselves when this happened in our own lives. Maybe the film prepares us for it and makes us a better patient friend or family member.All in all I'm very satisfied with the film the main actors and the ingredients for the story. You cannot help getting involved in how these people react and their problems in doing their best but not always succeed in that. I gave it 5 stars out of 5 for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.".

Outsiders to the nuclear family remain uncomfortable with the thought of death throughout. Amazingly that happens even to the close ones.

It is likely intentional from the director as for a teenager the thought of someone's death might feel distant. However if it were one's own father I would imagine that the response would not necessarily be like the one pictured in the film especially that the family seems like perfectly average.The film is probably a great chance for going through one's feelings for anyone who has experienced a cancer death of a close person. For others it surely is a chance to stop for 110 minutes to think what it would mean for oneself if something tragic suddenly happened in one's own life.As a nonGerman viewer it is refreshing for a change to see good moviemaking from Germany motivated by something else than the currently hot multikulti topic. and something that made me feel great at the end regardless of the theme was the soundtrack  German rock when played at the right place at the right time is just awesome!".

For when you've been in the situation the film describes you'll go through the exact motions you may have felt when taking care of a loved one who dies. Other than just about any other film I've seen on the subject no sappy music sets in no brilliant actors use their characters to showcase their abilities. It's just the story of an ordinary worker with a wife and two kids who gets diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor and chronicles his last months with a camcorder.Directorwriter Andreas Dresen is a seasoned TV director and documentary film maker which defines his visual style. But unlike most German directors he's making the best out of his possibilities by sticking to a very naturalist miseenscne focusing on creating 'special moments' which drive the story. That allows him to take the spectator's attention away from the actors. It's a style that already worked very well in 'Cloud 9' for which he received the Cannes a special Cannes 'Un Certain Regard' public prize before winning the award itself with this film. He is however essentially a documentary film maker so his best film so far is most definitely 'Herr Wichmann von der CDU' 2003 which is about a provincial election campaign.Still 'Stopped on Track' will probably stay with you longer than most films of the past year as it's dealing with a reality that concerns everybody but is usually considered taboo in film. While people die so often violently on screen it's quite a shock to see someone die from a disease even if it's just fictitious so the importance of this film is to make us wonder which is the appropriate way to deal with death a question to which it gives mature and even beautiful answers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most films about people undergoing a slow death have an inevitable sentimentality about them. It's a feeling I resist and then fall for  like eating too much chocolate. Not so Stopped on Track a new German film. It's about a man Frank who is diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour. It's gruelling and true. It combines all the wretchedness tedium and sadness that accompanies a slow death. And I think the audience feels these three qualities in equal measure with a couple of light moments thrown in. It is about a journey  the most universal of journeys and one that we often resist seeing up close and slow. Very powerful. Great acting. I did not feel emotionally manipulated just very sad. And a bit bored at times  which felt appropriate.I felt there was some irony at the expense of the health profession. Their capacity to do anything in the face of his dying and the terrible burden this placed on his family seemed limited in the extreme and their words felt kind but hollow. I doubt that this was the intention of the director Andreas Dresen who also made Cloud Nine  a film I really liked at MIFF a couple of years ago. In this film he used a mix of professional actors and these reallife health professionals and much of the dialogue was improvised as the filming took place.One aspect that I liked was that Frank used a mobile phone to records short bursts about himself and to capture his family reacting to him. This mini film within a film not only gave us insights into how he was feeling but mimicked for me the fragments of memory that you retain of someone who has died. This is an intimate and authentic film.".

It is about a journey  the most universal of journeys and one that we often resist seeing up close and slow. Very powerful. Great acting. I did not feel emotionally manipulated just very sad. And a bit bored at times  which felt appropriate.I felt there was some irony at the expense of the health profession. Their capacity to do anything in the face of his dying and the terrible burden this placed on his family seemed limited in the extreme and their words felt kind but hollow. I doubt that this was the intention of the director Andreas Dresen who also made Cloud Nine  a film I really liked at MIFF a couple of years ago. In this film he used a mix of professional actors and these reallife health professionals and much of the dialogue was improvised as the filming took place.One aspect that I liked was that Frank used a mobile phone to records short bursts about himself and to capture his family reacting to him. This mini film within a film not only gave us insights into how he was feeling but mimicked for me the fragments of memory that you retain of someone who has died. This is an intimate and authentic film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Halt auf freier Strecke or Stopped on Track is a German 105minute movie from 5 years ago. And it was the big moment in the spotlight for Andreas Dresen Milan Peschel and Otto Mellies. All three won German Film Awards for their work here. Writer and director Dresen is one of the most successful filmmakers from the former GDR. Peschel has worked in film for a long time frequently as supporting actor to Schweighfer. Mellies was roughly 80 in the final years of his life and career probably when he made this one and it was according to IMDb the first award he ever won. And the film itself also won the Lola for Best German Film of the Year. Everybody involved with this one was probably a bit disappointed that the movie was not picked to represent Germany at the Oscars back then.But now let us talk a bit about the story. The film begins with a couple in their 40s talking to a doctor when they are informed that the husband has terminal brain cancer. They only went there because he had some apparently not so serious headaches. This shows how things can entirely change from one day to the next. Live your life to the fullest you have no idea how much time you have left. The rest of the movie is about the medical treatment he receives the way he deals with his family and his family deals with him and his declining health until he dies in the final scene. It is certainly a fairly depressing watch from start to finish. Comedy is basically nonexistent and you also have to be very attentive so you won't miss any of the very few somewhat positive and uplifting moments.As a whole it was a realistic depiction of dying I believe and Dresen also did a good job with everybody else except the main character. The same story in reality where it certainly happens a lot too in a similar manner may not have looked much different. Still sometimes I felt that the film still could have delivered a bit more on the emotional side occasionally i found it a bit sterile for the subject but I guess Dresen did not want to become it too much of a tearjerker and that's perfectly fine too. And there were also a handful scenes I did not like and that I could have done without for example the early scene when the protagonist talks to a little machine about how he is supposed to tell his children about his illness. That was when Dresen overshot the mark but I can forgive him because the positive moments easily outweighed the good. I also believe that despite the bleakness this film is an example which will have a much bigger emotional impact when watched on the big instead of the small screen. It may be very difficult to catch this film at a theater because of the time passed but if you get the chance then don't miss out on it. I highly recommend Halt auf freier Strecke even if the second half was inferior to the first and the song during the closing credits was also a weak choice.".

It doesn't help that almost every character in the movie is a one dimensional cartoon characterand even less subtle too boot. Film would actually be a complete and total mess were it not for the professional performance of Eva Longoria here. In fact I would go so far to say the reason why the film works at all would be because of the slightly greater depth Longoria gives her character. She actually manages to make her character seem like a better thought out character then the other assorted characters here and while i don't know if that's because the script focuses more on her or if its because Longoria gets to resemble an actual human being as opposed to the more comically exaggerated people here i give her all the credit in the world for providing the film with someone to actually somewhat care about. if only Slater's character had been given as much screen time to develop into someone worth caring about as well Longoria plays the uptight wife of the mayor who gladly takes over after her husband is taken alongside the other men. Film is mostly about how she comes into her own while taking charge and making decisions for once and also how she learns to loosen up while engaging in a flirtation with a lesbian drifter who becomes the sheriff of the town as well as the town's resident bad ass As a case of a former wallflower coming into her own the film actually worksas anything else however the film really doesn't. The film's tone is very broad and played in an over the top farcical style which doesn't really gel with the subject matter. While its nice to see a film with this subject matter not played in heavy handed award baiting sympathy mode...i'm not sure if taking the complete opposite tone was the right track either. The mixture of tones wild sex farce and true love amongst suffering village women could work well but doesn't really come off as well as it could here. The film should play well on cable TV tho where the bright colors and bouncy energy will help it stand out from what else is on tho it might not sustain your interest past the second or third commercial break.".

My wife sat through it because she's an Eva Longoria fan but after this movie I'm not so sure anymore. Horrible acting horrible story with horrible attempts at I'm not sure what accents.

Based on a novel by James Canon and adapted for the screen and directed by Gabriela Tagliavini the story what little there is of it concerns the women of a remote Latin American town who are forced to pick up the pieces and remake their world when all the town's men are forcibly recruited by communist guerrillas. They are devastated that they have to do 'men's work' such as cleaning the town and governing the village. The local priest Oscar Nuez prays to God and is instructed that he must populate the village with new men by sleeping with all the women of childbearing age. Unable to perform his duties he is ostracized. One woman Eva Longoria becomes mayor and the women gradually make the town a women's place  yes even to the point of deciding that physical relationships between women are just fine and clothing is optional. A side bar story that simply doesn't fit is the presence of a reporter Christian Slater who is sent by his boss Camryn Manheim to get a front page article about the little town of only women. Et cetera.....The lines these poor actors are giving are so poor that they are embarrassing but the level of acting in general is on the junior high school level. Slater has so little to do that it seems as though he was hired simply to sell tickets in the theaters. This is a 'must miss' little bit of deflated fluff. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Jackie Chan Gives His All in His Final Action Movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the first solo Jackie Chan movie that I have seen for a long while. In Forbidden Kingdom he shared the star billing with Jet Li. In Karate Kid he even played a supporting role for Jaden Smith! Now comes word that this film Chinese Zodiac will already be the last action film of the iconic martial arts star. If that statement alone will not convince his fans to catch it then I do not know what will.I think a lot of people shared that idea even my kids who have only seen him before in Karate Kid. Today is the first weekend that it is showing in local theaters. We watched this in a movie theater in Chinatown and that 3pm showing was totally SOLD OUT. It had been quite some time that I have been in a completely full theater in a showing that is not a premiere. It is truly impressive that the audience was composed of fans of all ages.Chinese Zodiac recounts the exploits of a mercenary of historic relics JC Jackie Chan who is searching for the twelve bronze heads of Chinese Zodiac animals which had been looted from the Summer Palace. JC leads a team who works with him Mission Impossible style. He shares his adventure as well with two plucky ladies Katherine a French heiress who would like to him to find her greatgrandfather ship which was lost at sea and a Chinese activist Coco who is part of a crusade to have Western powers to return cultural treasures back to the countries from whom these were stolen during colonial times. As with all Jackie Chan movies in the past the main reason people go to watch it is not really the story but Jackie's unique brand of comedy action. This film certainly does not disappoint. It is two hours worth of exciting stunts which only Jackie can deliver. The movie opened with a long sequence wherein he was sailing down a mountain road using a body suit with roller blades all over it. The last scenes involved skydiving in order to recover the last animal head before it plummets into a volcano! There were still so many action scenes in between  involving dogs in a maze pirates on an island a rival mercenary on a sofa henchmen with photography equipment  all as exhilarating as they were also funny.Yes Jackie Chan's age may be showing he is 58 now but he definitely still has IT! The outtakes shown over the end credits show that he was still the one doing all those dangerous stunts and demanding physical comedy routines himself. Though he was uncharacteristically playing a rogue character in this film like all of his past movies there are still lessons to be learned at the end both personally as well as patriotically. Cheesy dialogs and corny acting yes but above all it is excellent entertainment as can be evidenced by the enthusiastic audience response. Come on in and enjoy Jackie Chan's final show!".

But do you really go to a Jackie Chan movie for its story? The stunts and fight scenes in this movie are simply amazing. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't watched it yet but if you grew up watching Jackie's earlier films 80s and 90s you're gonna be pleasantly reminded of his golden days. He's not as fast or as nimble but it is still light years better than the typical 'hollywood' action scenes.As mentioned story and dialogue meh. Think of it as a vehicle for the action that ensues. You'll get a few trademark comedy reminiscent of Jackie's earlier works and overall it's a very good family film. But action is the hook of this movie. It's seriously so good that you'll come in with expectations of great action and still come out thinking that was better than expected.If you're a fan of Jackie this is a nobrainer mustwatch. If you're not a fan give it a chance as it is still an extremely solid action movie.".

	schema:headline " Doesn't reach the level of Jackie Chan's earlier gems.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the past 3 decades Jackie Chan has successfully developed and maintained his own kind of genre full of unbelievable action acrobatic fights thrilling moments unlimited fun and decent humour entertaining all age groups ranging from the innocent kids to the intelligent old. His latest offering is also made on the similar format showcasing all the essential ingredients of a Jackie Chan film but still cannot be rated at par with his earlier classics since its not that exciting as it may seem from its short synopsis.This time the heist specialist or treasure hunter Chan takes up an assignment to deliver the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac stolen from Chinese dynasty's Summer Palace centuries ago. The location of few of those heads is known but the rest need to be discovered and brought back. Chan and his crew are hired to find these 12 bronze heads and the film is all about their adventurous expedition to complete the collection.It begins with a novel exciting  well shot sequence where Chan is escaping from a mansion after completing his ongoing mission. It sets the mood right and you are all game for watching something very exciting and exceptional coming up in the next reels. But unfortunately despite having some great action sequences CZ12 doesn't turn out to be that entertaining as expected. The fun and humor element is not the same as found in Chan's other movies and the characters are very weak foolish and forced which are not able to impress at all. Particularly the bunch of pirates and the girls are simply there to act as few silly characters in the film and nothing more.A major negative feature of the film is the use of French and other foreign languages in it for a considerable period of time without any English subtitles on the screen which forces you to keep watching it helplessly like a fool. After few initial good moments the screenplay becomes directionless and only aims at the thrilling actions sequences thrown in to keep the pace going. The camerawork is truly superb as usual and the background score successfully manages to excite you in all those well conceived brave scenes especially the ones involving the sky diving and volcano sequences.So if you are a diehard Jackie Chan fan from decades then this film will surely remind you of his gems such as ARMOUR OF GOD 1986 and more. But at the same time will not give you a similar experience in the theater watching the miracle man. Yet CZ12 might impress many young viewers not familiar with the amazing living legend called Jackie Chan. And at the age of 58 with more than 100 films I can't even imagine any other person in the entire globe performing such risky and unbelievable stunts all alone by himself like a rubber man. To say it all as a true fan of the maestro I loved watching CZ12 and its crazy sequences but as an exciting adventure project its not upto the mark if compared to Chan's earlier gems and could be a lot better keeping in mind its interesting plot. The man is there in the entire film standing tall as always and if this is supposed to be his last major action project then it surely deserves to be seen by all his fans as a must for this one reason alone.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the past 3 decades Jackie Chan has successfully developed and maintained his own kind of genre full of unbelievable action acrobatic fights thrilling moments unlimited fun and decent humour entertaining all age groups ranging from the innocent kids to the intelligent old. His latest offering is also made on the similar format showcasing all the essential ingredients of a Jackie Chan film but still cannot be rated at par with his earlier classics since its not that exciting as it may seem from its short synopsis.This time the heist specialist or treasure hunter Chan takes up an assignment to deliver the 12 bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac stolen from Chinese dynasty's Summer Palace centuries ago. The location of few of those heads is known but the rest need to be discovered and brought back. Chan and his crew are hired to find these 12 bronze heads and the film is all about their adventurous expedition to complete the collection.It begins with a novel exciting  well shot sequence where Chan is escaping from a mansion after completing his ongoing mission. It sets the mood right and you are all game for watching something very exciting and exceptional coming up in the next reels. But unfortunately despite having some great action sequences CZ12 doesn't turn out to be that entertaining as expected. The fun and humor element is not the same as found in Chan's other movies and the characters are very weak foolish and forced which are not able to impress at all. Particularly the bunch of pirates and the girls are simply there to act as few silly characters in the film and nothing more.A major negative feature of the film is the use of French and other foreign languages in it for a considerable period of time without any English subtitles on the screen which forces you to keep watching it helplessly like a fool.

Not quite as good as the Operation CondorArmour of God movies it's supposed to be a sequel to nor as good as SupercopPolice Story films but every bit as good as The Accidental Spy Who Am I? and The Myth. And I thought all of those were quite enjoyable.This movie shares all the great features and all of the flaws of Chan's self produced andor directed films. They have a great sense of humor and the stuntaction sequences are quite inventive. But they are also quite cartoonythe acting is VERY broadand there's quite a bit in it that defies any common sense. But who really cares right? This is Chan unfiltered.The only REAL flaw to the film is the clumsy way Chan keeps inserting his moral messages. He has characters tell us what's right and wrong in very stilted dialog instead of creating situations that demonstrate his points. not to mention that a few of his morals seem to have been government imposedwe are not to interfere with the social structure in any way a protest leader incongruously says as Chan nods wisely and says That's right! But I think this will make a fine home video release for the US audience once they edit out some of the more Chinacentric chit chat redub the dialog or at least all the English which is horribly spoken by the international cast and replace a couple of oddly inappropriate pop tunes.I'll be buying it for my JC collection!".

	schema:reviewBody "Where to start? I saw this movie in a theater in China with all my Chinese friends who had seen it already saying it was hysterical. This movie mixes Chinese broken English horrible french and other languages in a way that is very confusing.The movie starts off with JC in some crazy rollerblade outfit that somehow manages to have enough speed on flat surfaces to outskate gun fire? In the mix of the scene one of his partners an attractive lady comes out of a nice car and asks the soldiers where the bathroom is. She then proceeds to hide a set of keys which was literally a few minutes of the movie which then had no connection to the following sequence except for a soldier saying where are they keys.So the movie goes on explaining how a long time ago evil invaders destroyed a peaceful advanced and harmonious society during the opium war and painting a scene of how westerns are the villains first of many times. As the movie goes on we see how these Chinese zodiac statues that were taken are being sold in auctions by again greedy westerners set out to humiliate china. The action was very dull and as many mentioned the pirate scene in the middle was too drawn out. And was it a coincidence that the pirates although later speaking multiple languages were first speaking Japanese?Throughout this film I laughed maybe 3 times at most. However the audience that it was intended for nationalistic viewers who think foreigners are not the smartest was laughing throughout the film. For example Coco the Chinese in France is upset with a French guy who is breaking up with her. As JC arrives she is throwing vases and keys at him. When JC asks whats wrong the french guy says something along the lines of I just came to break up with her and get my keys to give to my new girlfriend who lives with me.At some point in the movie JC and is band of thieves are awoken by a speech by coco's speech on how dare they put money before a country's pride a theme very prevalent in this country right now and how their children will be ashamed of them forever.The film ends with a skydive that somehow lasted about 510 minutes without pulling the parachute and still being able to catch the statute and survive? With an old Jackie Chan retiring he has nothing better to do than to try and appease an audience that will glorify him forever for a nationalistic comedy that lacked in new action story line and surprise.".

I cannot believe he received two Guinness World Records for this action packed interesting movie.It starts with a fine note about some relics and then Jackie and his team who are befriended by a French mademoiselle set out on an adventure to find the French lady's great grandfather's remains but Chan and his team have other plans. As the story moves forwards things start to squirt out and everything makes sense.The action quotient for this movie is amazing and Chan has given chance to the females too. It was interesting and at times funny too. The plot is not much of a shocker if you have watched other Jackie Chan movies but with a speculation that this is his last action one I give it 710.Everything else with stunts screenplay and direction is good music is fine and numbing during action sequences. But as a whole it is pretty enjoyable one compared to the recently released Hollywood movies.Bottom line It will make a perfect weekend movie with your kids.WATCH OUT FOR Jackie Chan of course!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

PreInterval scenes in the island finding out 2 brass heads amazing scenes 3. Post Interval scenes of 20  25 minutes showing pure fighting skills 4. Climax block of flying in the air above a volcano to save the Dragon Brass head was purely exciting like a roller coaster ride 5. Dragon like art shown in the sky was really an unexpected but did fit into the context of the movie. Some Difficulties I faced was to understand the Chinese and French parts. Probably they could've given subtitles to the French  Chinese scenes. JC's dedication to the movie with his stunts is really stunning and awesome. I was really amazed at his action stunts. This could be added to the following list  1. Dark Knight Rises 2.Real Steel  we could fit this CZ12 in the third place. I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I Don't believe why this movie is underrated in many sites  My advice is don't believe those underrated comments.".

It is mostly about gimmicks and technology gizmos that make sounds and bleeps. There's no intelligence gain in watching this. And clearly they went over the top with tech. The story itself is a let down. At first I thought of the old Dragon Ball series but the quest was nothing like that or as exciting. I've never felt so disinterested in watching a team trying to find and reunite some lost bronze heads. There're I thought that Chinese movies would attempt to be purer and less shallow than Hollywood's worst movie in this category. It wasn't the case they went even cheesier and shallower. This movie will surely make some 7 to 10 year old very happy or someone with that level of mental faculty.".

He had arguably made his 100th film with 1911 and with his latest release in CZ12 Chinese Zodiac 12 you could sense the very obvious slowdown and less risk taking involved which culminates in a less than enjoyable audience experience sad to say when he tries hard to compensate with an increase in drama and story which is perfunctory at best for the action sequences to surface.Wearing multiple hyphenated hats probably the most in a feature film having a hand in everything from producing directing writing lensing deciding on art direction and the list goes on. Perhaps having to wear too many hats may have diluted his focus and responsibilities in a lot of areas resulting in what would be a very lackluster Jackie Chan movie by his standards. The usual comedy he puts in are very tired and unfunny and the stunts give way to some obvious wire work and a hint at standins which once upon a time would be unthinkable. Perhaps it is these high standards he had already set that he's woefully unable to achieve being also bogged down by the latest technology buzz to replace practical effects with CG ones as much as possible.The story is simple with Jackie Chan playing JC a mercenary Indiana Jones type thief for hire operating with a lean crew Zhang Lanxin Kwone SangWoo and Liao Fan and often posing as a National Geographic journalist. They get assigned by an unscrupulous auction house to steal what would be the bronze heads of the Chinese Zodiac statues which in the late 19th century sat pretty in a Chinese palace already demolished by the invading Western forces. So he goes jetsetting round the globe to recover these artifacts for the wrong reasons of personal profit before being told off and influenced by a group of well meaning lobbyists whose objective is to convince owners of any antiques and national treasures to return them to where they rightfully belong.I won't even go into too much specifics of the story because it conveniently introduces characters from a Chinese woman Yao Xingtong working in France to a French lady Laura Weissbcker whose ancestor happen to be one amongst many to have laid eyes on the treasures in China and helped himself to plundering for profit including being shipwrecked which leads the merry crew to an abandoned island where perhaps one of the longest and most uninspiring set action pieces takes place. Granted this film has got its fair share of investors it's a little bit of a scrimping felt when this entire sequence was soundstaged with stunts that try to look dangerous when it's obvious there's no degree or hint of risk. A bunch of multilingual multicultural pirates enter the scene as adversaries and I tell you it's one of the most tedious sequences in the entire film contributing to the tremendous sag in pace at the halfway mark.The highlights though were the first sequence involving Jackie Chan in what would be a suit of skates nimbly escaping from soldiers as he weaves in and out through pursuing vehicles and the quintessential warehouse setting that serves as a villains lair of sorts which allows for all hell to break loose and for the man to do battle against a whole host of adversaries giving opportunity to perform his usual bag of circus acrobatics that have become the hallmark of his career. It's vintage JC just in that segment. And in what would be a case of too many endings the finale involving a skydiving fight on approach to an active volcano is again something of a letdown given the lack of sophistication in masking and refining its movie magic moments the outtakes will show just why the hunger and appetite for risk is no longer there.Running just over 2 hours CZ12 would have benefited if the pace was tighter and trimmed without many unnecessary moments that dragged and bloated the thin storyline be it the light comedy that tried too hard to be funny action that became repetitive after a while or the chestthumping nationalistic moments with characters exalting their motherland and preaching from a morale high ground of obligation to seek and retrieve national treasures from the hands of greedy museums and private collectors. It may be amusing for a bit but too much of something just becomes a little bit abhorring. CZ12 is full of excessive moments which I think is natural for JC the filmmaker to have had become a little over selfindulgent with his latest effort. A slew of cameos from Oliver Platt Shu Qi and Daniel Wu amongst others like Jonathan Lee were sought to spice up the ensemble cast especially in the dying moments trying to sweeten the deal but these add to nothing other than a distraction from fans from what is a rather dull actionadventure. It's one thing going out on a blaze of glory and another fading into the sunset. Even the usually interesting end credit outtakes of a typical Jackie Chan movie didn't manage to last to the end and had little to show for effort put into this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll keep this short and in layman's terms. This movie is terrible. I'm actually 23rds into the movie as I write this because I cannot focus my attention towards this disaster anymore. I don't know much about technical aspects of cinema like cinematography vfx or video processing but this movie's final cut looks bad. It looks like a standard grainy DVD res on a full HD blue ray setup which is what Im viewing... so there's that. Where do I begin? I can start by saying that the plot is very similar to Operation Condor the one released in the US. Chan has lost his ability to pull off amazing fight scenes. No doubt that he's in shape for his age but the action choreography in this movie was beyond corny. Chan relies on a group of young pretty Asians to team up with to do the heavy fight scenes. Also they can't act worth a sht. Even by watching a dubbed version of this movie all I see is a bunch of hysterical people pantomiming as if it was a silent film. This brings me to another major technical problem with this movie which is the audio dubbing. The dubbed voice audio levels are very bad. I could hardly hear the actors talk throughout the whole movie. I was guessing what was going on most of the time. Worst of all the blu ray of this movie doesn't come with subtitles. There's also the unnecessary usage of CGI. Its everywhere in this movie even in simple scenes where they throw stuff into a river no kidding. Jackie Chan plays some sort of Indiana Jones grave robbing archaeologist that has to acquire a bunch of bronze busts. Along the way a European heiress tags along with Chan's crew to go treasure hunting with them. Its Operation Condor all over again. Except this time instead of Nazis its French aristocrats. They jet set to a bunch of expensive looking locations like Paris and a micro island with an active volcano but still skimp out scenes by using unconvincing CGI. Ie the skydiving scene which was fake and entirely redone w VFX graphics. So after a bunch of maybe a dozen mediocre PG fight ballets the movie ends. Its followed by the ending blooper scenes which weren't even good. The best part of it was the blooper montage from Chan's career where some of his old stunts were shown. I'm sure it was perceived as a master piece in his mainland China but this movie was just an overextended and over budget crapfest.".

Also they can't act worth a sht. Even by watching a dubbed version of this movie all I see is a bunch of hysterical people pantomiming as if it was a silent film. This brings me to another major technical problem with this movie which is the audio dubbing. The dubbed voice audio levels are very bad. I could hardly hear the actors talk throughout the whole movie. I was guessing what was going on most of the time. Worst of all the blu ray of this movie doesn't come with subtitles. There's also the unnecessary usage of CGI. Its everywhere in this movie even in simple scenes where they throw stuff into a river no kidding. Jackie Chan plays some sort of Indiana Jones grave robbing archaeologist that has to acquire a bunch of bronze busts. Along the way a European heiress tags along with Chan's crew to go treasure hunting with them. Its Operation Condor all over again. Except this time instead of Nazis its French aristocrats. They jet set to a bunch of expensive looking locations like Paris and a micro island with an active volcano but still skimp out scenes by using unconvincing CGI. Ie the skydiving scene which was fake and entirely redone w VFX graphics. So after a bunch of maybe a dozen mediocre PG fight ballets the movie ends. Its followed by the ending blooper scenes which weren't even good. The best part of it was the blooper montage from Chan's career where some of his old stunts were shown. I'm sure it was perceived as a master piece in his mainland China but this movie was just an overextended and over budget crapfest.";

The wall of smoke that Cynthia and Roxanne seem to keep in front of them.  The disparity between the images created for the formal portraits and the truth of the personalities in them.  In a distinctly unsappy way Leigh has explored the old adage that the truth will set you free.If one reads a paragraph describing the main plot  the adopted child seeking out her birth mother  a very clear idea of a movieoftheweek story comes to mind.

	schema:reviewBody "With modern films placing so much emphasis on visuals and sound  the stage specializing in avantgarde drama or comedy it's rare to find oldfashioned storytelling outside of books. But it's rare at any time or in any medium to find a work combining such smartness  sensitivity as Secrets  Lies. After the deaths of her adoptive parents urbane young London optometrist Hortense JeanBaptiste searches for her biological origins and locates her mother alcoholic neurotic oncepromiscuous factory worker Cynthia Blethyn in one of the finest film performances of all time. Each is stunned to find something about the other that neither knew that the mother is white and the daughter is black! The film has sideplots rather than subplots two other stories developed in depth parallel to the main story although Leigh masterfully uses them to support rather than weaken the central relationship between Cynthia  Hortense. Cynthia's daughter Roxanne Rushbrook is coming of age and exploring love work and independence while struggling between the love pity resentment  disgust she holds for her mother. Cynthia's brother Maurice Spall a rolypoly English Jimmy Stewart a prosperous but overworked studio photographer gives the family name a facade of middleclass respectability even as he  his wife Monica Logan carefully conceal an embarrassment of their own. Through a variety of small seemingly random but fascinating illustrations like the Canterbury Tales the film hammers home its theme that lying  deception become not just easy but casual in an age that emphasizes individualism  responsibility where you assume that no one not even the closest of your relatives wants to hear about your problems. Rather than help one another each suffers alone while every lie they so readily spin must constantly be fed with more deception. A story that could have been both preachy  crushingly depressing is cut with just the right amount of humor in all the right places until the heartbreaking climax that is as powerful as any ever filmed. There isn't an air of judgment or lecturing morality no attempt to make a sweeping commentary of society. If any such message is delivered it must be derived from the story. In a superb cast Blethyn stands out as the haunted tormented Cynthia hurt  angered by the contempt  pity she sees in the eyes of her brother sisterinlaw  daughter as she staves off nervous breakdown with the bottle. Yet she can't bring herself to turn away again from the child she gave up long ago even though only she knows how much pain lies ahead if she doesn't. JeanBaptiste provides a stark contrast as the coolheaded but intense young woman who might be repulsed by the coarse painful world in which Cynthia lives yet never shows any reluctance to enter it. There's a spareness about the film so many scenes go without music that you're often surprised to remember that there IS a music score that engrosses the viewer making him concentrate rather than giving an air of cheapness. It's not Shakespeare or Greek theater since no one gets stabbed or finds out he's married his mother but Tennessee Williams or Anton Chekhov would have been envious of this effort.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful characterdriven movie Mike Leigh's genius strikes again!";
	schema:reviewBody "I've seen this movie four times now and waited before writing a review waited to see if my first spellbound viewing could be matched by the others that would follow. And an overwhelming yes is the answer.It actually gets deeper with each viewing even with knowing that the cast were given the outline of the characters and told to develop their own dialogue. In fact Brenda Blethyn who plays Cynthia the mother was not even aware that Hortense played by Marianne JeanBaptiste was black until she meets her for the first time in a crucial scene.Timothy Spall playing Maurice the brotheruncle is incredible what he can portray just with his eyes is breathtaking.I love the layering of the story the characterizations so unexpected. Such as the child abandoned at birth and put out for adoption being the most centred and focused of everyone. The drunken exowner of the business that Maurice bought bringing Maurice to a place of awareness that it could be him wandering around drunkenly speaking of his past achievements.The flashes of miniplots portrayed by the subjects of Maurice's photographic settings. The heartbreaking scene where Maurice's snobby wife reveals her secrets. The slowly developing warmth and comfort between Cynthia and Hortense.And on.This is a fabulous movie worth seeing over and over to get it all. And even then. The secret of Hortense's father is never revealed just an unknown marked on the birth certificate which leaves us to ponder on the fact she was probably raped at fifteen. She states she deliberately never saw the baby that was the result.You can literally feel her growing joy in Hortense and how beautiful a person she is. One scene earlier on has Cynthia telling Hortense how more like her she is than her other white daughter. Remarkable. 9 out of 10.Would that we had a Mike Leigh at this side of the world to bring us such treasures!!".

	schema:headline " One Excellent Film...But Is There Another Secret?";
	schema:reviewBody "Here is a question which has dogged me each time I watch this film  and I have seen it over 40 times Two times during the film Cynthia Purley Brenda Blethyn discusses the circumstances under which her daughter Hortense Cumberbatch Marianne JeanBaptiste was born  but when Hortense asks who her father is Cynthia cannot say.In the restaurant when Cynthia realizes that she a white woman is indeed the mother of this black daughter she has a moment where she hints at the true circumstances of Hortense's birth. We realize that Hortense's father is black...but is there another secret? After all at the birthday party for Cynthia's other daughter Roxanne Claire Rushbrook Cynthia tells Roxanne that her father's name was Bingham  that he was an American medical student that she met on holiday while she was at Benidorm. So she can tell people who Roxanne's true father was. But when Hortense asks if her father was a nice man Cynthia can't say  or won't.The question to be asked here which no one breaches is Was Hortense the product of rape? Was the 15 year old Cynthia Purley raped by a black man in 1968 in London? And did she then keep the child only to give it up for adoption? Why doesn't anyone ask this? Why does Cynthia let Roxanne know who her father is but not Hortense? Now was this done on purpose by the director andor the screenwriter? After all it would be simple enough to see the name of the child Elizabeth Rose Purley on the birth certificate that Hortense gets a copy of. If it is blank this would prove that Cynthia did not know who the father was  pointing the way to rape.But the question is not asked and the answer not given.Can we speculate? Can we broach the subject that a black man raped a white girl and yet she did not abort the child and instead gave it life and then gave it away? This is an absolutely fantastic film. From Brenda Blethyn to Marianne JeanBaptiste now on CSINew York without her British accent to Timothy Spall this film is filled with Oscar worthy performances. Why this was passed over for the dull and boring The English Patient is beyond me.I would recommend this film without doubt. It is one of the finest pieces of filmmaking and acting I have ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In honor of my film class wrapping up this week I will be counting down my top five favorite films we have watched for class. I begin with my 5 choice Secrets and Lies a Mike Leigh dramacomedy about the secrets and lies shock that tear apart a dysfunctional British family. Brenda Blethyn plays Cynthia Purley the very dramatic and always crying single mother who is one day contacted by the daughter she gave up for adoptionwho happens to be black. The look on Blethyn's face is priceless as she flashes back to a one night stand she had as a young lady.Most would think Leigh's story would revolve around race relations which is not the case at all race is never an issue. Instead he revolves his story around the Purley family a unit so torn apart from over the years that a simple family cook out turns into a soap opera. Secrets and lies! We're all in pain! Why can't we share our pain? I've spent my entire life trying to make people happy and the three people I love the most in the world hate each other's guts and I'm in the middle! I can't take it anymore! This memorable quote comes from Maurice Purley brother to Cynthia and talented photographer. Maurice is your classic good guy the passive patriarch who always tries to hold the family together. The irony around his character is that he cannot conceive a child with his wife Monica. You almost feel sorry for the successful Hortense as if she would be better off not knowing her birth mother at all.The actors are so talented in this film that Leigh at times uses no cuts during a scene. The camera stays in one spot as the actors' play out scenes that can last 1015 minutes. After you get past the difficult British dialect you may want to use captions while watching you will feel as if you are that nosey neighbor who can't help but listen and enjoy the problems this family confrontsand that's no lie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again Mike Leigh crafts a film that leaves me completely emotionally drained by the time the credits roll. The film is immensely suspenseful and this suspense doesn't come in the Hitchcockian 'physical danger around every corner' kind of way. We are exposed to the various secrets and lies formed in this dysfunctional family very early on and the entire film is just a slow buildup until everything explodes and it is out in the open. We are forced to sit and wait for the inevitable collision of all the painfully awkward secrets that this family contains. Behind all of this is a beautifully operatic score that creates the perfect ambiance to the entire work. As with Leigh's earlier work Naked he creates an ensemble of strong detailed and incredibly flawed characters. Everyone has so much inner emotional pain that when they all end up in a room together your heart explodes with the uncomfortable anguish of every secret revealed. It's a series of savage beatings one right after the other that rips your emotional core into pieces and leaves them to be stomped on in the dirt. Of course behind all of this is a beautiful moral and that's where the film really shines. Behind all of the pain and gutwrenching heartache there is a wonderful story that perfectly depicts the folly of secrets and lies. We see that being truthful and honest for your entire life is ultimately the best decision regardless of how hard it may be. Letting all of the emotional pain build up over the course of decades will only lead to an even more painful conclusion. In the end it's better to simply be honest and trustworthy.".

We are forced to sit and wait for the inevitable collision of all the painfully awkward secrets that this family contains. Behind all of this is a beautifully operatic score that creates the perfect ambiance to the entire work. As with Leigh's earlier work Naked he creates an ensemble of strong detailed and incredibly flawed characters. Everyone has so much inner emotional pain that when they all end up in a room together your heart explodes with the uncomfortable anguish of every secret revealed. It's a series of savage beatings one right after the other that rips your emotional core into pieces and leaves them to be stomped on in the dirt. Of course behind all of this is a beautiful moral and that's where the film really shines. Behind all of the pain and gutwrenching heartache there is a wonderful story that perfectly depicts the folly of secrets and lies. We see that being truthful and honest for your entire life is ultimately the best decision regardless of how hard it may be. Letting all of the emotional pain build up over the course of decades will only lead to an even more painful conclusion. In the end it's better to simply be honest and trustworthy.";

Superbly acted and helped along by the big reveal of all the secrets and lies at the end the film continues to resonate in my mind today.Brenda Blethyn has never received much credit for her incredible portrayal of Cynthia Purley and most of that has to do with the highly overrated performance of Francis McDormand as a fairly boring and typical North Dakotan police officer in Fargo.  While Emily Watson and Breaking the Waves deserved Academy Awards in 1996 Brenda Blethyn and Secrets and Lies come in a close second.  There was something very real about Cynthia Purley's working class status and desire to fulfill her obligations to her newfound daughter.  Cynthia was by no means the sharpest tool in the shed and the screenplay does an excellent job of conveying the fact that she pretty much has no clue who Hortense's father is and frankly has little idea about responsibility in general.  Her other daughter Roxanne is essentially Cynthia at 21 with more of an attitude and it is little wonder that the two are constantly at odds.  The most refreshing aspect of Secrets and Lies is the refreshing bond that is eventually shared between Cynthia Brenda Blethyn and Hortense Marianne JeanBaptiste.  These are two women who have absolutely nothing in common save their bloodtypes.  Hortense is a welleducated Black optometrist with a sense of duty and responsibility while Cynthia is an undereducated White factory worker with little idea about what correct behavior entails.  What is wonderful is the little moments they share at an Italian restaurant where the dialogue is excellent.  Remember when Cynthia ironically mentions that she wishes she could have been a midwife because she loves children to a rather bewildered Hortense?  And how sweet and adorable did Brenda Blethyn play Cynthia with her cute little voice and her adorable way of being virtually idiotic but forgivable at the same time.  The woman gave her daughter away but proves that she is a good mom in her own right despite her flaws.  I could have done without the side story with Timothy Spall and his infertile wife because this is a film that is perfectly capable of being carried on the shoulders of Blethyn and JeanBaptiste.  There are some powerful scenes with the often verbally and physically abusive Roxanne and most delightful are the times when Roxanne is stunned to see her mother leaving for her dates with Hortense.An excellent rental that proves that American family drama doesn't hold a candle to the punch that the Brits pack.".

Men in their 40's facing important choices that may influence their lives or careers.What I like most about the film would probably be considered a fault by cinema lovers. The film uses simple techniques and avoids overblown form. It's rather a prose of life than artistic poetry. It also say what I always thought the simpler you are the smaller your problems. The Thief's problems are the least complicated.

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie which in some ways probably helps.  Going in with absolutely no expectations about any of the performers or the director may have helped make my experience more enjoyable.The best thing about this film is Troels Lyby who seems to have hot on just the right combination of humor sadness realism and indecision for Jorgen.  Particularly good is the scene where his friends try to cheer him up as his partner packs up to leave.  His slow disintegration during lunch is an example of really good acting.  He never lets his character get too maudlin or too I'm putting on the cheery face for you as an American actor would have done.Mads Mikkelson however is nowhere near as good.  His Jakob seems mopey bored angry and closeted.  Where is the thrill of finding a new sexual partner he's obsessed by? The script clearly calls for that but Mikkelson never really gets the audience to believe that Jakob is truly fascinated by Caroline.  Mikkelson seems to be just going through the motions in so much of the movie.  One could say that Jakob is deeply conflicted by his sexual and emotional attraction to Caroline hence the sullen acting.  But I just don't buy that.  The script never calls for that explanation and Mikkelson doesn't bring it off anyway.Peter Frodin as the outlandish Frederik is your stereotypical hysterical queen.  But he brings it off without offending us becoming obnoxious or turning Frederik into a cardboard cutout.  His scene where he describes his angst over Sailor's refusal to come out of the closet and love him is really quite good.Less effective is Charlotte Munck as Caroline.  In part this is due to the material she has to work with.  I never really felt that Caroline was suffering that much in her failing marriage to Tom Jesper Lohmann.  Sure Tom is never home.  But Caroline doesn't want another baby anyway and Tom being home would increase the pressure on her.  So why does she turn to Jakob?  The whole movie hinges on us believing that Caroline and Jakob really share a deep festering obsession with one another.  But the film never goes there and as a result half the movie anything to do with Jakob and Caroline just doesn't work that well.  Munck however is superb in the Swedish skatingrink scene.  her physical acting and facial expressions really convinced me that she was finally truly happy.Jesper Lohmann is given even less to work with and as a result his Tom is just a caricature of the workaholic husband.  It makes absolutely no sense for him to be the salvation of Jakob and Jorgen's marriage.  It's a cute ending somewhat along the lines of Flying Down to Rio.  But it makes no sense.Watch for superb bit performances by Morten Kirkskov and Henning Jensen as the superfag married couple particularly their two scenes midmovie one where they are horrified that Jakob has turned straight and one where the ugly secret of their marriage comes out.  Oskar Valsoe is really good as the lone straight ? man in the bunch without falling over into supercilious liberal guilt as so many American films would push the character.The editing is just superb and the cinematography at times really reaches for your heart.  The soundtrack is very good  when it is there.  It's too bad there wasn't more if it a la Muriel's Wedding or Boogie Nights.And okay  so the script at times falls into triteness.  Jorgen loses an eye after driving drunkenly through the night after hearing Jakob's confession.  Like we didn't see that one coming!  After The World According to Garp this is just too too common a storytelling trick. The ending too is just far too pat.  The inclusion of the horse was just so bookendish it really pushed the conclusion far beyond acceptable storytelling limits.  But overall this film is rather good.  I had a very pleasant time watching it.".

I had no idea what the movie was about and from the moment it started I found it utterly charming and very funny with some unexpected twists in the plot. The acting is great and the characters were all believable. My only gripe would be with a few bad makeup decisions especially a less convincing mustache on a supporting character and an amateurishly assembled beard on another. But these are minor problems and did not spoil the movie for me. A real fun movie with a wonderful ending you'd expect from a romantic comedy!".

I had no idea what the movie was about and from the moment it started I found it utterly charming and very funny with some unexpected twists in the plot. The acting is great and the characters were all believable. My only gripe would be with a few bad makeup decisions especially a less convincing mustache on a supporting character and an amateurishly assembled beard on another. But these are minor problems and did not spoil the movie for me. A real fun movie with a wonderful ending you'd expect from a romantic comedy!";

The one falls in love with the others sister in law and here goes trouble as it is in a bisexual reality.The actors seem pretty much left to themselves and as most of them are experienced that can do. But Joof's eager to plaster celebrity Danes in every little part of the movie is ridiculous. Bodil award winner Zlatko Buric gets one line as a taxi driver  and that is symptomatic for the entire movie.The only supporting role that earns praise is Lotte Merete Andersen as the doctor. She gets 30 second and steals the scene. That is acting!Joof is famous for her special and somewhat childish humor as expressed in acting ensembles Det Brune Punktum and Lex  Klatten and it shows also here. Her fondness of 'dirty' words here are nevertheless not funny at all but seems misplaced in a film about very sensitive adults.All in all this is a disappointment.

The main blame must lie with the script. First it is not funny! And with a romantic comedy that must be close to a deadly sin. There are a few chuckles but otherwise nothing. Secondly the characters are rather badly drawn. I have no doubt that they are meant to be extremely interesting but their behaviour are absurd most of the time because we never really get to know them properly. We are thrown into the plot head first without any background to who they are and what makes them tick. Like a previous reviewer wrote this film is filled with supporting characters including the main protagonists! The female doctor is the only REAL person who manages to make a REAL impression but she only has about a minute of screen time. As to the actors they really try but I am not convinced that they agree which kind of movie they are in. Charlotte Munch seems to think this is some kind of serious relationship drama and responds accordingly looking troubled in almost every scene. Mikkelsen and Lyby have no chemistry whatsoever together and one wonders what they saw in each other in the first place. The usually excellent Mikkelsen seems unhappy about the whole thing and manages to look bored with BOTH his man and his woman. Lyby is the one actor who comes off the best. He is the most sympathetic in this comedy and responds to his plight with some kind of normal reaction. He is sweet guy with a whole lot of emotions and also some sense of humour who really deserves someone better and more focused than the guy Mikkelsen portrays. Other than that we get a gallery of more or less eccentric people who bend over backwards to get a laugh from the audience but fail at every turn. And then there is the ending!!!! Pleeeease take it away!! I suppose it's meant to be heartwarming but it only comes across as phony and ridiculous. But it is not hard going despite all my reservations. You can watch it if there is nothing else to do it will cause you no pain...but nor will it stay in the memory for longer than one minute or so! Loved the score though...".

A movie that in its trailer wishes to appear as a fun light hearted movie that contains funny scenes such as one where the main character compares his boyfriends penis to vegetable. But this movie is only sporadically funny. It tries to combine a much to serious story with jokes that could have been part of American Pie. THAT does not work.Mads Mikkelsenperhaps THE most popular actor in Denmark seems out of place and constantly gives one the impression that he would rather have been somewhere else. But having said that I still must still applaud many of the actors appearing in this movie Troels Lybywho represents the seriousbut sadly boring part of the movie Peter Frdinfunny as always and Nikolai Steenextremely funny in a quite grotesque role.So the conclusion to my review is if you wish to see a funny moviethat does not share the bottom level of scary movie or not another teen movie  dont waste your money here.

	schema:reviewBody "In his golden five years 194044 Preston Sturges was the writer  director for eight movies for Paramount ALL GOOD and MOST of them BRILLIANT.I first came to know these movies when five of them were shown on the BBC at Christmas in the early 1990's including my personal favourites 'The Lady Eve' and 'The Palm Beach Story'. Since then I have had to wait for the invention of the DVD and then last year's Preston Sturges DVD box set when at last I could check out the other three.Of those three 'The Great McGinty' was the first movie to be Written  Directed by Preston Sturges and has to go into the GOOD rather than the BRILLIANT category. But for his first such project to be so good has got to be seen as a brilliant achievement for Sturges. I know how long he had to wait and how hard he had to bargain to get that opportunity. He knew he had to succeed not in his own terms but in those of his bosses at Paramount. In other words he had to bring in an economical movie that was conventional enough to be popular with audiences and critics alike.The lead Brian Donleavy plays McGinty as quite a straight character who has comic moments in set pieces with other players. The best comedy of the movie probably comes from Bill Demarest as the Politician and especially Akim Tamiroff as the Boss who drives the movie and its plot along as he pushes McGinty and his career forward. The second movie in the Preston Sturges golden period would be 'Christmas in July' again not one of his brilliant best but beginning to include more of the lunacy and eccentric characters of a true Preston Sturges movie. By the time of his third project 'The Lady Eve' Sturges would be at the top of his form and the top of his art and 'The Great McGinty' has to be seen not only as a good movie in itself but as the first step in that direction.".

	schema:reviewBody "The conventional wisdom on McGINTY is that it's lesser Sturges more important as his directorial debut than as a standalone comedy. Pish and tosh. This is a supremely satisfying comedy and had it been Sturges' only directing credit would still mark him as a filmmaker to remember. And no that's not a subtle swipe at his others merely a defense of this toooften overlooked movie.Maybe the best asset of McGINTY is its budget constraint which steered Sturges towards the 'ensemble' casting which would become one of his hallmarks. The movie is filled stem to stern with sharpeyed turns by primarily supporting players including the leads Donlevy  Tamiroff who are excellent. What I can't help but notice is how the Sturges films of the 40s are really the last gasp of the great breakneck comedies of the preCode 30s just prior to the 'screwball' era when Hollywood was still allowed to poke fun at peopleinstitutionsconventions of the Real World. In fact McGINTY with only minor casting changes would have fit right in with the Warner BrosFirst National bumper crop of fast cynical comedies of '31'34. And by the way Tamiroff's cheerfully corrupt and malapropping Boss would be paid hilarious homage 20 years later in animation form as Boris Badinov in Jay Ward's ROCKY  BULLWINKLE cartoons. The love interest of Muriel Angelus and adjoining subplot may come off a bit treacly but Sturges was canny enough to make this studiomandated mawkishness an integral part of the plot...even as early as 1940 he was subverting True Love to his devilishly satiric purposes! So stop nitpicking and thoroughly enjoy one of the great American comedies brought to unforgettable life by that great if unrecognized repertory company The Sturges Players featuring among others Wm Demarest Thurston Hall  Arthur Hoyt.".

Here we see a simple man who does what he is told and almost immediately is made governor of the state. This shows that America is the land of opportunity as well as the land of corruption. What amazes me is how fluidly the film moves. It is only 82 minutes long yet more happens here than in most Disney family movies. This shows the wonderful genius of Sturges and how he was able to enjoy a successful career throughout the 1940s.

	schema:headline " The Truth About the American Democratic System";
	schema:reviewBody "The 1940s saw the appearance of four major American directors Orson Welles John Huston Billy Wilder and Preston Sturgis. They had careers of varying degrees of success. Welles is usually seen as the great talent done to death by the jackals of the Hollywood system and his own personality quirks. Wilder and Huston were both more successful although both met with serious problems as well  Huston with the threat of the blacklist in the last 1940s and Wilder with increasing feelings of irrelevance in the industry after 1969. Sturgis actually had a far longer career in Hollywood as he was a highly successful screenplay writer in the 1930s. But his heyday as a great comedy director lasted only from 1940  1948 and even then with two projects THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK and UNFAITHFULLY YOURS failures at the box office. His last two films THE BEAUTIFUL BLOND OF BASHFUL BEND and THE FRENCH THEY ARE A FUNNY FACE were not as good as the films that preceded them. He was finished as a filmmaker by 1955. Even Welles lasted longer.His first film comedy that he wrote and directed is THE GREAT MCGINTY 1940 starring Brian Donleavy as the title character. It remains the best study of the weaknesses of the democracy our country prides itself on every 4th of July or other patriotic occasion. For the whole joke of the rise and fall of Dan McGinty is that he only succeeds when he fully works alongside the corrupt Boss Akim Tamiroff and the latter's underlings William Demerest Harry Rosenthal and when he actually tries to personally reform and be the good statesman he is brought down by the Boss in disgrace. Said this way the joke sounds flat but Sturgis' witty and perceptive script is not flat at all.Basically the problem comes down to this  how seriously do Americans take their system? As I said before we give a lip service to it and we follow the forms but do we really understand the nature of the public trust imposed on our elected officials and the electorate? It is doubtful. The reason is that everyone is more concerned with earning a living for themselves and their families. At one point Muriel Angelus tells William Demerest she has just read a book in which the writer points out that the money spread around by political corruption actually does help everyone by stimulating business and prosperity. Demerest shoots back that he wishes that book was read by everyone in the country. Of course Demerest's self interest would push this theory. But is he far from totally wrong? When Donleavy runs for Governor he is Mayor of the state's largest city. There is a series of intercut scenes of Demerest giving a speech for Donleavy while Robert Warwick gives a speech for the reform candidate. Warwick keeps harping on the useless public roads and public works that Donleavy and his cronies have foisted on the public to line their pockets. But Demerest reminds the public that as a result of these acts of public construction hundreds of families were fed during what was the depression and the result gave the people the most beautiful city in the world. For all of Warwick's high toned attack the actually results of the corruption seem rather sensible. Akim Tamiroff's boss seems like a typical political hood but if you listen carefully his comments culminating in America is land of great opportunity merely mirrors comments like those of the Tammany Hall sage George Washington Plunkitt in the early 20th Century who said he saw his opportunities and took 'em. Plunkitt differentiated between honest graft i.e. inflating the prices of public works projects which do benefit the city and dishonest graft stealing the iron roof of an almshouse to sell it to a scrap iron dealer. But there are examples of dishonest graft in Tamiroff's world  examples that Plunkitt would have known of. When Donleavy starts his way up the political power tree he is an enforcer collecting bribes from bordello operators and bar owners. This is not as gray an area of corruption as the public works issue  how do you defend shakedowns of small fry? Sturgis in the end destroys the machine and the wouldbe reformer by showing the impossibility of reform. Donleavy tries to make a stand but his principled attempt is ignored as the public learns he took bribes. He is swept out of power as rapidly in it's way as his rise from bum to governor had been. Yet even Sturgis must have realized that in the real world such sudden altruism would not have occurred to rock the boat. In his later film THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK we find both Donleavy and Tamiroff back in power together running the state  and in the end of that film solving the problems of the hero and heroine.".

	onyx:emotionText "The 1940s saw the appearance of four major American directors Orson Welles John Huston Billy Wilder and Preston Sturgis. They had careers of varying degrees of success. Welles is usually seen as the great talent done to death by the jackals of the Hollywood system and his own personality quirks. Wilder and Huston were both more successful although both met with serious problems as well  Huston with the threat of the blacklist in the last 1940s and Wilder with increasing feelings of irrelevance in the industry after 1969. Sturgis actually had a far longer career in Hollywood as he was a highly successful screenplay writer in the 1930s. But his heyday as a great comedy director lasted only from 1940  1948 and even then with two projects THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK and UNFAITHFULLY YOURS failures at the box office. His last two films THE BEAUTIFUL BLOND OF BASHFUL BEND and THE FRENCH THEY ARE A FUNNY FACE were not as good as the films that preceded them. He was finished as a filmmaker by 1955. Even Welles lasted longer.His first film comedy that he wrote and directed is THE GREAT MCGINTY 1940 starring Brian Donleavy as the title character. It remains the best study of the weaknesses of the democracy our country prides itself on every 4th of July or other patriotic occasion. For the whole joke of the rise and fall of Dan McGinty is that he only succeeds when he fully works alongside the corrupt Boss Akim Tamiroff and the latter's underlings William Demerest Harry Rosenthal and when he actually tries to personally reform and be the good statesman he is brought down by the Boss in disgrace. Said this way the joke sounds flat but Sturgis' witty and perceptive script is not flat at all.Basically the problem comes down to this  how seriously do Americans take their system? As I said before we give a lip service to it and we follow the forms but do we really understand the nature of the public trust imposed on our elected officials and the electorate? It is doubtful. The reason is that everyone is more concerned with earning a living for themselves and their families. At one point Muriel Angelus tells William Demerest she has just read a book in which the writer points out that the money spread around by political corruption actually does help everyone by stimulating business and prosperity. Demerest shoots back that he wishes that book was read by everyone in the country. Of course Demerest's self interest would push this theory. But is he far from totally wrong? When Donleavy runs for Governor he is Mayor of the state's largest city. There is a series of intercut scenes of Demerest giving a speech for Donleavy while Robert Warwick gives a speech for the reform candidate. Warwick keeps harping on the useless public roads and public works that Donleavy and his cronies have foisted on the public to line their pockets. But Demerest reminds the public that as a result of these acts of public construction hundreds of families were fed during what was the depression and the result gave the people the most beautiful city in the world. For all of Warwick's high toned attack the actually results of the corruption seem rather sensible. Akim Tamiroff's boss seems like a typical political hood but if you listen carefully his comments culminating in America is land of great opportunity merely mirrors comments like those of the Tammany Hall sage George Washington Plunkitt in the early 20th Century who said he saw his opportunities and took 'em.

But there are examples of dishonest graft in Tamiroff's world  examples that Plunkitt would have known of.

Sturges allegedly got the idea for the film and the various scenes therein from talking to a judge from Chicago who filled them in one the various shenanigans pulled there back in the day and still being pulled in some parts of the USA. Preston Sturges though he had a successful Broadway play The Good Fairy and had written several sparkling screenplays for Paramount the moguls that ran Paramount were a bit uneasy about giving him his own film to direct as well as act. The Great McGinty was a B film when it was released playing the lower half of double features. It had a competent cast of players but none of them you could say were big box office. Imagine the surprise the following year when The Great McGinty won an Oscar for Preston Sturges not for directing but for Best Original Screenplay in 1940. The Great McGinty returned a tidy profit for a film they had not spent all that much money on. Sturges was given greater autonomy and control after that and for the next four years turned out a series of comedy classics with much larger budgets. But he was in constant warfare with the money people at Paramount for the rest of the time he was there.The film is told in flashback as Brian Donlevy as a philosophical bartender tells a distraught Louis Jean Heydt his life story after preventing Heydt from shooting himself. There both in an unnamed South American country without extradition to the USA.Donlevy was the epitome of the American dream as Preston Sturges sees the American dream. In Sturges's view any bum with nerve enough to seize opportunity before him there's no telling how far he can go in America. When we meet Donlevy he's exactly that a hobo. He's on a soup line and ready to earn a few bucks by being a repeat voter for some people who for one reason or other are still on the voting rolls but just can't make it to the polls. By earning 74.00 a vote by voting 37 times at 2.00 a vote he comes to the attention of boss Akim Tamiroff. Though they are immediate antagonists Tamiroff sees potential in Donlevy and he begins a great political career and then has a very big fall. Preston Sturges was starting to assemble his stock company of players who were in most of his films at Paramount like William Demarest Jimmy Conlin Robert Grieg etc. Although Sturges was only at Paramount for four years his stock company rivaled that of John Ford for that brief period. Seen 67 years after its debut The Great McGinty is a fresh as the day it was first made. It's dated in that the political bosses like Akim Tamiroff are not what they used to be in the age of information. Still though the ethics or lack thereof are still present in the age of television and the internet.".

The best scenes are between Tamiroff and Donlevy who work beautifully together particularly when they're trying to kill one another. Though one of the last scenes is a sad one Sturges gives us our smiles back with the last moments of the film.Brian Donlevy who is usually in a supporting role does a terrific job as McGinty  tough and belligerent but with a kind side even he didn't know he had. Donlevy repeated his role of McGinty in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek in a cameo. Muriel Angelus a British leading lady who retired to raise a family in 1946 is lovely as Mrs. McGinty who never wanted to get married again and then falls in love with her husband. Tamiroff makes a powerful Boss who has a volatile relationship with his puppet who sometimes gets out of his strings. An excellent movie that pokes fun at political machinery and behind the scenes plotting. It also shows us what can happen when a little love comes into our lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Great McGinty dir. Preston Sturges 1940The Great McGinty has quite surprising scope for a middling level Depression era studio comedy. The film portrays the rise and fall of Daniel McGinty Brian Donlevy a bum who by the film's end will flee the country after being elected a state governor through dishonest means. Sturges structures the story as McGinty's flashback and begins the film with this prologue This is the story of two men who met in a banana republic. One of them never did anything dishonest in his life except for one crazy minute. The other never did anything honest in his life except for one crazy minute. They both had to get out of the country. The idea expressed about honesty that it is as dangerous to a dishonest man as dishonesty is to an honest man is vintage Sturges irony. Indeed McGinty includes various Sturges hallmarks the rapid fire dialog that conveys farce and naturalism the parody of typical American class structures. The film especially displays Sturges's knack for managing to finesse otherwise distasteful characters into the audience's good graces. Daniel McGinty for 95 of the picture is a man motivated by greed power and ego a born politician. Yet Sturges manages to shade the character realistically enough to allow the audience to believe the moral crusade McGinty embark upon ion the film's final 5. Of course upon deciding to finally take the highroad McGinty is promptly booted out of office and into jail.The Great McGinty was a wild success in its day with both the public and the critics heralding it as the arrival of a fantastic new talent in the world of cinematic comedy. For his perceptive script Sturges received the newly created Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Despite some of its more dated elements the dialog does include the occasional outdated slang and McGinty's biggest pratfall flounders the film remains a biting commentary on the treacherous world of politics. It conveys a common American cynicism toward political institutions with a pungent twist of levity. We are introduced to fairly remorseless crooks yet the film still manages to end on an effective grace note and as a result it power as entertainment endures.".

It conveys a common American cynicism toward political institutions with a pungent twist of levity. We are introduced to fairly remorseless crooks yet the film still manages to end on an effective grace note and as a result it power as entertainment endures.";

	schema:headline " Preston Sturges' satire on political corruption is unevenly paced but with Akim Tamiroff as The Boss it is a lot of fun.";
	schema:reviewBody "Preston Sturges couldn't get any studio interested in doing his Story of a Man nor could he even get it published when it was retitled Biography of a Bum so he offered it to Paramount for 10 on condition he could direct it.  It was an offer the studio bosses couldn't refuse and it paved the way for other writers such as John Huston to take control of their own work by directing its film production.  The script which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay has some extremely funny moments with almost all of them involving Akim Tamiroff who steals the movie as The Boss the man who pulls the political strings in the entire state.  He is the perfect counterpoint to the rather bland Brian Donlevy who is in the title role as a bum who votes thirty seven times in an election for mayor to get the two dollars per vote. This makes a deep impression on Tamiroff who likes his chutzpa and eventually runs him for alderman then mayor and finally governor.  The pace of the film is slow at its start but picks up when Donlevy starts his story in flashback until he's elected mayor and then slows down again. The condition that he marry to win any election begins his downfall because he marries his secretary Muriel Angelus who wants him to do great things and eliminate the graft in politics.  Although it's a marriage of convenience he falls in love and wants to please her.  And you see what she means when Tamiroff is all smiles as he says greeting the new governor What a wonderful opportunity. This state needs everything. ... We'll need  you'll kiss me for this  a new dam. ... You think a dam is something you put a lot of water in.  A dam is something you put a lot of concrete in. And it doesn't matter how much you put in there's always room for a lot more. ... The level of writing is first rate but I wish there were no flashbacks in the screenplay construction since you know how it ends from the start.   I've always felt the flashback construction in nine out of ten films is detrimental to their enjoyment.  The supporting cast includes William Demarest who has the classic line If you didn't have graft you'd have a lower class of people in politics!  Muriel Angelus was and is a relatively unknown actress who quit making movies after 1940. Sturges had severe budget constraints and couldn't use high salaried actors which would have benfited the film.".

Who knew democracy was so vulnerable!I'm not condoning voter fraud but forgive me if I try to keep things in perspective. Wake up vote fraud in America has been a robust and comical affair for a long long time. One of the funniest movies ever made about vote fraud and politics is the 1940 Oscar winning film The Great McGinty from writerdirector Preston Sturges.The Great McGinty begins in a sleazy bar in a wretched Banana Republic frequented by lost Americans. In trying to cheer up a depressed customer the bartender tells him a story of how he was once the governor of a state and how he lost it all to end up serving cheap rum in a two bit bar.Our bartender is Daniel McGinty played by the beefy Brain Donlevy and we see his story in flashback. Starting off as an out of work bum on a soup line McGinty gets involved in a vote fraud scam and for two bucks a vote he actually casts 37 ballots in one night which impresses the big boss Akim Tamiroff who pulls the political strings behind the scenes.But this boss doesn't think badly about graft in politics in fact he says at one point If it wasn't for graft you'd get a very low type of people in politics men without ambition! The big boss finds that McGinty is quite ambitious and little by little through one crooked election after another he manages to push Daniel McGinty all the way up to the governorship!But then in a moment of weakness McGinty decides he should actually start doing a few things for the regular citizens and it is when this essentially bad man decides to do something good that he fails miserably and is ultimately forced to leave the country.The Great McGinty is an acid tongued political comedy that still bites hard. It is also the perfect antidote if you have just watched the saccharine Mr. Smith Goes To Washington. I'll take the nononsense grifters of Preston Sturges over the sugar sweet idealists of Frank Capra any day.".

It does not always mix well with the melodrama of the rest of the film. The other problem is the relatively weak resolution. I had come to know and love these characters and I would have liked a little more at the end.SPOILERSStill it works quite well. The story reminiscent of Citizen Kane though released the year before is about a bum from the streets McGinty who is recruited to illegally vote for the incumbent mayor. In exchange he will get 2 for every vote. He not only does this but does it an amazing 37 times. The same political party impressed with his abilities hires him as muscle. From there the party decides to get him elected as mayor. There is one condition he must be married. Women can vote and they will not vote for a bachelor. His secretary a divorcee with two children agrees to a marriage of convenience with him. This is the relationship in the film which manages to touch deeply. It is entirely believable because of Sturges' writing and the two wonderful actors. The film has a basic riseandfall structure and McGinty's fall is truly heartbreaking. The Great McGinty deserves to be up there with Sturges' other masterpieces. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "The early 1940s was for some reason an extraordinary time for great debuts  eg CITIZEN KANE THE MALTESE FALCON CABIN IN THE SKY  and if THE GREAT MCGINTY is not quite in that class it gives ample evidence of why Preston Sturges would go on to have the best Hollywood career of the 1940s.  It is remarkably assured often outrageously funny and even at this stage genuinely subversive  its only problem is rather too little plot when the best Sturges films overload in the thing until they burst.What is surprising about this film is its violence.  Not just physical violence which is often farcical but real  that climactic assassination attempt is no joke  but in terms of words politics relationships showmanship the American way of life.  This is a great film about American politics free of MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON's capracant the very benevolence with which Sturges treats his caricatures and monsters doesn't make the system they operate any less rotten.While the war against tyranny rages in Europe a very different fascism operates in th US which is almost cheerily Irish in its backslapping humility of ambition.  There are no huge murderous ideals no dazzling uniforms no dense inflamatory tracts just some typical Americans  immigrants who  have made a fortune the Boss's rehearsed memories of poverty must surely have influenced the Pythons  helping their friends out. In fact it is almost the mirror opposite of a totalitarian state like Germany where one party is embodied in one highly visible man here one unseen puppetmaster runs all the parties but the result is the same.  Like in Germany fascism is embodied in its profuse construction the sterile useless monuments to power but whereas Hitler was creating a stable Reich that would last a thousand years the Boss's project is in continual unstable flux having to be torn down rebuilt again keeping the circle of profiteering gerrymandering and corruption going.  This lack of a cohesive centre however is the project's undoing as it spirals out of his grasp  the Boss could not have survived in inflexibly disciplined Germany but flourishes in a Darwinian 'free'market environment he being the fittest this however necessitates unwelcome competition.In the midst of all this is McGinty's rise and fall.  What's wonderful about McGinty the tramp at the beginning is his absence of all hypocrisy.  Far from being embarrassed or dehumanised by his need to continually scavenge and scrounge he accepts it as a necessity but doesn't allow it erase his dignity  much of the early comedy comes from bullies missing the distinction.  Another great thing is his complete lack of redemption  this is not a sweet Hollywood fable about a poor man who becomes rich or a horrible man who becomes nice.  After his brief lapse of conscience which has more to do with sexual desire and the need for his hardly blameless wife's approval he remains splendidly brutally misanthropically unreconstructed.  It is possible that his whole narrative is pure Blarney as might his wonderful story about the glory days of child labour in unconscious imitation of the Boss' own mythologising of self and past.  This doesn't make his acquiring a family any the less touching or delightful  one of the film's bitter insights is that the very nature of American politics  supposedly deeply conservative  is divisive individualistic antithetical to the family.  The not so little tramp might rise to become a gangster stooge governor but the tenements are still rotting.  Sturges has great fun mocking the piety of dogooders in ivory towers.The payoff though raucous is surprisingly bleak its tacit despair matching the disturbing opening suicide attempt and is full of rupture and doubt emphasising the element of play and showmanship that now infests US politics.  It is often said that because comedy directors must shoot plainly to foreground comic content they cannot be great directors.  This may be true but Sturges' mastery in his first film is astonishing especially for a writer with all the vices that implies.  In the first sequence we get a traditional shot of a woman on prominent display  we are invited to gaze at our leisure.  Disconcertingly she returns the gaze doing her own looking indifferent to us  the film is full of anticonventional surprises like this including some distancing protoAntonionian shots of the mayor's big new house exposing the emotional cost of McGinty's journey.  The comedy is interlaced with montages slapstick surrealism the wonderful dog! nonsense nonsequiters and explosions of comic activity that are like frenzied opera ensembles.  Sturges would master these elements further in his later films including at least three of the decade's ten best.  But for the moment enjoy.".

Another great thing is his complete lack of redemption  this is not a sweet Hollywood fable about a poor man who becomes rich or a horrible man who becomes nice.  After his brief lapse of conscience which has more to do with sexual desire and the need for his hardly blameless wife's approval he remains splendidly brutally misanthropically unreconstructed.  It is possible that his whole narrative is pure Blarney as might his wonderful story about the glory days of child labour in unconscious imitation of the Boss' own mythologising of self and past.  This doesn't make his acquiring a family any the less touching or delightful  one of the film's bitter insights is that the very nature of American politics  supposedly deeply conservative  is divisive individualistic antithetical to the family.  The not so little tramp might rise to become a gangster stooge governor but the tenements are still rotting.  Sturges has great fun mocking the piety of dogooders in ivory towers.The payoff though raucous is surprisingly bleak its tacit despair matching the disturbing opening suicide attempt and is full of rupture and doubt emphasising the element of play and showmanship that now infests US politics.  It is often said that because comedy directors must shoot plainly to foreground comic content they cannot be great directors.  This may be true but Sturges' mastery in his first film is astonishing especially for a writer with all the vices that implies.  In the first sequence we get a traditional shot of a woman on prominent display  we are invited to gaze at our leisure.  Disconcertingly she returns the gaze doing her own looking indifferent to us  the film is full of anticonventional surprises like this including some distancing protoAntonionian shots of the mayor's big new house exposing the emotional cost of McGinty's journey.  The comedy is interlaced with montages slapstick surrealism the wonderful dog! nonsense nonsequiters and explosions of comic activity that are like frenzied opera ensembles.  Sturges would master these elements further in his later films including at least three of the decade's ten best.  But for the moment enjoy.";

Heydt begins to launch his sad tale of having been a reputable bank clerk who in a moment of madness betrayed the public ran off with the dough and now finds no reason to live.Donlevy brushes him off. Reputable bank clerk? Donlevy was a state governor.A flashback takes us to Donlevy some years ago. He's a bum in line for a soup kitchen. Boys and girls soup kitchens were wellknow places where during the Great Depression viz. October 1929 the unemployed the wastrels the miscreants could get a free hand out. A lowlevel functionary of the wimpy mayor William Demarest picks Donlevy out of the crowd explains to him that the mayor needs a couple of extra votes see? Now many of the mayor's usual voters happen to be dead but that's no reason to deprive the mayor of their support. All Donlevy has to do is to go to a voting place say Hello Bill and the superintendent will allow him to vote for the mayor then give him a ticket stub which will entitle Donlevy to two dollars upon his return to the office.Donlevy is a tough and ambitious guy. He runs from voting place to voting place shaking hands saying Hello Bill! and collects 37 ticket stubs. The total is seventyfive dollars. That's a lot of money during the Great Depression op. cit.. The Boss Akim Tamiroff who runs the mayor's campaign as well as the mayor himself is duly impressed and hires Donlevy as a political goon. He promotes him to the role of enforcer whose job is to go out and collect money for the protection racket and beat up those who prove truculent.Soon Donlevy is sporting a big cigar and a checked suit so repugnant in appearance that it would be doing the sighted world a favor to burn it at the stake.In a few years Donlevy has proved so cooperative and so effective that he is now an Alderman  or a Selectman or Councilman or something I get them all mixed up. Then the wimpy mayor is kicked out and Donlevy elected in is place. And he does a grand job of taxing the public and hiring The Boss's favorite friends as contractors. He builds bridges and dams where there is no need for bridges and dams. Everybody agrees he's doing a grand job especially Donlevy despite his frequent fist fights with The Boss.They plan to run him for governor too but they need him to have a wife to fill out his resume so they force him into a marriage de convenance with his secretary. He's elected governor according to plan but well  cherchez la femme to continue these Anuran intonations. Donlevy and the notunappealing secretary fall in love. She reforms him. He spills the beans on The Boss but in doing so exposes himself to all sorts of criminal charges and he beats it out of town.Back to the framing story. By this time JeanLouis Heydt is sobered up and fascinated and has rethought his life. Maybe his descent into criminality hasn't been so bad after all. Donlevy tells the janitor to take care of Heydt. The janitor is The Boss. Donlevy and The Boss get into a fight.This isn't Preston Sturges's funniest movie I don't think but it's certainly one of his most outrageous. In Frank Capra's movies there was always a sentimental ending in which the hero was redeemed the evildoers remorseful and the public realized the hero's worth. Not here. Donlevy has had just one moment of madness like Heydt in which he brought the corrupt temple down around his head. He's lost his family without the slightest sign of grief. He's as pugnacious as ever. He's probably had moments in which if it were anatomically possible he would kick himself in his own rear for having turned ethical.It was Sturges' first real movie as writer and director and it's a fine introduction to his short iconoclastic career.".

Tamiroff pays off people to vote for his candidates and in the mayoral election finds himself up against drifter Brian Donlevy who impresses him with his smartaleck responses to every threat Tamiroff and his men make towards him. Realizing that this tough act is real and can be used to his advantage Tamiroff makes Donlevy owner and when the next election comes up for grabs it is Donlevy on the front burner. A great candidate must have a great wife supporting him so Tamiroff's secretary Muriel Angelus suggests a marriage of convenience. It will kill two bird with one ballot she realizes as it will give her a father for her children and pretty soon they are living in the mayor's mansion with Tamiroff's lightbulb of a brain going off as he sees the Governor's chair in Donlevy's future and a lot more power for him.This fasttalking political comedy rivals the same year's His Girl Friday with its quick thinking tricksters who can manipulate at will and come off smelling like a rose. Donlevy a veteran at playing both heavies and heroes is a combination of both here and as his reputation in politics arises the former drifter realizes that he can do some good something that Tamiroff isn't at all in favor of. Power corrupts and even a John Doe like Donlevy seems to be at first can be consumed with the evil that men do when given the opportunity to make laws while breaking others at the same time.Preston Sturges had been in the movie business for a decade as a screenwriter when he got the chance to direct his first movie with this delicious political spoof that targeted local politics rather than the White House or other Washington D.C. political figures. Usually in these movies local politicians were typecast as buffoons under the thumb of ruthless money men and more often than not dumber than a box of rocks. That's not the case for Donlevy and he gives Tamiroff a run for his money. Both men deliver the goods in the acting department even if their characters are both amoral. Among the memorable aspects of this film is the storytelling method set in a Caribbean bar where bartender Donlevy tells a suicidal man the story of a politician's rise and fall from grace. Of course telling this story doesn't ring as true as seeing it unfold and for the audience that's where the pleasure comes in. It's obvious from the time that Donlevy and Angelus meet that their marriage of convenience will eventually become a real one and when Angelus prepares the mansion for his instantly created family this results into a comical scene where a drunken and celebrating Donlevy trips over all of the redecorating props left in his way as he staggers to bed. As Preston Sturges became famous as a director he created a stable of character players who were featured in the majority of his films. Two of those players are featured here. William Demarest and Jimmy Conlin both had lengthy associations with Sturges their comical skills always adding amusement to the atmosphere. Sturges like Frank Capra sold his projects simply based upon his name because audiences knew that they would be getting a slice of life that they could relate to rather than Hollywood fantasy about what studio executives thought life should be. Reality with a bit of whimsy and tongue in cheek made Sturges and Capra films stand out a bit more than the usual films and that's what made their films a bit more special.".

	schema:reviewBody "Snow White elated fable with an early 1940s touch.  This modern day Snow White is riddled with lingo commonly spoken by people in early 1940s America.  Instead of being a pure and innocent woman as in the original version this Snow White is a nightclub singer with dubious associations to a known gangster.  Also the character played by Gary Cooper is both Prince Charming and head dwarf rolled into one.Feels more like a Billy Wilder film than a Howard Hawks feature.  This is because of certain characteristics throughout the story like its zanniness which is a fixture of Billy Wilder's comedies.  Also includes a satiric element so importantly featured in most of Billy Wilder's directorial work. Skillfully written by Billy Wilder a filmmaker with a knack for creating humorous situations out of everyday life.Ball of Fire1941 is the major blue print for Billy Wilder's late 1950s comedy masterpiece Some Like It Hot1959.  It deals with someone who has to blend with a crowd she doesn't usually hang out with to avoid trouble which was the basic premise for Some Like It Hot1959.  The plot for Ball of Fire1941 where Sugarpuss O'Shea finds sanctuary in a male filled world is the perfect opposite of Some Like It Hot1959 where the two male characters blend in a female dominated band.  Sugurpuss O'Shea and the two male characters of Some Like It Hot1959 are involved in nightclub work though in different jobs.Barbara Stanwyck is awe striking gorgeous for the part of Sugarpuss O'Shea. She belongs in a long line of beautiful and talented actressess who dazzles the big screen with presence in Howard Hawks films.  Barbara Stanwyck in this film is a sensuous kitten and tough thinking woman.  A warmup for Stanwyck's most sensual performance on film in Double Indemnity1944.No Howard Hawks motion picturewith few exceptions goes through a story without including some kind of romantic chemistry and romantic conflict. Professor Potts and Sugarpuss O'Shea are opposites personality wise yet connect because of Potts naive but joyful look at life.  What wins Sugarpuss's heart is Professor Potts clumsy and gentle nature which is quite a contrast to her gangster boyfriend.  The romantic chemistry of the two lacks the hardboiled edge of the BogartBacall films by Howard Hawks which is a refreshing change here.The classic screwball comedy that was extremely popular during the decades of the 1930s and 1940s.  Ball of Fire1941 is part of Howard Hawks screwball comedy period when he contributed to the sub genre with comical and witty portrayals of everyday life.  Matches the rapid fire dialogue of His Girl Friday1941 with the sultriness of The Big Sleep1946.  Ball of Fire1941 puts smiles on faces with priceless moments of laughter.Sugarpuss O'Shea is a typically strong Hawks female character who overwheims the film's hero with her flamboyant manners.  The name Sugarpuss suggests something that is alluring and sweet.  The inspiration for the person of Sugarpuss O'Shea was Mistress of Bugsy Siegal Virginia Sugar Hill. Sugarpuss O'Shea bar none is the most alluring female character in a Howard Hawks movie.Well rounded performances are turned out by the majority of the cast.  The actors who play Professor Potts associates excell in their eccentric performances.  Nice for a change to see Gary Cooper play a person who is awkward intellegent and romantic.  Dan Duryea adds a touch of dry comic relief as a gangster thug.Amusing to see six grown men behave in manners akin to an adolescent the minute Sugarpuss O'Shea walks into their lives.  The scenes where Professor Potts goes on the street to learn of some street slang to add to his and associates encyclopedia is a masterstroke in editing.  The moment near the end where Potts tells the gangster boyfriend of Sugarpuss to Put up your dukes is a hirilous moment in the film.  His Girl Friday1940 is still the best screwball comedy Howard Hawks ever did but Ball of Fire1941 is a close second.Ball of Fire1941 comprises of some fine cinematography by Gregg Toland whose creative eye lended a hand to the monumental camera work of Citizen Kane released during the same year.  Early in the nightclub scene is an uncredited cameo by Elisha Cook Jr.  Most of the time an excellent film is marked by excellent direction and Ball of Fire1941 is no exception. Lighthearted and sentlementle romantic comedy that belongs to an era when films were done a certain way.".

	schema:reviewBody "A silly farce of a story that works.  The elderly academians are stereotypically perfect.  Gary Cooper does his aww shucks naive signature performance in a worthy role.  Barbara Stanwyck is always one hot mama.  Great chemistry between the street smart Stanwyck character and the shy bashful Cooper.  A later version with Danny Kaye falls flat.  Instead of slang they are researching music.  Great musical cameo's but the four star rated 10 version is the original.  I always thought Kaye's brand of humor more suited to children.  The original is funny and cute the remake seems like leftover pieces squeezed together to fit a preestablished mold.  It lacks charm stick with the real thing...THIS ONE!!!".

	schema:headline " A Joyful Culture Clash";
	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks' Ball of Fire is a a sly urban updating of the SnowWhite fairy tale as well as an effervescent look at the fertile potential of clashing cultures. Stanwyck's Sugarpuss O'Shea is fasttalking and sexy a showgirl who bewitches Gary Cooper's English professor with her invigorating vocabulary as well as her dishy ankles. Cooper's Professor Bertram Potts is a young stuffed shirt selfentombed in a fusty academic cloister where he and 7 other reclusive intellectuals hammer away at writing an encyclopedia. Sugarpuss invades the hermitage with a bright modern femininity she is bold playful and selfpossessed reviving the inert libidos and general joie de vivre of the whole bashful fraternity. In one delightful scene she instructs the clumsy inexperienced older men in a bracing conga line. Foxy Stanwyck and an impressive crew of consummate character actors bring great humor and sweetness to the kind of scene that in other hands might become merely corny. Though Sugarpuss rejuvenates the men with the energy of youth she requires a different kind of rejuvenation. As the film reminds us detached vitality is what make a shark a shark. The academic brotherhood may be stale and lonely but they are openhearted and loyal. Unlike Sugarpuss' calculating gangster boyfriend played slickly by Dana Andrews Professor Potts is tender and thoughtful. Most importantly the young Pottsy as Sugarpuss calls him is also trusting enough to look foolish. In Howard Hawks' films making a fool of oneself is often linked to the experience of real love. Being guileless enough to be undone by genuine emotion is proof of valor. Both boyish and stiff Cooper is pitch perfect here. As he falls for Sugarpuss his face reveals all staid shyness competes with impassioned delight. We root for him.But being sweet and genuine aren't enough. This is a film about essential combinations passion and intellect sweetness and vigor.It's not until Potts avers his PHYSICAL passion for Sugarpuss that her heart really gives over. Later he must engage in fisticuffs surely the first of his life with the smug gangster. Despite amusingly nerdy preparationhe studies a hardbound guide to pugilism the actual battle awakens his animal instincts. His earlier effete intellectualism is now fully redeemed.Hawks' film is unequivocal Without lusty physical vigor we're entombed. Without tender intimate relationships we may as well jump in the ocean and swim the clock round.Two Notes1. This film is neither antiintellectual NOR antiworking class. It fully admires streetsmart vigor and creativity while also embracing the love of more formal learning. In our era a film like this is a bracing reminder that a fertile exchange is possible and improving for all involved.2. This is the kind of role that MAINSTREAM cinema used to provide actresses smart tough edgy sexy and eloquent.".

	schema:reviewBody "What happens to an ivy tower atmosphere if it is invaded by a sexually alluring siren? Will it lead to events similar to the expulsion of Adam and Eve from their perfect cocoon of the Garden of Eden? But the sin of Adam and Eve was tasting of the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. The eight professors in the ivy tower already have all the known knowledge of the world  their only problem is trying to dispense that knowledge within a three year deadline. Will they now miss that deadline? That is the situation of Howard Hawk's comedy Ball Of Fire one of the two great comedies with The Lady Eve that Barbara Stanwyck made at Paramount in 1941. People who think of Stanwyck as the dramatic equal of Davis and Hepburn only think of her in films like Stella Dallas Baby Face Double Indemnity or Sorry Wrong Number. Nobody denies Stanwyck's abilities as a fine dramatic actress but she was terrific too in comedies and it is interesting that her two finest comedies showcase her as a sexually alluring comedian. Katherine Sugarpuss O'Shea is a nightclub entertainer who is also the girlfriend of mob boss Joe Lilac Dana Andrews in a rare villainous role. Joe is having trouble with the District Attorney of New York City Addison Richards who is trying to crack a murder that may be linked to the mobster. It turns out that Sugarpuss can cement the case so Joe needs to hide his girlfriend...and maybe marry her if they marry she can't testify against her husband. He sends his two henchmen Duke Pastrami Dan Duryea and Asthma Anderson Ralph Peters to tell her to lay low...but where? Earlier that evening Sugarpuss got a visit from a Professor Bertram Potts Gary Cooper who needs her knowledge of street vernacular for an article he is writing in an encyclopedia on the subject of slang. Although she initially rejected his request for help she now finds it fits nicely into the needs of her boyfriend Joe. So she turns up at the building in Manhattan that Potts and seven colleagues Richard Haydn Aubrey Mather Tully Marshall Oscar Homolka Leonid Kinski Harry Travers and S.Z. Sakall have been living at for nearly a decade while working on this major encyclopedia for a foundation. That is the bare bones setup for this film one of Howard Hawks best comedies. Like His Gal Friday and I Was A Male War Bride Hawks makes his female lead fully capable at being a match or more than a match for the male characters. If Cary Grant's newspaper editor Walter Burns did connive and scheme against Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson she gave him as good as he gave her until circumstances played into his hands. The situation is the same here except that Sugarpuss is like a breath of youth and fresh air to Cooper and the seven older professors so that for all their book learning they lack a certain amount of common sense in dealing with the charming singer. She manages to compromise them from the start establishing a room for herself in their headquarters building that the foundation never made plans for.Not everyone is taken in Kathleen Howard the housekeeper Mrs. Bragg finds out the truth from a newspaper and almost ruins Sugarpuss' schemes. But what is worse perhaps is the slow realization by Sugarpuss that the square geeky Bertram is a decent guy  and a better boyfriend than Joe. Which sort of gums up the works for Joe and his schemes and Joe is not the sort to like his schemes to be gummed up at all.Samuel Goldwyn produced Ball Of Fire and since he did he got a first rate director and cast together. Stanwyck appears to have been third choice for Sugarpuss Lucille Ball was supposed to play the role but was dropped when Stanwyck became available  she might have carried it off for she played a similar role in The Big Street opposite Henry Fonda a few years later. One wonder is Hawks originally planned for Grant in the lead one could see him as the expert on English who is a naive professor  similar to his anthropologist in Bringing Up Baby. But Goldwyn made several films with Cooper and probably pushed for that leading man. Cooper shows enough naivet in his performance to make his discovery of love all the sweeter. The real joy that he expresses when he realizes that Stanwyck favors him over Andrews is rather touching even though it is presented at a moment of danger to Cooper and several others.As for the supporting cast they are all good. Duryea is properly insolent and dumb as the hoodlum Pastrami. Allen Jenkins is a garbage man seeking knowledge for pecuniary gain quiz show answers. The professors are individually cute particularly Homolka driving with an outofdate driver's license from 1906 but insisting Teddy Roosevelt thought his driving bully and Haydn the only one of the professors to have ever married who proves a sentimental type he carries his dead wife's hair around in a locket. One also notes Mary Field as Miss Totten the daughter of the wealthy inventor who created the foundation who despite the wise words of her lawyer Charles Lane keeps giving the professors more time to finish their work because she is sweet on Cooper. We last see that young lady enjoying a chase sequence  it was more fun than she ever had experienced before. Finally there is a nice sequence where Stanwyck demonstrates her voice by singing Drum Boogie to the accompaniment of Gene Krupa and his band. She also with the seven elderly professors dances the conga. Stanwyck rarely appeared in musicals I can only recall Lady Of Burlesque off hand so it is nice to see her show her singing and her dancing here as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "1941 may very well have been Gary Cooper's career year. His film performances that year are among his best the Oscar winning Sergeant York Frank Capra's classic Meet John Doe and this sparking comedy Ball of Fire. However it was Barbara Stanwyck who snagged an Oscar nomination for this film with her portrayal of sassy nightclub singer Sugarpuss O'Shea. Stanwyck lost however to Joan Fontaine in Suspicion.A whole lot of talent went into the making of this film besides the two leads. Howard Hawks worked from a script by Billy Wilder and his writing partner Charles Brackett. And Hawks put together a superb list of supporting players including seven of our finest character actors to be Cooper's professorial colleagues Henry Travers Leonid Kinskey Aubrey Mather Oscar Homolka S.Z. Sakall Tully Marshall and making his film debut Richard Haydn.These eight cloistered academicians are working off a grant to create some kind of ultimate encyclopedia. Cooper's specialty is the English language. A garbageman played by Allen Jenkins awakens him to a whole generation of new slang terms he hasn't heard. Cooper ventures out into the world and meets a variety of people and hears a whole batch of new expressions. His wanderings take him to a nightclub where he hears Stanwyck singing with Gene Krupa's band.Stanwyck's just filled with all the new hep jive talk but she's also ducking a grand jury subpoena to testify against her boy friend gangster Dana Andrews. She decides a good place to hide might just be the house where all these professors are quartered.It's quite a mismatch scholarly and shy Cooper and brazen Stanwyck In fact Hawks modeled Cooper's Bertram Potts on the character Cary Grant played in Bringing Up Baby which Hawks also directed. Cooper was as successful as Grant in breaking his stereotype though he never quite got the physical comedy down the way Cary did.Still Ball of Fire is a great big ball of amusement. I'm surprised there hasn't been a remake of this recently. Danny Kaye did a remake called A Song Is Born later in the decade with Kaye being a music professor instead. But I can see the possibilities of a remake here with this group of academicians putting together a Wikipedia like encyclopedia or even an ultimate search engine for the internet like Google.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ball of Fire is a real 'screwball' comedy and it being directed by Howard Hawks who made arguably the best one of all His Girl Friday ups the stakes just a bit. Not only that but it was one of Billy Wilder's first projects on a screenplay and his sharp wit comes through in almost every scene that needs it. And more than that when the movie needs to be romantic without any frills it really is. At the center of the craziness that becomes the story mostly towards the end and early on and a little in the middle is a story that we know is formulaic that a woman who is already attached if not quite yet hitched to someone else falls into an unlikely situation with another man and the two suddenly become really close the man first and then the woman but its the chemistry between a sexy preDouble Indemnity Barbara Stanwyck with conservative Gary Cooper.If ultimately it doesn't have the machinegun energy of His Girl Friday then again few movies do it makes up for it with a fun premise that Hawks and Wilder ride out logically as far as comedy premises can go. It's about seven professors and their leader professor played by Cooper who for years have been writing an encyclopedia and are coming close to the end... except for a snag  slang words. The old guys and intellectuals haven't a clue as to what words like Boogie and sugarpuss mean until they get a few people off the street to tell them. That and a nightclub singer Stanwyck on the run from the cops after she gets unwittingly and unfairly mixed up in a murder plot with her fiance. So she shacks up with Cooper and his fellow profs and it becomes Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with the twist that the girl this time is a lot more wily and tempting while the men are... old professor types who know almost everything except the human heart.But Hawks makes twist on his own premise as he goes along too. We see the natural progression of the plot of Cooper quickly falling in love with Stanwyck's advances all fake at first just so she can stay at the house and then little by little she falls for him too or at least feels so guilty about what she's doing to see the old geezers as real people instead of obstacles. There are a few key scenes that break the mold of the comedic antics some of which like Stanwyck showing the old men how to dance is hilarious and memorable one is the bachelor dinner between the professors when the one professor played by Richard Haydn talks about his marriage from many years before and it becomes genuinely tender and sincere not played for laughs certainly not when they're all singing the song Gienevive. The other scene is when Cooper walks into the wrong room thinking it's a professor and not his future wife and asks for advice about what to do as he loves her and isn't sure about himself. It's all shot in dark with a few specific lighting touches and it's about perfect.The ensemble is entertaining from the old men with their various sometimes interchangeable personalities to the filmnoir knockoffs playing the henchmen of Joe Lilac and there are many lines and moments that upon a repeat viewing should become even quotable. It could be said that it's slightly dated in some of its approach to tradition vs. the titillating but it never loses its sense of humor all the way up to the climax. Oh and it also happens to feature one of the best nightclub music scenes in the movies with Gene Krupa and his band doing Drum Boogie first in its usual form a fantastic drum solo at the end and then a variation on it with Krupa performing the song in a huddle of people with matchsticks on a matchbox. A small masterpiece of music in the middle of very good romantic comedy.".

So she shacks up with Cooper and his fellow profs and it becomes Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with the twist that the girl this time is a lot more wily and tempting while the men are... old professor types who know almost everything except the human heart.But Hawks makes twist on his own premise as he goes along too. We see the natural progression of the plot of Cooper quickly falling in love with Stanwyck's advances all fake at first just so she can stay at the house and then little by little she falls for him too or at least feels so guilty about what she's doing to see the old geezers as real people instead of obstacles. There are a few key scenes that break the mold of the comedic antics some of which like Stanwyck showing the old men how to dance is hilarious and memorable one is the bachelor dinner between the professors when the one professor played by Richard Haydn talks about his marriage from many years before and it becomes genuinely tender and sincere not played for laughs certainly not when they're all singing the song Gienevive. The other scene is when Cooper walks into the wrong room thinking it's a professor and not his future wife and asks for advice about what to do as he loves her and isn't sure about himself. It's all shot in dark with a few specific lighting touches and it's about perfect.The ensemble is entertaining from the old men with their various sometimes interchangeable personalities to the filmnoir knockoffs playing the henchmen of Joe Lilac and there are many lines and moments that upon a repeat viewing should become even quotable. It could be said that it's slightly dated in some of its approach to tradition vs. the titillating but it never loses its sense of humor all the way up to the climax. Oh and it also happens to feature one of the best nightclub music scenes in the movies with Gene Krupa and his band doing Drum Boogie first in its usual form a fantastic drum solo at the end and then a variation on it with Krupa performing the song in a huddle of people with matchsticks on a matchbox. A small masterpiece of music in the middle of very good romantic comedy.";

	schema:headline " how ball of fire compare to other screwball comedies";
	schema:reviewBody "Ball of Fire was directed and written by three of the best at their genre. Howard Hawks was a notable director of screwball comedies and the team of Wilder and Brackett wrote a number of comedies including Ernst Lubitsch's funniest film Ninotchka 1939. Wilder would also later become once of cinematic history's greatest comedic and dramatic directors with The Apartment and Some Like it Hot.In Hollywood Genres Howard Schatz writes The Screwball comedy dominated Depressionera screen comedy and provided that period's most significant and engaging social commentary 151. Schatz suggests that screwball comedies were not just escapist fare for Depressionera audiences but they remedied their shattered dreams that their poverty and discrepancies in wealth couldn't be overcome. One important element for this remedy to work was that there had to be a love story that crossed class boundaries usually with the woman as poor but more socially apt and the man as the opposite.In Ball of Fire Gary Cooper isn't so much rich as he is distinguished in the world of academia. He is a lexicologist in charge of an encyclopedia project with eight other professors each in charge of a different field of knowledge. The fact that the other professors are twice his age highlights just how smart he is in his field. Barbara Stanwyck an excellent comic foil is a nightclub singer whose boyfriend is a gangster on the run from the police. She comes into contact with Cooper through his work. He is doing a section for his encyclopedia on slang and enlists her to help him and needing to hide from the cops she accepts. This setup is very interesting because while Gary Cooper is not rich he's an expert on the language of the rich in a sense. In turn Stanwyck's character Sugarpuss O'Shea is lowerclass only through his standards. In terms of actual material wealth O'Shea is richer than Cooper because her boyfriend has stolen large amounts of money while he has worked nine years into his uncompleted encyclopedia. Also Sugarpuss O'Shea has absolutely no academic credentials but suddenly becomes of use to him as an expert on slang through her lowerclass background. Many twists on the traditional form of the screwball comedy are thrown into the story adding enough complexity to the relationship that it becomes unclear who really has the upperhand. Moreso the language theme presents wealth as an illusion which validates the main message of screwball comedies as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder were so similarboth had a cynical sense of humor both directors could master any genre both occasionally worked with the same actors including Bogart Monroe Stanwyck and Cooper. This is the two masters' only joint collaboration Wilder wrote Hawks directed and though Wilder complained about his script being misinterpreted as he usually did before breaking out as a director of his own scripts the result is one of the most delightfully entertaining comedies ever made.Bertram Potts Gary Cooper and 7 other professors are working on the definitive encyclopedia that will most definitely give substantial space to the man who invented the electric toaster. Just when they believe they are on the home stretch Potts realizes he knows little to noting about modern slang and sets out on a research expedition where he runs into Sugarpuss O'Shea a captivating burlesque dancer. When Sugarpuss's gangster boyfriend Joe Lilac Dana Andrews gets into a jam Sugarpuss must hide out to avoid a subpoena and finds refuge at the professors' house where worlds collide to hilarious results. If it's possible this film is both childish and mature at the same time it's based on a fairy tale and the professors' acting is animated yet Wilder's script is wild with double entendres and innuendos. It's a brilliant combination that blends swimmingly. Likewise only Charlie Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS could more perfectly blend slapstick with sentiment. Humor from either Hawks or Wilder isn't the least bit surprising but the moments of genuine tenderness between Sugarpuss and Potts is unexpected from the two directors who were known for their cynicism. Even more surprising is to find genuine suspense in some moments such as a perfectly edited sequence in which the professors are taken hostage and must use their knowledge to get out to go any further would be spoiling the scene. And I'll throw one last shock your way while most comedies aren't usually raved for their photography there's pretty amazing cinematography by Gregg Toland who famously revolutionized deep focus with CITIZEN KANE. Using deepfocus and a noirlike sentimentality with shadows and light there are moments that are disarmingly sensational.Gary Cooper had worked with Howard Hawks just earlier with SERGEANT YORK. Cooper won Best Actor and Hawks received his only Oscar nomination in his long and brilliant career but the film's fared badly over the decades and both should've received their accolades for this film. Cooper has more of a challenge in this film and like Cary Grant's similar role in Hawks' BRINGING UP BABY it could've been so easy for him to break character but Cooper keeps a straight face even when it looks like he's having a blast. He's also very convincing as a socially awkward scholar who's constantly correcting other people's grammar. Before I saw Barbara Stanwyck in this film I found it incredible that the Oscar nomination she received in 1941 wasn't for her wickedly sexy turn as a con artist in Preston Sturges's comedic masterpiece THE LADY EVE but when I saw this I understood. Both roles are similar about a conniving woman who uses a dimwitted intellect and then falls in love to comedic results. I think she's a bit sharper in Sturges's film but her character is more likable in this film because it's obvious that she becomes a better person when transformed by love. In fact BALL OF FIRE is possibly the sweetest paean of falling for a nerd He looks like a giraffe and I love him! and both characters truly evolve with love for each otherPotts is rejuvenated by Sugarpuss's pizazz and her hardened crust Stanwyck herself was a born New Yorker with a rough childhood which only adds to her perfect interpretation of Sugarpuss is melted by Pott's brain heart and eventual courage. In other words this is YumYum stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "Professor Bertram Potts Gary Cooper and his six assorted old oddballs who are trying to put together an encyclopedia are forced by hoodlums Dana Andrews Dan Duryea et al to take in Sugarpuss O'Shea Barbara Stanwyck and hide her from the police. Cooper and Stanwyck fall for each other and wind up getting married while the hoodlums are swept up by the authorities.This is a very funny movie with romantic undertones. It's not outrageously funny. It's not the Marx Brothers. The high Amusement Quotient is due mostly to the characters and the relationships between them. The romance lies in the development of characters.It's unnecessary and maybe self defeating to spell out the funny parts and the gags. So let me mention in passing a scene that isn't funny at all but rather touching. The seven dwarfs are sitting around a table drinking wine after dinner anticipating Cooper's marriage to Stanwyck tomorrow. Cooper is bemused by his own emotions and by the prospect of physical contact with a woman. Only one of the professors Robert Haydn was ever married and is now twentyfour years a widower. He offers Cooper advice from his own marital experiences and man it harks back generations. We went to the Catskills where we did some very pretty watercolors. And A wife is like a flower. We must wait for the petals to open. A bee too anxious to pollinate might spoil the bloom. Something like that anyway. Havelock Ellis was more straightforward than that. So was Tiny Tim.But after giving Cooper his fatherly advice Haydn takes out a locket and removes a lock of Genevieve's golden hair and the others begin to sing Genevieve and rather suddenly we realize the film has lost its comic tone and has turned rather effectively sentimenal as Haydn dabs a handkerchief at his cheek begs the others to sing it again and delicately leaves the table. Oh it's corny alright. Corny means old fashioned countrified  but it's not synonymous with 'baloney'. But Haydn's sentiment and the sympathy of the other tenderminded old clowns seems genuine enough. We know exactly what Haydn is feeling although the scene isn't overextended or overwritten. Once Haydn is gone the others shrug off the hopelessness of their ever having such a relationship and they lapse into a resigned but robust version of Gaudeamus Igitur. It may be Barbara Stanwyck's best role. She's unforgettable. In other films she often seems to be made of cast iron sexless and driven. Here she's light hearted and saucy. Best shot  Sugarpuss knocks unexpectedly on Potts' door and when he opens it she smiles like a T. rex her head tilted clicks her tongue and snaps her fingers and says Hi Pottsy old boy! and then tilts her head the other way and sweeps past him in this glittering gown sparkling with Gustav Klimt designer speckles. In a few moments she has him feeling her foot and looking down into her open mouth. Watch out Pottsy this babe has been known to bite. She's pretty foxy too sashaying around fluffing her long curly locks swinging her hips fomenting rebellion among this flock of troglodytic dodos teaching Cooper what yumyum is.A number of Hawks' movies derive their humor and sometimes their dramatic tension from the conflict between the cerebral cortex and the reptilian brain. The eggheads versus the naturals. And that's the case here. An ordinary viewer is more likely to cheer Cooper when he throws away his boxing book and tackles Dana Andrews swinging as recklessly as a kid in a schoolyard fight. Well we're all glad to see it finally happen. Yet I wonder if that's such a good lesson to learn. In addition to its other many functions the cerebral cortex has a prominent role in damping down the impulses generated by more primitive structures. That's what keeps us from murdering each other. It' nice that Cooper manages to let himself go but it's important to remember that the chief villain Dana Andrews a selfish murderer has no problem whatever letting himself go. I've always suspected that Hawks spent most of his career getting even with the college professors who gave him poor grades at Cornell though he spanks them only lightly here. Damned chrome domes. Come to think of it Hawks may have been a dropout but Dan Duryea managed somehow to graduate from Cornell.It's a truly funny movie and ought to appeal to people of varying ages genders and social strata.".

Best shot  Sugarpuss knocks unexpectedly on Potts' door and when he opens it she smiles like a T. rex her head tilted clicks her tongue and snaps her fingers and says Hi Pottsy old boy! and then tilts her head the other way and sweeps past him in this glittering gown sparkling with Gustav Klimt designer speckles. In a few moments she has him feeling her foot and looking down into her open mouth. Watch out Pottsy this babe has been known to bite. She's pretty foxy too sashaying around fluffing her long curly locks swinging her hips fomenting rebellion among this flock of troglodytic dodos teaching Cooper what yumyum is.A number of Hawks' movies derive their humor and sometimes their dramatic tension from the conflict between the cerebral cortex and the reptilian brain. The eggheads versus the naturals. And that's the case here. An ordinary viewer is more likely to cheer Cooper when he throws away his boxing book and tackles Dana Andrews swinging as recklessly as a kid in a schoolyard fight. Well we're all glad to see it finally happen. Yet I wonder if that's such a good lesson to learn. In addition to its other many functions the cerebral cortex has a prominent role in damping down the impulses generated by more primitive structures. That's what keeps us from murdering each other. It' nice that Cooper manages to let himself go but it's important to remember that the chief villain Dana Andrews a selfish murderer has no problem whatever letting himself go. I've always suspected that Hawks spent most of his career getting even with the college professors who gave him poor grades at Cornell though he spanks them only lightly here. Damned chrome domes. Come to think of it Hawks may have been a dropout but Dan Duryea managed somehow to graduate from Cornell.It's a truly funny movie and ought to appeal to people of varying ages genders and social strata.";

	schema:headline " Great wartime comedy with many nationalities";
	schema:reviewBody "Ball of Fire opened in the U.S. on Dec. 2 1941. Europe had been at war for more than a year and in just five more days Japan would bomb Pearl Harbor bringing the U.S. into the war. Hollywood made many comedies during the depression to help lift spirits and now it was doing the same thing to help ease tensions and lift the spirits on the home front. This wonderful comedy has several big name stars some music and rhythm by Gene Krupa and his band and a great supporting cast. That includes some of the best supporting actors of the time. Several were foreign born all from nations at war. One can imagine the emotion they must have felt. And how they may have viewed their profession as important for lifting the spirits of the Allies and the hopes of their people back home. The names of many characters are hilarious.Seven of the support cast are professors working with Gary Cooper who plays Prof. Potts. They include Oskar Homolka born in Vienna Austria as Prof. Gurkakoff S.Z. Cuddles Sakall from Budapest Hungary as Prof. Magenbruch Leonid Kinskey from St. Petersburg Russia as Prof. Quintana and three from England including Richard Hadyn as Prof. Oddly Henry Travers as Prof. Jerome and Aubrey Mather as Prof. Peagram. One was U.S.born  Tully Marshall as Prof. Robinson.The film has several other big name actors. Frequent leading man Dana Andrews plays the boss of the bad guys Joe Lilac. His gang includes Dan Duryea as Duke Pastrami and Ralph Peters as Asthma Anderson. Allen Jenkins is the garbage man. Ball of Fire received four Oscar nominations including best actress for Barbara Stanwyck as Sugarpuss O'Shea. It is a very funny film with much witty clever dialog. But this type of comedy may not be for everyone. Much of the humor develops around language and words. So those who don't like language and fun with words aren't likely to get much out of this film. But all others should enjoy it immensely. Some of the slang words in the script were a far stretch even for the time of the movie. In a late scene Duke Pastrami is talking to Sugarpuss Now meantime lay low and stay close to the Ameche. Sugarpuss Okay! The what? Pastrami The telephone. Later she uses it as a slang question to Prof. Potts whom she calls Pottsy. When he asks what that is she explains that it's the name of the inventor of the telephone. He interrupts to say that the inventor of the phone was Alexander  but she interrupts to explain that Ameche played the inventor in the movie. That was a 1939 biopic with Don Ameche Henry Fonda and Loretta Young. A nice little jab here at the intelligence of those Americans who learn their history from the movies. Here are some more funny lines and exchanges from the film. Sugarpuss picks up a book and says Oh Greek philosophy. I've got a set like this with a radio inside. She turns to Potts and says Well how do we start professor? You see this is the first time anybody moved in on my brain.Potts Living in this house cut off from the world I've lost touch. And it's inexcusable. That man talked a living language slang. I embalmed some dead phrases. 'Slang' as the poet Carl Sandberg has said 'is language which takes off its coat spits on its hands and goes to work.'Sugarpuss Who was that guy learned so much from watching an apple drop? Prof. Gurkakoff Isaac Newton 1642 to 1727 the law of gravity. Sugarpuss Yeah that's him. And I want you to look at me as another apple Professor Potts. Just another apple.Potts For four days we have been drifting Miss O'Shea. The needle of the compass no longer points to the magnetic pole. It points if I may say so to your ankle. I shall regret the absence of your keen mind. Unfortunately it is inseparable from an extremely distracting body.Sugarpuss Don't tell me the jive session has beat off without baby.Potts Miss O'Shea the construction 'on account of because' outrages every grammatical law. Sugarpuss So what? I came on account of because I couldn't stop thinking about you after you left my dressing room. On account of because I thought you were big and cute and pretty.Prof. Magenbruch I thought you meant to leave us in protest Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg A nurse does not quit her post when an epidemic reaches a crisis.Sugarpuss reads the inscription inside a ring Richard ill. Who's Richard ill? Potts Richard the Third.Joe Lilac on the phone Where are you? We're not down here to enjoy ourselves. This is a wedding.Sugarpuss Eight squirrelly cherubs right out of this world. Prof. Magenbruch Did you hear Potts? I'm a squirrelly cherub?Potts Now let's have it out. I made an ass of myself and I know it. Prof. Jerome Oh well we all have. Potts Yes but I was the lead donkey.Prof. Oddly a widower the past 20 years offers some courtship advice to Potts Being a botanist I find an astonishing parallel between a woman's heart and the wind flower or anemone nemorosa. Perhaps you know the plant how it waits for the warm sunshine and soft winds before it unfolds its petals. Sensitive and delicate. One rough impetuous bee can completely destroy the blooms.Prof. Magenbruch Did you  did you get the records? Prof. Peagram Well they were all out of 'Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar.' But I got 'Chicka Chicka Boom Boom' and 'Shoot the Sherbet to Me Herbert.'".

His performance is charming and won my heart in more than one scene. Barbara Stanwyck portrayed the selfish club singer using others for her advantage but she eventually softens. The real delights of the film were the seven elderly professors particularly Richard Haydn whose comical oneliners and stuffshirt demeanor keeps one laughing hysterically.This movie was by far one of the best I have seen for a long time cleverly combining elements of comedy romance and drama.".

Claudette Colbert thinks her marriage to Joel McCrea isn't working even though he doesn't think likewise. She thinks she's not a capable enough wife he thinks he's a failure as a man and husband. She takes off for Palm Beach to get a divorce despite all of his attempts to stop her. On the train to Florida she meets a wealthy tycoon who wants to marry her and give her everything she could possibly want but she realizes that what she really wants is her husband.This is all told with a lot of wit and flair. The early scenes with Colbert and McCrea drag and an extended bit of nonsense on the train involving the Ale and Quail Hunting Club is superfluous and not very funny. But once everyone shows up in Palm Beach the film becomes a delight and a bonus is added in the person of Mary Astor who plows on to the screen about half way through the film and decimates everyone in her path with her quicktongued and hilarious performance as a rich society lady with a lot of time on her hands and her sights set on Colbert's husband.What I liked about this film was that Colbert and McCrea don't seem to have a lot of chemistry in their early scenes together he seems so stiff and bland and you don't really blame her for wanting to get away. But after you've seen both of them with other people they seem so much more right for each other when they get back together and there's all this chemistry you didn't initially realize was there. I don't know if that's due to their performances the writing the directing or whether it was just a happy accident but it works beautifully.Grade A".

You just say Preston Sturges was a genius and this is his best film.Gerry Jeffers Claudette Colbert has decided that she needs to divorce her husband Tom Sturges regular Joel McCrea. Why? We're not quite sure. Perhaps she's looking for thrills perhaps she simply wants a partner who can pay the rent and perhaps she's truly come to believe that she no longer loves him. No matter. Her mind is made up and there's nothing Tom can do about it. Try as he might Gerry slips through his fingers and ends up on a train to Palm Beach the divorce capital of the world.Echoes of Some Like first appear on the train ride when Gerry finds herself unable to sleep do to the racket being caused by The Ale and Quail Club. It's bad enough when they start shooting out windows and what comes next... let's just say that it's a lot funnier than it would be if it happened in real life.Still Gerry makes it to Palm Beach in the company of nutty millionaire John D.

And spoil more of the plot for you I will not.Sturges was capable of operating in many modes responsible and patriotic Sullivan's Travels and outrageously madcap The Miracle of Morgan's Creek are two that come to mind. But Palm Beach shares its elegance wit and reserve with The Lady Eve in which con artist Barbara Stanwyck sets her sights on absentminded professor Henry Fonda. Even the mistaken identity plot is similar upon examination.Between the two Eve may end on a slightly more graceful note but Beach seems to be made with a bit more... well experience. Sturges seems at his most relaxed throughout the film and it does a world of good. The story is bogged down only by brief moments of racism early on. And leaving it's hard not to feel sunny and refreshed.For those in need of a vacation I recommend a stay at Palm Beach. And the rest of you should come along as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has been one of my favorites for thirty years since the Village Voice critics turned me on to Sturges. It's a loony world where loony things happen and it's important to realize that the central loony joke is that Claudette Colbert's Gerry gets things from men without having to put any effort into it at all. No she's not prostituting herself  she never trades anything for her prizes she just keeps on looking pretty. Joel McCrea with Colbert is sexy and just right. He's not supposed to be silly  he is the sane anchor in the chaos and the romantic leading man. Rudy Vallee  absolutely perfect deadpan delivery of some really great lines. Hurrah for the Ale and Quail Club for Toto and for the Wienie King.But the mystery  I have always believed that there is an unfinished story in here a movie that didn't get produced about the twins. It's almost like Palm Beach is a sequel to that movie. If you don't know that Gerry and Tom are twins the opening frantic sequences makes no sense at all as it is it is difficult to make sense of but this is the gist of it  Gerry and Tom's twins want Gerry and Tom Tom and Gerry want each other so in order to get married Gerry and Tom have to lock their twins in closets and run to their wedding. This means the unwanted twins must have been up to some business before the wedding but we never see any of it. Something's missing here and I think that is the flaw in Palm Beach Story. I have never been able to find out where this story element came from. Does anyone know?But still watch and enjoy this great movie over and over. There was no other like Preston Sturges  no one as honest or real. Or funny.".

No she's not prostituting herself  she never trades anything for her prizes she just keeps on looking pretty. Joel McCrea with Colbert is sexy and just right. He's not supposed to be silly  he is the sane anchor in the chaos and the romantic leading man. Rudy Vallee  absolutely perfect deadpan delivery of some really great lines. Hurrah for the Ale and Quail Club for Toto and for the Wienie King.But the mystery  I have always believed that there is an unfinished story in here a movie that didn't get produced about the twins. It's almost like Palm Beach is a sequel to that movie. If you don't know that Gerry and Tom are twins the opening frantic sequences makes no sense at all as it is it is difficult to make sense of but this is the gist of it  Gerry and Tom's twins want Gerry and Tom Tom and Gerry want each other so in order to get married Gerry and Tom have to lock their twins in closets and run to their wedding. This means the unwanted twins must have been up to some business before the wedding but we never see any of it. Something's missing here and I think that is the flaw in Palm Beach Story. I have never been able to find out where this story element came from. Does anyone know?But still watch and enjoy this great movie over and over. There was no other like Preston Sturges  no one as honest or real. Or funny.";

The performances are mostly spoton particularly the leads Claudette Colbert Joel McCrea Mary Astor and surprisingly the best Rudy Valle who is remarkably natural and sympathetic. SPOILER ALERT However the schtick really drags The Palm Beach Story down. The opening sequence shown with the credits and presented in pantomime reminiscent of the start of The Philadephia Story is thoroughly confusing yet is supposed to provide exposition. One could argue that all was explained at the end of the picture but even upon reviewing the opening after watching the entire film it still left me puzzled. For a plausible explanation see the Wikipedia article on The Palm Beach Story. Early on the schtick involving the Wienie King's poor hearing is tiresome and predictable yet it continues on and on. Later the raucousness of the Ale and Quail Hunting Club on the train is WAY over the top unbelievable unfunny grating and goes on for 1015 minutes.END OF SPOILERSWere it not for the above annoyances which unfortunately account for a significant portion of the movie I would have rated The Palm Beach Story higher as it does have its share of clever dialogue an unusual premise and gifted actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Palm Beach Story has a poor title but it's a hilarious movie by the sometimes cynical master of comedy Preston Sturges.  Palm comes a year after Sturges far lesser comedy The Lady Eve staring Stanwyck and a dull Henry Fonda.  The superior comedy Palm rivals the greatest screwballs like Bringing up Baby and The Awful Truth for sustained insanity and strength of characterization.In this screwball masterpiece the characters' flakiness is shared by the rest of their absurd world.  It climaxes in a fantastic scene set on a train where an Ale and Quale club goes on a drunken shooting spree forming a posse that tramps from car to car singing A hunting we will go.As Anthony Lane argues Palm presents a realist view of the prominence of sex and greed as motivating and blinding forces.  In a key scene Colbert gives a little speech about the look or the copulatory gaze that she's been getting from every man since she was 14.  This movie is slightly cynical and funnier for it's richness.  Comedy is set off against discussions of lost opportunity and youth.  Topic A is what runs the world of The Palm Beech Story but sometimes topic B money is temporarily more important.  After leaving her struggling husband Gerry gets prizes from any horny man she comes in contact with rent money from the regretful wiener king taxi rides a train ticket from hunters and dresses and rubies from a millionaire.  Also the Princess has a kept petman who tags along as she pursues new husbands.  Sturges shares with Wilder and Allen a slighlty cynical view of human nature.  As Lane points out they don't have a conservative Catholic view of the inherent selfishness and sinfulness of human kind but a liberal more Deweyan view of human potential slightly jaded from their experience. They are not without hope but aware of limitation.  Sturges is beyond naivete like many of his screwball compatriots and frankly examines weaknesses that others avoid or deny and he criticizes conventions that supposedly created a utopia in the 1950's.  This is one of the highlights of the screwball genre that illuminatingly explores like no other group of films life love gender sexuality and desire in 20th century America in an endearing and always fun manner.".

	schema:headline " Crazy comedy that lives in its own marvelous universe.";
	schema:reviewBody "As an example of screwball comedy this wacky film is at times almost breathless in it's storyline and dialogue. Colbert plays the wife of a frustrated inventor McCrea who decides to put her own happiness to one side in order to help him. She plans to divorce him marry a millionaire and then give McCrea the money he needs to get his idea off the ground. She heads off by train to Palm Beach Florida and encounters a quirky friendly magnate Vallee who seems to fit the bill. McCrea however is completely against the entire plan and is in hot pursuit of Colbert trailing her to the title locale but eventually becoming sidetracked by Vallee's voraciously manhungry sister Astor! Colbert is lovely and funny and game for all the various shenanigans of the plot. Her charm manages to gloss over some of the more unsavory elements of her plan as presented in the film. One memorably amusing scene has her attempting to borrow clothes from the female passengers of the train when hers are lost eventually concocting a real eyeopener as the maid says You can borrow my earrings....! McCrea has a pretty onedimensional role but again his charm goes a long way in selling the story. His most memorable bit is a flurried run through an apartment and hallway with his pajama bottoms falling victim to all the excitement. Vallee is endearingly goofy and sympathetic. He also gets to sing in one key scene. Just as a relay race needs a solid anchor bringing up the rear Astor pops in for the final third of the film and her vivacious motormouthed portrayal is a highlight of the movie. Scarcely taking a breath in between reams of dialogue she masterfully clips off several hilarious bon mots as she sets her considerable sights on McCrea. All of them are so likable within this mess that it seems as if there may be no way for the story to end happily yet it does in a fairly controversial ending! Though the four leads do a terrific job there are many other great turns by various character actors none more so than Dudley as The Weinie King. His appearance as a halfdeaf sausage entrepreneur puts the film on it's whackedout track right from the start. Newcomers to the film could almost be forgiven for thinking it's a sequel to an earlier comedy based on the unusual opening credits sequence but all is eventually explained. The film has a comforting innocence to it despite the potentially tasteless subject matter i.e.  a wife practically prostituting herself for her husband and is a beautiful glimpse into a time when movies looked good and earned their laughs without the blatant vulgarity that pervades most films today.".

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that Claudette Colbert can't make up her mind. In 1934's 'It Happened One Night' she was running from Miami to New York to get married. In 'The Palm Beach Story' she is running from New York to Miami to get a divorce.The Palm Beach Story is one of those great screwball comedies that can be watched over and over again. It tells the tale of a married couple played by Colbert and Joel McCrea who although still desperately in love with each other they don't exactly see eye to eye on how to manage to family finances.McCrea is a traditionalist i.e the man provides for his family and charity is not to be accepted as his pride would not allow it. Cobert on the other hand sees no harm in accepting innocent gratuities from admiring gentlemen in order to make ends meet.McCrea has dreams of building an innercity airport and requires 99000 for the venture and has to persuade a legitimate investor to throw in his lot. Colbert's plan completly barmy it is too is to convince her husband that she is no longer in love with him leave him and get a divorce find a millionaire to marry who will then give her anything she wants including the 99000 which she will then pass on to McCrea to build his airport and fulfil his dream. However McCrea has no idea of her intentions and genuinely believes that she no longer loves him and has walked out on him for good.Her sex appeal is evident for all to see and through the course of the movie she successfully utilises this sex appeal to negotiate a free taxi ride to the train station and then a free train ticket from New York to Miami courtesy of a group of drunken millionaires known as the Ale  Quail Club. When the AQ club get a bit too rowdy on their annual booze up and start innocently shooting up the trains bar Colbert seeks refuge in the sleeping cars and after trying to climb into a vacant upper birth she comes face to face or more correctly foot to face with mega rich yet mega dull Rudy Vallee.Vallee's performance is the main reason to watch this movie his character is absurd yet likable tight yet generous and smart yet stupid. It is through Vallee that some of the best one liners are delivered. It's a shame that the men most in need of a beating are enormous.Vallee is smitten and after taking Colbert on a multithousand dollar spending spree they take his private Yacht from Jacksonville to Miami. on reaching their destination they are met by Vallee's talkative and title mad sister Mary Astor and her companion Toto not a cute little dog as the name suggests but a foreign gentleman who has made himself her personal chapperone. McCrea has also managed to track down his estranged wife and is there to meet them. Colbert unable to tell Vallee the real reason why she left her husband has painted a non too pretty picture of her husband and to avoid fireworks hilariously introduces McCrea as her brother 'Capt McGlew'. Astor has also taken a shine to McCrea so jealousy starts to rear it's head from all parties involved.This movie is very enjoyable indeed and has all the hallmarks of what you would expect from a Preston Sturgess movie. It's also great to hear Rudy Vallee sing again and he is not so 'uphisown' that he doesn't mind becoming the butt of the jokes when everyone is closing their windows in hopes of drowning out his crooning.I will be the first to admit there were much better divorce based Screwball Comedies made around the same time such as Love Crazy with William Powell  Myrna Loy but The Palm Beach Story is an enjoyable flick and a brilliant way to spend 90 lazy minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy.".

Colbert unable to tell Vallee the real reason why she left her husband has painted a non too pretty picture of her husband and to avoid fireworks hilariously introduces McCrea as her brother 'Capt McGlew'. Astor has also taken a shine to McCrea so jealousy starts to rear it's head from all parties involved.This movie is very enjoyable indeed and has all the hallmarks of what you would expect from a Preston Sturgess movie. It's also great to hear Rudy Vallee sing again and he is not so 'uphisown' that he doesn't mind becoming the butt of the jokes when everyone is closing their windows in hopes of drowning out his crooning.I will be the first to admit there were much better divorce based Screwball Comedies made around the same time such as Love Crazy with William Powell  Myrna Loy but The Palm Beach Story is an enjoyable flick and a brilliant way to spend 90 lazy minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Enjoy.";

The Palm Beach Story is a cynical and unethical but dated screwball comedy by Preston Sturges.

The wonderful cast he put together for  The Palm Beach Story exceeds all expectations and made this a winning screwball comedy typical of the times.Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea made a fantastic couple. Both of the leading actors were excellent comedians they do amazing work together. The supporting cast is first rate. Mary Astor and Rudy Valee are excellent as the rich siblings falling in love with the estranged Jeffers. In minor roles Sig Arno Robert Dudley and the rest of the cast perform wonders and respond to Mr. Sturges' direction.The only things that don't work as well with the rest of the film are the prologue and the ending. The end seems to indicate that Preston Sturges was running out of ideas. The multiple weddings are a bit hard to accept as they don't seem real. The existence of a pair of twin siblings we knew nothing about while watching the film appear to have been added out of desperation and thus make an ending to accommodate both rich Hackensackers.As a curiosity note throughout the film Ms. Colbert is seen only on the right hand side of the screen because of her desire of being photographed from the left side only. This actress had the uncanny ability to change herself to that side of the screen without anyone realizing what she's doing. She might start with her whole face in front of the camera on the left hand side of the screen but she always does something to change places with whoever is playing opposite her and wind up with her left profile for us to see.Still this is one of the best films by Preston Sturges perhaps a notch behind Sullivan Travels and The Lady Eve.".

I think it says something very unflattering about that 1942 Hollywood in general Sturges in particular and the audiences who bought into this load. A good movie should not only be literate and technically competent but compelling and inspiring. Or at least funny. Measures to which this old flick hardly attains.

	schema:headline " Seeing it in its cinematic context";
	schema:reviewBody "One element of this film that shouldn't be ignored is that it like Sullivan's Travels and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek is a conscious lampooning of earlier movies from the 1930s. It takes a standard conventional plot from those movies and turns it on its ear. The same plot can be seen for example in the Paramount movie from 1931 Up Pops the Devil with Carole Lombard and Norman Foster who coincidentally was Claudette Colbert's first husband. In that movie a wife who still loves her husband wants to divorce him for his own good she thinks she's just a noose around his neck and once rid of her he'll become a success. It's set in the same upper crust of society as The Palm Beach Story with a millionaire suitor for the wife and a nymphomaniac girl for the husband. Here everything is played straight with as much pathos and melodrama being milked out of the situation as can be. In The Palm Beach Story though the same basic plot and characters are used but it's the comedic potential and wackiness of the situation that's emphasized to marvelous effect.The subplot with the twins glanced at in the beginning and end of the picture is another conscious lampooning of conventional movies here a lampooning of the structure of movies themselves of their conventional beginnings and endings. It's not meant to be taken seriously as McCrea's character casually says at the end it's all stuff for another movie. No words can be found to adequately praise Claudette Colbert's performance. Joel McCrea is good too as the prototypical wooden 1930s leading man. Rudy Vallee is absolutely hilarious as a momma's boy version of John D. Rockefeller as is Mary Astor as his rich nymphomaniac sister. Her eunuch Toto played by Sig Arno seems straight out of an Ernst Lubitch picture perhaps a Sturges nod to the master. Quite a few scenes of the film in their settings and atmosphere pay homage to Lubitsch. Sturges does the Lubitsch touch proud especially in those two scenes when Colbert sits on McCrea's lap so that he can undo the back of her dress with the two of them both times melting into a kiss and the scene ending with a fade out leaving little doubt as to what will happen next. The second scene is particularly romantic done as Rudy Vallee sings Good Night Sweet Heart itself a standard of the 1930s. Vallee also sings a line of Isn't It Romantic a song introduced in the luminous 1932 film Love Me Tonight directed by Rouben Mamoulian. The music in the film itself hearkens back to those great romantic comedies of the 1930s.It's nice to see Sturges's stock company of actors popping up here as well. I noticed William Demarest say his name was Bill Docker the same name his character had in Preston Sturges's Christmas in July.In short The Palm Beach Story is a wonderful film whose richness can really be appreciated when seen in context in the context of those old 1930s Paramount films both the melodramatic ones like Up Pops the Devil that it lampoons and the comedic romantic ones like Love Me Tonight and One Hour with You that it pays homage to.".

	onyx:emotionText "One element of this film that shouldn't be ignored is that it like Sullivan's Travels and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek is a conscious lampooning of earlier movies from the 1930s. It takes a standard conventional plot from those movies and turns it on its ear. The same plot can be seen for example in the Paramount movie from 1931 Up Pops the Devil with Carole Lombard and Norman Foster who coincidentally was Claudette Colbert's first husband. In that movie a wife who still loves her husband wants to divorce him for his own good she thinks she's just a noose around his neck and once rid of her he'll become a success. It's set in the same upper crust of society as The Palm Beach Story with a millionaire suitor for the wife and a nymphomaniac girl for the husband. Here everything is played straight with as much pathos and melodrama being milked out of the situation as can be. In The Palm Beach Story though the same basic plot and characters are used but it's the comedic potential and wackiness of the situation that's emphasized to marvelous effect.The subplot with the twins glanced at in the beginning and end of the picture is another conscious lampooning of conventional movies here a lampooning of the structure of movies themselves of their conventional beginnings and endings. It's not meant to be taken seriously as McCrea's character casually says at the end it's all stuff for another movie. No words can be found to adequately praise Claudette Colbert's performance. Joel McCrea is good too as the prototypical wooden 1930s leading man. Rudy Vallee is absolutely hilarious as a momma's boy version of John D. Rockefeller as is Mary Astor as his rich nymphomaniac sister. Her eunuch Toto played by Sig Arno seems straight out of an Ernst Lubitch picture perhaps a Sturges nod to the master. Quite a few scenes of the film in their settings and atmosphere pay homage to Lubitsch. Sturges does the Lubitsch touch proud especially in those two scenes when Colbert sits on McCrea's lap so that he can undo the back of her dress with the two of them both times melting into a kiss and the scene ending with a fade out leaving little doubt as to what will happen next.

I just love Joel McCrea  he was equally at home in white tie and tails or in jeans and a tengallon hat. You just instinctively believe every word he uttered  a thoroughly natural performer. No wonder the Colbert character went back to him in the end. That endingbeginning though is very strange. What is that all about with the twins?

One night however Martha receives a message from a man who's wife claims he isn't dead. He soon is though killed just the way Martha had envisioned. Word spreads and soon skeptical reporter Gary Wallace is on her trail as is the hitman responsible for the killing.Black Rainbow is a grimy slowburning little southern Gothic. Directed by Mike Hodges the film is equal parts horror yarn crime thriller and chastising of fake mediums. Before she begins foretelling deaths we never are clearly sure if Martha's gift is all an act. Whether it is or not the image she uses to describe her connection to the afterlife that of a rainbow is about to become very blackened indeed. Low key and mysterious the film is laced with atmosphere that while often dreary in reality is quite hypnotic.In a film like this the characters have to be welldrawn. These are believable broken people. As Martha Rosanna Arquette is intensely ethereal. I don't think she's ever looked more stunning and likewise I don't think she's ever given a better performance than the one delivered here. She vividly conveys the essence of the character a woman who turns to sporadic bouts of nymphomania for her only form of gratification. Emotionally worn and hardened by the existence that's been forced on her Martha lives an empty life giving hope to others while keeping none for herself. Jason Robards plays her father a louse of a man using his daughter as a cash cow while deriding her every step of the way. Tom Hulce is the cocky reporter and I recognized the mechanic from The Night Flier as Ted Silas.At one point in the film Martha is branded a witch due to one of her predictions. The same woman was more than happy to take part in her showings when they were reassuring but the moment she foresees something bad the woman does a 180 and puts her down. Ah good ol' human nature! This leads to Arquette tearing into her final audience with a speech about the affirmation of their own lives through the afterlife. Terrific stuff.Hodges peppers his film with many themes a key one clearly being the human need for assurance. Under his direction everything comes together beautifully. One scene is a real stunner as we bear witness to the force of an unseen explosion. I didn't realize what I was seeing at first but once it became clear I had to go back and watch the scene again. A lovely example of creativity through subtlety. Really despite the run down locations despite the macabre nature of the proceedings the entire film has an underlying beauty radiating throughout it. It's a delicate balance but one that's fully achieved.Wrapping up with an ambiguous ending the film concludes on a fitting note. This was a great discovery. Never talked about but utterly satisfying anyone looking for a real sleeper need look no further. Wonderful film.".

That is more disturbing than any special effect.It is a shame Black Rainbow didn't get a proper cinema release. According to Mike Hodges on the DVD commentary of Black Rainbow both the distributors Palace Pictures UK  Miramax USA were both suffering financially.

I really enjoyed the premise  a fake psychic starts actually prophesizing people's deaths  both the why and how  which makes her a target for a hit man.  Arquette is pretty good in the role  kind of a mystical and ethereal nymphomaniac and Robards is great as always.  The plot meanders a bit and sometimes gets a little slow but I still enjoyed it.  The ending didn't really make a lot of sense to me  maybe I missed something earlier in the movie  but I was surprised by this ending and liked it even if though it didn't seem to be supported by the rest of the movie.".

The ending didn't really make a lot of sense to me  maybe I missed something earlier in the movie  but I was surprised by this ending and liked it even if though it didn't seem to be supported by the rest of the movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "This had the potential to be a good movie  the basic premise about a phoney medium who starts to experience real premonitions was interesting the actors were excellent and the gloomy atmosphere of an economicallydepressed rural South came through loud and clear  but it just didn't go anywhere.The movie came off like more of a soapbox for the writer's leftist secular humanist views than anything. For example there's a scene in which the psychic starts telling an auditorium of bluecollar workers that if only they were to stop believing in God and the afterlife they could start to build a better world here on earth. The problem with such propositions is that they don't square with reality. The further we've moved from religion the baser we've become.

For example there's a scene in which the psychic starts telling an auditorium of bluecollar workers that if only they were to stop believing in God and the afterlife they could start to build a better world here on earth. The problem with such propositions is that they don't square with reality. The further we've moved from religion the baser we've become.

Though not wo its share of mistakes  weaknesses they are all honestly come by.The film covers several genres  comments upon them in interesting ways it is a Western w. conventional themes turned upside down  inside out of Indian savages vs. white civilizers it is a historical drama that chronicles the rise to power of the industry elites in late 19th century CA. illustrated in the subplot of Pres. Taft's visit to the Riverside Inn. While this is a Western it might be better termed an anti Western.  Every character including Blake's Indian is weak vacillating  morally changeable which makes for a wonderfully complex tale.Blakes dialogue gives us the film's title Well at least they'll know that Willie Boy was here.  He says this in responding to Katherine Ross' comment asking why he is willing to keep running even though the whites will eventually trap  kill him.  This scene conveys the film's elegaic tone about the death of the romantic West  the rise of the homogenized white industrial CA. that would arise in the 20th century.  Willie is compelled to stand up for his own individuality even though in actuality few will mourn his passing  even fewer remember that he was here.  But Polonsky the filmmaker tells us that someone will indeed remember Willie beyond those tracking him down  exterminating him Polonsky himself  the viewers of the film.  Really cool stuff!Another powerful layer of history is Abraham Polonsky's involvement.  As a Hollywood 10 member the script seems to comment indirectly on the Hollywood Blacklist era.  Blake the hounded Indian is much like the renegades of the Hollywood 10.  Willie Boy tries to stand up for the principle of honor  freedom in the face of insurmountable social odds.  Yet he is never seen as a romanticized or one sided character.  Even Willie Boy is pig headed monomaniacal and selfdestructive.I think Blake does a great job in this role.  It makes  you remember how good he could be in film roles remember In Cold Blood? before Baretta came along.  And it makes you weep for his recent descent into hell  wonder at what might have been if his life  career had taken diff. turns.I didn't mind Katherine Ross as much as some viewers.  She was much less bothersome  stereotypical than in some of her other roles The Graduate  Butch Cassidy.  During the film I was actually realizing how much I liked her in her role which surprised me.I highly recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the westerns made in the 1960s and 1970s including Ford's CHEYENNE AUTUMN and LITTLE BIG MAN which presented the westward expansion as the disaster it was to the Native Americans. Ford's film concentrated to the attempt of an entire tribe to flee to Canada to avoid being cooped up on a reservation. LITTLE BIG MAN looked at the long series of insults and thefts suffered by the Native Americans leading up to the Battle of the Little Big Horn their great victory over the politically ambitious Custer  in this film  and the point where their doom got sealed. Those films occur in 1876  77. TELL THEM WILLY BOY WAS HERE occurs some three decades later 1909 and shows the hopelessness of their situation.The screenplay is not quite even. It is notable that the author of the original novel Harry Lawton  who died a few weeks ago  was writing the script with director Abraham Polonsky. This may explain the uneven handling. Polonsky who was a victim of the Hollywood Blacklist was notable for his radical point of view best shown in his 1947 John Garfield film FORCE OF EVIL. But he was an expert screenplay writer and his view of the rights of Native Americans would be similar to those of Lawton. According to Lawton's obituaries he remained committed to Native American rights and culture throughout his life.Willy Boy Robert Blake kills a man who was bigoted and goaded him. He is pursued by a posse led by Robert Redford which is determined to get the young man because of his background. Redford a bit more fair minded wants to just catch him to bring him to trial but one gets the impression as the film continues how hopeless this hope is. It would be sort of like Henry Fonda being in charge of the lynch mob in THE OXBOW INCIDENT to try to control their passions and probably as unsuccessful.To confuse matters the killing takes place near an inn that newly elected President William Howard Taft is visiting on a political trip. Taft's presence in the locale makes the newspaper reporters wonder if they are getting the full facts from the sheriff. Why so much intense searching for this Indian? Is it as they are told that he killed a local man and he is quite adept at hiding in the deserts of Utah? Or is he part of a massive conspiracy of Indians planning to kill Taft? To us knowing the actual incident it seems ridiculous but keep in mind that since 1865 three U.S. Presidents were assassinated for political reasons the last McKinley in 1901. Also while thirty three years since Little Big Horn and nineteen since Wounded Knee the possibility of an Indian uprising was not hard to dismiss the great chief Geronimo died in 1905 shortly after attending Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration  we were that close in time to the period when he was on the warpath.The film goes to it's tragic conclusion  a long hard chase to the death of a representative of a defeated people. But the final victory is Blake's. In the end Willy Boy becomes the legend of the Native American who would not surrender.".

But it's a lumbering tale that takes a good hour before the dust begins to settle and we get some action along with the character development of both Blake and Redford.Every scene is painfully slow in getting to the payoff so that the film seems a lot longer than one hour and thirtysix minutes. The first hour is devoted to the manhunt for an Indian killer Blake and then the plot involves the arrival of President Taft in 1909 California and the effort to protect him from any kind of assassination attempt.Redford's role as the reluctant sheriff is never too clear since he's a man of a very few words a regular Gary Cooper type so it's up to Blake to carry much of the film and he does. He's terrific as the Indian lad who's trigger happy when the posse starts getting too close.The last twenty minutes should have been a model of suspense as they close in on Willie Boy but it's allowed to drag out interminably.Summing up Character driven tale had the potential to be a fine western but badly paced direction of Abraham Polonsky is no help nor is the sluggish script. Film was released after BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID put Redford on the map but was never a big boxoffice success.".

The first hour is devoted to the manhunt for an Indian killer Blake and then the plot involves the arrival of President Taft in 1909 California and the effort to protect him from any kind of assassination attempt.Redford's role as the reluctant sheriff is never too clear since he's a man of a very few words a regular Gary Cooper type so it's up to Blake to carry much of the film and he does. He's terrific as the Indian lad who's trigger happy when the posse starts getting too close.The last twenty minutes should have been a model of suspense as they close in on Willie Boy but it's allowed to drag out interminably.Summing up Character driven tale had the potential to be a fine western but badly paced direction of Abraham Polonsky is no help nor is the sluggish script. Film was released after BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID put Redford on the map but was never a big boxoffice success.";

	schema:reviewBody "This lesser known Redford film has been recently exploitively unearthed in the wake of costar Blake's reallife arrest and trial for murder. Blake plays a Peyote Indian in 1909 who kills in self defense and is tracked all over the desert by a small posse led by sheriff Redford. Notable as the return to directing by a man who was blacklisted for 18 years prior it has strong social commentary and the characters really represent aspects of a more contemporary society namely the one that went on a Communist witchhunt in the 1950's! The film though the plot line is fairly straightforward isn't always easy to understand because many of the characters' traits and motivations are blurry. No one in the entire film except possibly Lipton is a sympathetic character. Everyone is either violent or stupid or manipulative or a combination of the three. There is some degree of suspense and tension in the film but it doesn't really come off as wholly successful. Redford is an antihero this time on the side of the law after previously playing a fugitive himself in The Chase. Blake is a highly troubled soul who can't fit in to either the world of the reservations or white man. As his love interest Ross is hilarious. With her anachronistic hair and slathered on redface makeup she is the least likely Indian imaginable unless they had put Mamie Van Doren in the role. Why they bothered to cast her and give her second billing is a mystery anyway because one can not see her face in this movie!!!!!! Her hair in CONSTANTLY over half her face she is photographed through brush and tall grass behind hanging clothing with wet hair all over her forehead and eyes head hanging down etc...to the point of hilarity. Clark's character is very enigmatic...sharing a lusthate relationship with Redford. They strike some interesting notes but their story isn't fleshed out properly. This is worth checking out for the occasional tension the cat and mouse aspects of the chase and for it's camp value concerning the Indian characters but the overall impact is not what was intended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the Willie Boy incident that was one of the most savage chapters in frontier history .Contemporary Western drama set in 1909  it tells the story of one of the last and violent western manhunt. Set in Joshua Tree  California  about a killing carried by a Paiute Indian  Robert Blake  who murders his bride's father in selfdefense  it triggers a nonstop pursuit . Later on Willie Boy and and his white bride  Katharine Ross  escape and go on the run across the sunny desert . They become the objects of a manhunt by a tough posse led by the reluctant local sheriff  Robert Redford  and his followers  Barry Sullivan  Ned Romero  John Vernon  among others .Well paced film with bitter irony and stunningly directed by Abraham Polonsky  this was onceblacklisted Polonsky's first movie in 31 years . A thoughtprovoking and powerful picture  even though the screenplay carries its liberal conscience on its sleeve . Main cast is very good . Robert Blake is awesome as an obstinate Indian presumed guilty of a crime defined by circumstance rather than by fact he gradually reverts to being an Indian in the archetypally savage sense . A sober Robert Redford gives fine acting  he plays as a reluctant as well as stubborn sheriff who pursues mercilessly Willie . And Katharine Ross is very attractive as the bride who follows to Boy . Support cast is frankly nice such as Susan Clark  Barry Sullivan  John Vernon  Charles McGraw Robert Lipton and Ned Romero . Colorful and evocative cinematography by maestro cameraman Conrad L. Hall including wonderful desert outdoors and masterfully photographed . Special mention for the thrilling and suspenseful musical score with atmospheric and strange sounds by Dave Grusin  in Jerry Goldsmith style . Enjoyable production design with marvelous landscapes by two veteran designers  Alexander Golitzen and Henry Burnstead Hitchcock's ordinary. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Abraham Polonsky it was made with austere authority  adding a strong allegory about witchhunting . This was Polonsky's retun to filmmaking after 21 blacklist years since Force of Evil with this excellent contemporary western . The best and most successful movie he directed was the classic film noir Force of evil and also wrote the prestigious Body and Soul . Subsequently  he was chased as a member of the communist party . After defying the comittee by refusing to name names  8Polonsky was pursued  juzged and condemned by the HUAC  once blacklisted he only wrote and directed a few films as Romance of a horsethief and this Tell them willie Boy is here. And wrote some scripts such as I can get it for you wholesale  Madigan  Monsignor Avalanche express Rating  710. Better than average  well worth watching".

This movie was set in 1909. It was at the time that Indians were most vulnerable. There was no certainty they would even survive as peoples. The racism was very clear. Opportunistic white whiskey merchants sell booze to the Indians but contemptuously mutter racist things about the Indians.It is probably hard seeing an ItalianAmerican Blake play an Indian and Ross IrishAmerican? playing a halfbreed. However they both pull it off fairly well. Blake plays a character who shoots the white father of Ross's character and ends up on the run. The ambiguity of everything is pretty good. It is selfdefense because the father sneaks up on him and is raising his gun. But the impression one gets is one is not sure whether Blake's character is prone to violence or just on the defense. There is a better scene when the sheriff Redford finds Ross's character shot dead. But no one knows whether it was murder or a selfinflicted suicide.Redford's sheriff is ambiguous too. You don't know whether to like him or not. Most importantly though one is aware that he is just barely in control. It is very clear that in a few months the powers in the jurisdiction may change and make him useless as a sheriff. He is only through his bravery and action oriented personality that he keeps his underlings under control.The desert as a great hiding place is put to use. This was California when large towns today were just spots in the desert. The rocks are great hiding places for a person on the run. I was even surprised to find wooded and watery areas which you won't expect to find in the desert.I was a little confused by the ending. The sheriff shoots the runaway shooting suspect when he raises his gun. It was ambiguous. Yet why does Redford's character say that 'he had no bullets'? Blake's character was shooting at him.

	schema:headline " Culture Conflict in the Mojave.";
	schema:reviewBody "Conrad Hall's photography turns the harsh hostile Mojave Desert into the kind of place in which some entrepreneur might build a highend spa or a land developer might set up a nice gated community for retirees with streets that have names like Happy Trail and No Problem Drive and Party Time Cove. Or come to think of it a nice strip mall with tony shops like Vuitton and Starbucks and Banana Republic would do nicely.Sadly that's what's been happening since the events described here took place in 1909. Dusty little towns like Banning and Lancaster are now sprawling environment engulfers but I digress.Robert Blake is the Paiute Indian Willie Boy who kills the white father of his girl friend Katherine Ross and takes off with her into the desert which Hall captures as a rather benign place with towering Washingtonian palms creating a shady oasis the breeze whooshing gently through the fronds.

Having been persecuted doesn't automatically turn you into a genius but in this case it's not badly done. Nice shots of Robert Blake running full tilt across the sand rifle in hand leaping creosote bushes as if they were hurdles on a college track.Polonsky's loyalties are clear enough. What did I do to them? asks Blake referring to the white folks. What did any of us do? Well the Paiute were never particularly brutal not like the Mojave Indians. They didn't have to be. There was enough water around the Colorado River that they could afford to be farmers rather than warriors. Ira Hayes one of the heroes who raised the flag on Iwo Jima was a member of the neighboring Pima tribe.Polonsky thank God doesn't revel in White Guilt. The audience is made to feel sympathy with Blake and Ross if only because these are two lovers on foot being chased by a horde of horsemen who don't understand them and don't want to understand. But that and a few remarks here and there are about as far as it goes. If you didn't know Polonsky had been blacklisted you'd classify this as a more or less typical example of 1960s antinomian values. It's no more propagandistic than dozens of other films that came out of the same period.And what it finally boils down to is an exciting and ultimately tragic chase movie. The covert message will be happily unnoticed by most younger viewers and easily ignored by the more sophisticated. See Willie Boy run. See handsome Coop the epitome of handsomeness dodge bullets among the stuccotextured rocks. Look at the enthralling beauty of the natural landscape free of giant tarantulas and mutated ants.".

Or come to think of it a nice strip mall with tony shops like Vuitton and Starbucks and Banana Republic would do nicely.Sadly that's what's been happening since the events described here took place in 1909. Dusty little towns like Banning and Lancaster are now sprawling environment engulfers but I digress.Robert Blake is the Paiute Indian Willie Boy who kills the white father of his girl friend Katherine Ross and takes off with her into the desert which Hall captures as a rather benign place with towering Washingtonian palms creating a shady oasis the breeze whooshing gently through the fronds.

Willie got his whiskey from another Indian who stole the bottle from out of a bunkhouse not from whites after participating in a bar fight. He did not run away with his lover after being confronted while they were making love. She was terrified of him and he kidnapped her after shooting her father in the face while he slept. He later shot Carlota in the back either when she tried to escape or because she was slowing him down. The only real relevance to the proximity of the US President was that it also meant there was an over abundance of newspaper reporters near San Bernardino and Riverside who sensationalized the chase not even knowing that Willie Boy was already dead before most of them had even heard of him.The true story of the manhunt or at the least the closest to the truth as it was based on eyewitness and secondhand accounts from the remaining witnesses is The Last Great Manhunt by Harry Lawton the book TTWBIH is based on Lawton even changed the title to that of the film. Years later a couple of politically correct college professors wrote articles claiming Lawton's book was all wrong and Willie Boy was a hero even going so far as to suggest Carlotta was killed by the posse. Lawton sued and showed his meticulous research of historical archives and interviews with witnesses. The professors later were forced to print a retraction as part of a settlement.".

The film offers varying degrees of the racial divides and tensions between whites and Native Americans during turn of the century America. Sheriff Chris Cooper Redford treads that line carefully as he knows he must bring Willie Boy to justice but is keenly aware that it wouldn't take much for his search party to turn into a lynch mob. All the while one wonders how the final confrontation might take place knowing that Willie Boy is not the type to go down without a fight. The prelude to that showdown is perhaps even more of a shocker as Willie's girl Lola commits the ultimate sacrifice so her man has a better chance of escaping.I haven't seen Robert Blake in a lot of films besides this and In Cold Blood though I was a regular viewer of 'Baretta'. I liked that show which had a reasonably authentic 'street' feel to it back in the Seventies. I often wondered why Blake never broke out to greater mainstream success until I saw him once on a late night talk show. His entire stint consisted of a rambling rant on government conspiracies and assorted complaints against authority and he came across like a nut case. It's sad that he wound up at the center of his wife's murder mystery in recent years a far cry from the once cute kid who graced the screen with the Little Rascals and as Red Ryder's sidekick.".

They are pursued by a posse led by Sheriff Cooper Robert Redford. Meanwhile residents of the region are preparing for a visit from President Taft.Redford was in his prime after his breakthrough success with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 and the outstanding Downhill Racer 1969. Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here came out next and was critically acclaimed. While a modest hit it failed to achieve the success of the other two films especially Butch Cassidy. It has since fallen into nigh obscurity and is almost never mentioned in 'Best Western' lists.Along with Hombre 1967 and Butch Cassidy and soontocome Westerns like The Missouri Breaks 1976 Willie Boy ranks with the breakthrough 'modern' Westerns of the 60s70s. The movie is polished and hardly seems to have dated after all these decades. The director was an admitted communist who was blacklisted by the McCarthy squad in the late 40s and Willie Boy was his big return to filmmaking.The cast is great also including the stunning Susan Clark as a patronizingly liberal white missionary and the desert scenery is spectacular. But the first half is dull and the story doesn't perk up until the 50minute mark. Still this is a worthwhile late 60's Western if you like the style of the others noted.What lowers my grade is the LIEberal rewriting of the historical facts in order to gel with the Indianastragicvictim theme that was fashionable at the time. The real Willie Boy was in his mid20s and kidnapped the 15 yearold Isoleta his second time after murdering her father in his sleep. Willie Boy used Isoleta as a pack animal and when she couldn't walk any more shot her in the back. Her clothes were shreds while her skin had swellings  bruises and there were cactus needles in her body. Her shoes were worn out and her feet bloodied. Willie Boy ultimately committed suicide with his last bullet and his corpse was found after the partNative posse chased him for eleven days and over 500 miles in the picturesque wasteland. In short Willie Boy was a piece of sheet who executed two of his own and yet this movie has the audacity to make him out to be tragic figure oppressed by righteous authorities. Why Sure!The film runs 1 hour 37 minutes and was shot in the deserts of S. Cal Banning Pioneertown Joshua Tree Riverside Palm Springs Whitewater and Lake Sherwood.GRADE C".

	schema:headline " Romeo and Juliet revisited on a Paiute Reservation";
	schema:reviewBody "Apparently a seriously fictionalized adaptation of the saga of troubled Paiute Willie Boy transforming it into a Romeo and Julietlike tale with WillieRobert Blake and his halfbreed girlfriend LolaKatherine Ross the victims of racial slurs and prejudice by judicial authorities. In part it's also a standard western with a long posse chase of this horseless fugitive and his girl through a rocky desert wilderness in southern CA followed by a hide and seek shooting duel with Deputy Sheriff CoopRobert Redford on a bare rocky Ruby Mountain. The ultimate outcome was quite predictable.Willie much resents being considered inferior to white men and often being referred to as 'boy'. Once in a while he strikes back like a rattler. He jabs a belittling bigot in a pool hall causing serious injury. He refuses to give up his courting of halfbreed Lola despite murderous threats by her disapproving father. When this duo disappear one night her father and 2 other men with rifles go looking for them in the woods and find them making love. As papa appears ready to shoot Willie he grabs his rifle and shoots papa first. The other men scatter. Seems like Willie should have been able to plead selfdefense with Lola a witness. Apparently theyrightly didn't think that would be good enough for a white judge. Thus they run into the wilderness and a posse is organized to capture them.Dr. Lisa ArnoldSusan Clark is the 4th main character. She has earned a doctorate at a prestigious eastern university and is a medical doctor as well as the superintendent of this reservation. Apparently unmarried she treats the 'Indians' as her surrogate children to be protected from the big bad outside worldespecially illegal whiskey salesmen. She has a dysfunctional sexual relationship with Coop refusing to acknowledge him outside her bedroom as she considers him her social and intellectual inferior. Since Willie's Lola has been raised to be a white woman Willie is also seen by most as her social inferior.The fact that Willie from a high vantage point shot at only the horses not the men of the posse suggests that he did not shoot men unless he felt he absolutely had to. However in his subsequent shooting duel with Coop he definitely was shooting to kill.The details of the final duel between Coop and Willie are perhaps significant to the story. Coop surprises Willie from behind and gives him a chance to surrender. But Willie whirls around with rifle ready to fire. Coop shoots him dead. But Coop discovers that Willie's rifle was empty. Hence Willie's action was actually an indirect suicide thus mimicking the apparent earlier Lola suicide. Coop's action was in apparent selfdefense as was Willie's earlier shooting of Lola's father. However Coop is regarded as a hero whereas Willie rightly assumed that he would be regarded by white authorities as an unjustified murderer.The film ends with Willie's body being cremated at the base of Ruby Mountain where he died. Interestingly Coop gave the body to the Paiute present telling them to bury it. Instead they gathered wood for a funeral pyre. When the white posse arrived they object that they want a body to show to authorities to prove that Willie is indeed dead. Coop obviously supports the Paiute's decision saying Tell them we're all out of souvenirs. In that era the bodies and effects of infamous outlaws were often subject to theft by souvenir hunters. Presumably that's part of Coop's thinking. Also he was telling the posse to let the Paiute dispose of the body according to their traditions. According to Gary Varner's web site titled The Treatment of Death Among the Paiute both burial and cremation were commonly practiced according to circumstances. Willie's circumstance could call for cremation.For one thing burning was believed to neutralize evil associated with a person and the potential mischief by their ghostalso true of the witch burnings in Europe. Actual accounts of Willie's death favor cremation on site although another account claims that he escaped captureAccording to one reviewer and several web sites I consulted the real Willie clearly murdered Lola's father who was a Paiute shaman. She was either a voluntary or involuntary companion during his flight depending on the account. Lola was either murdered by Willie or accidentally shot by the posse depending on the account. Willie died alone on Ruby mountain maybe. The Coop and Dr. Arnold characters are pure inventions. Thus the most important details of the film are all fabrications despite the claim at the beginning that it is a true story. Typical Hollywood! I thought the President Taft episode was an unnecessary diversion from the main story. The main characters with the possible exception of Katherine Ross were well cast. For a much more fun role for Susan Clark see The Skin Game in which she is a pickpocketcon artist nemesiscompanion for James Garner.".

It stars Robert Redford Robert Blake Katharine Ross and Susan Clark. A TechnicolorPanavision production it has music by Dave Grusin and cinematography by Conrad L. Hall.In the summer of 1909 a member of the oldest American minority a Paiute Indian named Willie Boy became the center of an extraordinary historical event. This is what happened in the deserts of California.It's a very intense and captivating movie sad even it is well performed by the boys up top beautifully photographed and boosted tonally by a haunting musical score that takes its heart from Jerry Goldsmith's score for Planet of the Apes yet there's just something too Hollywood about it that stops it breaking through into a film worthy of the subject matter.Problem in the main is that in trying to tune into the coolness of Robert Redford and he is very smooth here the focus of the film is more on Redford's Sheriff Cooper than it is Robert Blake's Willie Boy. Oh for sure the Willie Boy axis as he goes on the run with his Indian girlfriend Lola Ross unconvincing in race terms but emotionally impressive is explored but it's Cooper's movie and that just can't be right. The actual facts of the manhunt and its key areas have been cloaked in grey over the years so the film makers stick rigidly to one of the stories told while dripping liberal messages in and out of the narrative. It's often a fascinating movie with its changing of the times pulse beat but as much as I was glad I watched the picture an overriding sense of unfulfillment still leaves me frustrated.It was well received by the critics of the day this in spite of director and stars not seeing eye to eye and it is a decent movie with great values. But it's just not all that it could have been. 6.510".

The white girl's father never approved of his daughter's love for the boy just because of his American Indian heritage! I believe the father died from his own stupidity because of his hatred against the boy. He had every right to defend himself from the father who couldn't help it that the boy fell in love with his daughter. Obviously love doesn't stop happening if both parties come from different races. All the father had to do was simply understand the boy's background and his culture as a proud American Indian and everything would have probably been fine. If he made the effort in trying to get along with the boy none of these problems would have ensued.Anyways as with any film there needs to be a good plot in order for it to be a good story. So that's why I gave this one a 9 out of 10.".

Why was poor George Lazenby cast to play in such trashy films? Was he really that bad in On Her Majesty's Secret Service? Did the director of this film think that by casting two Bondian actors in this film that he would be raising the production value of such a horrible script?  The action scenes are so tame and unexciting that you can't believe why Jim Kelly would allow this to be vehicle in his career after the success of Enter The Dragon. The only one aspect of this film worth viewing with the exception of the Bondian actors is the soundtrack. Not that it's completely brilliant but it definately has a Rare Groove edge to it if that's your bag but I doubt a Soundtrack album ever accompanied this drivein B movie. Oh and Jim Kelly has a cool red jump suit to wear. But that's about it. If the opening scene with a woman getting stitched up in a nauseating slow pace doesn't get you to turn the video off the action will slowly put you to sleep. Only interesting if you were ever curious to see what George Lazenby got up to after his turn at James Bond.".

Jim Kelly has great fighting skill and the mere presence of Bond alumni George Lazenby and Harold Sakata is enough for the film to warrant a look.The story  concerning a fiendish plot to freezebomb the world  is absurd but the elements that populate it  kungfu hot chicks and grunting henchmen  combined with great locales and a goofy soundtrack make it a doozy.If you expect Enter the Dragon you won't get it with Death Dimension a.k.a Kill Factor but this movie is still some great fun. Look for the senseless closing frame it seals the deal.".

Kelly still has the moves but while some of his fighting isn't bad it is spoiled by the unslick presentation lighting framing etc.. Sakata is for me and many others an iconic presence his Oddjob is arguably the best henchman in the entire Bond series. However his role here adds nothing to his stature in fact it probably detracts from it. Lazenby's participation is minor. The film is poorly directed and obviously drawnout at the climax. Worth a look for its cast but don't expect too much. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the films that best shows how silly some exploitation films of the 1970's could be and still be entertaining.The plot has a scientist making a freeze bomb for a gangster who intends to sell it the highest bidder. The scientist implants a microchip into the brow of his comely assistant and sends her off to get the information to the proper authorities. The scientist then burns his notes and commits suicide to prevent the weapon from getting into the wrong hands. In police headquarters Jim Kelly is assigned to find the assistant and to get the goods on the bad guy. Of course Jim Kelly is barely on the case when people begin to take a run at him. From there the film progresses in a series of very good action sequences punctuated by dialog scenes that drive the plot into a completely nonsensical direction.In all honesty the film makes no sense what so ever but you won't mind because the film moves along at a good clip. The film's nonsensical plotting also assures that you're going to continue watching simply to see where its all going. Where its heading is toward a truly unbelievable ending that had me scan back and playing it a second time thankfully its just as funny the second time. Kelly co star of Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon and well known in some circles as the star of Black Belt Jones is one of the few American stars who consistently made good martial arts action films. He's one actor who could both act well in the dramatic scenes and look like his fights were more than staged fights Kelly always looks like he could hold his own in real life. I think the reason that this film works at all is simply because he is such a good actor that he sells the utter nonsense happening around him.Is this a great film? No actually it's probably not even a good one but its an enjoyable one that's worth a bowl of popcorn and a soda.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something about this Z grade martial arts flick that might make you want to take a shower after you watch it. A seedy sleazy feel pervades every frame and if you know about the LA scene of the 70's and what was going on at the time it feels even sleazier. Iconic martial arts master and the King of Cool Jim Kelly made a handful of these movies after his appearance in the very successful Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee. A lot of fans were disappointed that Kelly's ultracool character is killed off so early into that film because we wanted more of this guy. And movies like Death Dimension give Jim Kelly a chance to show his stuff. Among these films all of which are memorable and great in their own way Death Dimension stands out as one of the cheapest of the lot. Filmed in the Nevada desert and the glitzy Reno casino strip on a very small budget the movie still manages to be atmospheric and entertaining. Featuring a cast of cheap looking women who look like they were borrowed from a hardcore porn movie as well as some truly mean looking men. There is an evil Haitian thug with a scarred face that will make your skin crawl. He likes to beat women and slice people's throats with his razorlike pinky ring. And the king pin scumbag is just called The Pig and he is truly a pig in his skin tight polyester shirts bursting under the strain of his sweaty big body. when Jim Kelly is on screen though everything comes together and we are reminded just why we are watching. Kelly's martial arts skills are finely tuned and hyperenergetic the man is truly incredible to watch. Here he is partnered with Myron Lee a Chinese undercover agent and the two work very well off each other kind of like the pairing of Conan and Subotai in Conan the Barbaian. Some highlights include scenes of Jim Kelly walking around the neonsaturated Reno strip at night. The man is just so cool in everything he does. As far as the plot goes well it concerns some evil bastards trying to get their hands on a machine that can freeze the weather in a concentrated area. It sounds a bit like the plot from Black Samurai another Kelly film that is actually better than this film. Anyway we don't watch these films for their brilliant story lines do we? I recommend this movie for fans of exploit cinema and martial arts movies of the 1970's. It's good sleazy fun.".

Kelly spends most of the film fighting and little time acting as he repeatedly finds himself attacked by lots of bad guys. These fight scenes are hardly what you would term wellphotographed but they are very entertainingly done complete with overemphasised sound effects.Now you would think that a film containing plentiful action plus a couple of topless women for exploitation purposes would have to be pretty exciting right? Wrong. Adamson's tacky and cheap direction is evident at all moments sucking vitality from the movie loads of scenes consist of people arguing whilst sitting around in darkened rooms which is hardly what I would call fun.Kelly is pretty athletic in the lead role but gets no chance to act or develop a character. George Lazenby ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE costars as Kelly's chief Harold Sakata plays the chief villain the Pig and his line readings are a hoot it's a shame that it's impossible to take him seriously! Also around for good measure are a hulking black bodyguard with a nasty scar across his face who likes to break people's arms and necks a couple of prostitutes who take their clothes off a lot an incredibly evillooking tortoise the scariest tortoise I've ever seen in a film actually and lots of dumb criminal henchmen who appear from nowhere.DEATH DIMENSIONis a bad film to be sure but quite an entertaining one mainly for the interesting cast alone.

Lots of boredom is countered by lots of action making a pretty fair movie in the end which isn't that bad.";

Instead it just slowly slogs its way to the endingthe very very bad ending. In fact I couldn't wait for this listless film to end.Well folks this should NOT really come as a surprise if you consider who is responsible for this film. It's from the master of schlock Al Adamsonone of the most pathetically bad film makers of all time. In fact for Adamson this IS a very good filmand that's what makes his career all the more sad. If you don't believe me that this is one of his better films just try watching Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN HORROR OF THE BLOOD MONSTERS HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS and FIVE BLOODY GRAVES! Ugghh...to quote Colonel Kurtz the horror.This film begins with a lady scientist is there any other type? escaping from Odd Job I mean Sakata who is working on a freeze bomb. Considering that she has the formula on her the baddies are all out to get her...fast. To combat them instead of sending out the Marines police or FBI two lone guys are sent to combat this organization of evil I guess the budget wouldn't allow more. Kelly and a nobody nicknamed Myron Bruce Lee go in search of evil and somehow blunder into it by the end of the film. But considering how dull all this is you really could care less and just want the whole thing to end. And when it does end it ends in one of the silliest scenes. Kelly apparently is a HORRIBLE shot with a handgunmissing at least 20308 times during the last 10 minutes of the film. Yet once the boss baddie gets on a plane and flies away to freedom Kelly hits the plane and it miraculously blows upeven though he's hundreds of yards away and it's only a snubnosed .38 caliber gun! Naturally I hated the film. Unfortunately this isn't one of the more unintentionally funny Adamson films nor is his other teaming with Kelly BLACK SAMURAI. See it if you are an Adamson completist but otherwise don't bother.Oh and a final thought. In the scenes with the lucious prostitutes this may sound catty but they seem to be about the ugliest professionals in film history. Where did they get these women? Prison?!".

When she plays the cello he smiles and as he is dying he smiles as he listens to her voice. These are the only two occasions in which he smiles throughout the entire movie. Whether this is love attraction or because he was thankful that she made him feel good is open to interpretation. Given that he is an extremely straightforward and honest characterand also given that in this movie everything is what you see on the screen there are no hidden motives twists whatsoever I assume that the reason he doesn't answer or CAN'T answer when asked why he did it by his boss is because he doesn't know himself. I think the key to understanding this movie is the title and the narration at the end of the movie something along the line of a disciple telling his master that he cries after a sweet dream because he knows it can't come true. For Sunwoothe girl and his belief? that he can kill everyone else and still live are sweet dreams that cannot come true. The reason why he unrealistically gets by after getting shot and stabbed so much is not simply because he is the main character but because everything he does after meeting the girl is like a sweet 'dream' a surreal realityyes an oxymoron just like the title a 'bittersweet' life. The morbid ending is also very fitting as sweet as the dream was the more bitter it is when he wakes up from it and faces realityonce again relating to the last narration.".

	schema:reviewBody "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say once in a great while a film comes along blah blah. Or Only a select few films ever have reached this blah blah. Or I could say if you see one movie this year blah blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the bigboy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well films that deserve this kind of special praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real 21st Century film and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea believe it or not and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean mean and like its lead male a damn ruthless fighting machine. The film beats along with its Raymond Chandlerlike screenplay with all the jazz and style of early 90's John Woo and with the energy and themes of Quentin Tarantino's grind house 70's. Life plays with your emotions making you care for the badguy hero even though he is a vicious killer and causes one to release tension through laughter when the blood starts gushing like a dozen ruptured fire hoses. Wholesale death blood by the gallons broken bones and multiple beatings with humongous pipewrenches twobyfours and lead pipes are on order right after a heaping dish of innocent love and a guy trying for once to do the right thing.The plot well you see it's like this you can see everything coming a mile away the movie plays it straight and follows the exact path you know it will and the exact path you hope it will. There are no twist endings no complicated triple crosses no hidden motives for the characters. Everything on screen happens the way you see it and everything thing ends exactly the way you picture it. And this is a good thing. The film is so on track that it doesn't need a twist or a swerve to make you pay attention. It starts at A ends at E and hits B C and D on the way there. Life is so steeped in its genre tropes of noir character and themes that the ending is know to all of us before it even starts. However it's the journey that matters and I'll be damned if you can find a betterlooking more brutally violent journey anywhere.As much as I try to analyze the film nothing comes to mind. And this is the purest of all compliments. The film is as shallow as the pools of blood splattered in the hallways alleyways and run down exteriors of the sets. Often times a director feels the need to bog a simple story down with twists and a deeper meaning to hide the fact that they are afraid to just let things happen because they need to happen. Bittersweet Life is not one of these films. It exists with its soul laid bare for all to see and when the carnage is complete you thank the film for being honest with itself. As the final credits roll you might find yourself asking Is that it? Yes that is itcinematic perfection. It is all it needs to be pure and simple boisterous and calm bloody and drenched in gore and an honest movie with nothing to hide. genrebusters".

	onyx:emotionText "I could sit here and start this review off any number of ways to make this film sound ultra important. I could say once in a great while a film comes along blah blah. Or Only a select few films ever have reached this blah blah. Or I could say if you see one movie this year blah blah. You know the drill. These are the opening sentences the bigboy critics use when they really want you to see a flick and when they want a particular review to really stand out. Well films that deserve this kind of special praise really do only come around once in a great while. Unbelievably I have seen two in only six months time. The first was what I like to call the first real 21st Century film and that was Oldboy. And the second film of this status also comes from Korea believe it or not and it is Bittersweet Life.Bittersweet Life is probably one of the most simple most streamlined modern films I have ever seen. It is lean mean and like its lead male a damn ruthless fighting machine.

And he says no matter how dark and moody it may seem his new film ''A Bittersweet Life Talkomhan Insaeng is no exception.''This movie basically deals with relationship breakups resulting from small communication breakdowns Kim said during a news conference Monday after the preview screening of ''A Bittersweet Life. Without calling it comedy exactly sometimes audiences have to laugh at very serious or ironic situations Kim said.Kim has shown his unique morbid sense of humor in previous movies such as ''The Quiet Family a black comedy about a family who kill visitors to their cottage ''The Foul King a comic drama about an amateur wrestler and one horror contribution work for the omnibus film ''Three. Kim is also behind ''A Tale of Two Sisters the psychological horror film that became a summer hit in 2003.''A Bittersweet Life starring Lee Byunghun from ''Everybody Has a Little Secret and Shin Mina from ''Madeleine portrays the desperate and brutal revenge of Sunwoo played by Lee after he is expelled from his gang and comes close to being killed by his boss.Lee Byunghun is a hitman who falls for the girlfriend of his boss in the stylishly violent A Bittersweet Life. Conventional ideas of causation are put into doubt in director Kim Jeewoon's twist on film noire. ''A Bittersweet Life Talkomhan Insaeng'' is what Korean critics are describing as ''Action Noire.'' In it he tweaks the traditional Korean gangster story line presenting a work with film noire undertones and stylish cinematography.Sunwoo Lee Byunghun is a revenging dark angel dressed in black. Gang leader Kang Kim Youngcheol assigns Sunwoo his righthand man to watch after his nubile girlfriendprofessional cellist Heesoo Shin Mina while he is away and find out about the other guy with whom he suspects she is messing around.The plot is complicated by Sunwoo's existential decision to stray from the explicit instructions with which he is charged. He is cryptically told time and again to make good on a promise but he never exactly know what that is.Much of the action occurs in the long shadows the sprawling megapolis Seoul casts. Here the gangsters wish they were too cool to be killed. No friend can really be trusted as the good guys are not so good and the bad guys can be down right evil. Importantly the motivation of his tormentors is shrouded in mystery.But the movie has been labeled ''action noire'' for a good reason. The stylistic ultraviolence of director Kim is superb. The creepy fisherman killer represents a unique Korean twist on the classic film noire villain. Our hero is not a good good guy either and I loved that about him. He is not only tough but also a stoneface killer  a tribute to both the director and actor's character interpretation.After all gangsters should fight to kill and that means sometimes going for the knees and other joints hitting low and dirty to take the guy out quick. In general the fight scenes were creative. Watch for the facedraggedacrossthecinderblockwall scene perhaps a first for cinematic violence.".

But this does not make the movie less enjoyable. The cinematography is brilliant and the maincharacter delivers a great performance. It contains beautifully choreographed martialarts and gunfight scenes with references to masterpieces like Taxi Driver and Kill Bill.

	schema:reviewBody "Everything is believable from the small things like the way in which the main character first falls in love with his boss's girlfriend because of the delicate curve of her neck and the way the main character fumbles with a gun for the first time while he tries to put it together to the theme of revenge that this films is propelled by.The main character SunWoo has lived most of his life serving his 'HyongNim' Korean for boss in the gangster underworld. He has in fact dedicated 7 years of his life to him taking care of the dirty work his dirty work. His boss Mr.Kang sees SunWoo as one of his most trusted 'AhHo' Korean for underling and this is where you recognised that familybased element of the gangster underworld. In Korea the society is largely based on a strict hierarchal system where you must respect your elders and demand respect from people younger than you. Although right now Korea is slowly moving away from convention and traditions the underworld of gangs stills strictly upholds this hierarchal system. The theme of revenge stems from this as Mr.Kang feels like a betrayed father with his underling SunWoo protects his boss's girlfriend from getting caught cheating. Mr. Kang follows the protocol of the underworld and decides to punish SunWoo who has been like a son to him. Before SunWoo suffers the punishment Mr.Kang asks him why did he betray him to which SunWoo replies I thought if she promised never to cheat on you everything would be back to normal... I thought everything would be OK. To this Mr.Kang says No its OK tell me the truth... It's because you fell for her isn't it? SunWoo cannot lie as he stays silent confused. As he kneels down in the mud in this scene you see on the main characters face the realisation that after all this time of never falling in love with anyone the one girl that turned his head was his boss's girlfriend. Earlier in the movie there is a scene where Mr.Kang and SunWoo have dinner together as father and son in a family of the underworld where Mr.Kang says that he hates being lied to and that if SunWoo caught his young girlfriend cheating that SunWoo should kill her. Mr.Kang contradicts himself here as he is in fact married with a wife who he is cheating on by being with this new younger girlfriend. Mr.Kang believes that in the underworld of gangsters if your boss says something and he is wrong you must still agree and follow his lead. There is a Japanese gangster saying If your boss says black is white and white is black you must agree. If he says there is no sky then to you there is no sky. Mr.Kang punishes SunWoo for what he says is betrayal of the code of master and disciple hierarchy. SunWoo almost loses his life as he refuses to be punished fighting against gangsters that he was once the general of. This is where the main character's 'Hamletstyled' contemplation of revenge takes place. As the story shows the audience SunWoo breaking away from tradition and convention by refusing punishment set down by his elder we also see the main character breaking away from the tradition of close quarter combat as he tries to acquire firearms. To the main character his boss's actions confuse him. SunWoo spent 7 years of his life serving Mr.Kang and in the final scene SunWoo confronts Mr.Kang with this fact. SunWoo screams I rotted away serving you for 7 years! Were you really going to kill me?! To SunWoo Mr.Kang's actions were too severe. Ironically this time its SunWoo asking Mr.Kang No its OK tell me the truth... Tell me why you really tried to kill me. At this moment we see that Mr.Kang chose to punish SunWoo not because he wanted to uphold the law of the underworld but because he was simply jealous of SunWoo of SunWoo's youth. Mr.Kang's reason for cheating on his own wife with a younger woman may also suggest Mr.Kang's thirst for youth. SunWoo points pistol at his own boss his father his mentor and I truly expected him not to fire but I was totally wrong. As Mr.Kang's character may symbolize tradition and convention SunWoo strikes him down as a unpredictable force of chaos and revolution. The way in which we try and control our lives could be seen as the convention of the hierarchal system where humans try to uphold peace and order. Through the main character this story depicts how bullshit the 'system' is and that life can prove to be utter chaos the more we try to control it and bring order to it. The most powerful scene in this movie I thought was really breathtaking was the final scene where after having been shot numerous times and barely breathing the main character calls the girl he has recently fallen for. As she picks up he drops the phone and can only hear her voice. Comforted only by her voice saying Yeo Boh Sae Yo? Korean way of asking who is it on the phone he looks up to see wind blowing in the leaves of a tree. He then seems to be lost in a dream in his final moments of living. But then his dream is cut very shot ALL OF A SUDDEN by a single shot to his head. It almost as if he was dreaming and then woke up to see his life to see nothing.".

In his previous film the marks of originality intellectual challenge and superb visual style hailed the possibility of a brave new voice in Korean cinema.A Bittersweet Life commences with similarly awesome photography and ambiance. The wind in the leaves of a tree  Is it the leaves or the wind that moves? asks the disciple of the master. Neither he replies it is your mind and heart that moves. Cut to La Dolce Vita the swish bar restaurant which we are to discover is also the gangland stronghold of SunWoo. A single tree in the centre of the restaurant's sky lounge.

In his previous film the marks of originality intellectual challenge and superb visual style hailed the possibility of a brave new voice in Korean cinema.A Bittersweet Life commences with similarly awesome photography and ambiance. The wind in the leaves of a tree  Is it the leaves or the wind that moves? asks the disciple of the master. Neither he replies it is your mind and heart that moves.

	schema:reviewBody "SunWoo is the manager of sleek modern restaurant in uptown Seoul called La Dolce Vita but that's not his only employment. He is also the errandboy of underworld Kingpin Mr Kang. A job he fulfils ruthlessly and efficiently until the day Mr Kang takes off for a week leaving SunWoo to mind his much younger girlfriend HeeSoo to make sure she doesn't sleep around. If she does he is to execute both of them. HeeSoo cheats. SunWoo almost sentences them to death but has a sober moment and realises that letting them go is the right thing to do.In Mr Kang's absence a rival crime syndicate headed by President Baek and his overconfident son is becoming more and more impatient to force a business merger with Kang. Despite Kang's reluctance to go through with this deal one of his own men SunWoo's cohort MinGi welcomes the business with Baek and his son and complicates matters.Upon Kang's return he figures out SunWoo's failure to carry out his orders and demands he be killed unless he apologises. At this moment SunWoo is about to be tortured to death by Baek Jr. but is returned to Kang on the promise that he will do business.It's out of the frying pan and into the deepest pits of fiery hell for SunWoo. Already bashed and bruised and beaten he is cast down in the mud during a heavy rainstorm and forced to apologise. He resists. His hand is crushed with a massive wrench he is buried alive.He survives and breaks through the loose soil. SunWoo and the audience breathe a sigh of relief. But it's far from over. MinJi and a large group of thugs are still waiting by the shallow grave. They drag him into a old building and give him 15 minutes to call Mr. Kang and beg for his life. Still he refuses. And when those 15 minutes are up SunWoo unleashes an incredibly lethal and jawdroppingly furious asskicking like you have never seen. He goes through about 20 men like they weren't even there and dishes out agonising bloodsoaked punishment in one of the most nailbiting escapes you'll ever see.It's now time for SunWoo to plan his revenge. And that he does with lovingly violent detail.A Bittersweet Life comes in 3 large acts that make the 120minute running time pass in a breeze. The setup and story are so simple and honest that you can literally startwatching the film at any point and still become immersed in the action. But I feel that many viewers may be missing the twist at the end.By 'twist' I mean after SunWoo's death the film goes back to the beginning revealing that he only fantasised the whole thing. He says the cruelty of any sweet dream is waking up to find yourself back in the real world. He is still in his restaurant and when no one is looking insecurely looking over his shoulder to make sure SunWoo shadow boxes for fun or curiosity. Hardly the kind of behavior you would expect from a man who has just annihilated 50 baddies.But regardless of the final outcome it's the highoctane journey you take to get there that really matters right? And A Bittersweet Life is one movie you'll want to watch over and over again.".

	schema:headline " A Bittersweet Prose";
	schema:reviewBody "It's seems like there is no stopping Korean cinema as the year isn't yet over and they've already released a handful of spectacular features. Aside from Sympathy for Lady Vengeance A Bittersweet Life was the second revenge driven film I was eagerly awaiting. I kept my expectations at a reasonable level even though I was well aware of Kim's reputation his eye for capturing detail and his strength at creating eerie atmosphere.And the atmosphere here was felt right from the start. Byunghun Lee plays Sunwoo a hotel restaurant enforcer and a trusted henchman to a powerful crime boss. From the initial glimpse Lee carries heavily confined mannerisms and easily achieves seriousness and believability. The action although a bit reminiscent of the Far East style is intense yet touches the limits of implausibility much like the ending. I must say that it wasn't the action that held my interest at first but Lee's character who was sharply followed by the camera through the nights of driving and contemplating. He vacantly lives from one day to next feeling strongly disconnected from the world around him but still manages his duties to perfection and to much praise from his boss Kang.That's until he gets entrusted by Kang to carry out a short task involving his young mistress. The female character had some potential in the beginning as she evoked some elusive feelings in our gloomy lead but she was abruptly shelved. The story makes the turning point as his mission goes awry but before I was able to question the cause and effect next came the brutally unprecedented fight between Sunwoo and the thugs. This helped the story quite a bit since it showed how something small and avoidable could turn into something big and ugly.This surprisingly fills approximately half of the film. The remaining time offers few black comedic elements fistful of rapid shooting sequences and even hints at a possibility of a Mexican standoff. Not to nitpick or complain but purely for the sake of conversing and since the movie is labeled as a real life actioner there are moments when you think just why weren't these gangsters carrying guns at so many instances? And no I didn't ask the same question with Kill Bill.In the beginning of the film Sungwoo recited Master are the branches moving or is it the wind?  That which moves is neither the branches or the wind...It's your heart and mind. I'm no expert at this or a big fan of decoding messages but I think that it could simply mean that Sungwoo or the audience never meant to know what specifically cradled his life into such reveries nor was Sunwoo able find any grounds of communication with his former boss who sometimes looked at him as if he was his own son.Regardless could seven years of being a loyal servant to a respectful boss really have pushed both parties into such desperate measures over this? Perhaps he was too stubborn or jealous of Kang to reveal his cause but why did he decide to help Heesoo in the first place? Maybe he wanted her to go back to Kang and make him happy. After all he was such a calculating person that didn't desire love. Maybe it was just because she found him boring and ethereally played cello? Sunwoo's final quote suggested his envision of a dream or its demise. He failed to achieve what he desired. I failed to fully grasp what he desired as well. Perhaps he wanted a more ambiguous finale that gangsters rarely get afforded in reality but the one he received was pretty dubious on its own. I ask these questions not in vain or to mercilessly critique this film but because I genuinely wanted to know more about what drove these characters and wouldn't have minded if the movie was longer. After all it was because of Heesoo that Sunwoo got to travel on a different path in life. If you'll omit such speculations or enhance the plot by filling in the subtleties of Sunwoo's motives then I'm sure you'll find this film very uncompromising and intense from the first reel up until the final hodgepodge of a bloodbath.Overall this was a fairly decent noirish piece with a prosaic story glossed by few slick action sequences that will likely get some fans rallied. Although the film shares few similarities with OldBoy it doesn't compare nor achieves the brute straightforwardness seen in such films as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Peppermint Candy. It was stylistically directed with pleasant music and cinematography but it ultimately left me unaffected by the underdevelopment of characters leading up to the final showdown. Maybe it was its intent to come off this way but at the end of the day I am merely a film fan looking for characters to empathize with be they cold hearted rapists or washed out ex silver medalists on a bad luck streak.Nevertheless this film is still recommended and is much better than what Hollywood puts out there most of the time. Give it a try and hopefully you'll find it more overall satisfying than I did.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's seems like there is no stopping Korean cinema as the year isn't yet over and they've already released a handful of spectacular features. Aside from Sympathy for Lady Vengeance A Bittersweet Life was the second revenge driven film I was eagerly awaiting. I kept my expectations at a reasonable level even though I was well aware of Kim's reputation his eye for capturing detail and his strength at creating eerie atmosphere.And the atmosphere here was felt right from the start. Byunghun Lee plays Sunwoo a hotel restaurant enforcer and a trusted henchman to a powerful crime boss. From the initial glimpse Lee carries heavily confined mannerisms and easily achieves seriousness and believability. The action although a bit reminiscent of the Far East style is intense yet touches the limits of implausibility much like the ending. I must say that it wasn't the action that held my interest at first but Lee's character who was sharply followed by the camera through the nights of driving and contemplating. He vacantly lives from one day to next feeling strongly disconnected from the world around him but still manages his duties to perfection and to much praise from his boss Kang.That's until he gets entrusted by Kang to carry out a short task involving his young mistress. The female character had some potential in the beginning as she evoked some elusive feelings in our gloomy lead but she was abruptly shelved. The story makes the turning point as his mission goes awry but before I was able to question the cause and effect next came the brutally unprecedented fight between Sunwoo and the thugs. This helped the story quite a bit since it showed how something small and avoidable could turn into something big and ugly.This surprisingly fills approximately half of the film. The remaining time offers few black comedic elements fistful of rapid shooting sequences and even hints at a possibility of a Mexican standoff. Not to nitpick or complain but purely for the sake of conversing and since the movie is labeled as a real life actioner there are moments when you think just why weren't these gangsters carrying guns at so many instances? And no I didn't ask the same question with Kill Bill.In the beginning of the film Sungwoo recited Master are the branches moving or is it the wind?  That which moves is neither the branches or the wind...It's your heart and mind. I'm no expert at this or a big fan of decoding messages but I think that it could simply mean that Sungwoo or the audience never meant to know what specifically cradled his life into such reveries nor was Sunwoo able find any grounds of communication with his former boss who sometimes looked at him as if he was his own son.Regardless could seven years of being a loyal servant to a respectful boss really have pushed both parties into such desperate measures over this? Perhaps he was too stubborn or jealous of Kang to reveal his cause but why did he decide to help Heesoo in the first place? Maybe he wanted her to go back to Kang and make him happy. After all he was such a calculating person that didn't desire love. Maybe it was just because she found him boring and ethereally played cello? Sunwoo's final quote suggested his envision of a dream or its demise. He failed to achieve what he desired. I failed to fully grasp what he desired as well. Perhaps he wanted a more ambiguous finale that gangsters rarely get afforded in reality but the one he received was pretty dubious on its own.

Starting with the film's visual aspect it definitely sets the tone of cool almost like the grayish gloomy tones in Le SamuraiIf you loved this movie you must see Le Samurai by Herman Melville. His hotel room lacks emotion and appeal just barren and simple like Sunwoo. The Dolce la Vita bar sways the mood of Sunwoo into this absurd fragile yet dangerous atmosphere of the Korean gangs. All the blood reds jet blacks and pure white symbolizes the world of Sunwoo to us professionally pure yet ruthlessly violent. The acting in this film was superb and extraordinarily done. All the characters only display primary emotions happiness anger fear and dismay. I know this might turn you off as saying there is a lack of extensive creativity in the world of thugs creativity can not exist. MunSuk was damn fine as an incompetent yet super suckup to Mr.Kang and he proved it until the end as a backstabbing usual thug. President Kang well he won a best supporting actor and you'll damn get a kick out of him his raunchy thuggish snarls to his straightforward astonishing violent attacks. Everyone else is simply brilliant and worth watching. In terms of violence this is the most COOOOOOOOLEST gun scenes you'll ever see. Nothing flashy pansy this movie god damn rocked.

	schema:headline " Korean action that plays like a pumpedup HK crime film but at the cost of banal emotion";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm writing this mostly to put thoughts into order on the idea of a film manipulating the audience. It comes up on film forums now and then and I can agree in principle because I recognize it from personal experience that some films enable the viewer to experience a feeling while other films demand it of him but watching KJW's film made it more clear for me. The formula of the revenge film is put in full practice here as a plot in the first half we get the cruel injustice in the second half the furious vengeance yet KJW believes he's making more than a revenge film. The trouble here is that stock characters are put through the motions of living stock feelings and the bodyguard ordered to watch his boss's girlfriend falls in love because the film demands it of him. The film opens with a shot of trees blowing in the wind and a quote of the most banal philosophy is it the branches moving or the wind? it's your heart and mind. This is trying to resemble a Wong Kar Wai film with the crucial difference that the sadness and longing feel artificial not the result of personal conviction but rather that these ideas would look good on the film. That may be because KJW relishes the bloodshed. No other part of the film receives the care and attention of the scenes of violence.Yet by the end of it KJW isn't satisfied with a crime flick where blood gushes out of bullet holes of which it's a good one he wants emotion to pour out of the finale. For all this to work for me for me to be able to acquiesce to the experience as something worth opening myself to I need to hear the film play itself. Like a music instrument a film that plays itself is music to my ears good or bad at least it's an effort. I want to be able to see the film absorbed by its music like it doesn't even matter I'm there. KJW's film wants to play me to use me as the music instrument to create emotion. A melancholy piano tunes in the right moment we get a shot of the protagonist shedding a tear this fabricated emotion is then cut by the loud bang of a pistol. To get back to what I wrote above some films let me determine whether I will be sad or angry A Bittersweet Life anxiously expects it of me it's like the film is studying my reactions to see will I shed a tear. To the degree that all films are artifice it could have something to do with different levels of transparency to that artifice.I don't know if KJW's problem is that he doesn't have obsessions as a filmmaker. This is the third of his films I've actively disliked and all three of them are vastly different to each other. He's good with technique but like Tarantino he seems he doesn't have anything personal to share. In place of nothing to exorcize he seems to pick every time a different genre to stave off boredom. As though anxious to prevent that same boredom in his audience he fills his movies with passing thrills. At the same time he aspires to more than passing thrills yet when the time comes for his film to express a conviction that the world is a certain way we get banalities.".

	schema:reviewBody "After seeing thousands of Asian films the tendency for the average viewer is to become jaded. How many revenge movies can one see until the premise get's old? How many Asian shocks does it take before being the jolts become normal? That being said every once in a while a film comes along that rejuvenates my faith in Asian cinema. A film that takes the simple and tired old formula and spins it into a masterpiece of epic proportions. A Bittersweet Life is one of those films. A masterwork of Korean Cinema that doesn't fail to impress even the most jaded viewer and at the same time doesn't leap into a formulaic revenge flick.The story is simple Kim Sunwoo is an enforcer for a Korean Mob Boss Mr. Kang. One day Mr. Kang announces that he'll be leaving for a few days and asks Kim if he'll watch over his mistress while he's gone. Mr. Kang suspects that his mistress has taken another lover and asks Kim to watch over her and if he happens to catch her in the act to immediately call him or take care of them. Kim eventually does catch the mistress cheating with another young man. Instead of following his boss' wishes Kim decides to let them go. When the boss comes back and realizes he's been lied to he tries to have Kim killed. He is unsuccessful and soon all hell breaks loose.A Bittersweet Life is a masterpiece of contemporary Korean Cinema on par with that of ParkChan Wook's Oldboy and Bong Joonho's Memories of Murder. The central reason for this would obviously be Kim JiWoon's expert direction. Just as he revitalized the Korean Horror genre with a Tale of Two Sisters he does so with the Korean Gangster flick in A Bittersweet Life. Kim Ji Y also does an excellent job bringing Kim Ji's vision to life and many of the shots in the film border on breathtaking. In particular the shots filmed in the rain of exiled Sunwoo surrounded by a cloud black umbrella's held by Mr. Kang's syndicate are incredible.Another of the film's big strengths is the score. The film's music features Spanishinspired guitar pieces techno pseudo classical violin pieces and jazzysalsa influenced guitar riffs and all work perfectly with the film ever changing moods. Indeed the film's music is almost as important to the whole package as Byunghun Lee superb performance.And speaking of Byunghun Lee he really is the glue that holds the production together. Towards the beginning of the film he plays the role of Sunwoo as a very quiet and subdued almost pathetic except for when he has to kick some major ass which he does in style but an event about halfway through the film hardens him and he is resurrected into a monster of sorts one hellbent on revenge for his former boss.Oh and who could forget the action? A Bittersweet Life is full of hard brutal action the kind I love so much. The film's action is spread liberally throughout the film unlike much of the other Korean Gangster films which usually only have spattering of violence here and there. Jung Doo Hong's action scenes are no nonsense. There's no flashy KungFu sequences just brutal realistic fights and gunplay although some of it is a bit over the top. The last 20 minutes of the film features a balls to the wall finale as Sunwoo singlehandedly takes on the entire syndicate in a sequence strongly reminiscent of Brian Depalma's Scarface.Bottom Line A Bittersweet Life is an unabashed masterpiece of Korean Cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a revenge movie pure and simple. When it comes to this genre the protagonist usually has some injustice loosely used here done unto him and therefore unleashes hell upon those who incurred his wrath who of course failed to finish him off in the first place.Sunwoo Lee Byunghun is a hotel manager. Or so he seems. On the surface he's calm cool and collected. But step out of line he brings upon his fury without remorse and without sympathy. His cockiness earns him no admirers but he gives his utmost loyalty towards his boss President Kang.He leads a lonely existence without friends and in his latest mission strikes a forbidden friendship with his prey that led to his ostracizing from the clan he belongs to. Relying on his personal judgement in contradiction with his boss's he consciously interpreted his mission ambiguously and this led to his downfall. In the mob as a servant you do not think but carry out orders like a faithful dog. Such is his life for seven years until now.As with revenge films those who go against you must die and you soon find yourself up against impossible odds and with incredible luck. At times the movie stretches its realism to the limit but for the purpose of good violent fun. The violence is gratuitous  shootings up close bleeding by the buckets handbreaking fistfighting at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson.But thumbs up for the action pieces which were well choreographed especially the escape fight scene you must learn never to give a few minutes to a hitman and the climatic shoot out finale. Poetry in motion some might add at times shot like John Woo's slowmotion style with classical music in the background. Various bad characters are up for our antihero's dispatch and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible.On the other end of the spectrum this film also had incredible amounts of silence and nonaction which punctuated between the action sequences well. Sort of like a breather  the calm before the next storm.The relationship element between Sunwoo and Heesoo Shin Mina however was never fully explored. It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue this was never brought across in a clear manner and left open to interpretation. Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters. Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit.Nonetheless as a revenge movie this film delivered. But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast stylish action and of course bloody violence.".

The violence is gratuitous  shootings up close bleeding by the buckets handbreaking fistfighting at times making the audience cringe at too much crimson.But thumbs up for the action pieces which were well choreographed especially the escape fight scene you must learn never to give a few minutes to a hitman and the climatic shoot out finale. Poetry in motion some might add at times shot like John Woo's slowmotion style with classical music in the background. Various bad characters are up for our antihero's dispatch and you'll find yourself rooting that he does so with as much pain as possible.On the other end of the spectrum this film also had incredible amounts of silence and nonaction which punctuated between the action sequences well. Sort of like a breather  the calm before the next storm.The relationship element between Sunwoo and Heesoo Shin Mina however was never fully explored. It was hinted that the cause of the rift between servant and master was the woman but because of the lack of explicit narrative and dialogue this was never brought across in a clear manner and left open to interpretation. Another element that somewhat fell flat was the forced attempts to inject humour with bumbling characters. Felt a bit out of place and the pacing suffered a tad bit.Nonetheless as a revenge movie this film delivered. But there's somewhat a nagging thought in me that it could and should have reached its full potential given the superb cast stylish action and of course bloody violence.";

Asian fight scenes and automatic weaponry with a fetish for knives abounds. Other movies do the same thing better such as hard boiled one of the classics.

The difference between a modern Hollywood thriller and Korean cinema is that you question yourself is he going to live is he? And often you are un pleasantly surprised.The film follows a crime boss and his enforcer who happens to be a man of honor in his own sense and not a big fan of well words. The film is a single story line but branches off rivalry between different mafia houses the chiefs girlfriend the enforcer love revenge a whole lot of kicking ass and broken bones. But simply put its a story about doing what's right and love more importantly this still is a better love story than twilight. Not a lot of films in this genre leave a big smile on your face when they end this with its irony does.The other major difference would be feeling empathy while Sundance and other festival showcase the hard hitting dramas of Hollywood pick a Korean action film and it still would make you feel something.The cinematography is phenomenal it doesn't go crazy with color tones and doesn't care much about CGI its all really nicely thought out shots and well done stunts. There are some gorgeous frames that you don't see everyday and the way they show you something happening without explaining the whole thing or body is just beautiful.Bonus points for gangster film with no nudity and well there is gore lots of it you don't like blood? This one isn't for you.The action is paced really nicely there are buildups and then serene moments. If raid is action films headliners done right this is raid without the red bull. Music is a bit of a let down but makes up for it with a great sound mix.This one definitely goes in my must watch list.

Cheesy romances featuring teenagers are really not my usual viewing but The Classic was just beautiful. I am not familiar with Korean cinema and have never seen 'My Sassy Girl' so I cannot comment on how it measures as a followup. But as a movie standing on its own it was a touching tearjerking and humorous 2 hour journey for me. The cinematography was outstanding and paired with an equally impressive soundtrack it created beautiful scenes of the Korean countryside as well as enhancing the generally poignant nostalgic mood of the film. The acting was first class all around in my opinion the movie could've so easily gone overboard with badacting considering the general plot of the movie but never once did I find myself irritated by the lead female. The casting was perfect and I was absolutely charmed by the characters of Junho and the hilarious Taesu. There were also a lot of comical elements in the movie which had me laughing off my sofa making the characters endlessly endearing. The film takes us through a journey of many years in the past from when the characters' parents first meet and had me bawling my eyes out at the end. The modern day story is just as good too. The film also finishes with what I consider two big surprises which had me thinking about the movie for ages afterwards.All in all I am really surprised that I liked this film. After considering why this was so since I really don't like romanticcomedy dramas I came to the simple conclusion that this was just great filmaking where the watcher gets utterly lost in the movie. It may not be very realistic and however long we analyse it and it's clichs at the end all we know is that we were moved and entertained by this movie.".

The story then shifts to the past where the mother is a young woman who falls in love with a guy but she herself is arranged to be married with the guy's friend.  There's a parallel between the past and present and the story shifts back and forth between two romances. I found this movie to be a wellexecuted Korean melodrama.  The cinematography is quite beautiful.  However it is rather cliche in some parts as some aspects of the director's previous work feels a bit repeated here yet as a movie itself it is a wellfilmed nicely delivered piece of work.  It is kind of unfortunate however given the popularity and the expectations given to the movie due to the director's more accomplished previous work My Sassy Girl this reviewer couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed.   If I hadn't seen the previous work and saw this movie for the first time I might've given higher praise.  As it is however the movie almost accomplishes in being a truly great movie as opposed to good which it is.   Occasional inventiveness in composition and atmosphere and timing is excellent.  The movie does tend to be a bit predictable particularly if you know what kind of themes the director has presented in his previous work and admittedly I saw the ending coming sooner than I probably should have althogh it didn't really distract me from enjoying it either.  One can't help whenever one sees a rainy scene or when a certain Pachebel music comes out one is reminded of a scene directly from My Sassy Girl As My Sassy Girl actually pokes fun at melodramas Without some of those distractions it may have resonated a lot more strongly as an original piece of work.  In terms of characters they are certainly memorable  and the romantic elements while not as multidimensional or as deep as the director's previously mentioned work are convincing.  There are some historical backdrops to go along the romance that gives the film a somewhat a denser almost epic if not nostalgic feel yet doesn't really go in the way of an epic which itself might not have been a bad direction to go. Some of the attention to detail are also pretty well done.  Overall though I enjoyed the film as a romantic melodrama while being a bit hampered by tough expectations and some cliches the characters and the romance certainly leaves a nice impression.".

	schema:reviewBody "So a lot of people have compared this director's work to his previous work My Sassy Girl which came out about 2 years before this one did. There have been many comparisons between this one and that and while there are similar themes in choice of music and themes I would say it is like comparing apples to oranges. MSG was funny and then got dramatic hence it is a romancecomedy with some drama if anything i would call Windstruck MSG 2. This one was mostly a dramatic romance story with a few very classical clichs. There is enough foreshadowing that you can guess what is going to happen if you pay any attention at all and have seen any Korean drama but the director still does an excellent job in telling the story.The main characters do an excellent job acting and bringing out the character's emotions. The story is beautiful and so is the music. Enjoy it for what it is if you have a heart at all you'll be teary eyed. You'll know what is coming and you'll still be floored by it thats how good it is. Even the ending which I thought was a bit over the top is the only way you could have ended a classic.I am a little hesitant to say that this is a date movie definitely not for a first date. I would think that any emotionally sensitive human being is not going to be particularly happy throughout most of this movie until the very end. Such is a melodrama.".

But soon she find out that her mother Joohee's love story was surprisingly similar like her's.From the bright and colorful scenery and nice camera shots The Classic is a true Classic. The acting of Son ye jin is superb convincing and great. She manages her emotion balanced it and finely shaded. Sure if you've seen this movie and your an avid romantic movie fan it will remind you some love story classics such as Love Letter by Shunji Iwai and The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. Yes there are some elements of Love Letter and The Notebook but the story is completely different. The story is shifting from different time frames from 1968 to 2002 but still the director balanced the story so the viewers will not have a bad time on understanding the story.And no one can call this a CLASSIC without it's beautiful fantastic and brilliant soundtrack. The song of Scenery of Bicycle riding is one of the best OST's I've ever heard.The scenery is also excellent. The country side setting is amazing and the place is very romantic. The war scene which is shot proudly in my home town PHILIPPINES! was also excellent. You'll appreciate the beauty of the place even though the scene was pretty sad. The cameraman's magnificent shots helped!This Valentine season if you haven't seen The Classic then WATCH IT NOW! And fall in love...1010".

The movie begins with the story of the daughter.  From the beginning the movie showcases the stunning Korean scenery and beautiful camera angles.  The movie unfolds with the telling of the daughter Chihye and her crush Sangmin a boyfriend of her friend Sukyeong.   The movie quickly dives into the heart of the movie when the daughter discovers her mother's diary about her first love.  This my fellow movie aficionado is the start of the Classic.  For sake of brevity and not giving away the plot I will not go into detail about this wonderfully written and wonderfully acted movie.  There are some flaw in the movie but even with that I am blown away by how emotionally gripping and satisfying the story and acting of the main actress Son Yehjin and Cho Seunwoo who play's the mother's love interest. The musical scores and selections are awesome and very fitting to the mood of the story. The movie title suggests a classic Korean love story but in the end I can't help but wish that I too could have experienced such level of love.   For the romantic at heart and those who want to experience the full range of human emotion watch this movie better yet own this movie.".

I'm sure the director wasn't making this movie unique so that it would stand out like his previous movie but instead wanted to make a movie that makes people remember what cheesy romances were like back in the days.

Classic is not strictly just a love story but a story about humanity and relationships of all kinds friendship and the bond between children and parents. I am reminded of Amelie for it's lightness of spirit and dips into the imaginative and the fanciful. An underlying belief in romance rules the characters in both films. Classic is a complete package there are no loose ends and instead at the end you can take a deep breath and feel satisfied. I think that this would be a great foriegn film for someone who doesn't like foreign films to see because the actors portray the characters and their stories so convincingly that you can read the humanity without understanding the language. The quality of the acting and entire composition of the movie make it universal. It's inspiring to know that even in 2003 a film can be created that is truly timeless.".

	schema:reviewBody "A new Cho Seung Woo fan I had to see this film and he once again blew me away. This film is wonderful because it really does portray classic love stories both the past couple and the present couple meet and court in very special and sweet ways. My favorite moment of the film is when the past couple gets stuck in the rain and the boy breaks a watermelon open for them to eat. Without nudity or racy dialogue it is obvious that these people are in love. The cinematography is breathtaking the acting is topnotch and the storyline is as pure and innocent as the main characters. We need more films like this! I'm tired of the romantic films that show two teens meeting at a party. This is a truly classic love story that offers a albeit idealized version of something we can all relate to falling in love with that one special person. If you like foreign films this one is a treasure. If you like romantic films this one is a mustsee. If you want something the entire family can watch together this one is great.".

	schema:headline " Director Kwak Jaeyoung's not so successful followup to My Sassy Girl";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers! Spoilers!My list of Korean romance continues to grow. List in my comments on Wanee and Juhan. The latest addition Classic however is slightly disappointing. Whether it's director Kwak or the Korean romance genre as a whole there seems to be a general tendency of running out of originality and resorting to clich. Classic does not have the poignancy of My Sassy Girl which is moving because what starts out looking bizarre ends up being very touching and convincingly intact. As I have rewatch Sassy Girl in DVD just a couple of weeks ago the comparison is all too clear. Very briefly Classic tells two love stories a girl falling in love with her best friend's beau and her mother's first love mainly through her eyes browsing through the latter's diary.The focus is mainly on the mother's story with a little bit of the Cyrano plot but the letters play a much smaller part here. The biggest flaw here is that the reason for Juhie the mother parting with Junho is not convincing. That these two people truly in love would part just because Taeso tries to hang himself for not being able to win the heart of a rich girl his father wants as a daughterinlaw verges on absurdity. In addition to have Junho go to war and blinded so as to craft a tearjerking scene also fails to move at least not this viewer who was deeply moved by My Sassy Girl.The second story of the daughter Jihae likewise fails to strike a cord of resonance mainly because of the unimpressive performance of Cho Insung as Sangmin. Generally the plot is too contrived culminating in Sangmin being the son of Junho. Yes I know that this may be considered the very essence of the plot the unfulfilled love of the first generation finally answered in the second. This however backfires in taking away some of the beauties in the simplicity of the two separate love stories.  While falling short overall Classics has individual scenes and elements that are commendable. I particularly like the two love scenes in the rain of mother and daughter both beautifully filmed to bring out the best of the traditional charm in Korean romances. The title melody Korean I believe is hauntingly lovely though not as captivating as I believe' in My Sassy Girl which has to be the most beautiful film melody in recent years.Son Yejin is unquestionably the reason to watch this film. While not as pretty as Jun JiHyun My Sassy Girl Son has her own quiet charm that grows as you watch. After an impressive debut in Lover's Concerto Son has considerable challenge in playing both mother an daughter in Classic. In an interview director said that initially he intended to have two actresses play the two roles but as shooting progressed he became convinced that Son should play both. Looking at the result I think that separately Son did well on both roles. However if you put them together the inhibition of the modern' daughter and the expressive style of the traditional' mother blur the difference between the two so that the plaited hair of the mother sometimes serves as the most distinctive difference.".

	schema:headline " Definitely A Korean Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The Classic is about a movie between the romantic relationship between a motherJoohae and her daughterJiha. Both Joohae and Jihae was played excellently by Korean superstarSon Yejin.It gives the viewer an understanding about the emotions brought about by lovethe aspect of how probably fate affects our love relationship and the good and bad feeling of being in love. The movie begins with Jihae and Sookyoung are friends attending the same university and both have a crush on Sangmin who is in their drama club. The more clamorous and outgoing of the two Sookyoung asks Ji hae to do her a favor  write a love letter to Sangmin. Jihae pours out her own feelings for him on paper but sadly in her friend's name. Touched by the letter Sangmin is attracted to Sookyoung and Jihae feeling uncomfortable and even guilty tries to avoid him. And yet by coincidence or by fate she keeps running into him. Jihae has lived alone with her mom since her childhood when her dad unexpectedly passed away. Her mom is now on a trip abroad and to wile away her solitude she starts cleaning the attic. There Jihae finds a secret box in which her mom kept the memorabilia of her first love story of some decades past. Summer in 1968 Joonha is visiting his uncle's home in the countryside during his summer vacation. There he meets Joohee and falls in love at first sight. One day the lovely Joohee secretly asks Joonha to escort her to a haunted house in the village. Happy and excited to be at her service Joonha meets her at their promised spot. But in an unexpected storm the two lose their boat and barely manage to return home at a very late hour. Joohee gets into big trouble for this incident and is sent back to Seoul. Having parted with Joohee without a word of farewell Joonha spends the rest of the summer heavyhearted. With summer vacation being over Joonha also returns to Seoul. At school his classmate Taesu asks him to write a love letter to send to a girl. And who would it be but Joohee Joonha's dream girl. Unable to confess his own summer love story Joonha reluctantly complies with his friend's request. The movie was stars as I have mentionedSon Yejinwho was sincere and excellent in her performance as the mother and the daughter.She made her performance interesting that viewers to do care for both her characters. The other cast namely Cho InSung and Cho SeungWoo does not fail to disappoint.It was directed by Kwak Jaeyoungwho is known for his movies like My Sassy Girl and Windstruck.His direction was just as great as the two movies that I have mentioned.It ultimately started my love affair with Korean movies and my admiration for Son Yejinone of the best actresses in Asia. Highly recommended for it is not just like any other chick flick out there but a classic one.".

It reminded me of how I was in high school thinking the world would end if Susie Derkins didn't dance with me at homecoming. Yeah pathetic.But folks I'm glad I stuck around for the 2nd half. It really gets interesting complex and ponderous. Whereas the 1st half showed us nothing more than a sappy boy loves girl but they're too dumb to do anything about it plot part 2 is rife with situational  psychological shockers... child abuse death suicide war protests  political tyranny all figure in albeit in minute doses but certainly enough to create some real tension  intrigue which had been missing from the first 45 mins. What I thought would be a predictable sappy romance had a few very nice surprises in store and the ending was powerful on both emotional and philosophical levels.My only complaint is that it took so long to get there and when it finally did it felt a bit rushed. I would have loved for the 2nd half to have been an entire movie by itself.Overall it was a worthwhile experience although I sensed just a tinge of budding pretentiousness which is inevitable amongst bright new directors who are following up their 1st smash hit see also Tom Tykwer Jean Pierre Jeunet. Yes I cannot help comparing this to its wonderful predecessor My Sassy Girl which was a bit more raw  endearing like an intimate piece of chamber music while Classic is a bit more like a symphonic endeavour. What's wrong with writing chamber music if you're good at it? Why do successful artist have to go diving into a bloody symphony all the time? And why the hell didn't Susie Derkins dance with me at homecoming??? Whoops sorry I got a lil carried away there.OK and speaking of music I really liked what they did in this movie. It's a bit odd to feature 18th century Baroqueclassical composers Bach Mozart Beethoven in a 20th century Korean story but hey it worked.".

	schema:headline " The Classic Film Analysis";
	schema:reviewBody "Director and writer Kwak Jaeyong's film the classic is a melodramatic romance that simultaneously tells the love stories of a mother and daughter. But there is much more to this movie than just a beautiful love story. By examining the political back drop of the movie and understanding a little more about Korean history a much more complex situation is revealed. The director has done an incredible job of subtlety telling us the political reality of Korea in the 1970's and even has the boldness of suggesting a solution to The Korean Peninsulas most troubling problem reunification with the north.When analyzing film or literature it's important to pay attention to detail. Especially when something seems out of place. It usually means the writer is trying to tell us something. One thing that struck me as odd right away was the white doves in the opening scene of the film. Why were the birds white doves? And why did Jihye have such difficulty swooshing them away? This is a subtle message that will be examined in more detail during the conclusion. First we must understand the historical back drop of the film.Korea in the 1960's and 70's was a time of change political and social turmoil and a time when Korea was struggling with its identity. This was the third republic and the president was Major General Park Chunghee. Under Park Koreas economy greatly increased however many Koreans were frustrated with the harsh autocratic ways of the regime. Students and teachers unions led many demonstrations and protests leading to sometimes violent clashes. This is illustrated constantly in the film with repetitive military images and the fact that two of the main characters are doing there mandatory military time. We see that the military is often cruel in its handling with the young men as they are beaten for seemingly no reason at all. Also we see images of the student protests of the autocratic military regime. Despite these images in the movie some would agree that Park was an effective administrator and did help Korea on the path to what they are today a highly successful liberal democracy. Also it's important to know that Park was a staunch anticommunist and desired for Korean reunification.So how is this reflected in the film? I believe that Joohee and Joonha's heartbreaking and traumatic love story is meant to represent the splintering of the Korean peninsula. The two young lovers want desperately to be together however circumstances beyond their control is preventing this from happening. Just like hundreds of thousands of relatives in North and South Korea were split due to circumstances beyond their control.Finally let's return to the white doves in the opening scene. As we see in the beginning of the film white doves have rested on Jihye's window sill. These presumably wild birds do not seem at all frightened when Jihye approaches them and she actually has to struggle to push them out of the window. Why is this and why did the director choose the bird of peace? I believe that the birds represent the yeaning that Korea has to reunite the peninsula there is still a strong desire for peace. However Jihye represents a younger generation of Koreans that do not have that same desire to reunite with the North not like their parents and grandparents do. This is why she unwittingly pushes the birds out the window. However by learning about her mother's love story and the struggles that her mother went through she is able to compose her own love story. The fact that Joohee's daughter and Joonha's son have fallen in love represents the unification of the two Koreas. Therefore I think that the message the director is trying to make is that in order for Korea to unite its imperative that the younger generation understand the struggles that their parents and grandparents went through during those traumatic times. And just like it was Sangmin and Jihye's destiny to complete the unfinished love story of their parents it is the new generation of young Koreans responsibility to help reunite the Korean peninsula before it's too late.".

The only thing that left me 'errr...' is how the time shift at the scene where Joonha kissed Joo hee was executed. I didn't realize that the timeshift had gone back until they zoomed Joonha you may notice by the firefly ending scene where it looked so similar so i was quite unaware at that time. Other than that... This movie is awesome. You might sob real bad the ending when Sangmin was later known that he's Joonha's son was completely unexpected and i burst into tears so bad i guess i should dry my pillow.

Maybe to make it in a way the audiences can relate to when it comes to the present and so the ending can be a bit different. But despite few slight other aspects it just didn't seem all that necessary. The movie also felt a bit drawn out a bit as it progressed. It had a decent start but felt a bit too sappy at times and drawn out. Despite it having some flaws it felt like a decent romance movie to watch with a date or as a couple. Personally this was a romance movie for certain parts I could relate with thus during some parts it felt sort of moving. And to some degree it brings about emotion and the melodramatic elements work for the most part even if it comes off as silly sometimes. I can't really say this is a classic romance movie but it's a good one that is worth a watch.7.310".

There's no doubt about it though that these stars have far better films under their belts.I am not sure So Jisub knows Mandarin so I suspect he was saying his few lines phonetically. He does better with his natural Korean but I suppose he was hired here to be eye candy for the females in the audience.  There is too much reliance on CGI in this film as well. I quickly lose patience when filmmakers rely too heavily on it for gags and story plot lines instead of the actors doing natural humor. The best screen comedians in film history did NOT rely on special effects.The story is about a woman's revenge in trying to get her doctor boyfriend back from a film star he was fallen in love with. She has a huge imagination in dreaming up ways to get him back but unfortunately her ways do not generate sympathy toward her character. For instance putting glass shards down on the bathroom floor for her rival to step on? That's going too far. If you can't win him back honestly then maybe he's not for you in the first place.7 out of 10 on the IMDb.".

He does better with his natural Korean but I suppose he was hired here to be eye candy for the females in the audience.  There is too much reliance on CGI in this film as well. I quickly lose patience when filmmakers rely too heavily on it for gags and story plot lines instead of the actors doing natural humor. The best screen comedians in film history did NOT rely on special effects.The story is about a woman's revenge in trying to get her doctor boyfriend back from a film star he was fallen in love with. She has a huge imagination in dreaming up ways to get him back but unfortunately her ways do not generate sympathy toward her character. For instance putting glass shards down on the bathroom floor for her rival to step on? That's going too far. If you can't win him back honestly then maybe he's not for you in the first place.7 out of 10 on the IMDb.";

She is aided by a cute guy who has a past with the actress. Together they try to wreck the relationship and send the boyfriend back to Sophie. Of course there are other complications.Sue me I laughed. Its unreal and I didn't care. I just sat and laughed and waited to see what happened next. Sure you know the course the romance will take but how it gets there has some nice twists. Yes the film has a cruel edge with Sophie getting abused but at the same time the film maintains a really nice charm.I liked it. Its not high art and to be honest an hour after its done you'll have forgotten you saw it but for two hours its a nice distraction.".

Though I just wish the ending would have had more detail. But all in all it's good funny and entertaining. Also the theme song Very Perfect by Harlem Yu and Angela Zhang is totally sweet and captivating. Somehow I feel like it would have added more sweet feeling to the movie if the song was played in more parts of the story. Got addicted to the song as a matter of fact.

She is so awful in this gosh like I said not only is her acting bad she really needs to work on her facial expressions cause it turns off the mood of what it's trying to achieve. This is about a crazy girl who can't deal with break up and goes bonkers and starts doing retarded stuff and most of it isn't cute at all. Even for a silly romantic comedy it just doesn't work.

It is a social commentary and a beautifully told fable. To call it a romantic comedy to compare it to an American movie with a similar title is to miss the point entirely.Warning before you watch this movie you'd better figure out where you can find a local source for black bean noodles 'jajangmyun' in Korean. Even if you've never tasted them you'll be craving them by the end of the movie. I have tasted them  fresh from a street vendor in Seoul  and I'm now nearly wild for black bean noodles.And this basic hunger for a simple comfort food  for enjoyment of sustenance with all the associations that come with true comfort food  sums up the movie nicely.".

	schema:reviewBody "For almost 2 weeks ago I was told that there was a new movie being showed at out local cinema. I said cool. Then I was told the reviewers didn't actually know what to say about the movie and just told everyone to go see it for yourselves. Then I said  we should give this movie a try.We bought tickets sat down in the smallest cinema room I had ever been in with 5 other people. I asked what the title of this movie was and I was told it was Castaway On The Moon. I thought it would be a ripoff of the movie Castaway but would involve space.The movie started. I immediately started giving myself predictions of what would happen next. And very early in the beginning I was convinced it was going to ripoff the movie Castaway even thought the beginning of this movie had nothing to do with the Tom Hanks movie.After very few minutes I stopped thinking. I stopped thinking about everything. My mind was literally not awake. The only part of my body that was there was my eyes and ears and now I will forever take care them. Because without my eyes and ears I would never ever had been able to witness this piece of unexplainable incredible art!This film is art. It is one of the best examples of moving art. Moving as a picture that moves and as in an emotion not possible to really explain.Even though it's not so to say an English speaking movie it is still meant for the western audience. In fact it's meant for the western northern southern and eastern audience.I didn't for a moment think about the composition the lighting the color work or any of that stuff. Not even the acting. Everything was just.. well I can't put another name on it that perfect!This movie has so many messages and shows them all in such a brilliant way! I could only name a couple but I know there are so many more..... I just don't know how to put words on them. Even showing is something I do not know how to do. It's just something you have to see think about and understand.I can't tell you how good this is or how bad it is because it's neither. It's not good it's not bad it's something else that stretches above the words knows as good great brilliant and incredible. I don't know whatever word that would be and I don't even think there is a word for it or can ever be a word for it! It's just something you feel. And that is what this movie is! It is a feeling! Not a word not a story! It is a feeling! Everything this movie film a piece of art you can call it whatever you want but that's what this is!I know this is a lot of praise for a movie and many will probably question what I have said about this movie but I'm telling you this is a movie you have to see for yourself!When the movie ended I sat in my chair just watching and listening to the credits waiting for my brain to catch up with everything my eyes and ears had just experienced. As the last person left I left the theater.On my way back I was walking with those who watched the movie with me and I could not come up with a single word to say. And neither could my company. We were all just walking without a word and didn't manage to say anything until we got home. During that 10 minute walk it felt like we were all just trying to come up with something to say about the movie but no one could do it! When we started talking again we didn't mention the movie. We didn't mention it because we didn't know what to say about it.When I try to explain this movie I literally say It's a movie. I say nothing negative about it and nothing positive either cause no matter how many words I use I could never ever be able to explain it!This movie isn't a movie. It's not a film. It's honestly a feeling. Which is why I can't explain this amazing experience with words or even show it. It must be felt. It must be experienced.".

	onyx:emotionText "For almost 2 weeks ago I was told that there was a new movie being showed at out local cinema. I said cool. Then I was told the reviewers didn't actually know what to say about the movie and just told everyone to go see it for yourselves. Then I said  we should give this movie a try.We bought tickets sat down in the smallest cinema room I had ever been in with 5 other people. I asked what the title of this movie was and I was told it was Castaway On The Moon. I thought it would be a ripoff of the movie Castaway but would involve space.The movie started. I immediately started giving myself predictions of what would happen next. And very early in the beginning I was convinced it was going to ripoff the movie Castaway even thought the beginning of this movie had nothing to do with the Tom Hanks movie.After very few minutes I stopped thinking. I stopped thinking about everything. My mind was literally not awake. The only part of my body that was there was my eyes and ears and now I will forever take care them. Because without my eyes and ears I would never ever had been able to witness this piece of unexplainable incredible art!This film is art. It is one of the best examples of moving art. Moving as a picture that moves and as in an emotion not possible to really explain.Even though it's not so to say an English speaking movie it is still meant for the western audience.

To cut a long story short it excels in every aspect of filmmaking  directing script music photography and acting. The main male character is very good but the female is a revelation. This little film blows Hanks' Cast away out of the water completely by originality depth intelligence wit emotionality. And for a film apparently quite sad it contains an amazing amount of humor. It reminded me a little of Chungking Express another Asian favorite of mine as that one is also about social outcasts weirdos loneliness and... food.

	schema:reviewBody "Note Check me out as the Asian Movie Enthusiast on YouTube where I review tons of Asian movies.I would assume that the director of this film saw that Tom Hanks flick and said to himself Hmmm this is a good idea. I think I'll take the same general premise and transform it into a unique romantic comedy that blows away genre conventions. He then proceeded to do exactly that.Some reviewers will claim that Castaway on the Moon aka Moon is a ripoff of the American flick Castaway but what exactly are the similarities between these movies? Let me tell you. 1 There's a guy who gets stranded on an island but that barely counts as a similarity because in Moon the island is positioned within the city limits. A man in massive debt attempts suicide by jumping off of a bridge but he survives and is washed ashore an uninhabited tiny island on the Han river. Even though he clearly sees the nearby metropolis he can't swim across the river to civilization so he just stays on the island for a while. How is this in any way similar to Tom Hanks being stranded in the middle of the ocean? Answer it isn't the least bit similar. 2 There are various daytoday events that are similar e.g. starting fires growing a beard entertaining oneself in simplistic ways etc. but anyone stranded on an island would do these things and people have been doing them for the better part of humanity's existence. These were not invented by a Tom Hanks movie. 3 There's an emotional bond with a few inanimate objects. Yes this is one element of Moon that could be considered a ripoff of Castaway. But that's quite literally the only piece of evidence one could muster. Hardly a compelling case. Heck it's so thin that it probably qualifies as more of a homage than anything else.So what exactly makes Moon so different from Castaway? Well for starters Moon is a friggin' romantic comedy! This is evident at about the 30 minute mark when a hikikomori is introduced. For those who are unfamiliar with hikikomori it's a severe psychological condition whereby introverts isolate themselves within a confined area and refuse to interact with other people. What the heck does this additional character have to do with some dude stranded on an island? My dear friends that's the reason why this film is so fantastic why it demolishes romantic comedy genre conventions and why assertions of ripping off Tom Hanks movies are shortsighted and ridiculous.If one really wants to milk the comparisons between these films Moon exposes the romantic elements of Castaway as runofthemill and dull. Just imagine a Joonho Bong film mixed with Chanwook Park's I'm A Cyborg But That's Okay 2006 and you might get a feel for just how quirky and engaging Moon turned out to be. These characters are carefully crafted by first establishing a certain psychological flaw then allowing the characters to slowly face those flaws through the introduction of the stranded island theme. But how do these characters bond if they're isolated from each other? Watch the movie and see.Oh and the previous reviewer might like to know that it was Hollywood who remade A Tale of Two Sisters  2003 My Sassy Girl 2001 Il Mare 2000 Into the Mirror 2003 etc.  all Korean movies. And they're planning on remaking more because it's Hollywood that has run out of ideas. If you think Korean films have no originality you might want to check out Welcome to Dongmakgol 2005 Save the Green Planet 2003 Crush and Blush 2008 Dasepo Naughty Girls 2006 Forbidden Quest 2006 Rules of Dating 2005 If You Were Me 2003 Iri 2008 Oasis 2002 a Chanwook Park film a Joonho Bong a Kim Kiduk film or about 50 other films that I don't feel like listing out.You know what I'll suggest that everyone watch Moon and Castaway in the same evening for proper comparison. It's obvious that the former has stronger more interesting more creative characters. A lot more time and effort was put into the script and it shows.".

	schema:reviewBody "Castaway on the Moon is a 2009 Korean film about 2 people who don't want to interact with society or others anymore. It's a sublime under the radar film to U.S. audiences anyway that's definitely worth a watch. I caught this film when it first came out a few years ago and just watched it again recently. Bottom line it's competently made totally engrossing and absolutely terrific...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!First and foremost this film has nothing to do with living on the moon or being stranded on a far away desert island for eternity it's actually the polar opposite! Some people I call them morons will try to explain that this movie is very similar toa rip off of the American film 'Castaway starring Tom Hanks. Although there are some parallels to be drawn these two films have only one thing in common i.e. there's a guy that's separated from society. Don't get me wrong I actually like Tom Hanks' Castaway quite a bit but aside from the fact the both film's protagonists are stuck on an island these two films aren't really related to each other whatsoever the primary difference being one movie's protagonist wants to get back to his life and the other wants to escape it.What this particular movie is about is a guy who's essentially tired of and has been beaten down by the rat race that is his life in modern society. He wants to end it all by committing suicide but he fails in doing so and is subsequently presented an accidental opportunity to escape from it all instead. After some initial resistance he soon comes to fully embrace this opportunity he has been given. On the parallel side this movie is also about a very odd girl who's afraid of society and can no longer cope in order to function within it. She's long ago shut herself off or perhaps shut herself in would be more appropriate from interacting with anyone on any type of personal level.As the film progresses these two main protagonists who pretty much occupy 95 of the screen time slowly form an unconventional bond via highly unusual means and they each come to rely on one another more and more as time goes by while they both try to overcome their own societal fears concerns and issues as best they can.The way the main characters interact with each other from a distance throughout the entire film is unique profound and charming. Both the primary actor and actress are spot on perfect in their respective roles and they both do a magnificent job of what's asked of them within the framework of the story.Ultimately all this really boils down to is just a simple  finely paced film that it is immensely watchable and quite enjoyable. In many ways it's also a fine little parable regarding what modern society has become over the years and how we all must interact within it or face getting left behind.Personally I could hardly look away from this film. It's equal parts odd funny sweet sad beautiful and it is Borderline Brilliant! What more can I say?...other than Korean cinema does it again!Highly Recommended! Not Optional Viewing! This is a MUST SEE Film!!!9 out of 10 stars!".

This is a truly wonderful little film that to be perfectly honest I wasn't crazy about for the first hour. Where was this going I wondered? And then it clicked and and I suddenly found great wisdom and many smiles and a tear or two in this really one of a kind movie.I'm going to be honest here and say I can tell you what happens but I can't tell you what its like to experience this film. There is just something wonderful that happens as you watch this film and see these two misfits find a better part of themselves.Do me a favor and just see this film and stay with it all the way to the end and I think you'll be rewarded.".

The cast is simply brilliant both the male and female lead expresses every ounce of emotion so well that you 'commit' to the film in an entirely different way you feel connected to these people and you care about what happens to them like you know them. Even the people who makes a short appearance like the mother and the delivery boy does their part so well it makes you want to find out what other movies they were in.The entire film is so brilliantly put together with the writing scripts and editing that in my opinion it can make big Hollywood blockbuster look like a child produced it. It has what most movies lack nowadays and that is 'Heart' you can really tell that the person who directed and produced this film loves it like their only child.To sum up although it is one of the lesser known Korean film everything in this film is in my opinion faultless and I genuinely hope more people watch it. It completely changed my perspective on what is loneliness isolation and happiness.".

He jumps out and falls into the water only to wake up some time later washed up on the shore of an island in the middle of the city under a bridge. When he finally comes to his senses again he decides that he wants to live and tries to escape the island but there is apparently no way out except by boat.. and he doesn't have a boat. After a while he realizes that there is no way off the island so he decides to just survive on the island until he'll be rescued.. it's probably going to happen sooner or later so he just makes himself comfortable until that day.. but he waits.. and waits...and waits.. until he suddenly gets a note from a lonely girl who has been watching him from her house for some time thinking that he's an alien that has been sent from space to keep her company. Through messages in the sand and by bottlemail they exchange words in the alien Englishlanguage for some reason and develop a tight relationship despite the distance between them. I found the film to be very entertaining as the main character is a very funny actor and the script always finds new ways to come up with creative solutions to everyday issues when living on a deserted island and the love story between the two weirdos is also quite moving with a good surprise ending to finish the film on a high note.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Castaway on the Moon the life of young Kim Seonggeun is falling apart he lost his job when the company went under his girlfriend left him and the 75000 loan he took out from socalled interestfree Happy  Cash Loans has morphed into a whopping 209000 because of missed payments. So with nothing left to live for he decides to kill himself by jumping off a bridge into the River Han which runs through the heart of Seoul. Surprisingly he finds himself coming awake on what appears to be a deserted island  yet he can see Seoul not more than a few hundred yards away! Unfortunately he can't swim and for reasons he cannot fathom people passing by on ferries assume he's waving instead of calling for help. Then the battery on his cell phone dies  not that anybody he calls believes his story of being stranded on an island in the middle of the city anyway  and he has to decide how he can survive on his own in the wild....Meanwhile there's a young woman in the city who's so agoraphobic that she's stayed in her room in her parents' house for the past three years creating a fantasy world for herself online and adhering to a strict regimen of diet and exercise her only hobby is to take photographs of the Moon from her window at night using a highpowered camera. On only two days of the year  a 20 minute period in the Spring and one in the Fall when the Civil Defense System runs a drill which requires everybody to stop their vehicles or go indoors  does she have the opportunity to take photos of the city which she loves to do because then it looks as empty of people as the Moon does. On one such special day however her camera spots Kim Seonggeun and because of his to her inexplicable behaviour she immediately decides that he's an alien. She becomes fascinated with him and starts observing him through her camera as he slowly learns how to catch fish and birds and eventually to cultivate edible plants that he grows from undigested seeds found in the poop of birds. Over time she finds a way to leave her room without being seen in order to toss messages in bottles to him he responds by writing in the sand. For some reason this communication is only in English not in Korean so he assumes the bottlewriter must be a foreigner and since she already believes he's an alien she doesn't think anything of it at all. How long can this new way of life last for Kim Seonggeun and will he ever learn the identity of his correspondent? And what might happen when typhoon season approaches? This is a very sweet movie it's mostly very funny but occasionally there's a bit of pathos too and the audience at FantAsia was so taken up with the characters that we all were cheering the moments of triumph that occur throughout. The young woman with social anxiety mirrors what is apparently a serious social problem in Asia young people who lock themselves in their rooms for years at a time living vicariously through the Internet and supported only by their parents' continued good will. I thought it an interestingly realistic touch to bring into this surely fantastical film but the truly wonderful thing about it is its heart. It even made me no noodle lover at all feel hungry for black bean noodles!".

The Hollywood blockbuster can't hold a candle to this gem. Funny touching emotional charming can't begin to describe it. The acting is top notch the script is perfect and the directing is outstanding. I was expecting a Hanks ripoff at the beginning and there are a few similarities but it soon became its own movie. The set up reminds me of a show from 'This American Life' where a guy was stranded on a small island in Jamaica Bay off the coast of Brooklyn.Google In the Shadow Of the City and 'This American life' to see.The second part of the movie that deals with the female recluse had me riveted in trying to figure out how the two were going to communicate let alone get together. The journey is worth it and I won't spoil your fun. If you are looking for a good film a romantic comedy Castaway on the Moon is it.".

The script certainly feels to have arrived from the Moon. A cold magical and otherworldly place which lightens the dark night sky. And such is the script. The story is bizarre but possible a beautiful unexpected surprise with hints of tender love and crazy romanticism thrown in. A hats off certainly goes to the director and the writer to have actually pulled off something like Castaway on the Moon. In a very abstract way the movie's about us lost in world made of concrete emotions thoughts and then there's this minutely shining light an escape to freedom and the magic of surrealism.

	schema:headline " Vibrant hilarious mesh of genres and a different sort of film for David Gordon Green";
	schema:reviewBody "There will be many who will dismiss Pineapple Express as immature overly silly disjointed and scattershot. There will be others who recognize it as a bizarrely artful playful loose genrebending comedy with some outstanding performances an inspired comedy script and some great work from director David Gordon Green certainly one of the finest young directors around.The latter group is correct. Pineapple Express is as a whole the best movie the Apatow clan has produced yet. David Gordon Green is unquestionably the best director to direct one of these movies but this is also a very different sort of movie than the films he usually directs. Does he rise to the challenge? He certainly does. I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and welldirected as this film.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's muchanticipated followup to Superbad is an excellent screenplay but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film Pineapple Express is all about the laughs and the laughs are certainly here and they are practically nonstop with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue acting or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. In addition to David Gordon Green's excellent work as director the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr's cinematography is consistently great. Pineapple Express will be an inherently divisive film. It didn't get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed there's little of the criticpleasing dramatic scenes Apatow's comedies have been praised for and even when they do pop up they're usually deflated instantly with a joke and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film's tone which never becomes schmaltzy thank the heavens. Really the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film which contains one of the film's best jokes but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don't and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie before the big long action scene happens and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film but so what? There are also some nice little tongueincheek references to the film's influences they messed with the wrong melon farmers. The cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual Gary Cole is a perfect villain and it's nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film and get one of the film's funniest scenes as her character's final scene. The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.There are a lot of reasons why Pineapple Express won't work for many people and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film's plot is inherently silly to an extent although this is nowhere near the Anchorman style of comedy and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of Knocked Up. Pineapple Express may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.910".

I never would have believed that he was capable of directing such exciting and fun action scenes or keep the movie's tone steady despite the different elements it consists of being so wildly disparate but somehow he pulls it off. No other stoner movie can claim to be as artful and welldirected as this film.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's muchanticipated followup to Superbad is an excellent screenplay but expect none of the realism and resonance of that film Pineapple Express is all about the laughs and the laughs are certainly here and they are practically nonstop with just about every scene featuring some great dialogue acting or the sort of incredible sight gag this movie does so well. This is just great comedy throughout. In addition to David Gordon Green's excellent work as director the film is technically superb. The soundtrack and use of music is brilliant and frequent Gordon Green collaborator Tim Orr's cinematography is consistently great. Pineapple Express will be an inherently divisive film. It didn't get the sort of critical accolades many previous Apatow clan movies did and I expect audiences will also be a little less unanimous. Indeed there's little of the criticpleasing dramatic scenes Apatow's comedies have been praised for and even when they do pop up they're usually deflated instantly with a joke and credit has to go to director David Gordon Green for his expert handling of the film's tone which never becomes schmaltzy thank the heavens. Really the whole film is throughly enjoyable except for the very last scene in the film which contains one of the film's best jokes but is really hard to buy given the state the characters are in and also more than a little forced. Aside from that moment the whole thing works beautifully quite astounding given the mesh of many different genres and sorts of comedy that this is. You either go with this movies sense of humor or you don't and I imagine more people will enjoy the first three quarters of the movie before the big long action scene happens and lots and lots of violence occurs. I guess you have to have a somewhat morbid sense of humor to laugh at ALL of the jokes in the film but so what? There are also some nice little tongueincheek references to the film's influences they messed with the wrong melon farmers. The cast really give it their all. It was great to see James Franco back in a comedic role and his performance steals the show. Rogen is good as usual Gary Cole is a perfect villain and it's nice to see the gorgeous and talented Amber Heard finally make a quality film and get one of the film's funniest scenes as her character's final scene. The supporting cast are also all good in their roles.There are a lot of reasons why Pineapple Express won't work for many people and they will probably end up being the very reasons the film works for those who like it. The film's plot is inherently silly to an extent although this is nowhere near the Anchorman style of comedy and one must be prepared for an outright comedy and not something in the vein of Knocked Up. Pineapple Express may end up being more enjoyable for stoners and those with friends who are stoners but it works on its own as great comedy because the humor has much more range and scope than just marijuana. One of the best comedies in years.910";

Honestly it really felt like we lost our original set of writers  directors after an hour and they had to find a replacement set from some cheesy action movie. It totally came off the tracks when our lighthearted stoners picked up machine guns along with the rest of the thugs. Did the writers quit smoking weed and start doing meth or something?

In Pineapple Express he remains a loser and we can never believe in his journey since he's pitted against a bunch of unlikeable unsavory comic book characters. Rogen plays Dale Denton a process server who witnesses a murder by a drug dealer and then must elude the drug dealer's hired killers who are out to get him. His buddy marijuana dealer Saul Silver joins him as they elude the hit men. Right away you see how dumb the movie is when Denton is able to witness a murder which occurs inside a house in full view of anyone walking on the street. Another ridiculous moment occurs when Saul's marijuana supplier is shot point blank in the stomach but manages to survive and then is strong enough to drive Denton to the drug dealer's lair. Of course those who wrote the movie undoubtedly will argue that the situations are supposed to be over the top and that's the humor of it. But there comes a point where there are so many scenes that are so ridiculous that one simply doesn't care about the characters anymore. Rogen and Franco do their Beavis and Butthead impersonations but their humor has no subtlety and relies mainly on slapstick to get by. There's a romantic subplot involving Denton's relationship with a girl who's a high school student but that fizzles completely especially at the end when the screenwriters forgot to tell us what happened between the two. While this is supposed to be a somewhat goodnatured farce about two guys who share a mutual love for marijuana there's a lot of unnecessary violence with drug dealers killing one another during the finale. The ending undercuts the more goodnatured scenes between the film's two protagonists. If you check out the IMDb graph as to the age groups who liked this film you will see that the older you are you are less likely to like it. I feel certain that within five years Seth Rogen will be a forgotten name within the movie industry unless he stops writing and acting in films such as this.".

Even in Knocked up the only good thing was Catherine Heigal. Seth has no comic timing he's not funny and no being fat and goofy doesn't give you an instant ticket to Laughsville but surely gets you a Kick my ass poster right on your butt in High School. The only reason why I kept watching this was because I wanted to see more of Amber Heard not cuz she did a great job or something only cuz she was looking cute and she had only 34 small scenes. That sucks.James Franco I had some hope from him and he was still believable as a weed seller who is almost drowning in his own weed all day long. The only thing that could have saved the movie would have been a really good ending. Surprise surprise none here. Even the ending disappointed me. It was like the crew was torn between making a comedy and an epic. Most scenes were out of place and put on. It did have a few laughs like the leg through the windshield during car chase. And every time Danny R. McBride kept on living like an irritating little pimple which keeps on sprouting back up every time you pop it.Danny R. McBride as Red.... humm he was looking more like Tom Hanks on a very very very very bad hair day. So as I was saying I've lost all my trust in those friends of mine I'll think twice before doing something they say....Hope this will save someone from 01 hour 52 mins of boredom.....I would have given a '1' to this movie but the '2' is just for Amber".

Who thought this was entertaining?? Then at the end they still aren't at the hospital i just wished that they had all died as the were insanely annoying and being shot didn't seem to kill them. This film made me want to fall asleep with its unreal story line i mean what happens to his girl friend at the end she just seemed to have been cut out of the rest of the film. Then at the start when he sees the murder if he'd have just sat there he wouldn't have been noticed. But no he had to crash in to two cars really loudly so that he could be found out. Then the whole thing with him getting found out because of his drugs?? I'm surprised he even threw it out if he was such an addict he would have kept it. Worst film i have ever seen.

	schema:headline " Definitely my favorite Apatowbrand product and one of the funniest of the year. A comedy with real heart";
	schema:reviewBody "It's been a year since the glorious Superbad hit theaters and here we go again Pineapple Express is the best comedy of the year at least in this man's opinion. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time nor have I enjoyed myself more while doing so. It's got everything! Fire weed guns car chases explosions a beautiful lady Ed Begley Jr. and of course blood and guts. Yes I'm reviewing Pineapple Express and not some twisted horror movie.What makes this movie so great and accessible to the viewer that is allowed to see it mind you is that it's got something for every kind of comedy fan ridiculous action gags the witty and snappy Apatowbrand dialog funny cops hilarious pot jokes and James Franco playing the most lovable stoner of all time. What I really enjoyed most about this movie is that it has real heart and is not afraid to make the audience know it. It's a great buddy movie to see with all your friends. It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl you'll love Pineapple Express.James Franco yes THAT James Franco taking a break from the latest intense drama or SpiderMan film delivers the funniest performance since Sacha Baron Cohen in Borat. His Saul is quite the character and many people in my audience were hopelessly in love with and rooting for him. Though he's a supporting role the movie belongs to Franco in every way. His honest sweet and hilariously charming performance will have you dying of laughter. Seth Rogen is no slouch on the jokes as well though his character is somewhat similar to his character in Knocked Up I really hope he doesn't begin replicating his performances like some other comedians do. Danny McBride of The Heartbreak Kid is a scene stealer as well. I found him absolutely hilarious and great even if his character was a total ass. Gary Cole who has become like a cult favorite of mine is nothing but a bonus as the villain.I think a lot of credit needs to be given to director David Gordon Green who had to have noticed how excellent the first act of the film is because the film was in serious danger of pulling a Hancock and falling flat on its face after the first act because of a somewhat serious second act I say somewhat because this is when our characters realize the danger they're in. However instead of that happening Green turns the action packed third act into one of the most ridiculously hilarious scenes of recent memory. Of course what happens is absurd but because you've had the time of your life up to that point you really don't care. Featuring one of the greatest lines of all time in slow motion uttered by Franco of course Pineapple has one of the strongest third acts of any comedy out there.Another very strong thing about this movie is that it never drags and is almost a complete opposite of Superbad. The style of the jokes is different as well. In Superbad we had the hard hitting gut wrenching laughs and in Pineapple Express we have a steady flow of crack ups that leave the viewer in stitches and hurting by the end of the movie. It really is an experience to behold. It's one of the funniest movies of the decade and one of the best theater experiences of this year. My theater clapped several times throughout the film including at the end and at the iconic slow motion line.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's been a year since the glorious Superbad hit theaters and here we go again Pineapple Express is the best comedy of the year at least in this man's opinion. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time nor have I enjoyed myself more while doing so. It's got everything! Fire weed guns car chases explosions a beautiful lady Ed Begley Jr. and of course blood and guts. Yes I'm reviewing Pineapple Express and not some twisted horror movie.What makes this movie so great and accessible to the viewer that is allowed to see it mind you is that it's got something for every kind of comedy fan ridiculous action gags the witty and snappy Apatowbrand dialog funny cops hilarious pot jokes and James Franco playing the most lovable stoner of all time. What I really enjoyed most about this movie is that it has real heart and is not afraid to make the audience know it. It's a great buddy movie to see with all your friends. It doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl you'll love Pineapple Express.James Franco yes THAT James Franco taking a break from the latest intense drama or SpiderMan film delivers the funniest performance since Sacha Baron Cohen in Borat. His Saul is quite the character and many people in my audience were hopelessly in love with and rooting for him. Though he's a supporting role the movie belongs to Franco in every way. His honest sweet and hilariously charming performance will have you dying of laughter. Seth Rogen is no slouch on the jokes as well though his character is somewhat similar to his character in Knocked Up I really hope he doesn't begin replicating his performances like some other comedians do. Danny McBride of The Heartbreak Kid is a scene stealer as well. I found him absolutely hilarious and great even if his character was a total ass. Gary Cole who has become like a cult favorite of mine is nothing but a bonus as the villain.I think a lot of credit needs to be given to director David Gordon Green who had to have noticed how excellent the first act of the film is because the film was in serious danger of pulling a Hancock and falling flat on its face after the first act because of a somewhat serious second act I say somewhat because this is when our characters realize the danger they're in.

	schema:reviewBody "Having gone to the midnight showing with a friend I was as excited as the rest of the country in witnessing what should have been the greatest comedy of the year to every young adult in the audience. Suffice it to say I was very disappointed. The movie turned out to be one big running Bro gag after another.That being said let's evaluate the plot of the movie. The basic idea of the film is based around a pothead Dale Denton  Seth Rogen  who serves court orders and his dealer Saul Silver  James Franco. Denton while finding one of his court orders targets Ted Jones  Gary Cole  witnesses the shooting of an Asian drug dealer at Jones's very residence! Panicking he backs into a corrupt cop's car into another car and then speeds off in a very amusing scene. From this point on Denton and the man whose home he returns to Silver are forced to go on the run from an insanely persistent drug lord and his thugs who want nothing more than to kill Dale Denton for witnessing the crime. NONE of that is bad whatsoever. It is a simplistic plot that fits a frame perfectly for an actioncomedy flick.It is unfortunate that one of the main reasons I mark this film down is for Seth Rogan's performance. Granted he has always been a popular actor for Bro crowds but this is a new low. NONE of his material was amusing. His character was virtually the same as his character in Knocked Up with the only difference being that he stays in his life of pot smoking in the conclusion of this film whereas in Knocked Up he changes his lifestyle. Most of the jokes that Dale Denton is privy too are idiotic even for an Apatow film. His slapstick and mannerisms did more to degrade this film's quality than even the sad fact that this movie will probably convince the American public that marijuana is the way to go in life. And no I am not antiweed.As for how the plot is actually carried out here is another mark down. It progresses in a linear fashion  trying to find the man responsible for ratting them out to Ted Jones  and then suddenly flops into a barrage of stupid scenes involving Denton's underage girlfriend and her absurd father. To make matters worse the comedy that is used throughout the majority of the film to progress the story is as stale as Seth Rogan's performance.All of that out in the open I should mention I have NEVER been a fan of James Franco. I will not deny he was Phenomenal in this film. Every poor line from Seth Rogan and Danny McBride  actor who played Red  was redeemed by his performance as Saul Silver. His character his portrayal and the comedy that ensues was a riot. Most of his lines made me want to wet myself laughing. If any award should be given out for lead actor it should be given to James Franco.Gary Cole gave a great performance as a whack bad guy in this film as well and I would be lying if I said he in any way took away from this film. It is unfortunate that his talents as well as the talents of James Franco had to be wasted on this production.The third character meant to be a protagonist in a certain sense is Red Danny Mcbride. Unfortunately I would argue that his character was as worthless as Denton. Every line from his mouth was one bad comedy clich' after another that we've all heard over and over again from different films. The pathetic white wanna be thug acting like his life is greater than it is can be seen in films like Waiting  Andy Milonakes . Granted it was amusing when Red in all rights should have died early in the movie and kept returning but eventually you have to wonder why he's allowed to keep living.What the film lacked in value to the comedy world it also failed to make up for in substance. There was no great lesson or revelation that the viewer was to experience at the end of the film as in more contemporary modern films nor was there a moment when the protagonist learned his mistakes and made up for them in years to come Knocked Up 40 Year Old Virgin Waiting. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to be different in this regard but unfortunately it did not redeem the movie. I had heard Olivia Thirlby  Juno The Whackness was to be in the film.. maybe the extras on the DVD will have her and perhaps offer more substance into the film who knows.This was a long critique and for that I apologize. If you must walk away with anything from this review then let it be this If you want to see James Franco give a memorable performance this film is for you. But I caution that his acting aside this is one of those films that makes me weep for how idiotic and simplistic our culture is becoming that and every Bro in your town will be there so be ready for that hell when you get there.510 ONLY for James Franco and Gary Cole.".

	schema:headline " I Wanted So Much to Enjoy This Movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I screwed up by going into Pineapple Express with such high expectations. I mean last week I saw Step Brothers. The trailer was funny enough but I didn't know if the onenote joke of seeing Will Farrell and John C. Reilly stuck in failure to launch mode would hold up for a whole movie. Still I wanted to see it so I went in with low expectations. I laughed out loud through parts of the movie but never really felt fully entertained. By the end of the movie the few moments I had laughed at weren't nearly enough to make the film feel like a satisfying comedic whole. I was disappointed but not too worried because I knew Pineapple Express was only a few days away. Surely it would be the laughoutloud comedy of the year. I was mistaken. I've seen a ton of movies this year and few have really stood out. Indiana Jones was okay Hancock was a pleasant surprise and IronMan was ten times better than it had any right to be thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. The Dark Knight was hands down the best movie so far this year surpassing even my highest expectations. But what has been missing this year is a standout comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed Juno but it was light and sweet. Where is this year's Superbad absolutely one of my favorite comedies of the past 10 years? Forgetting Sarah Marshall is probably way funnier than I thought it was but I had been through a breakup the day I saw it and went into it looking for relief. I chuckled but was never able to really get into it. So today I went into Pineapple Express ready to be entertained. Unfortunately the movie fell flat on almost every level. I knew something was amiss when I checked my watch thinking an hour or so had passed only to find out that the movie had only been running for 35 minutes. Surely the pace will pick up I thought but the movie just droned on until the end credits. Nothing overly hilarious or exciting happens in the movie. There are jokes and a few funny bits but sadly I laughed more during the first 20 minutes of Step Brothers than I did during the entire runtime of Pineapple Express. There are explosions and a car chase but they offer about as much punch and tension as you might get watching a group of 5 year olds in a capgun fight. Probably even less. It's hard to say exactly where the movie went wrong. At times I thought maybe it was the slow pace but there was much more going wrong than bad editing. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez were beyond uninteresting or even threatening as the film's villains. They seem much more interested in drinking beer and eating fried chicken than catching the film's protagonists. At no point do you ever feel that Seth Rogen great as always but even he couldn't save this picture and James Franco are truly in any real danger. Franco's performance is a real treat but after 15 minutes you wish it was being utilized in a better movie. His chemistry with Rogen is electric but this simply isn't the buddy film it could have been. And then there is the carnage. That's right. One character is beaten to a bloody pulp and even shot twice maybe even more times before the movie ends but somehow manages to live through to the end of the movie. This could have been hilarious but it loses it's humor entirely when death and injury seem so real throughout the rest of the movie. Imagine seeing a battered bruised and bandaged Wiley Coyote walking amongst the corpses of the DDay invasion scene from Saving Private Ryan and you get an idea of what I mean. Seeing the all too realistically damaged dead bodies of a man smashed by a car and another killed by an explosion are shocking and completely unnerving since this movie is supposed to be funny. Dead bodies can be funny look at Weekend at Bernie's or even the morbidly humorous morgue van scene in Bad Boy's II but not when they look like the sort of thing you would see at rotten.com. To some degree I think Superbad has ruined the comedy genre for me. I knew going into it that it was going to be funny but nothing could have prepared me for just how outrageously funny it ended up being. I honestly don't think there is a false note in that movie. Then you have Pineapple Express. This should have been a great comedy but even the greatest musicians can't make beautiful music with instruments that are atrociously out of tune. So what was my favorite part of the movie? Probably the last 30 minutes. Why? Certainly not because of what was going on on screen. The girl I went with ironically the same girl I went through a breakup with the day I saw Forgetting Sarah Marshall snuck in a gigantic bag of Reese's Pieces. Apparently just as bored and let down by the movie as I was she tossed one of them at me to amuse herself.

And the fact that no one in the audience told us to settle down or shut up tells you just how into the movie they were.

	onyx:emotionText "Maybe I screwed up by going into Pineapple Express with such high expectations. I mean last week I saw Step Brothers. The trailer was funny enough but I didn't know if the onenote joke of seeing Will Farrell and John C. Reilly stuck in failure to launch mode would hold up for a whole movie. Still I wanted to see it so I went in with low expectations. I laughed out loud through parts of the movie but never really felt fully entertained. By the end of the movie the few moments I had laughed at weren't nearly enough to make the film feel like a satisfying comedic whole. I was disappointed but not too worried because I knew Pineapple Express was only a few days away. Surely it would be the laughoutloud comedy of the year. I was mistaken. I've seen a ton of movies this year and few have really stood out. Indiana Jones was okay Hancock was a pleasant surprise and IronMan was ten times better than it had any right to be thanks to Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. The Dark Knight was hands down the best movie so far this year surpassing even my highest expectations. But what has been missing this year is a standout comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed Juno but it was light and sweet. Where is this year's Superbad absolutely one of my favorite comedies of the past 10 years? Forgetting Sarah Marshall is probably way funnier than I thought it was but I had been through a breakup the day I saw it and went into it looking for relief. I chuckled but was never able to really get into it. So today I went into Pineapple Express ready to be entertained. Unfortunately the movie fell flat on almost every level. I knew something was amiss when I checked my watch thinking an hour or so had passed only to find out that the movie had only been running for 35 minutes. Surely the pace will pick up I thought but the movie just droned on until the end credits. Nothing overly hilarious or exciting happens in the movie. There are jokes and a few funny bits but sadly I laughed more during the first 20 minutes of Step Brothers than I did during the entire runtime of Pineapple Express. There are explosions and a car chase but they offer about as much punch and tension as you might get watching a group of 5 year olds in a capgun fight. Probably even less. It's hard to say exactly where the movie went wrong. At times I thought maybe it was the slow pace but there was much more going wrong than bad editing. Gary Cole and Rosie Perez were beyond uninteresting or even threatening as the film's villains. They seem much more interested in drinking beer and eating fried chicken than catching the film's protagonists. At no point do you ever feel that Seth Rogen great as always but even he couldn't save this picture and James Franco are truly in any real danger. Franco's performance is a real treat but after 15 minutes you wish it was being utilized in a better movie. His chemistry with Rogen is electric but this simply isn't the buddy film it could have been. And then there is the carnage. That's right. One character is beaten to a bloody pulp and even shot twice maybe even more times before the movie ends but somehow manages to live through to the end of the movie. This could have been hilarious but it loses it's humor entirely when death and injury seem so real throughout the rest of the movie. Imagine seeing a battered bruised and bandaged Wiley Coyote walking amongst the corpses of the DDay invasion scene from Saving Private Ryan and you get an idea of what I mean. Seeing the all too realistically damaged dead bodies of a man smashed by a car and another killed by an explosion are shocking and completely unnerving since this movie is supposed to be funny. Dead bodies can be funny look at Weekend at Bernie's or even the morbidly humorous morgue van scene in Bad Boy's II but not when they look like the sort of thing you would see at rotten.com. To some degree I think Superbad has ruined the comedy genre for me. I knew going into it that it was going to be funny but nothing could have prepared me for just how outrageously funny it ended up being. I honestly don't think there is a false note in that movie. Then you have Pineapple Express. This should have been a great comedy but even the greatest musicians can't make beautiful music with instruments that are atrociously out of tune. So what was my favorite part of the movie? Probably the last 30 minutes. Why? Certainly not because of what was going on on screen. The girl I went with ironically the same girl I went through a breakup with the day I saw Forgetting Sarah Marshall snuck in a gigantic bag of Reese's Pieces. Apparently just as bored and let down by the movie as I was she tossed one of them at me to amuse herself. I tossed a couple back and before you knew it we were having a full blown Reese's Pieces battle right there in the middle of the cinema. And the fact that no one in the audience told us to settle down or shut up tells you just how into the movie they were. Pineapple Express was a disappointment and an easily forgettable movie but the experience of going to see it will always be a fond one thanks to a gigantic bag of Reese's Pieces.";

Last night I was privileged to see an advance screening of Apatow's funniest film to date by far and I really enjoyed all his other films. The audience and I were laughing so hard that I need to see it again to pick up on the jokes that I missed. It has been a long time since I have seen a stoner film stoned but I may have to make an exception the second time around.I believe that when Apatow Rogen and Goldberg decided to write Pineapple Express they wanted to create the Lawrence of Arabia of stoner flicksand they succeeded. Pineapple Express is the stoner film that has reset the bar for stoner films just like The Dark Knight has reset the bar for comic book films. James Franco's Saul Silver who just deals drugs to pay for his Boobie's nursing home He plans to become a civil engineer and be able to build toilets for kids in public parks. is the greatest stoner character of all time. He has dethroned Sean Penn's Spicoli character after over 25 years of holding the honor of Celluloid stoner king.I don't want to ruin any of the jokes for you but I am pretty sure every teen and college male in America will be quoting dozens of lines from the film within weeks and spoiling it for the main intended demographic so I say go opening weekend before your buddy who saw it the day before starts spouting some of the films best lines.I had one minor quibble with the story in that at one point Saul sells pot to some pretty young kids and there is a funny bit built around that but I wish they had at least chosen seniors in high school or something for that scene. I believe pot is less harmful than alcohol tobacco and of course all other illegal drugs but that was just a bit too young for me.Anyway minor quibbles aside Pineapple Express is one of the funniest comedies ever made and undisputed king of the stoner flicks.".

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself even if you've never even been high in your life there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here the focus is not primarily on it and the movie is better off as a result.So far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the toodumbforit'sowngood Strange Wilderness and the dumbbutfun Harold  Kumar. However despite coming in late to the game the old expression of saving the best 'till last seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time Pineapple Express feels silly but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime carchases comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect but the writers get it spot on here.Main characters Dale Denton Seth Rogan and Saul Silver James Franco may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead they deal with drugs Saul is Dale's supplier and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drugdealer crimelords the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure this isn't a hallmark drama there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable it's a story about two regular guys who get into crazy shenanigans smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se but it's entertaining and down to earth.This is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable actionpacked plot the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.Coming from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around the pacing isn't quite as tight and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time losing momentum yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless if you don't mind profane dialogue blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.And that's all it basically comes down to but what else were you expecting? As a movie Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus. With some great action scenes tinged with plenty of comedy all revolving around some memorable characters portrayed by enthusiastic suitably cast performers who end up within a plot which is admittedly hammy but fun all the same Pineapple Express is good for many things but the thing that it does best is in making you laugh and it does so with enough frequency to make this one of this year's greater comedies.Written by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

I did not expect much from this as I had gotten bored with the previews I was seeing everywhere but the funniest parts of this movie are not shown on TV. Spend the 11 dollars and go see it.".

First we can all wash out the bad taste that was left in our mouths by Drillbit Taylor. This was by far the best of the Apatow Productions. THANK YOU. The boys have not lost it. Seth Rogen and james Franco were funny as hell. This was not just a stoner movie. Like its predecessors the theme of friendship was prevalent throughout. However the boys added something different to the mix this time besides weed. Pure OVER the top action i'm talking explosions car chases Ak 47's guns galore. It was a solid R rated movie with comedy always there to overshadow the badass action and violence. In an effort to keep this a spoiler free review  All i can leave you with is go watch this film. I haven't laughed this hard at the movies for quite a while. I was seated next to an old lady who was laughing her brains out she was like 75 years old.The poster has earned the space on my bedroom door need i say more?  The film was followed by a Q and A by Seth Rogen Judd Apatow Ken Jeong Danny Mc Bride Craig Ferguson and Evan Goldberg. Who were as down to earth and funny as one would expect. The Q and A alone was worth staying there until 130 am.".

Now I had always heard Pineapple Express was a brilliant blend of genres and that's what it is  a great stoner comedy that successfully blends buddyaction elements into it's story. The script was hilarious as it's written by Seth Rogen himself and fellow successful screenwriter Evan Goldberg. The comedic elements written into said script although lowbrow and often dark came off as very breezy and ended up being one of the key factors of appeal for the film. Though the best part about the film for me was the really believable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen. The two have worked together before on the cult television series Freaks And Geeks and their reallife friendship transfers very beautifully on film. Surprisingly enough the movie also featured a sufficient amount of thrills and action  especially towards the end. Overall I found Pineapple Express to be a delightfully funny buddystoneractioncomedy that brought the laughs and surprises in shovelfuls.".

	schema:reviewBody "What an outstanding movie!! I have heard all the prior generation people rave about this movie so I decided to check this movie out myself. I only have faint memories of having watched parts of this movie from my mom's lap when she and dad were watching this in the theater. The other reason why I decided to check this out was a Superbowl halftime debate on whether Amitabh was better than Rajesh Khanna. I could not participate in this debate for two reasons first I was eagerly awaiting another wardrobe malfunction for one of the cheerleaders and secondly I only had memories of one Rajesh Khanna movie Haathi Mere Saathi. I remember having enjoyed it very much as a child. But that alone was not enough to quantify anything. The more recent performances of AB were fresh in my mind but after having seen this movie I decided that Rajesh had a class of his own. His chirpy performance in this movie is really unparalleled! What an amazing performance! Amitabh being more junior has not equaled Rajesh but has done his share very well. Thus even after watching this movie the debate will continue.What's New? What can possibly be new in an old movie? Guess what? there is plenty for the younger generation to take away! There is no education in the movies these days whatsoever except perhaps bedroom or bar sequences. The inadequacies in the field of medicine are so nicely brought forward by this movie which is certainly over 30 years old! Now I can understand why Munnabhai MBBS was such a hit. It had so beautifully adapted from this movie to match the present generation. Kudos to Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Sanjay Dutt  Kamal Hassan too for carrying this forward.Noticeable BaaabuMushaai the nick name for Amitabh as heard from Rajesh throughout the movie will ring in your ears even hours after you have seen the six letters The End on the screen. There really is no end to such people! Some sequences were simply amazing. Those that stood apart in my mind were the last scene with a tape that had a significant pause in between the mounvrath guru who so symbolically said that there is so much more than the decaying body to Anand's soul then of course the Munirbhai sequences and the eventual backfiring of this strategy and so many more! The songs were so gentle and heart warming! The comic timing of Rajesh Khanna was simply amazing! Verdict Present day filmmakers really need to rework their brains and start thinking much much better! There is much more to Hindi cinema than just skinshow and catchy item number songs. This is a MUSTWATCH movie! I did not think so when others told me but having experienced it myself I believe them! I am gonna check out the other MUSTWATCH movies prescribed by the previous generation.".

Acting direction story music dialogues etc... everything is fabulous. It has drama humor emotions in dollops. It is a story a dying man who looks at life with a positive attitude and enjoys his time knowing  fully well his disease is incurable and that he is going to die soon.Rajesh Khanna as Anand is absolutely brilliant this is his careerbest performance  notwithstanding movies like Kati Patang Roti Aradhana Amar Prem etc. You cannot think of any other actor in this role and to think Rajesh Khanna was not the original choiceShashi Kapoor was. He makes you laugh and cry. He causes anxiety and goose bumps. Simply superb.Amitabh Bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai a name with which Raj Kapoor used to address the film's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee. He showed the world that the next superstar was coming though he really arrived a couple of years later. The rest of the supporting cast is also brilliant be it Johhny Walkerstands out or Ramesh Deo or Seema or Sumitra. Everyone is wonderful.Music is the hallmark of all great hindi movies and this one has music ranking right up there on the top. Be it Kahin door jab din dhal jaye or  Maine tere liye hi saath rang or Zindagi kaisi hai paheli.Maverick composer Salil Chowdury comes up with an absolutely fantastic score and singers Mukhesh and Manna Dey do complete justice to his tunes.About the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee what can one say he is one of the best directors ever in the Indian film history. A guy with a complete repertoirea complete entertainer though people consider other  directors to be more entertaining but real movie buffs will agree with me. All his movies he has been directing movies since 1957 are worth a watch. Some are brilliant and others watchable. None of his movies can be rated as unwatchableexcept maybe Jooth bole Kauwa kaate and Jhooti.Simply put this is one of the best Hindi movies ever made.".

All of them relatively low on budget and high in quality. To think of it that he was directing at the breakneck speed of more than two movies a year. Mukherjee's movies were light hearted comic dramas Anand too is comical at times. His other movies featured people struggling to keep a job or fancying a marriage to film star or struggling to keep up with a practical joke Anand on the other hand is about struggling to live the short life you have.Anand is without doubt the best and most popular of Mukherjee's works. Rajesh Khanna's role as Anand a patient with 'Lymphosarcoma cancer of the intestine' is probably his best acting ever. How Anand fights cancer brings tears to your eyes even if you see this movie for the umpteenth. You laugh with Anand you cry with him you sing with him you live the life he lives. Amitabh Bachchan's Dr Banerjee role of his square faced Bengali doctor in a role so different from the roles that made him a superstar Bachchan was voted the greatest actor ever in the online BBC pole though he played it down saying  this proves Indians do not have much to do on Internet Amitabh does a wonderful job. Being a Bollywood movie that it is there are some beautiful songs. I wonder  a Hollywood movie with songs is called a musical and all Bollywood movies are characterised as song and dance sequences. This is a stereotype that a lot of Hindi Movies won't fit into then there are a lot that will. Anand for one has no dance sequence. Lot of beautiful songs though that help the narrative and in character development like acting can't.For example you never see Anand unhappy for a second. You think he has no sorrows. Even the name of his illness is something to enjoy. Lymphosarcoma of the intestine is quite a name to have for a disease Anand says in his ever cheerful voice the word Anand means pleasure btw. Deep inside Anand knows he has limited time in the world and he wants to fill every life that he touches with happiness. In the process he starts growing closer to you. He talks to a complete stranger on the street like he knew him forever. He shares the sorrows of people he meets gives them reason to smile. But never will let you into his own sad past. It is only through a song a sort of soliloquy he sings that you get a bit of information about his sad past  he himself wont share it with you.The movie won the 1972 Filmfare Award. One of the best works to come out of Bollywood.".

Anand is a movie which speaks more than it scripts. It tells us more than its characters narrates the story. The impressive character no doubt is of Rajesh Khannna but Amitabh is too much impressive. The Anand tells us how a man decided and then spent rest of his short life. A Man who had short time but he wanted to live too much. for him not the quantity but quality of life does matter. I recommend to see this movies more than once. And every time u see this movie u'll end up with more brighter definition of film and life. The movie is too simple to narrate here and tooo deep to express what i actually think about it.".

His person consummately excels in mimicking soft romantic sad morose and boisterously exuberant roles.Many people contend that Amitabh would had done a better characterization if he had been offered an author backed role instead of Rajesh Khanna in ANAND. Here it may be kept in mind that Amitabh could not match a stunning performance in MILLI where his real life spouse Jaya Bahaduri outperformed him. The bullock cart scene immediately followed by the song Kaheen door jab din dhal Jaye in ANAND speaks volumes of the excellently crafted direction of Hirsihkish Mukherjee and has enlisted his name among all time great directors. This song and the one Zindagi Kaisi he Paheli touch the latent strings of sublime imagination with poignant originality which cannot even remotely be identified anywhere among the fast untamed crazy and meaningless songs of this age of Indian Cinema ......which seems to be overly swamped by the temporal vulgar and money minting mentality of the producers directors and actors.That is to say there is nothing worthwhile in contemporary cinema which happens to be laden with tawdry vulgarity and incompetent intellectual standing visavis the cerebral and indepth creativity of movie makers of erstwhile days.".

	schema:reviewBody "Babu Moshai Zindagi Aur Maut ke Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain An immortal piece of dialog from an immortal movie Anand. Many a Hindi movie starts of wellbut falters pretty badly in the climax. Anand was one of the few movies which grips you from start to end. Its one of the few movies which has an unforgettable climax.Consider this the eponymous character AnandRajesh Khanna lies on the bed dying. Babu MoshaiAmitabh Bachan enters the room. He cannot bear to see his friend lying still on death bed. He holds him and shakes him up weeping uncomfortablyTum Mujhe Aisa Chod Ke Nahin Ja Saakte20 mahine se mein tera bak bak sun raha hoonBaate Karo Mujhshe And then as if on cue the tape recorder plays Babu Moshai Babu Moshai Zindagi aur Maut Ki Khel Mein Hum Sab Katputhli Hain Yahan kya hote hai na tum jaane na main Sab Upar Wale ki Haath Meiin The ghostly way in which the voice appears and the equally eerie laughter creates such a haunting impact that a shiver runs down my spine every time i watch this scene. It's as if Anand is speaking through his spirit and even after death he still continues to live.Anand is a masterpiece of the first order by Hrishida and one of my all time fav movies. Now an interesting thing regarding the dedication of Anand. It wad dedicated to Raj Kapoor and the city of Mumbai.The Raj Kapoor connection was easy to make out as he was Hrishida's best buddy in real life. Hrishida got his first commercial success with Raj Kapoor's Anari and Raj Kapoor got the best actor award for the movie. They were as different as chalk and cheese. While Raj Kapoor was the typical loud Punjabi extrovertHrishida was the very epitome of the Bengali Babu with his sober intellectual demeanour. Also Hrishida's movies were aimed at the common man and pretty sober and minimalist in nature while RK was a showman par excellence with his penchant for larger than life canvas and huge settings. Hrishida himself admitted that Anand's character was based on RK's and he didn't cast RK as he couldn't bear to see his friend die on screen also. For his part Anand was a movie always close to RK's heart.Regarding the Mumbai connection i feel the story of Anand is somewhat linked to that of Mumbai. One could be that Hrishida made his career in Mumbai and i guess this was his way of saying thank you to the city which made him. Most of Hrishida's best movies have been Mumbai centric Anand MiliAbhimaanGol Maal to name a few. Also like Anand Mumbai is a city which though beset with innumerable problems like slums crime pollution overcrowding still manages to survive and live every day. Life is not easy for an average Mumbaikar what with all those overcrowded trains high prices crime rate but heshe still has a zeal for life which is rarely found anywhere else. Its a city which gets back to normal life even after a couple of bomb blasts have destroyed large chunks. Its a city where dreams are made and realized. Its a city where people face a daily struggle and yet have an inexhaustible zest for lifemuch like Anand who knows he will die but takes death head on as he says Babu Moshai zindag Badi Hone chahiye Lambi nahin. Mumbai is a city that dies a thousand deaths daily but never loses its love for life. Anand is a man who knows he is to die but makes the best of his limited life.".

But it seems he would take some time out from his other schedules would come to Hrishi da and ask him if he could shoot the next scene from Anand. That's how eager and dedicated he was to Anand. Probably he knew that this was the movie that he would be remembered for.The movie narrates like the pages of a diary of one Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee and his relationship with Anand Sehgal who he treated for cancer. Despite of such a heavy theme the movie is high spirited just like Anand Sehgal who likes to laugh in the face of death. Special mention should be made for attention given to each character in the movie. All the characters are well etched and everyone has given a truly inspired performance.The last sequence must be the most dramatic sequence that I have seen in any movie. Music by Salil Chaudhary and lyrics by Yogesh and Gulzar are apt and wonderful. Definitely one of the best movies made in India.".

Yes this word was invented by Shammi Kapoor! who I hear is a computer buff I wonder if he has Yahoo email..yahooyahoo.com! When you can remember when and where you saw a movie it says something about the impact it made on you. A haunting melody an exuberant performance or a damsel actress that you had a secret crush on I should confess that it was Asha Parekh! So the scene that was struck in my young mind was Rajesh Khanna singing Kahin Door Jab Din Dhal Jaaye...a haunting melody by any standards. So when I wanted to watch a movie in solitude one of my few choices was Anand. I wanted the nostalgia that only a good movie can bring. Yes the movie not only brought nostalgia but also brought tears melancholy and sadness at which time I realized that a great director has worked me over. No one could have done justice to portraying a cancer stricken patient as Rajesh Khanna did in this classic. Khanna was an upcoming actor at that time and somehow the films he starred had some enchanting melodies and hummable tunes. Anand is one of the rare movies you enjoy watching because there is this silence afterwords where words spoken would be a nuisance. The performance is subtle as compared to some of the garish over acting that we see by the imbecile Khans in the latter year movies so much so you hope there is never be a remake of this. This is one of the best performance by an actor wherever this profession is practiced. Like any good movie this was an amalgamation of talent like the direction of Hrishikesh Mukherjee music of Salil Chaudhry and a fine supporting cast that included Amitab Bachchan who incidentally is subdued. That leaves me wondering if he was watching and learning from a great fellow actor at work. All said and done this movie is etched in my memory so much so this is one of the Top Ten Indian Movies on my short list. Yes a sheer Poetry in Motion.".

They dread the day he will die as it nears yet he remains steadfast. He changes the lives of those around him. Great Story.Perhaps the most moving scene is when Anand dies he cannot bear the pain of his death not for himself but for his best friend Bamushai. A shocking selflessness at a moment where he is at his most truehis death bed In the end there is a real sense of transcendence you real feel a triumph over the concept of death. The best example is the voice recording. Anand has died but the recording plays on so in memory Anand will live on eternally. It should really be a tragic story but this is an uplifting story about a damned man. Well worth watching more than once.".

Rajesh Khanna with his lively performance as character of Anand the main character of the movie who is suffering from a chronic disease and is about to die in 2 months creates a special attachment to the character and by the time movie ends you also feel like crying. Amitabh with his splendid performance as a very serious doctorwriter who is a cancer specialist and tries his best to save Anand but all in vain.The music of the movie is its another strongest part Mukesh with his magical voice leaves a strong impact. All the songs are are written and composed well. Kudos to Hrishikesh Mukherjee for properly utilizing all the resources in the movie and coming up with a masterpiece of all times.

I cannot explain in simple words how such an economic work can be so breathtakingly beautiful and powerful at the same time. That was Hrishikesh Mukherjee's magic. He was the Rebel filmmaker of his time. When all other Directors made mindless larger than life films where The Hero  the Heroin ran around tress and wept like babies Hrishikesh Mukherjee made films that had simple themes characters we could relate to and the whole movie had a Middle Class set up something thats extinct in today's movies.It is a work of great intelligence and subtle intensity every frame greatly observant of the varying moods. I'm at a loss of words at describing how affected I was by this movie at the moment but all I can say is this is one of the finest motion pictures I have seen. ANAND represents cinema at its finest at its peak accessible to the lowest commonest denominator yet compromising nowhere on quality. I just cannot stress enough how wonderfully gentle and beautiful this movie was and such a wonderful character study.Rajesh Khanna so effectively captures the easy going personality of the protagonist Anand Saigal. Part of it owes to his previous effort at playing the same man in the film SAFAR but we would know him more from movies like Aradhana and Amar Prem. This film also marks the arrival of Amitabh Bachchan and he's fantastic as Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee. Dara Singh is also excellent in a sweet cameo as a Pahalwaan.I strongly PoohPooh Karan Johar  Nikhil Adavani for stealing Anand's plot and making a Trashy  Crappy Kal Ho Na Ho which was not even 0.0000000000000001 close to Anand.".

Our TV was on the blink and I happened to be there. Sundays were movie nights on TV and we had but one channel in those days that we could tune to. It was Doordarshan  controlled by the govt. and only had broadcasts for a few hours every evening. I saw the movie and by the end of it I was inconsolable and cried all the way back to my home a small walk taking me 45 apartment buildings away and was depressed for a few hours thereafter. Fantastic! I would STRONGLY recommend that people see this movie and see a movie that is classy in its treatment of the subject as well as the characterisations of the principal actors. The plot is not particularly rich  and it is mostly emotional  a very slight hint of romance good songs and a brilliant ending which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling it.".

Bhaskar who comes of a different linguistic region is highly affectionate and respectful to his everrestless friend Anand due to his enthusiasm indomitable philanthropic passion and optimism about life. In recognition of his feelings to his friend Anand is fond of calling Bhaskar with a different nickname Babumasai which means great gentleman. Bhaskar in spite of being a good and serious physician fails to delay the death of Anand and mourns a lot commemorating the precious moments with the great man whom he could not cure. An urban Indian setting beside a sea provides the narrative with a meaningful physical backdrop.The directorial experiment of idealizing an everlively individual Anand in keeping with the mannerism of the star actor Rajesh Khanna is proved to be unforgettable professional success in Indian cinema. Another historical contribution of the film is the invaluable exposure and success of a great Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan in characterizing Bhaskar at the earliest phase of Bachchan's career. For the spectators today the speed of the narrative is sometimes unnecessarily slow but the criticism should not count wonderful editing. Hrishikesh Mukherjee in extension of his previous reputed editing experience offered a simple and compact narrative of popularizing a serious urban theme with tragic end. An acceptable script which is full of good humor and touch of humanist emotion supports the overall indifference to death and urban loneliness. Salil Chowdhury presents several wonderful songs which have remained exceptional in their lyrics and melody. Perhaps Hrishikesh Mukherjee is one of the pioneers in framing and editing musical shots in Indian movie.Another significant aspect of the film is the organic network of the characters in representing a humanitarian tragic narrative. The four major character positions are Anand Bhaskar who is Annad's Babumasai a few less prominent females and the less known supportive urban identities. Almost none of them are negatively featured. The central and most interesting dyad is AnandBabumasai relationship. The ideal construct of a traditionally steady professionally successful introvert married Indian male character of Bhaskar is contrast to boyishly insistent restless talkative and softhearted Anand who is very sociable and also decisively withdrawn from any love relation but highly committed to friendship. Both of them have positive attitude towards femininity but in practice they differ. After the death of Anand while Bhaskar cries his heart out in acknowledging his overwhelming greatness two contrary characters finally become complementary to each other with respect to the orientation of the narrative. A viewer gets four major positions in order to identify their emotion. One may identify with Anand who might appear greater than ideal male identity of Bhaskar. One may find out a Bhaskar in himself. One may like to appreciate and respect the relationship. One may feel himselfherself less responsive to the height of the local construct of emotion a union of joy and sadness. The last position is unlikely to be the focus of the film. Any positive response to the film indicates the success of a different representation of urban Indian ideals and optimism.".

The secret behind Mukherjee's success is the outstanding work he displays on screen with sheer simplicity.'Anand' is about a simpleton who's diagnosed with a life threatening disease and has but a few weeks to live. Yet he chooses to live the last days by being happy meeting people and being friends and he befriends Bhaskar.Mukherjee shows us a wonderful contrast between Bhaskar's and Anand's personalities. We see Bhaskar as a frustrated workaholic and Anand as the happygolucky cheerful and playful teaser who's also an artist. Once Anand enters Bhaskar's life Bhaskar learns how to live.Rajesh Khanna plays the title role and is wonderful. I tend to avoid his movies but I'm glad I didn't miss this one. I've never been a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and really disliked everything he did since the 80's. In 'Anand' he is brilliant. Comparatively his screen time is more limited but he makes the best of it. Lalita Pawar and Johnny Walker leave a mark with their brief roles.The songs are beautiful and they add to the narrative. Salil Chowdhury's score is memorable.If you haven't seen Anand go and watch it otherwise you'll not know what you missed.".

It was very sweet but in a good way. No excessive cuteness no magical cure to being crazy. The crazy people are crazy and that ain't gonna change anytime soon. The cinematography and visuals were great. I really loved the set design of the hospital. And all of the side characters were a great cast of crazies. I have not watched a great deal of Korean cinema and have never seen the leads in anything before. I live in Korea so I'm very aware of Rain or Be as its pronounced here but I thought that both pulled off their rolls very well especially the girl.

Don't you hate it when someone tries to rush you? Hey! Wake up! No  go away  I wanna finish my dream!I'm a Cyborg but That's OK reminds you of so many different movies in the first ten minutes. You try to fit it into a box. Hey! It's like soandso! But it's not. The vision that director Chanwook Park presents us with is foreign so alien to any genre that our mind is confused. Maybe you have to give up all expectation before you can enjoy it.Younggoon thinks she is a cyborg. A nice normal young girl otherwise that is her only kink. Hello mental institution. She can't eat of course  food makes her ill really so she licks batteries of various sorts as other inmates tuck into their dinner. She's lonely and talks to machines. The drinks dispenser is one of her favourites. But she's not a psycho  as she will point out  I'm not a psycho I'm a cyborg.As inmates go Younggoon is fairly low maintenance. Most of the antisocial patients are weird beyond belief. But it is a young man called Ilsoon who manages to reach out to her where doctors have failed. Ilsoon believes all sorts of things  like believing he has the power to steal intangibles from people such as character attitudes or habits. His services are soon in demand among the other patients.Younggoon has some internal conflicts. For cyborgs there are seven deadly sins and they give her some problems. The seven deadly sins for a cyborg areSympathy. Sadness. Restlessness. Hesitating. Useless daydreaming. Feeling guilty. Thankfulness.Of all these sins sympathy is the worst.Interestingly the inmates are like parts of the body they compensate for each other's particular shortcomings and have very sane insights into kinds of madness not their own.When the film becomes a love story it is not one based on lust and idiocy. The funny farm becomes a parable for a world in which we need to believe in and accept each other's failings. Chanwook Park has crafted perhaps the most original film of the year and one of the most moving. It comments on the nature of belief and on a humanity that we are in danger of losing through cleverness. It features colourful characters and scenes that make us gasp. There is enough creativity in I'm a Cyborg but That's OK for ten films not just one. Constantly defying expectation it even manages to treat with respect the question of mental illness which is used largely as a metaphor or plot device. When we see the pain and suffering of real mental illness it is clear that Chanwook Park is not mocking.I'm a Cyborg but That's OK takes Chanwook Park's reputation as a master filmmaker and builds it even further. Having established himself with films of violent realism it may upset fans of Old Boy and Lady Vengeance. And while I'm a Cyborg but That's OK is not about hyperviolence and the metaphysics of revenge the dizzying array of ideas may be more than many audiences can stomach in one sitting. It may just seem so offthewall that you lose patience before the story gets going. Which would be a shame.So maybe take a very deep breath. Make sure your batteries are fully charged. If it doesn't blow you out the cinema  I'm a Cyborg but That's OK  may just blow your mind.".

	schema:headline " A bit boringbut a very fresh film from director Park Chan Wook";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Park Chan Wook is known for creating very eccentric films including his widely known 'vengeance trilogy'. In the interviews that he had with the Korean press he said that he made 'Saibogujiman kwenchana'because he wanted to take it easy after finishing his vengeance trilogy. While it is definitely much less violent and different from his previous films it certainly has a strong touch that separates director Park from the average movie director.The storyline is simpleyet it is something that has never been tried before. Two patients at a mental hospital fall in love with each other. Young Goonbrilliantly played by Lim Soo Jungis a patient who thinks she's a cyborg having a strong dislike towards doctorsbecause they took away her grandmother when she was youngand not eating food for fear that her robotbody would break down. Il Soonplayed by the sensational singer Rainis a patient who thinks that he can steal other people's abilities and has a fear of being demolished from the world. It's simple yet complicated because there are twists and turns everywhere that Park leaves unexplained. It's not your average blockbuster I don't even know if foreigners would like this movieseeing as that Lim Soo Jung and Rain are not famous in the western world.although Rain was named one of the 100most influential people by Time Magazine last year But in a world where the film industry is running out of ideas this film is definitely outstanding unlike the average clich Korean love stories filled with Cinderella stories and triangular relationships. How many people could think up such a beautiful love story that takes place at a mental hospital? After watching this film I truly understand why Park Chan Wook is a great film director. He's not the kind of director that only directs safecashguaranteed blockbusters. He's the sort of directorlike Kim Ki Dukwho takes a challenge and tries to create a new chapter in cinema history. Already rumors are spreading in Korea that this film is a front runner for next year's Cannes International Film Festival.

	onyx:emotionText "Director Park Chan Wook is known for creating very eccentric films including his widely known 'vengeance trilogy'. In the interviews that he had with the Korean press he said that he made 'Saibogujiman kwenchana'because he wanted to take it easy after finishing his vengeance trilogy. While it is definitely much less violent and different from his previous films it certainly has a strong touch that separates director Park from the average movie director.The storyline is simpleyet it is something that has never been tried before. Two patients at a mental hospital fall in love with each other. Young Goonbrilliantly played by Lim Soo Jungis a patient who thinks she's a cyborg having a strong dislike towards doctorsbecause they took away her grandmother when she was youngand not eating food for fear that her robotbody would break down. Il Soonplayed by the sensational singer Rainis a patient who thinks that he can steal other people's abilities and has a fear of being demolished from the world. It's simple yet complicated because there are twists and turns everywhere that Park leaves unexplained. It's not your average blockbuster I don't even know if foreigners would like this movieseeing as that Lim Soo Jung and Rain are not famous in the western world.although Rain was named one of the 100most influential people by Time Magazine last year But in a world where the film industry is running out of ideas this film is definitely outstanding unlike the average clich Korean love stories filled with Cinderella stories and triangular relationships. How many people could think up such a beautiful love story that takes place at a mental hospital? After watching this film I truly understand why Park Chan Wook is a great film director. He's not the kind of director that only directs safecashguaranteed blockbusters. He's the sort of directorlike Kim Ki Dukwho takes a challenge and tries to create a new chapter in cinema history. Already rumors are spreading in Korea that this film is a front runner for next year's Cannes International Film Festival. Although I think it is totally a rumor I do wish that this competes at Cannes a festival that elevated Park into worldwide fame.";

I'm a cyborg but that's OK is however very different from Oldboy or any of the sympathy trilogy movies. It has what Hollywood lacks no clues and great depth as opposed to a great deal of clues with no depth. To make a long story short if the maincharacter needs to take a pee she doesn't first consult with the camera so that the viewer is sure to understand what is going on. Now this to some can be a big drawback why i believe the overall score on IMDb is relatively low. So beware if you aren't interested in any of the psychological spiritual or philosophical thoughts that the movie is offering because it is packed full.Cha Younggoon the main character played by Sujeong Lim is experiencing a big trauma in her youth and  perhaps  copes by 'becoming' a cyborg You could guess her inspiration comes from her grandma  the rat and with it comes some guidelines the Sins. sympathy feeling guilty and useless daydreaming are some of them. These becomes her obstacles in her path to rid the earth of the whiteuns  her caretakers on the mental hospital. There you have it. Now you do get clues as to why she wants to go on a killing spree but i wont include spoilers here.The soundtrack is welltimed and good. The acting from just about any in the cast are great. They don't have easy characters to portrait and you would think they had many pointers and clues as how to interpret them because they feel very authentic. The patients all have some kind of psychological disorder everything from only being able to walk backwards to having the ability to steal peoples characteristics. Therein lies much of the humor. From outside they look disoriented and in chaos but Chanwook takes us on a fascinating journey inside their heads. The patients all seem to understand each other on another level than the caretakers do and it is beautiful to watch. The movie jumps from being funny to deep to emotional over and over again and im left totally drained out at the end of the movie. It doesn't matter that the ending is abrupt if you feel like me you want to watch it again and again to pick up on things you missed and to go through the emotions all over again.I will have to be bold and say that although Oldboy is not far behind this is the best from Chanwook Park and hence one of the best movies period.".

	schema:headline " flawed in some small ways but overall a crazily sincere masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "There are ways to do romantic comedies just as their are ways of doing sincere dark comedies set in mental hospitals and ChanWook Park goes to fantastic and unexpected lengths of subverting expectations with truly nutty and this may be the nuttiest movie to come out of Korea this uh month ideas and visuals being explored while never skimping on making these people to care about. And yes the cyborg Cha YoungGoon SuJeung Lim at first seems like a typical nut or what one might stereotype as. Indeed as I thought more about it what Park goes for is almost experimental what would it be like to have as the pivotal character of a movie the person in the loony bin who is near unresponsive to other people and who won't eat any food? At first we're plunged into her mindset she's a cyborg after all and she marks up her energy levels by her toes lighting up and takes in such energy by licking batteries as opposed to regular consumption.But she also has a troubled past though moreso in the memories of her grandmother whom she was closest with and who we see in flashbacks was tossed away into a sanitarium as YoungGoon was eventually instead of actually dealing with them as real fellow family members. It's hard not to get caught up further into her much more real plight when shock treatment comes around and that the feeding tubes just won't do any good. From the sound of this it sounds like a really tragic story and in a way it is. But on the other hand it absolutely isn't all the same. It's Park's funniest film loaded with his bravura sense of style that is brutally selfconscious with the camera lots of wonderful usages of color from greens to reds to whites and blues and so on 360' pans highflying shots a great splitscreen involving two characters in two separate solitary rooms connected by two cups and a string as well as with very assured direction. To see someone make films like 'Cyborg' or Oldboy is to see someone who doesn't mind obviously flashy moments because there are just as many moments that are more intimate in connection between the characters.But as I said it's a very funny movie with the various character in the mental hospital veritable caricatures there's one guy who got tossed in by apologizing to everyone involved in an accident he wasn't involved in and one fat woman who when not stealing YoungGoon's food is trying to get static electricity going from rubbing her feet and random characters doing wacky things in the halls behind main characters talking. There's a big belly laugh at the 'picture book' of the Cyborg's where it lists the seven deadly sins inexplicably linked to the torture and murder of cats in the classic storybook pictures. There's even an actor who comes closest to looking like the Korean Bruce Campbell! And the scenes with YoungGoon going into superviolent mode as the cyborg and shooting everything in sight ranks right up with the corridor fight sequence in Oldboy as Park at his most staggering in choreographing mayhem.But then there's Rain's character Park Ilsun who is the counterpoint for YoungGoon as he's just a crazy thief in on his fifth voluntary commitment. He'll be hopping around one moment or imagining himself going very tiny so as to not be noticed. But what the two of them share no matter what is vulnerability which soon they see in each other or at least IlSun sees in YoungGoon with scenes showing either one crying their eyes out actually being earned. It's as much of a credit to the actors as it is to Park that none of this is false sentimentality and out of the wild comedy there is subtext always present of the director meeting the willing audience member halfway it is a mental hospital and no matter how crazy it can be they aren't tapped out of life completely. This makes up the emotional tie between the two main characters and the struggle to compromise a mental state that can't be fixed and a more pragmatic goal eating food leads to a real emotional highlight.Only the denouement or what could be considered that perhaps as there's a nukebomb element thrown in with outdoor rain scenes that feel real unnecessary albeit there's a tremendous final shot for the film and little bits involving the supporting characters that could be left out what's with the guy that won't stop yelling?. Otherwise this is still prime work going on daring even as far as blending together some real surrealistic tendencies with the kind of spirit that went into One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It takes guts to put the personal with the wacky but somehow I'm a Cyborg But That's OK pulls it off better than any other film I can't think of in recent memory.".

The mental hospital looks like no hospital I've ever seen with bright green padded rooms deep red maintenance corridors and even a hiccupping grandfather clock. The CGI whether due to budget constraints or artistic choice has that artificial quality seen all too often but here it adds to the films carefully crafted aesthetic. It's almost as if we're seeing the hospital through the eyes of the patients everything seems not quite real. Or perhaps too real.There is a shaky start though.

And it is. Think Angels of the Universe meets Twelve Monkeys packed with visual thrills. The opening sequence is one of the biggest kicks of its kind.Wheels are spinning are gears are grinding in pale translucent green vaguely reminiscent of xray images. It turns out we are observing a Cyborg's inner life cleverly interwoven with the opening scenes of the actual feature. Before we really understand how Cha cover girl SuJeong Lim ended up on the funny farm the camera is gliding downstairs in an impossible dolly shot smoothly passing through closed doors down to the asylum's mysterious subbasement with its candycolored pipework. In the course of the movie's 105 minutes ChanWook Park takes us from Seoul to the Swiss alps and back again. I say forget Bollywood. South Korea is the new Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a big fan of Park ChanWook's Vengeance trilogy and though I knew this would be a different beast I was keen to see it nonetheless. It is essentially the story of two young people with acute mental problems caused by family troubles. The first Young Goon is a girl who believes she is a cyborg and is sectioned after attempting to recharge while working on a radio manufacture production line. The second is a young man played by the apparently famous Korean singer Rain I regret to say I can't confirm his celebrity as I know nothing about Korean pop who is certainly a talented actor based on the evidence here. He believes and makes other inmates believe that he can steal anything including their personal traits and characteristics. YoungGoon won't eat because her delusion convinces her that if she does she will break down irreparably but she is befriended by IlSun Rain who devotes his energies to coming up with a strategy for getting her to eat. This film contains moments of mad genius which I won't divulge here but for all it's flaws it's worth seeing just for the fantasy setpieces. However it touches on mawkish sentimentality at times a condition not previously noted in Park's films and initially the inhabitants of the sanitarium seem comedic caricatures who are there merely for our voyeuristic amusement. I'm A Cyborg is definitely at it's best when Park indulges his flair for stunning visual sequences and imaginative storytelling. So while I don't rate it as highly as I do his Vengeance films it certainly warrants pride of place in modern Korean cinema.".

Neither does it feature picturesque landmarks of mountains trees and buildings all so typical. In fact it is nothing we have ever seen before.Instead of a pale long haired female lead Lim SuJeong Tale of Two Sisters is refreshing as Younggoon a paranoid schizophrenic who thinks she is a half cyborg. She doesn't eat as she charges herself with battery sticks herself with wires and talks to fluorescent lamps. IlSun Rain a mental institution mate who steals personality traits from other patients is secretly in love with her.Using fanatical and violent characters is nothing new in director Park Chanwook's movies and what the movie has to offer is really out of this world. Conservative audiences may be completed bewildered with the bizarre story and wacky characters from an apologetic patient who walks backward a liar who suffers from memory loss and obese bully who craves to fly with her red and green socks.I think the director wants the audience to look beyond the strange and peculiar characters and that a universal theme of love and dreams can be applied to just any person. Love is all about acceptance and sacrifice isn't it? It doesn't have to fall into the same mould that all other movies would use.You have to applaud Director Park for his ambitious and highly imaginative take in a movie industry like Korea. Although it is cannot be considered a romantic comedy audience will laugh and be thrilled by the stylistic directing spirited soundtrack which would remind you of a merrygoround and fresh vibrant colours from yellow green to blue.However the character development was weak and the audience never really got a sense of why Younggoon would behave in the way she was even though her family members are not normal as well. Despite being a short movie there were moments of boredom as there was no clear sense of direction on where the movie was heading. Rain's maiden performance could not be said as exceptional but fans can at least still get to see him shirtless.Audience will be divided into two camps You either appreciate this zany and hilarious movie or hate it to pieces for being nonsensical and lame.httpthemovieclub.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "So Park Chanwook creator of the visually and psychologically arresting Vengeance Trilogy the chilling short Cut and military mystery thriller J.S.A. has adopted a new approach for his latest instalment the romantic comedy. This is not to say he has gone off his game however. He is still very much on top of it and further cementing his reputation as one of Korea's most original provocative and sought after film makers. And after making so many films set within the darker corners of the human soul a little light heartedness is not only welcomed by the man himself but critics and fans alike.Now some more conservative types may find drawing humour from the mentally ill a little touchy but Park handles it with surprising care and avoids stereotypes. Instead of paranoid delusionistssuicidal depressivesschizophrenics he gives us far more interesting and playful characters. The woman whose night socks give her ability of flight after lights out. The singer who's adamant to get into the Swiss choir after years of practising. And the male lead IlSoon a young man with thieving tendencies due to a fear of shrinking into a dot if he does nothing. But he's no ordinary thief. He steals peoples' manners peoples' table tennis games and even manages to make off with an entire Thursday Damn he's good Younggoon admires.Albeit an unconventional love it is somewhat more worthy than those of Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy and can leave the viewer feeling upbeat and moderately happy and secure in contrast to the ultraprovocative catalogue he has behind him. Beautifully acted and on a par which many Western romcoms will fall miserably and embarrassingly short of I'm A Cyborg is inventive lovely cute and slightly soppy But That's OK.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk".

This is not to say he has gone off his game however. He is still very much on top of it and further cementing his reputation as one of Korea's most original provocative and sought after film makers. And after making so many films set within the darker corners of the human soul a little light heartedness is not only welcomed by the man himself but critics and fans alike.Now some more conservative types may find drawing humour from the mentally ill a little touchy but Park handles it with surprising care and avoids stereotypes. Instead of paranoid delusionistssuicidal depressivesschizophrenics he gives us far more interesting and playful characters. The woman whose night socks give her ability of flight after lights out. The singer who's adamant to get into the Swiss choir after years of practising. And the male lead IlSoon a young man with thieving tendencies due to a fear of shrinking into a dot if he does nothing. But he's no ordinary thief. He steals peoples' manners peoples' table tennis games and even manages to make off with an entire Thursday Damn he's good Younggoon admires.Albeit an unconventional love it is somewhat more worthy than those of Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy and can leave the viewer feeling upbeat and moderately happy and secure in contrast to the ultraprovocative catalogue he has behind him. Beautifully acted and on a par which many Western romcoms will fall miserably and embarrassingly short of I'm A Cyborg is inventive lovely cute and slightly soppy But That's OK.Read the full review and more at www.wrawreviews.co.uk";

There's something for everyone in it. It even is funny and visually beautiful. What does one want more?After the film I found out that the director was the same who made Oldboy and it somehow made sense because both films have an extreme authenticity and originality.It's a film for everyone  almost  only hard boiled realists will have their difficulties with it probably the same ones that didn't like Amlie.".

	schema:headline " It's an oddly paced and a somewhat matteroffact film but that's really quite OK.";
	schema:reviewBody "'I'm a Cyborg but that's OK'  it sounds like one person saying one thing and then someone else replying with their own opinion. In a sense that's exactly the narrative for 'Saibogujiman kwenchana' which I can only entrust with the World Wide Web actually means 'I'm a Cyborg But That's OK'. The film is a romance of sorts but between two people of varying mentalities one deluded enough to think they're something they're not and the other smart enough to know what they are but treating life as if a child inside an adult's body. In a way this is apart of the film's overall downfall  the sweet and somewhat humorous look at a budding romance using psychological problems as a backdrop.In a sense you have to admire what the director Chanwook Park has done here and that's if I've read into it correctly. I'm a Cyborg But That's OK seems to be about Korea's ever growing world of technology modernity and gadgets. Whether it's a statement on a generation's struggle to come to terms with the introduction of all this technology is entirely down to the viewer but for me the film is a fable about that. In this day and age everybody of a certain age seems to need mobile phones pagers computers with access to messenger services  merely to keep in constant contact with friends in the world. The sorts of people in the mentioned criteria in terms of age are exactly the same as the two primary characters we follow in this film 24 year old Park Ilsun and 26 year old Cha Younggoon.I think the film is a statement more so on the coming to terms with the introduction of all this technology and modernity rather than an out and out study of two people who are suffering from specific psychological studies. Park IIsun is an attention seeker and Cha Younggoon is an anorexic that much we can figure out for ourselves and that's pretty much how it goes down in terms of establishments. There is a brief backstory to do with Younggoon's grandmother being taken away but I don't think it acts as a dramatic enough catalyst for her eating disorder to begin.So rather than include scenes that suggest an in depth study the film spends most of its time having Younggoon shooting up the hospital asylum they're all staying at as well as throwing in other such dream sequences to do with socks that enable you to fly. As a character Young is perhaps so unable to come to terms with the postmodern age of gadgets that have wormed their way out of the factories and amongst the people in the Far East that she deludes herself to be a machine of some sort. In this case she is an interesting study of the filmic body a hybrid of woman and machine but through imagination only. This potential fear of technology and inability to fit into a social network of cell phones gadgets and gizmos to keep in touch with everyone explodes with disorientating and random outbursts of scenes in which she shoots up the asylum and its employees. Briefly she sheds the weak anorexic skin and possesses brilliant power al Robocop or The Terminator. She combats her fears and frustrations by becoming what she fears most a robot a machine  a piece of brutal modernity.So while the ideas under the surface may well be right on I'm a Cyborg But That's OK is really just a cute and somewhat pleasant film that passes time rather nicely. The bizarre content of an avantgarde nature is fine in the sense it is dealing with people of a damaged psyche anyway but the film's general rhythm is distorted we can be going through a phase of long cuts complete with people talking softly to out and out chaos be it a guns blazing dream sequence or a scene in which someone imagines they are thirty centimetres tall  then there's the scene I mentioned earlier to do with socks that enable you to fly and yodel.The study of young people here is key this is not One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or that bizarre chain of scenes from Twelve Monkeys in the asylum and the film never reaches the heights of quality of those films. Instead the Far East's constant updating and introduction of technology in countries steeped in rich history quite literally dating back centuries is the focus. The young people who are congregating in this film are not of that fast paced technology driven life and yet they still find difficulty in getting on with one another something that makes Young and Park's relationship all the more rewarding. The film is a love story at the end of the day about one individual who thinks they're a robot but is actually anorexic and someone else who believes they can steal people's souls when really they're probably crying out for attention.Park is able to get that attention with Young and is able to act out 'repairing' her which pays reference to whatever's imaginatively inside her his belief of being able to 'take' souls is played into being able to 'fix' gears and cogs but it's the fact he believes he has actual access to people's insides that counts here. Given this they are each other's remedy Young enables Park to come to terms with human interaction and Park aids Young in her eating disorder the truly odd thing may be that neither of them ever quite knew it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Park Chanwook's Vengeance Trilogy and enjoyed them I was keen to see how he would tackle a more lighthearted film. With this he clearly demonstrates that he is not a one trick pony. Here he manages to make a film with plenty of laughs as well as some sadness. It would be too easy for a comedy set in a mental institution to descend into a freak show where we are invited to laugh at the patients condition but he skilfully avoids that.We are introduced to the protagonist Cha Younggoon in the opening sequence where she is working in an electronics factory she hears a voice telling her what to do and cuts open her arm pushes wires into the wound tapes them in place then plugs herself in to the mains. She survives this but as there is clearly something wrong she ends up in a mental institution. As she is convinced that she is a cyborg she refuses to eat instead spending her lunch time holding a battery. She grows to believe that her purpose is to kill the doctors there but her sympathy is preventing her from doing this because of this she forms a friendship with another patient who claims to be a thief who can steal just about anything... if he can steal Thursday surely he can steal her sympathy. As she isn't eating she is getting weaker and her new friend Park Ilsun is determined to persuade her to eat he does this by giving her a device which he tells her will enable her to eat food.The film has many poignant moments as well as several surreal scenes such as those where Younggoon believes she is gunning down the medical staff at the facility. The actors did a good job especially Sujeong Lim in the lead role who had a strange detached look which was somewhat increased by her blonde eyebrows. With this film Park Chanwook has clearly demonstrated he can make light hearted films.... I certainly wasn't expecting him to make a film that featured yodelling.".

	schema:headline " A courageous philosophic and positive movie about the sense of life";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a Cyborg But That's OK is a touching and romantic comedy movie about the sense of life. The movie is set in a mental institution and introduces us to a lot unique characters a shy man who is always excusing himself a man who believes his wife is made of fur a fat woman who thinks she can fly a strange couple that sings along to traditional Swiss songs by yodelling and so on. While all these characters seem to have some fun and even though the doctors and nurses are mostly nice with them there are also a few sad scenes when they feel disillusioned and scared and seem to realize that their lives aren't completely normal. The film should have been a little bit longer and shown us a little bit more details about the fate of these characters in my opinion and even several movies or a television series could have been inspired by this film.Let's focus on the main story though. It's basically the story of Young Goon a young and shy woman who refuses to eat and is looking for a sense in her life. She grew up with her schizophrenic grandmother who believed she was a mouse and her parents never really took care of her. One day her grandmother was forced to go to a mental institution but obviously not the same as YoungGoon's. The schizoid young woman has never seen her grandmother again. She misses her a lot and wants to bring her dentures she forgot at home when she was taken away by the staff of the mental institution. Since then YoungGoon also desires to avenge her grandmother and kill all staff members of all mental institutions. YoungGoon believes she is a cyborg that needs to be recharged to gain enough power to realize her plans which is dangerous for people around her and especially for herself.In the mental institution she meets IlSoon who is hospitalized for kleptomania stemming from schizophrenia. The antisocial thief is a very emotional and smart person who immediately falls in love with the mysterious YoungGoon. When she is about to die by refusing to eat he tries to protect her from herself and the staff. When he learns that she believes she is a cyborg he develops a plan to make her eat by developing a fictional machine that converts food into electrical energy. But the young man soon has to develop further plans to protect the love of her life when she starts to believe that she is in fact a nuke bomb that requires a bolt of lightning to detonate and bring the end to the world.While the story lacks direction and feels fluffy at times this fact isn't important as the movie is about something completely different. It wants to show us that even people in a mental hospital can be very and sometimes even more human than normal people and feel sorrow love and hate very intensively. The way the two outsiders of the group come closer to each other is far beyond physical love. Her love story begins very slowly and at the beginning the young woman doesn't really care about or even realize what the young man feels for her. He slowly wins her heart by each step he takes and by doing so he doesn't only heal himself in a certain way and becomes more openminded responsible and social than ever before but he also saves the life of the woman he desires and gives a new sense to her sad life.This movie is really touching and convinces with a strong and credible acting. The movie though doesn't only focus on the drama elements or the romantic story with profound dialogues but it also includes several moments of intelligent humour and a few action filled overthetop scenes that break with the slow pace of the movie and feel very original and refreshing. The movie surely has some lengths and I think the film should have spend some more time on the supporting characters instead of the main story that only truly develops in the last third of the movie. On the other side this movie is very intelligent from an emotional and human point of view and has a beautiful philosophy telling us that each day of our life is unique and that something very positive could happen any day that gives your life a new sense or unknown joys. This is a movie that any really sad or suicidal person should watch because it says more than a thousand words could do. Director Park ChanWook who is known for completely different movies like Oldboy created a truly courageous and unexpected gem that may one day be hailed as a classic. It's not a movie for anybody. At first try I didn't adore the movie but I didn't stop thinking about and rediscovering it to get access to its pure and unique beauty. Patient and openminded viewers should get rewarded by watching this film. Those who are looking for quick entertainment a classic love story or a hilarious movie should change their minds before watching this.".

When she is about to die by refusing to eat he tries to protect her from herself and the staff. When he learns that she believes she is a cyborg he develops a plan to make her eat by developing a fictional machine that converts food into electrical energy. But the young man soon has to develop further plans to protect the love of her life when she starts to believe that she is in fact a nuke bomb that requires a bolt of lightning to detonate and bring the end to the world.While the story lacks direction and feels fluffy at times this fact isn't important as the movie is about something completely different. It wants to show us that even people in a mental hospital can be very and sometimes even more human than normal people and feel sorrow love and hate very intensively. The way the two outsiders of the group come closer to each other is far beyond physical love. Her love story begins very slowly and at the beginning the young woman doesn't really care about or even realize what the young man feels for her. He slowly wins her heart by each step he takes and by doing so he doesn't only heal himself in a certain way and becomes more openminded responsible and social than ever before but he also saves the life of the woman he desires and gives a new sense to her sad life.This movie is really touching and convinces with a strong and credible acting. The movie though doesn't only focus on the drama elements or the romantic story with profound dialogues but it also includes several moments of intelligent humour and a few action filled overthetop scenes that break with the slow pace of the movie and feel very original and refreshing. The movie surely has some lengths and I think the film should have spend some more time on the supporting characters instead of the main story that only truly develops in the last third of the movie. On the other side this movie is very intelligent from an emotional and human point of view and has a beautiful philosophy telling us that each day of our life is unique and that something very positive could happen any day that gives your life a new sense or unknown joys. This is a movie that any really sad or suicidal person should watch because it says more than a thousand words could do. Director Park ChanWook who is known for completely different movies like Oldboy created a truly courageous and unexpected gem that may one day be hailed as a classic. It's not a movie for anybody. At first try I didn't adore the movie but I didn't stop thinking about and rediscovering it to get access to its pure and unique beauty. Patient and openminded viewers should get rewarded by watching this film. Those who are looking for quick entertainment a classic love story or a hilarious movie should change their minds before watching this.";

Anything and everything can happen you don't have to explain every minute detail and the bottomline is you can interpret it in whatever way you want. I'm a Cyborg But That's OK runs along similar lines having its two lead characters patients of a psychiatric ward but therein lies some structure of a story about love reaching out and in making sense of life not to mention the movie as well.Directed by Park Chanwook who gave us his famous Vengeance trilogy Oldboy Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance it's a very big leap from that trilogy into something more fantastical light hearted bright and may I say at times nonsensical as well. But there were some lapses into teasing audiences familiar with his more violent trilogy incorporating signature scenes which were a blast as I thought they were inserted at appropriate moments when you just want to lash out at everything else happening in the story.The introductory scene reminded me of Wisit Sasanatieng's Citizen Dog in fact the general look and feel of the presentation resembled it minus the voice over narration where we see Younggoon an extremely appropriate subtitled name played by Im Soojung degenerate into madness and gets herself warded into an asylum. She starts to think of herself as a cyborg and develops special affection with florescent lamps and vending machines while refusing to eat as it will mess with her internal machinery. And we meet Ilsoon Rain who develops feelings for her and embarks on a quest to convince and get her to eat while sharing with her tender moments as they make sense of their worlds within the confines of an institution.The big draw to the movie for local audiences will no doubt be Rain. In his debut feature film fans will no doubt be flocking to the cinemas to catch their latest idol in action with the only snag that those below 16 cannot gain admission rated NC16. Female fans will be thrilled that he sings a little in the movie and yes bares that famous chest of his. We're talking about the man who has held a concert here with the highest ticket prices the most expensive being S888 though the preview I was in was surprisingly less than 20 persons in attendance.For starters I do not know of his appeal nor do I listen to his music but I thought he performed reasonably as Il Soon a thieving man who believes he can absorb the abilities of others and does so to comedic effect. Actually what turned out appealing to me was centered onto the background madcap people the supporting cast playing all sorts of crazy characters. Some with dialogue others just preoccupied in their own little worlds doing their own little repetitive actions most of which just draws out chuckles.It's a love story within plenty of fantastical sequences. Just don't try to make sense of things that don't seem to make sense and you'll be able to breeze it. And on that note I'm a Cyborg but That's OK may not be everyone's cup of tea in the traditional romantic comedy sense.".

Another vital aspect for an action movie is of course that the action sequences are very well done. The movie is quite graphic but not gratuitously so or for its own sake such as in many a recent horror movie the Saw series comes to mind.I guess the movie could be likened to a good apple pie  certainly nothing revolutionary in fact quite the staple of its genre but who would want to turn down a really good apple pie with quality ingredients?".

This movie is exactly what you would expect from great Korean cinema comparable to the likes of The Chaser Memories of Murder and A Bittersweet Life. In this movie there is lots of rather believable tragedy little kitsch there is the occasional unsuitable oneliner and the girl sometimes says things that in my opinion are too mature for her age and yank a little too much at the emotional chain  these are basically the things that brought my rating down to 910 and a fair amount of graphic violence and realism in the fighting scenes. There are also some wacky characters just like they appear somewhat frequently in east Asian productions but I think they fit in quite nicely despite the otherwise very serious tone.If one were to compare it to a US production I would go with e.g. A History of Violence because of the serious tone and the realism but still the overall style is drastically different.The whole experience is nicely rounded off with a very beautiful score and the only thing I considered negative besides what I already mentioned was that the plot is moving very fast. At various points I was not sure whether I didn't pay enough attention or whether details were left out. Meaning for instance how one character got the information about another character. These connections of information between characters are not always clear in my opinion but it does not really hurt the story and I am sure that it would be clear with a second viewing  something that this movie absolutely deserves.".

And it ended with more than a bang. More like a beautiful chaotic explosion.This movie as a whole was great. I am in WOW shock. Now the end was amazing but without the hour and a half of plot story characters suspense good fightaction scenes sweet revenge etc.... the end would not have been so incredible.This movie is in comparison like a cross between Taken Bourne Identity mildly similar to Bourne he doesn't have memory problems or anything Leon the Professional and Man on Fire. Honestly. This movie rivals them all.Its very gritty very brutal. Very violent and at times disturbing. But there is a lot of emotion and heart building up at the center of it all.I don't know if you are one of those idiots who don't watch these movies because they don't want to read the subtitles and think that the dubbing is too cheesy and would take away from the movie if you are. Get over it and you will end up experiencing a Dynamic movie you otherwise would not have watched.If subtitles don't bother you. Then I suggest you go ahead and watch this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "You may want to compare this with or see shades of the film from the likes of Luc Besson's The Professional Pierre Morel's Taken and Tony Scott's Man on Fire with the common running theme of a highly skilled operative taking it upon himself to rescue someone they love from the clutches of devious villains and executing a brand of vengeance without remorse as he ploughs through and singlehandedly demolishes all who stand in his way. The Man From Nowhere is South Korea's answer to this subgenre and does so with aplomb both in providing that emotional punch to the highly choreographed set action pieces.The heartthrob Won Bin buffs up to become that titular character Cha TaeSik a man with a secret past who now lives his life incognito in a shady pawnshop trade striking up his only friendship with the outside world through Jeong SoMi Kim Sae Ron from A Brand New Life doing an excellent job once again the kid from next door whose mom happened to offend drug traders who are also in the business of dealing with the lucrative body organs black market. In fact the villains are portrayed in such negative light for the multitude of vices they get involved in including kidnapping children for an Oliver Twist type of artful dodging profession as couriers that you just cant' wait for them to get their just desserts.SoMi's capture and her mom's demise moves the plot forward with Cha having to rely on skills from his past to reclaim the only life of normalcy he knows as he goes on a one man rampage trying to piece together how deep the rabbit hole of villainy goes while on the chase by both the cops led by Detective Kim ChiGon Kim TaeHun and the villains all out to put a stop to his series of destruction to their business. Like any Korean film there is ample time given to deal with Cha's backstory as well as to showcase Won Bin's good looks sans scruffy long hair and a perpetual scowl on the face. His previous film Mother and this one put together would already prove that Won Bin has a wide range of emotions to play unorthodox characters rather than just being another pretty boy on the block.Now for all the action junkies who think they may have seen it all this Korean flick ups the ante in at least two scenes which makes you sit up and take notice that the stunt coordinators are no pushovers and can offer something refreshingly different. There's that iconic leap from the balcony in The Bourne Ultimatum that had Jason Bourne chase someone through the balcony window in a leap that's followed by a camera. Here the same got pulled off with the major difference being knowing it is precisely the actor Won Bin himself executing the move from a second storey leap through the window followed by a roll on the ground to break fall all done in one swift motion and unless some devious trick is used that's the actor alright.The other is the much lauded close quarters knife fight. It may be inspired by the likes of Oldboy or even Repo Men but this one held it's own ground through its beautiful yes it's a little weird using this to describe bloody violence choreography striking up that sense of all round danger with Cha going for the jugular with a lesson on anatomy with respect to where major arteries are located paralyzing his opponents before fatally dealing with some. This culminates in Part B that moved from many to one to a one on one battle that occasionally puts you in the first person's perspective. Those scenes alone will be reason enough to watch this for a second time and for fans of the revenge thriller flicks The Man From Nowhere sets to deliver the no BS dead serious treatment that will leave you applauding each time any bad guy bites the dust. Recommended!".

Anyone might think this is a mix of 'LeonThe Professional' and 'Man on Fire' where a highly trained but troubled person tries to protect a child but this movie is more than that.There are many short but strong stories nicely fabricated that will keep You watching the total movie in a rush! Now come to the story. A mystery man with no past links suddenly becomes involved in a drug transport because of a child being kidnapped and unfortunately that child was the only link of him to the outerworld .So had to comeout from his own hideout and save the girl and find out the persons behind it. He has to defy the police as they are after it too at a point the sad past life comes to daylight and it was well understood about his strange behavior of everything. This rouge so renegades the force and takes the action by his own. The stylish BOURNE looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciated.But I m not giving it the highest rating only its lacking of showing the touchy emotions in the best way..it was excess .Silence play a better role than words in some situations it needed that. But the overall movie was simply sublime.reasonable violence was shown here..it was logical. Some funny characters and parts are nicely putted into that enhanced the color and variety of the movie. But I am getting addicted to this korean thrillers. Memories of a murder' Joint security Area' Vengeance trilogy including OLDBOY Infernal Affairs trilogy 'The Chaser''Thirst''The Bittersweetness of Life' 'I Saw The Devil'..the serial is getting longer and longer..keep it up !!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer to this movie I wanted to go see it but wasn't like super hyped up for it. It basically looked like the Korean version of LEON The Professional. But this movie is like the Korean version of Man on Fire with fight sequences that are similar to the Bourne movies. I heard this film really skyrocketed Won Bin's popularity especially in Korea and I could tell why. He really is a badass in this movie and his charisma is overflowing in this movie. One of the girl in the audience couldn't help but say he is so cool in Korean during the scene where Won Bin's character is driving angrily while on the phone with the bad guys while showing some intimidating emotion. The plot isn't super original or anything basically Man on Fire with a better flow and more dark and gritty with better action in my opinion. Overall this film was a lot better than I expected and also kept my interest from beginning to end while also being entertained. The style of this movie reminded me of A Bittersweet Life in a good way which is a plus with saturated colors leaning towards the dark and blue. Some people might get a bit irritated by the constant camera shot to Won Bin's face while he takes a pose like in some magazine or something. But I could tell it's to sell the movie to female viewers as well. Excellent casting pretty good story with some slick action scenes make this movie really worth seeing there is something for guys and girls.8.310".

	schema:headline " Just a note of caution to the girls who are here purely to admire your eye candy the movie's not for the fainthearted!";
	schema:reviewBody "Have you ever thought how lost and distraught one can be following the loss of hisher loved ones? I guess this is a point that is worth pondering over especially when we are witnessing such a tragedy unfolding in Japan. The Man From Nowhere widely known as Ajeossi in South Korea essentially depicts a man who has withdrawn himself from the society and lost his sense of worth and living due to the lost of his loved ones. However he finally began to show affection and fondness in the little girl lives down the street it was just like how tin man finally found his heart. They were each other's only friend. So when she is taken away he fights with all his might and wit because he cannot possibly handle the loss of his only beloved friend.This simple plot is very well executed. In terms of the pacing it was just right and through subtle interactions between Taesik played by Won Bin and Somi played by Kim Saeron they show their high interdependency and chemistry. There was not a single part of the movie that is boring. Your tension is constantly kept at high and you will be sometimes treated with some tidbits of laughter. The narrative is definitely not the only attraction to this movie that eventually became the top selling movie in South Korea in the year 2010. Possibly the other main attraction is the film's cinematography. This movie has superb fight choreography underscores superb. Brace yourself for a bloody massacre but one that is not just of a bloody mess but of mission and gracefulness. This coupled with creative angles and excellent sound effects you get a movie that is of high production value. This alone assures you that the money that you spend on the movie is worthwhile.How can one forget the other important factor? It's the protagonist. Won Bin has made several breakthroughs in his acting career that started back in 1997. However this is probably by far the most successful role that he has taken up. With this single role he has bagged 7 awards. Is that justified? Certainly! From the initial bizarre look and stare to later on how he soften his look towards the little girl he wants to protect to the flashback where it depict his downfall and devastation to the ruthless and merciless look that was fuelled by hatred and despair when he was in search of the little girl they were all effectively delivered to the audience. You can get so drawn into his acting that you may feel the sheer violence is justified. One moment you grief with the man who lost his loved ones the next moment you crease your forehead at his brutality. The balance of this multifaceted character is definitely not easy but Won Bin did it. Also commendable is that there was no stuntman that stood in for the combat scenes. All the fist knives and guns action were executed by him. His black belt in Taekwondo definitely comes in handy for his role. Indeed he has proved himself to be more than just an eye candy.As the movie is coming to an end it takes on a twist that prevented another episode of tragedy. The ending scene was definitely perplexing at first but it turns out to be the man has finally found his 'home' for his heart where he can pour out his affection and love once more. With the calming ending track leading into the credits you cannot help but be affected that is being moved to tears. To sum it all great acting great production great movie.www.moviexclusive.com".

Man with a checkered past gets drawn into unintentional friendship with kid who falls prey to bad guys due to extraordinary circumstances. Plot is actually fairly unique and interesting we get a peek at a creative underworld business strategy in Seoul's Chinatown one of the bad guys has a fun role and the relationship between the hero and the kid comes across as pretty genuine. Action is pretty decent as well if you turn off your realism filter. Dialogue and writing are slightly subpar but it doesn't detract too much from the pace and plot of the film. It shouldn't win many awards but this film is worth watching for sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "As of recent I've been watching several good revenge flicks in the likes of Taken Man On Fire The Brave One Edge of Darkness and Death Sentence. All these movies work in there own ways not because of nonstop awesome action but because of the emotional appeal and pacing. This film is no different.The Man From Nowhere follows Cha TaeSik a long haired and deep voiced man who likes to keep a low profile. His only real link to a normal life and only friend comes from his neighbor Somi. After Somi and her mom are kidnapped by gangsters looking for their stolen drugs. As Cha Tae Sik gets closer to fining Somi the more his mysterious past comes on to the open.The Man From Nowhere is nothing we haven't scene before plot wise and is not crammed with action. What makes The Man From Nowhere work is its phenomenal pacing and exceptional acting from most of the cast. In the beginning you know next to nothing about Cha TaeSik but by the end of the movie a lot comes clear about why he acts the way he does. The real action takes awhile to hit but when it hits it really hits. This was some of the most realistic and brutal action I've ever seen from Korea. A very impressive knife fight towards the end of the movie is worth your patience. Trust me.The acting from Bin WonCha TaeSik and SomiSaeron Kim was amazingly touching. You really cared about these characters which gave strength to this movie. By the end you will almost be in tears.The directing of this movie was also some of the best I've seen from Korea. The dark tone and nearly flawless picture shows me how far up Asian cinema has come. A stand out shot is when Cha TaeSik jumps out of a window two or three stories up rolls over and continues running all seemingly in one take. I think it was cg stitched together but it looked very convincing.Overall this movie has an old plot but stands out because of the tone pacing and wonderful acting. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves good revenge flicks. You won't be disappointed!".

Of course some elements and little pieces of plot are borrowed but that is not quite so as the movie at it's on right stands strongly as an original masterpiece. Everything shots characters music and choreographed fighting scene has that certain wow factor and is sublime in the movie beautifully directed by Director JeongBeom Lee.TaeSik Cha acted by Bin won who also appeared in the Korean crime movie mother 2009 and brother hood of war 2004 puts out an excellent display of acting melodrama and slick fighting. I am judgemental about character appearance and the choice of his haircut is intriguing to note at the beginning which from some bizarre oddities with me today I thought I should write. The longmetro sexy haircut we often associate with Justic Bieber is an element designed to mask his shadowy and mysterious past. It also acts to mislead the antagonists about his unknown strengths which I got to say is spectacular when revealed in action scenesThose guys didn't knew who they were dealing with!. Mid way through the movie the act of cutting his hair signalled a climatic turning point to save his unfortunate neighbour Mido and an heightening problem for the gangsters he is confronting with he meant business!. Taesik angrily warns the captors that People living for tomorrow have no chance living today.  which is sort of true. Of course what he promises he delivers and there's no short of expectations of the body count that piles up later on...Overall the movie is awesome and is highly recommended to watch for blokes who can tolerate a bit of melodrama.

	schema:reviewBody "Asian crime dramas about the devastation of heroin distribution seem to be all the rage now however I applaud this film as this is only one facet to a larger story. What we have in The Man From Nowhere is essentially three types of crime movies rolled into one. Where the film succeeds is that it does not borrow too heavily from predecessors in the Korean revenge circuit and proceeds to craft an interesting story with elements that are both unique and welcome to the genre. The plot revolves around an isolated man's friendship with a little girl that reminds him of a life he used to enjoy before it was taken away. Well the little girl ends up being taken away and a cat  mouse game ensues to get her back. He will stop at nothing to redeem himself for the life he once lost and cannot bear losing it a second time. This story has been done many times however there are further developments in the plot that completely changes the structure of the movie making it another beast altogether. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous with Seoul being presented in many perspectives which you can feel like modern corrupt beautiful destructive etc. The acting is all top notch and not for one moment did any performance or dialogue take me out of the atmosphere of the movie. The only issue that bothered me was the way certain characters were introduced and how they were connected to others. It becomes hard to decipher the ties between the many baddies that appear in this film and while this may be intentional to keep the audience in the dark revealing the characters to the audience later on still came across as convoluted. There are multiple bad guys which do multiple functions for multiple organizations which becomes a mess for the audience to figure out. A minor complaint but less screen time should have been spent for certain disposable baddies. Now the action is presented in explosive bursts. It is genuinely gritty and intense which is seen in few action movies today. The film is not an action movie by any stretch however the few sequences that are in here are worth the price of admission alone. They are built up and they do deliver. The drama is exaggerated but reasonable for the subject matter although one or two evil acts the bad guys do are just stupid and darkly comical. Regardless The Man From Nowhere is a very entertaining revenge film and I wholeheartedly recommend to those seeking a fresh twist on bare knuckle bloodshed. 810".

The police and the bad characters are also clichd but in a good convincing way. The story line about the brutality of the KoreanChinese gangs and their complete lack of value for any human life is believable and sad.Few things raised the film above other good Asian violent gangster flicks for me. The lead character was very well played. His portrayal of the 'man in solitary pain' was great and I'm glad there was no OTT outbursts to try and explain his character or history. The little girl was also excellent and convincing. Their relationship really works with some genuinely touching moments. Also the fights scenes were well above other flicks I've seen.

Yes it is and yes it does.But this isn't a Hollywood slasher flick. The kills in this movie are not gratifying and aren't meant to be. The women being killed are not scantily clad models running through forests from men wearing masks. There is nothing pleasant or cool about these scenes they make the viewer uncomfortable they unsettle they bring one's mind into very dark places. It gives us a peek into the madness that every man is capable of and does so realistically and without pulling its punches. This brutal realism makes people uncomfortable and prompts negative reviews. This is understandable but unfortunate. I believe that a movie should be judged on more than the amount of blood the viewer is comfortable seeing onscreen. To these people please do not watch Korean revenge thrillers if you are uncomfortable with torture or blood.But enough of that rambling. This movie is excellent. Beautiful cinematography contrasts the stark dimly lit scenes where the murders or gritty fight scenes occur. The camera work is simple but effective the viewer is often treated to closeups of both Byunghun Lee and Miksik Choi and their facial expressions tell us more than dialogue ever could. There is also contrast between Lee and Choi. Lee clean and stoic and Choi filthy and madly expressive. They compliment each other very well and play off of each others strengths effectively.The story itself is typical of revenge films but fantastic in its execution. Lee's character experiences a profound loss at the hands of Choi's character and in the process of seeking revenge begins to resemble the man he so hates. The line between victim and aggressor becomes blurred between both characters. This is where the film shines. There is no black and white in I Saw the Devil the viewer is left with shades of grey.As for the acting it was all done very well. As I mentioned Lee and Choi work well together and all supporting cast members did an excellent job. Choi portrays his character in an incredibly convincing manner shifting suddenly from calmness to manic anger but never in a way that feels unnatural or forced. Lee's character is quiet and much less expressive but he does very well in showing immense amounts of emotion through just his eyes or subtle movements of his body. A memorable performance from them both.As for flaws the only thing I can think of is the strange perhaps unrealistic behaviour of the police. Lee is a member of the NIS and is very skilled when it comes to remaining hidden but that shouldn't make him untouchable when directly provoking police officers or driving on the wrong side of the street. Still though it's a very trivial complaint that isn't worth a deducted point.A confident 1010 from me. If you are comfortable seeing serial murder portrayed realistically and are able to appreciate more than just gore please do yourself a favour and watch this film.".

	schema:headline " An uncompromising unsettling and unforgettable thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. Censors claimed it was offensive to human dignity. These were the kinds of things they told the audience at the world premiere screening of the Uncut Version of I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International Film Festival last week. I had heard the movie was pretty graphic but I never expected that it would push any boundaries. I turned out to be only half right. After finding out his fiance has been brutally murdered secret agent Daehoon Byunghun Lee is at a loss. With the help of his fatherinlaw he sets out on a revenge plot to find the man who did it. He quickly finds the culprit Kyungchul Minsik Choi. He beats him pretty badly but instead of killing him he leaves him alive. He wants to stalk his prey and exact his revenge slowly and increasingly more painfully.Going in with very few ideas of what I was about to see I was startled and thrilled at the tenacious audacity on display from the opening scene all the way until the final frames. The film is a gritty merciless experience that could never be truly recreated in North America. This is the kind of hardboiled revenge thriller you could only find in Korea. And to hear that even the censors there could not handle Kim Jiwoon's complete vision makes the film all the more uncompromising and astounding. It has taken me well over a week to try and come up with the words to describe and review the film but never once have I forgotten anything I saw. It is quite simply unforgettable.I was right in assuming the film would not push the boundaries of what can be shown in regards to graphic violence and gore. But it comes really close. It makes Park ChanWook's entire Vengeance Trilogy look about as violent as the Toy Story Trilogy. Blood sprays flies drips gushes  every verb or way blood can possibly flow out of the human body occurs over the course of the film. It relishes in it no matter if the shot is raw unflinching and real or hyper stylized and completely overthetop. One sequence involving a brutal double murder as the camera swoops around the scene in a circle is simply magnificent to watch both to see how much blood is spilt and for how wicked and incredible a shot it is.The revenge tale at the core of I Saw the Devil is not all too original but it is the story and idea around it that is. Very rarely do we see a film with two characters that start off completely different but very slowly become all in the same. Daehoon and Kyungchul are both very stubborn individuals who will not back down from each other. They just keep at each other and even as Kyungchul is continually beaten abused and victimized he never once lets up. I keep coming back to a comparison with Batman and The Joker in The Dark Knight and how those two menaces push each other to their physical limits and that is exactly what happens in this film. While it was easy to pick sides in Dark Knight Jiwoon makes it increasingly difficult for the audience to figure out who they should sympathize with here. It is a haunting and blatantly moraldefying story and its raw and emotional undertones are more than difficult to swallow.But the key problem I found with the film is Jiwoon's lack of ability to know when to cut. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film and none of its edge would be lost in the process. I was glued to the screen for the majority of the film but found myself checking my watch more than once because I was totally baffled as to why it runs over 140 minutes. There is only so much revenge one can take and comprehend and having the film run so long makes it all too easy to call out as being selfindulgent. I respect the film and I respect Jiwoon as a filmmaker I wanted to seek out the rest of his film catalogue immediately after the lights came up but it just makes such an incredible movie feel a bit sloppy and weakened as a cohesive package.Another inconsistent element is Lee's Danhoon. We never learn much about him outside of his being a secret agent and wanting to inflict as much pain as he can through his revenge scheme. So how are we to assume he was not a sick and twisted individual in the first place? How are we to know this is not his first time inflicting such a painful revenge? He rarely speaks and his cold calculating eyes never once give us a hint of any further development. It is a great performance by Lee but it is one that feels very underdeveloped  outside of some rather obvious sequences.But then anyone would look underdeveloped when standing next to Choi. The man gives a performance that is the stuff of legend. He was incredible as the lead in Oldboy as the man who was wronged and is even better as the wrongdoer here. He brings out the monster in Kyungchul all too easily and his riveting performance is unmissable. The transformation into this disgusting psychopathic creature is nothing short of amazing. He chews up scenery at every turn and is magnetic on screen. Nothing even comes close to equaling the power intensity and dare I say authenticity he puts into this character. He is the stuff of nightmares.I Saw the Devil is a great revenge thriller but is far from perfect. Choi's electric performance alone should become required viewing for anyone with any interest in film.810.An edited version of this review also appeared on httpwww.geekspeakmagazine.com.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is not for the squeamish or the faint of heart. Censors claimed it was offensive to human dignity. These were the kinds of things they told the audience at the world premiere screening of the Uncut Version of I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International Film Festival last week. I had heard the movie was pretty graphic but I never expected that it would push any boundaries. I turned out to be only half right. After finding out his fiance has been brutally murdered secret agent Daehoon Byunghun Lee is at a loss. With the help of his fatherinlaw he sets out on a revenge plot to find the man who did it. He quickly finds the culprit Kyungchul Minsik Choi. He beats him pretty badly but instead of killing him he leaves him alive. He wants to stalk his prey and exact his revenge slowly and increasingly more painfully.Going in with very few ideas of what I was about to see I was startled and thrilled at the tenacious audacity on display from the opening scene all the way until the final frames. The film is a gritty merciless experience that could never be truly recreated in North America. This is the kind of hardboiled revenge thriller you could only find in Korea. And to hear that even the censors there could not handle Kim Jiwoon's complete vision makes the film all the more uncompromising and astounding. It has taken me well over a week to try and come up with the words to describe and review the film but never once have I forgotten anything I saw. It is quite simply unforgettable.I was right in assuming the film would not push the boundaries of what can be shown in regards to graphic violence and gore. But it comes really close. It makes Park ChanWook's entire Vengeance Trilogy look about as violent as the Toy Story Trilogy. Blood sprays flies drips gushes  every verb or way blood can possibly flow out of the human body occurs over the course of the film. It relishes in it no matter if the shot is raw unflinching and real or hyper stylized and completely overthetop. One sequence involving a brutal double murder as the camera swoops around the scene in a circle is simply magnificent to watch both to see how much blood is spilt and for how wicked and incredible a shot it is.The revenge tale at the core of I Saw the Devil is not all too original but it is the story and idea around it that is. Very rarely do we see a film with two characters that start off completely different but very slowly become all in the same. Daehoon and Kyungchul are both very stubborn individuals who will not back down from each other. They just keep at each other and even as Kyungchul is continually beaten abused and victimized he never once lets up. I keep coming back to a comparison with Batman and The Joker in The Dark Knight and how those two menaces push each other to their physical limits and that is exactly what happens in this film. While it was easy to pick sides in Dark Knight Jiwoon makes it increasingly difficult for the audience to figure out who they should sympathize with here. It is a haunting and blatantly moraldefying story and its raw and emotional undertones are more than difficult to swallow.But the key problem I found with the film is Jiwoon's lack of ability to know when to cut. There are easily twenty minutes that could be chopped right out of the film and none of its edge would be lost in the process. I was glued to the screen for the majority of the film but found myself checking my watch more than once because I was totally baffled as to why it runs over 140 minutes. There is only so much revenge one can take and comprehend and having the film run so long makes it all too easy to call out as being selfindulgent.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is probably the heaviest one I have ever seen in terms of mental and physical brutality even though I know movies that touch me even more. Anybody that has problems with torture scenes cannibalism violations and explicit sexual content as well as repetitive harsh language should stop reading here and lock for something else. Anybody else is invited to watch a movie about a monster you have never seen before.The movie turns around the question if one can and if so how one could fight a monster. If two monsters fight each other can there be a winner and what are the consequences for other involved people. The movie hides in fact a lot of philosophical content and depth beneath the surface of blood and gore and is less superficial than it might seem at first sight.The movie is comparable to the story of the great Korean vengeance trilogy around Sympathy for Mister Vengeance Oldboy and Lady Vengeance. It has the same harsh language and great acting as the Korean crime masterpiece Memories of murder. It has the same philosophical content as the Canadian Les sept jours du talion. Those movies can be references but this flick isn't comparable to any Hollywood production. This movie is also much heavier than any of the mentioned movies and something like that could only be a success in a country like Korea because it would be cut or banned in Europe or North America. Be sure to catch the uncut version no matter how high the price because it's really worth it.This movie doesn't only live from its shocking and gripping story and the numerous brutal scenes but also from the amazing acting. Choi Minsik is one of Korea's greatest actors as he proved in Oldboy or Lady Vengenace but this time he is even more perfect than I expected. He plays his role with so much credibility and precision and is easily the best interpretation of a serial killer I have ever seen in a movie. Lee Byunghun plays in a credible way a man that must become a monster to realize his promise and his revenge and he perfectly plays a broken person that goes through extreme changes. The other actors also deliver a more than solid job and remain credible. I must underline the acting of the weird cannibal friend of the monster and his strange wife you should absolutely check out the deleted scenes.The director also did a great and very detailed job. The acting is perfect the settings work very well and a great atmosphere is created. Kim Jeewon already created the dark calm and mindblowing masterpiece A tale of two sisters and he shows in here that he can also create a heavy pitiless and extreme movie like this. I happen to estimate him higher and higher and want to check out the rest of his movies.In the end this movie isn't maybe as gripping and stunningly original as my favourite Korean flicks Oldboy A tale of two sisters or Memories of murder but it surely is a movie you should check out if you like modern Asian cinema and if you liked the movies I've listed up in this review. It's a little masterpiece you won't forget after you have seen it and it's probably the best movie of the year to me. I would say that this movie underlines my opinion that the Korean cinema has become the best in the world during the last years.".

Some of the actions performed on screen will make most viewers squirm uncomfortably while a vast majority of those that aren't will let the audience's mind drift to some very very scary places. In short its a visceral thriller. The movie is essentially driven by both lead characters trying to inflict as much pain and terror in one another as possible. Unlike most serial killercrime thrillers both the two characters collide in violent brutal fashion with one another many many times leaving each other bloodied and eager for the next encounter. During these scenes the movie takes on an unexpected action tone with plenty of engaging fights that include knives scythes screwdrivers and in one scene a fire extinguisher. In between these scenes the audience is shown the full depravity of the serial killer's psychopathic nature who pretty much succeeds on setting the bar for on screen insanity.If this sounds like a mindless actionthriller summer film you'd be mistaken. Both Choi M.S and Lee B.H deliver great performances with Choi in particular acting disturbingly convincing as a completely unhinged maniac. The plot although somewhat predictable is nonetheless entertaining and once set in motion incredibly gripping. There are plenty of cheap boo! gotcha scares but some scenes are masterfully crafted to generate a LOT of tension. Believe me when I say that there were plenty of scenes where you could literally see that the rest of the audience wasn't even breathing much less moving. As mentioned earlier the action scenes are shot surprisingly well and there's a certain pleasure to be derived from watching the hunter become hunted... and in such an exquisite effective and merciless manner.On an aside the movie seems to have remake potential with Hollywood production. Perhaps starring Will Smith and Robert Downey Jr. as a serial killer? wouldn't you be terrified? with maybe... Danny Boyle at the helm? Hopefully the movie does well enough in its release to receive any considerations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Prior to my screening on I Saw the Devil at the Toronto International  Film Festival all I knew about the film was the one sentence provided  to me by IMDb.com A secret agent tracks a serial killer who murdered  his fiance.  But I did know that the film was directed by Jiwoon Kim who helmed  last year's brilliant the Good The Bad and The Weird. And on the  strength of that resume entry alone I secured tickets to I Saw the  Devil.  To say that I wasn't prepared for what I was about to screen was an  understatement. And I certainly wasn't prepared to comment that I Saw  the Devil is the best film about a serial killer since Se7en.  The film begins with the serial killer abducting a female victim. After  nearly destroying her head with a hammer he dismembers her and  disposes of the various body parts.  A search ensues and her head is found is shallow waters. We learn that  the murdered young girl was the fiance of Kim SoHyun who happens to  be some kind of Special Service bodyguard. She also was the daughter of  the former Chief of Police.  Kim SoHyun abruptly takes two weeks off work and begins a manhunt for  his finances killer. He has narrowed it down to four possibilities and  after roughing up the first two multiple wrench blows to the nuts he  focuses on his third suspect named Kang.  We know from the opening scene that Kang is indeed the killer and when  Kim SoHyun breaks into his home he realizes he has found his man.  But instead of turning Kang over to justice Kim decides that he will  beat torture and then release Kang over and over again tormenting him  without peace. A transmitter swallowed unwillingly by Kang allows Kim  to follow his every move.  The next reels of film will follow as Kim dispels some incredibly  violent and bloody vengeance on Kang. Using everything from rocks to  plastic bags to fire extinguishers and fish hooks Kim will enter  Kang's life beat him near death then leave him to his wounds only to  hunt him down and beat him some more.  The scenes of the beatings are not for the faint of heart as I Saw the  Devil is not for the squeamish. I scalpel to the foot and the cutting  of the Achilles tendon got the biggest reaction from the crowd but  there is enough blood and torture afflicted here to give anyone  nightmares.  Jiwoon Kim brilliantly weaves a tale that has not been shown in film  before. Our two leads meet each other early in the film whereas most  serial killer films don't pit the law and the maniac on the screen  together until the final act. Kim clearly has the upper hand until a  turn of events allow Kang to again strike back. It's like two  heavyweight boxers standing in the ring going toetotoe in a crowd  pleasing match of heavy blows.  And just when Kang takes control again and tries to surrender to  police Kim again finds a way to avenge his family.  Byunghun Lee as Kim and Minsik Choi as Kang are brilliantly cast and  bring an energy to the screen that is maintained through the 144  minutes of the uncut edit. The supporting cast which essentially  involves further Kang victims or unsavory characters that deserve their  fates do just enough to distract us from the brutality of the  oneonone battle and allow us to catch our breath barely before the  carnage begins anew.  It's been a while since I have been so invigorated and involved in a  film such as I Saw the Devil that I wanted to climb the highest  mountain and sing its praises but this film delivers the goods. Rarely  do you find an audience involved with that much violence on screen  cheering and applauding when a character utters I'm far from done  during a blood soaked frenzy of activity.  I didn't just see the devil. I saw the best serial killer movie in many  years and clearly one that goes in my Top 5 serial killer films of all  time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many reviewers who give this movie a good rating assume that most critics are put off by the violence and the bloodshed and then proceed to support their appreciation for the movie by explaining that one needs to look through the apparently necessary gore and appreciate the deeper layers of the movie. Well I wasn't necessarily put off by the gore although I don't appreciate gore for the sake of gore I don't like the Saw movies. I think Old Boy was an excellent movie for example. That movie went far beyond violence and gore and covered themes like pain loss and revenge in a wildly original meaningful way. 'I saw the devil' attempts to do something similar at least that is what I assume but it fails miserably. The acting is actually quite good MinSik Choi and ByungHun Lee are very capable actors without any doubt. And the story starts off very promising. There's a good build up the first 45 minutes but after that the story unravels into an inconsistent mess within no time. I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples GPScapsules are solid poopproof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions but are essential to the story development. And mind you Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose temporarily he happens to catch a ride with two killers with a dead body in the trunk  oh what a coincidence. And of course he kills them in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fiance. Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point  why then proceed 15 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer waving a knife into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on and so onI'm willing to accept a tiny bit of illogicality coincidence inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie but a movie should not be build on that. At least that is my humble opinion. The rating this movie gets on IMDb shows that most viewers don't agree.".

I deduct that the supposed moral of the story is that revenge cannot heal the inflicted pain even if you try to live out your revenge in installments. And that in the end revenge backfires and the moral borderline between victim and perpetrator starts to dissolve. Fair enough I've seen less illuminated morals in movies. But the execution of the idea undermines the whole purpose. A couple of examples GPScapsules are solid poopproof and only flush out with diarrhea? And exactly at what level of mushiness does the capsule decide to go for the exit? These may seem like trivial questions but are essential to the story development. And mind you Kimchi tends to be pretty spicy. The first time the serial killer is set loose temporarily he happens to catch a ride with two killers with a dead body in the trunk  oh what a coincidence. And of course he kills them in a moving car. The secret agent discovers the 3 bodies but somehow this does not convince him that his gamble to keep the serial killer on the loose may harm innocent bystanders or are we supposed to believe that he knew they were killers and that justice was somehow done despite the fact that he should know that the killer doesn't just have an appetite for 'guilty' victims as he butchered his fiance. Many more people end up dead or traumatized because of this gamble. And don't tell me that his hatred and urge for revenge have already completely taken over his rationality and morality at that point  why then proceed 15 hours to portray this disintegration? The other cops are supposedly completely incapable and do nothing to stop the carnage. Our cop gone rogue uses his cell phone a number of times to call with the police but they have no way to track him down? Despite the fact that they have GPS capsules with microphones in their arsenal they cannot track down a mobile phone? And even when they meet him at his father in law's house they don't apprehend him? Moreover when the serial killer decides to surrender to the police about 50 cops are waiting at the agreed meeting point. Then our rogue cop comes driving by and while driving pulls the serial killer waving a knife into the car and abducts him. And the other cops just stand by doing nothing. What? All 50 cops came on bicycle or using public transport and cannot pursue a driver who is struggling to subdue a serial killer with a knife while driving? And so on and so onI'm willing to accept a tiny bit of illogicality coincidence inconsistency and even plain stupidity in a movie but a movie should not be build on that. At least that is my humble opinion. The rating this movie gets on IMDb shows that most viewers don't agree.";

	schema:headline " I dislike this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I usually don't write reviews on movies but I felt compelled to write a thing or two about this movie that I disliked immensely. I honestly am having very hard time trying to understand why this movie got such a high rating in IMDb. First off The story was very boring and predictable and protagonist was probably one of the most despicable character I've seen in a revenge flick. It can probably be argued that he has probably done more damage than the serial killer through all the suffering he caused for innocent people. He appeared to show zero remorse for all the trauma he caused innocent victims by letting the killer go every time and seemed to enjoy the suffering he caused around him. At least for me he had zero redeeming quality and made me want to root for the psycho killer which I assume was not the director's intention. Further Lee byung hun's lack of emotional range can be clearly seen in many crucial scenes as his acting definitely feels forced from the beginning to the end and there is absolutely no character development for both the protagonist and the killer which I found very disappointing. They were simply one dimensional characters most frequently seen in Hollywood movies. Lee byung hun's dialogue seemed forced at times and I could not feel a single genuine emotion coming from him in any of the scene. Not only that the plot of this movie simply baffled me. Kim Soo HyeonLee byung hun's character makes many and I mean many illogical decisions in the movie. After he let Kyungchul go for the last time why would he go to the hospital to ask his brother? what Kyungchul is up to. I would have to assume that he has to be intellectually compromised to not see where this is headed. Kyungchul pretty much gives it away by saying that he will get his revenge which have to mean that he is probably headed for someone close to him. Further why would his brother know where Kyungchul is headed and how on earth did he wake up from a brain trauma with few slaps in the face. Further why on earth would he provoke someone who nearly killed him? None of these actions made sense. I'm assuming that his brother was there for some kind of comic relief  but this was neither amusing nor relevant to the plot. He could have probably stopped Kyungchul from killing his father in law if he used his brain for just one second. Further I'm confused as to how Kim soo hyeon would put his hand in someone's mouth and rip one's mouth open without getting seriously bit. Even Kyungchul's action doesn't make much sense as it would be more logical for him to go for Kim soo hyeon's parents instead of his father in law. Next how did he retrieve the GPS device after Kyungchul made a random civilian swallow it in the bathroomhe used the device at the end of the movie so he can hear his family suffer which I find very unnecessary and overthetop. Am I to believe that Kim soo hyeon actually retrieved it somehow from a civilian's mouth when he was in a hurry to find Kyung chul just so he can use it at the end for dramatic effect? Also I hated the part when Kyungchul's wife was getting killed. I feel terrible for saying this but making a female victim pregnant is such a hackneyed and clichd way to make the viewer feel emotional connection with the victim that I honestly found myself laughing through this part. Fight scenes were also pretty corny and no where near as gritty as many top Korean thrillers I've seen old boy chaser.... It was just some prettyboy doing his very best not to dirty his leather jacket for the most part again reminiscent of many Hollywood films. Kim soo hyeon honestly seemed to try so hard to preserve his cool image that it definitely overshadowed any kind of emotion coming from him. I could go on and on but I think I'll just stop here. Aside from few beautiful scenes especially the beginning sequence when soo hyeon's wife gets dragged away in the snow this movie was weak in its plots dialogues and character developments and had so many flaws. I do not believe this movie deserves the 7.9 rating it has and in my honest opinion this is probably on par with I spit on your grave. Also I am not a troll trying to provoke people. I genuinely want to know what most people here sees in this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I challenge you how many times do you have to cover your eyes with your hand during thiz film? The movie is so fertile it makes The Last House on the Left 2009 and I Spit on Your Grave 2010 look like plastic trees. The violence level will shock you to the edge of your seat. A secret agent found his fiance brutally murdered by the hand of a psychopath serial killer. With all the power he has the agent hunts down the killer and avenge him through the mercilessly pains he could possibly do. The power of thiz movie doesn't come from its story which is predictable but still it leaves you a little twist in the ending but how the Director describes it so well and brilliantly gritty. The fact is Korea Media Rating Board had forced the Director JeeWoon Kim to cut and edit the violent contents in thiz film. Although after the reediting in some scenes it still will mark something in your mind especially the killing scenes and violence against women. It's not a recommended film for viewers with weak heart. Kim is known for his previous works such as A Tale of Two Sisters 2003 and The Good The Bad The Weird 2008. In thiz revenge thriller the image is colorful with precise lighting and stunning cinematography. The throbbing Score works along harmoniously through every scene. However the focus of thiz movie undoubtedly is on two main characters. Both bring a depth of emotion in their character developments. As NIS agent ByungHun Lee who is previously known as Storm Shadow in G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra 2009 gives a resolute and complex character on one side he performs the vengeance without platitude and on the other side we could still see his brittle emotion. As the killer MinSik Choi who is previously known for Oldboy in 2003 provides a convincing crazy psychopath character that is not afraid of anything. It's a perfect role for Choi. Nothing will prepare you for some atrocious scenes. In the end after seeing thiz film entirely something will make you realize who the real devil is is it the killer? Or is it the man who takes revenge on him? Since both of them bring unmerciful heat to their actions. Although they come from different direction and motive finally they meet in the middle anyway they are the same. It's a good contemplation. Every person has the devil inside them. The difference is how far we can tame it? Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE httpjonnyfendi.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "How far can the revenge thriller genre go? Well when you have a film of this genre helmed by twisted Korean director Jeewoon Kim it can go pretty far. I Saw the Devil is about a secret agent who blurs the line between good and evil as he hunts down his fiance's killer to enact some particularly gruesome revenge. His lust for revenge sends him to the brink of insanity as he begins to become a more despicable human being than the serial killer he is chasing down. The film is brutal intense and haunting. It is unapologetically graphic from start to finish and is absolutely not for the faint of heart. But for anyone who can stomach its brutality I Saw the Devil is quite the movie.It seems this film's primary goal is to shock and disgust. It more than excels in this area but it also works very well as a psychological thriller. There is this constant struggle of what is good and what is evil throughout the film. The distinction grows more and more faint as Kim Soohyeon grows more and more obsessed with catching and defeating Kyungchul the serial killer. He is disturbingly brutal and endlessly vicious in his revenge against Kyungchul. The film has a somewhat repetitive nature once it gets going. Kyungchul hides somewhere is about to torture a victim but then Soohyeon stops him and beats the hell out of him before leaving him in misery and pain so that he may track him down and torture him once again. But the repetitiveness works because it is a constant escalation in brutality and a loss of humanity. Plus every fight between Soohyeon and Kyungchul is incredible.Jeewoon Kim shoots this film with a brutally precise eye for visual integrity. His camerawork allows the film to succeed as a haunting drama as well as a fast paced action thriller. The fights are choreographed excellently and the violence in each duel only increases. This isn't a film for the squeamish as Kim finds every possible way to disgust his audience with the bloodiest and most malicious forms of torture possible. It is all shot so intensely that you just want to scream in pain and disgust at the horrors you are witnessing. And yet at the same time there are calmer and more subtle scenes of the film which are shot with haunting beauty in the framing and camera movement. Plus the film has a disturbingly beautiful score that will leave you mystified as well as terrified. I wouldn't go as far as to call this an art house film but it certainly has some qualities that might lead it to that.I Saw the Devil is a fantastic film in all of its bloody glory. It is the kind of film that will only appeal to those with an appetite for maliciousness and a stomach for horrific amounts of blood and gore. This film is so disturbed and yet so excellent in its execution that if you can handle it you will be treated to a very worthwhile film. Expect the unexpected with this film and be prepared to look away in horrified disgust.".

	schema:headline " Style and Substance Abuse.";
	schema:reviewBody "Director JeeWoon Kim has had a spotty career to date. His breakout A Tale Of Two Sisters was a muted cruel and often confusing tale. It was a case of style over substance a film that was to ignite the messages boards rather than the average film goers brain. His follow up however A Bittersweet Life was thrilling yarn taking its ques from the coveted American styled thriller. The film concerns an 'enforcer' who is told to do the one job he wont do obviously this doesn't make his boss very happy. Like i said we've seen this before but these thrillers set up their premise early and the fun is had watching our main character stumble over the finishing line. With 'I Saw The Devil' there is no such care taken it sees the director plunge head first into the murky and depraved world of torture porn.As an audience we should be asking ourselves what the point of given scene or character action is but the violence here is gratuitous and without merit. Even something as shallow as Saw Darren Lynn Boussman which arguably ushered in this new fad to the masses has a slightly veiled point that some people deserve to die because they don't know how to live. In one scene in I Saw The Devil our 'hero' is told that 'revenge is for the American movies' it would seem then the notion has been processed for all its hyper real absurdity but still the film makers are intent to make us watch the senseless breaking of limbs and bludgeoning. Just while we are on the point of the bludgeoning of which there are many why are these characters still alive after 30 blows to the head with a metal pipe? The answer seems to be so we can have a nice little coincidental expository scene or indeed so the person can be tortured further for our displeasure.Firstly the idea of redemption through revenge is one that doesn't sit with me at all. That's not to say i cant have fun watching it films like Black Rain Ridley Scott set up the ensuing redemptive violence with care making the idea of Michael Douglas's impending bloody revenge more appealing. Or take Oldboy for example with Oldboy the fun of the revenge is in the complexity of the web spun in its honour. We get nothing here except for the death of his wife who just happens to be pregnant and this is surely enough right? Well no its not. I need to care about the characters first so i therefore feel for them if anything further happens to them whether it be directly or indirectly. But that's what the film deals in actions. Our hero never verbalises his anger he just acts this leads to a disconnect from him. This fact coupled with the over use of the films killer MinSik Choi gives the film an uneasy weight toward the dealings of the killer the film revels in his depravity. Its almost like watching one of the vacuous major horror franchises in which the killer is the main star and the audience come to watch him work. By the end of the movie i didn't care whether the killer was punished or not rightly or wrongly. There was nothing holding the movie together people cried but there is no emotion this movie is completely soulless. A good juxtaposition to this is The Chaser. The Chaser walks similar lines we have a depraved serial killer and the man who stop at nothing to exact bloody revenge. The difference here being that the incentive for the hero is not just to kill or maim the bad guy which is completely uninteresting our hero learns that there are more important things in the world other than his nihilism. Neither men here have anything real to live for they are both as bad as each other. Watching as ByungHun Lee bludgeons suspected serial killers is not fun its just wrong.If you want morally murky then Joe Carnahan' s excellent Narc is a fantastic example of good person doing terrible things under extreme circumstances. In that film Ray Liotta goes to illegal lengths to gain a conviction and tough justice on the criminal underworld after his partner dies. We really get a sense of character in the film and you really get a feel for Liotta's choices however wrong they might be. So what we end up watching isn't nasty or irrelevant its heartbreaking.I honestly couldn't help but be appalled by this movie. I didn't want to be i don't want to be the killjoy. i saw nothing in this movie that justified its 2hrs 20minute runtime and I'm a person that likes to try and take positives out of negatives. I think that the vast majority that will see this movie will be looking for the torture porn elements or just because they heard how 'bad' it is and for that they will enjoy it. Those who like me were looking for something with abit more meat forgive the pun something a little more in the vein of A Bittersweet Life Oldboy or The Chaser i would strongly recommend staying away from this tripe.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director JeeWoon Kim has had a spotty career to date. His breakout A Tale Of Two Sisters was a muted cruel and often confusing tale. It was a case of style over substance a film that was to ignite the messages boards rather than the average film goers brain. His follow up however A Bittersweet Life was thrilling yarn taking its ques from the coveted American styled thriller. The film concerns an 'enforcer' who is told to do the one job he wont do obviously this doesn't make his boss very happy. Like i said we've seen this before but these thrillers set up their premise early and the fun is had watching our main character stumble over the finishing line. With 'I Saw The Devil' there is no such care taken it sees the director plunge head first into the murky and depraved world of torture porn.As an audience we should be asking ourselves what the point of given scene or character action is but the violence here is gratuitous and without merit. Even something as shallow as Saw Darren Lynn Boussman which arguably ushered in this new fad to the masses has a slightly veiled point that some people deserve to die because they don't know how to live. In one scene in I Saw The Devil our 'hero' is told that 'revenge is for the American movies' it would seem then the notion has been processed for all its hyper real absurdity but still the film makers are intent to make us watch the senseless breaking of limbs and bludgeoning. Just while we are on the point of the bludgeoning of which there are many why are these characters still alive after 30 blows to the head with a metal pipe? The answer seems to be so we can have a nice little coincidental expository scene or indeed so the person can be tortured further for our displeasure.Firstly the idea of redemption through revenge is one that doesn't sit with me at all. That's not to say i cant have fun watching it films like Black Rain Ridley Scott set up the ensuing redemptive violence with care making the idea of Michael Douglas's impending bloody revenge more appealing. Or take Oldboy for example with Oldboy the fun of the revenge is in the complexity of the web spun in its honour. We get nothing here except for the death of his wife who just happens to be pregnant and this is surely enough right? Well no its not. I need to care about the characters first so i therefore feel for them if anything further happens to them whether it be directly or indirectly. But that's what the film deals in actions. Our hero never verbalises his anger he just acts this leads to a disconnect from him. This fact coupled with the over use of the films killer MinSik Choi gives the film an uneasy weight toward the dealings of the killer the film revels in his depravity. Its almost like watching one of the vacuous major horror franchises in which the killer is the main star and the audience come to watch him work. By the end of the movie i didn't care whether the killer was punished or not rightly or wrongly. There was nothing holding the movie together people cried but there is no emotion this movie is completely soulless. A good juxtaposition to this is The Chaser.

If this movie had left out the women and the sex and pitted the bad guy against other men I suspect we'd find fewer favorable comments here. Being able to overwhelm the viewer with graphic scenes of rape and mutilation does not constitute art. This is porn no matter how nicely it is dressed up. With regard to the narrative line of this film it makes little sense as someone else has already pointed out. Catch and release is good in fishing not in a serious film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Revenge.. is an easy theme for one to work with and to weave a thrilling story around and Jeewoon Kim makes a confusing contribution with this film  even the name in English makes no sense if u look back! And look back I do with a lot of disappointment at having been led on by the high rating on IMDb! What is wrong with the filmviewing community these days that they give high ratings to any pretentious junk that comes their way?This film is not the least bit realistic in any way in terms of the situations and the incidents.. it is just too surreal while it attempts to be anything but that! Like just how does the good guy with the pin upguy face and boybandcrew haircut get away so easily from the cops AND the bad guys! And going by the ease with which the 'bad guy' does away with humans one would think that living in Korea is really dangerous  and young girls dressed in expensivelooking clothes wouldn't wanna be caught dead waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere  especially after dark! Its like the scriptwriter sat with a bunch of his drunk friends discussing women and they went ..yeah let's put this girl here in this scene strip her naked and then another girl here get her molested and another one there and get her raped! Yeah that's the secret to attracting a large audience! So at regular intervals  what could have been hinted at was explicitly displayed in not anywhere near artistic shots. Purely gross stuff shown to gross u out.. without any emotion involved at all!Very lackluster performances too.. bah! None of the actors in this film seem really fit for their role and instead look very uncomfortable playing their part and eager to finish the job and move on! So i'll not waste any more of my nor your time with this film and would like to make this review brief in concluding that besides the casting and the plot there were just too many flaws in this film in dealing with psychology physiology etc. Cheap thrills in shock sequences and an overlycold coldblooded 'bad guy' who is thrown into pointless gory scenes make this film a senseless ordeal!3 out of 10 for the notsoterrible music and the bare effort taken by Kim to make this film a 'thriller' with OK cinematography A tale of 2 sisters  also by Kim  had better visuals. This film is easily avoidable!!".
